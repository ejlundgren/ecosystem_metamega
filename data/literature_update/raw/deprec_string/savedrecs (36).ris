AB  - The increasing demand to replace chemical antimicrobial agents with natural compounds leads to the use of some plant extracts and essential oils (EOs) as natural preservatives. Nanoemulsion (NE) with Tween 80 as wall material and Pickering emulsions (PE) stabilized with carbohydrate (Arabic gum (AG)) or protein (sodium caseinate (SC)) wall materials. First of all, the PEO was obtained from two parts of plant: flowers and leave, and characterized by GC-MS and the IC50 index measurement. The Prangos ferulacea essential oil (PEO) extracted from leave was selected for the next tests due to slightly higher antioxidant activity compared to the flower's EO. The leave's PEO was encapsulated in three forms: nanoemulsion (NE) with Tween 80 as wall material and Pickering emulsions (PE) stabilized with carbohydrate (gum Arabic (GA)) or protein (sodium caseinate (SC)) wall materials. The NE had the smallest particle size and the highest antioxidant and antimicrobial (S. aureus and E. coli) activity. AG-stabilized PE recorded the highest encapsulation efficiency (85.37 +/- 1.97 %). The occurring of new chemical interactions between PEO and wall materials and uniformly shaped PE microcapsules were approved by FT-IR and FE-SEM tests, respectively. Free and encapsulated PEO were added to the mayonnaise, and the samples were analyzed during storage at 4 degrees C for 60 days. Peroxide value and TBA index gradually increased for all mayonnaise samples, but this increase was lower for samples containing NE and SC-stabilized PEO capsules. In general, carriers stabilized with the simultaneous application of protein and carbohydrate performed better compared to their single application in sensory tests in mayonnaise.

AB  - Here, we provide experimental verification supporting the use of short-section imaging bundles for two-photon microscopy imaging of the mouse brain. The 8 mm long bundle is made of a pair of heavy-metal oxide glasses with a refractive index contrast of 0.38 to ensure a high numerical aperture NA = 1.15. The bundle is composed of 825 multimode cores, ordered in a hexagonal lattice with a pixel size of 14 mu m and a total diameter of 914 mu m. We demonstrate successful imaging through custom-made bundles with 14 mu m resolution. As the input, we used a 910 nm Ti-sapphire laser with 140 fs pulse and a peak power of 9 x 104 W. The excitation beam and fluorescent image were transferred through the fiber imaging bundle. As test samples, we used 1 mu m green fluorescent latex beads, ex vivo hippocampal neurons expressing green fluorescent protein and cortical neurons in vivo expressing the fluorescent reporter GCaMP6s or immediate early gene Fos fluorescent reporter. This system can be used for minimal-invasive in vivo imaging of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, or deep brain areas as a part of a tabletop system or an implantable setup. It is a low-cost solution, easy to integrate and operate for high-throughput experiments.

AB  - Renewable energies have been occupying more and more space in energy matrices worldwide, and lignocellulosic biomasses are promising for these energy sources. This study aimed to develop a fuzzy model to optimize the ferrous sulfate concentration and temperature in the pre-treatment of elephant grass. Five concentrations (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mM) and three temperatures (25, 40 and 55 degrees C) were used as input. The application of the fuzzy model evidenced that the best results for cellulose exposure (53.1 %) were achieved by using a ferrous sulfate concentration between 20 and 22.5 mM and temperature between 39.5 and 42.5 degrees C.

AB  - Walnut Oil (WO) is recognized for its potential to improve cognition, but the mechanisms of its action related to improving cognitive impairment are not yet clear. In this study, the components of walnut oil were measured, and it was found that WO supplementation for 8 weeks could significantly prevent cognitive behavioral deficits and synaptic dysfunction induced by intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine (SCOP) in mice. By comparing and analyzing the changes in the hippocampal synaptic structure, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter fluctuations, brain transcriptome, inflammatory factors and gut microbiota in mice from different treatment groups, we observed a significant correlation between synaptic transmission genes, gut microbiota and neurotransmission in the WO supplemented group. It was found that WO supplementation could influence the secretion of neurotransmitters Ach and 5-HT by modulating the gut microbiota in vivo, thereby improving cognitive impairment through the central nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation.
   Walnut oil could improve cognitive impairment by influencing the secretion of neurotransmitters through the regulation of gut microbiota in vivo.

AB  - In the present study, ferulic acid (FRA) has been explored for possible neuroprotective effects against cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced neurotoxicity in the Swiss Albino mice. Animals were divided into five groups and treated with FRA for fourteen days and a single dose of CP was administered on the seventh day. Animals were subjected to neurobehavioral tests such as the forced swim test and Morris Water Maze test. On day fifteenth, the brain was removed and used for biochemical analysis. The outcome of the study showed that CP administration induced significant neurotoxicity in the form of depression, anxiety, and cognitive dysfunction. Cyclophosphamide administration also reduced the activity of antioxidant enzymes, reduced the level of neurotransmitters (i.e., dopamine, 5-HT, and BDNF), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), and increased lipid peroxidation and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha). Additionally, CP administration increased the level of acetylcholine esterase. Treatment with FRA significantly reversed these behavioral, and biochemical markers towards normal and mitigated CP-induced neurotoxic manifestation.

AB  - Background: The causal relationship between exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the development of skin cancers requires constant research for possible orchestrating mechanisms. In recent years, the Hippo pathway, along with its effector protein YAP, became implicated in cutaneous carcinogenesis; however, Hippo pathway regulation by ultraviolet radiation has not been described thoroughly. In order to address this issue, we focused on how different doses of ultraviolet B affect Hippo signaling pathway components and its upstream regulators, JNK1/2 and ABL1, in human keratinocytes. Additionally, we decided to determine how silencing of YAP influences Hippo pathway component expression. Methods: Primary epidermal keratinocytes were irradiated using UVB lamps with increasing doses of ultraviolet B radiation (including 311 nm UVB). Real-time PCR was used to determine the mRNA levels of each investigated gene. The experiment was then performed after YAP silencing using siRNA transfection. Additionally, we determined the mRNA expression of Hippo pathway components in an A431 cSCC cell line. Results: We observed that YAP mRNA expression in the A431 cell line was insignificant in comparison to control, while in the case of LATS1/2, a significant increase was noted. UVB irradiation did not change the levels of YAP mRNA expression in human epidermal keratinocytes. LATS1, LATS2, ABL1 and MAP4K4 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated after UVB irradiation in non-YAP-silenced keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner, while after YAP silencing, only LATS2 and ABL1 showed significant mRNA upregulation. The 311 nm UVB irradiation resulted in significant, dose-dependent mRNA upregulation in non-YAP-silenced keratinocytes for LATS1, ABL1 and MAP4K4. After YAP silencing, a significant change in mRNA expression was present only in the case of ABL1. Conclusions: YAP mRNA expression does not significantly increase after exposure to UVB; however, it upregulates the expression of its proven (LATS1/2, JNK1/2) regulators, suggesting that in real-life settings, UV-induced dysregulation of the Hippo pathway may not be limited to YAP.

AB  - Mild blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) is a modality of injury that has been of major concern considering a large number of military personnel exposed to explosive blast waves. bTBI results from the propagation of high-pressure static blast forces and their subsequent energy transmission within brain tissue. Exposure to this overpressure energy causes a diffuse injury that leads to acute cell damage and, if chronic, leads to detrimental long-term cognitive deficits. The literature presents a neuro-centric approach to the role of mitochondria dynamics dysfunction in bTBI, and changes in astrocyte-specific mitochondrial dynamics have not been characterized. The balance between fission and fusion events is known as mitochondrial dynamics. As a result of fission and fusion, the mitochondrial structure is constantly altering its shape to respond to physiological stimuli or stress, which in turn affects mitochondrial function. Astrocytic mitochondria are recognized to play an essential role in overall brain metabolism, synaptic transmission, and neuron protection. Mitochondria are vulnerable to injury insults, leading to the increase in mitochondrial fission, a mechanism controlled by the GTPase dynamin-related protein (Drp1) and the phosphorylation of Drp1 at serine 616 (p-Drp1(s616)). This site is critical to mediate the Drp1 translocation to mitochondria to promote fission events and consequently leads to fragmentation. An increase in mitochondrial fragmentation could have negative consequences, such as promoting an excessive generation of reactive oxygen species or triggering cytochrome c release. The aim of the present study was to characterize the unique pattern of astrocytic mitochondrial dynamics by exploring the role of DRP1 with a combination of in vitro and in vivo bTBI models. Differential remodeling of the astrocytic mitochondrial network was observed, corresponding with increases in p-Drp1(S616) four hours and seven days post-injury. Further, results showed a time-dependent reactive astrocyte phenotype transition in the rat hippocampus. This discovery can lead to innovative therapeutics targets to help prevent the secondary injury cascade after blast injury that involves mitochondria dysfunction.

AB  - Brain amyloid-beta (A beta) governs the pathogenic process of Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials to assess the disease-modifying effects of inhibitors or modulators of beta- and gamma-secretases have not shown clinical benefit and can cause serious adverse events. Previously, we found that the interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition inducer (ILEI, also known as FAM3C) negatively regulates the A beta production through a decrease in A beta immediate precursor, without the inhibition of beta- and gamma-secretase activity. Herein, we found that MS-275, a benzamide derivative that is known to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), exhibits ILEI-like activity to reduce A beta production independent of HDAC inhibition. Chronic MS-275 treatment decreased A beta deposition in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Overall, our results indicate that MS-275 is a potential therapeutic candidate for efficiently reducing brain A beta accumulation.

AB  - Background Stem cell transplantation is a fascinating therapeutic approach for the treatment of many neurodegenerative disorders; however, clinical trials using stem cells have not been as effective as expected based on preclinical studies. The aim of this study is to validate the hypothesis that human neural crest-derived nasal turbinate stem cells (hNTSCs) are a clinically promising therapeutic source of adult stem cells for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods hNTSCs were evaluated in comparison with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) according to the effect of transplantation on AD pathology, including PET/CT neuroimaging, immune status indicated by microglial numbers and autophagic capacity, neuronal survival, and cognition, in a 5 x FAD transgenic mouse model of AD. Results We demonstrated that hNTSCs showed a high proliferative capacity and great neurogenic properties in vitro. Compared with hBM-MSC transplantation, hNTSC transplantation markedly reduced A beta 42 levels and plaque formation in the brains of the 5 x FAD transgenic AD mice on neuroimaging, concomitant with increased survival of hippocampal and cortex neurons. Moreover, hNTSCs strongly modulated immune status by reducing the number of microglia and the expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and upregulating autophagic capacity at 7 weeks after transplantation in AD models. Notably, compared with transplantation of hBM-MSCs, transplantation of hNTSCs significantly enhanced performance on the Morris water maze, with an increased level of TIMP2, which is necessary for spatial memory in young mice and neurons; this difference could be explained by the high engraftment of hNTSCs after transplantation. Conclusion The reliable evidence provided by these findings reveals a promising therapeutic effect of hNTSCs and indicates a step forward the clinical application of hNTSCs in patients with AD.

AB  - Salicin is a major natural compound of willow bark and displays diverse beneficial biological properties, such as antioxidant activity. However, little information available for the neuroprotective potential of salicin against ischemic brain injury has been reported. Thus, this study was performed to investigate the neuroprotective potential of salicin against ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury and its mechanisms in the hippocampus using a gerbil model of 5-min transient ischemia (TI) in the forebrain, in which a massive loss (death) of pyramidal neurons cells occurred in the subfield Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) among the hippocampal subregions (CA1-3) at 5 days after TI. To examine neuroprotection by salicin, gerbils were pretreated with salicin alone or together with LY294002, which is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, once daily for 3 days before TI. Treatment with 20 mg/kg of salicin significantly protected CA1 pyramidal neurons against the ischemic injury. Treatment with 20 mg/kg of salicin significantly reduced the TI-induced increase in superoxide anion generation and lipid peroxidation in the CA1 pyramidal neurons after TI. The treatment also reinstated the TI-induced decrease in superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in the CA1 pyramidal cells after TI. Moreover, salicin treatment significantly elevated the levels of phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta), which is a major downstream target of PI3K, in the ischemic CA1. Notably, the neuroprotective effect of salicin was abolished by LY294002. Taken together, these findings clearly indicate that salicin protects against ischemic brain injury by attenuating oxidative stress and activating the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 beta pathway.

AB  - Xylitol is considered a naturally occurring antibacterial agent. It is generally believed to enhance the body's own innate bactericidal mechanisms. It also provides anti-adhesive effects against both Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of xylitol nasal irrigation in the postoperative care of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who received FESS were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups at one month post-surgery. Thirty-five patients in the xylitol group received 400 mL of 5% xylitol nasal irrigation daily for 2 months, while another 35 in the normal saline (NS) group received 400 mL of NS nasal irrigation daily for 2 months. Prior to FESS, as well as before and after nasal irrigation, sinonasal symptoms were assessed through the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test Questionnaire. The patients also underwent an endoscopic examination while undergoing nasal function tests, and a cytokine measurement of the nasal lavage and a bacterial culture from the middle meatus were performed. The safety of the nasal irrigation was assessed through any self-reported adverse events, the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Patient Questionnaire and the eustachian tube function test. The endoscopic scores and olfactory threshold significantly decreased after xylitol irrigation when compared with those before irrigation. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in the nasal secretions also decreased significantly after xylitol irrigation. The amounts of Interleukin-5 and Interleukin-17A were significantly increased in the nasal lavage after xylitol irrigation. No side effects, including those related to eustachian tube function, were seen after nasal irrigation in both groups. Our results showed that xylitol nasal irrigation was both beneficial and safe during the postoperative care of FESS.

AB  - BackgroundThe diarylheptanoid ASPP 049 has improved the quality of adult hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion ex vivo through long-term reconstitution in animal models. However, its effect on hematopoietic regeneration from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is unknown.MethodWe utilized a defined cocktail of cytokines without serum or feeder followed by the supplementation of ASPP 049 to produce hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Flow cytometry and trypan blue exclusion analysis were used to identify nonadherent and adherent cells. Nonadherent cells were harvested to investigate the effect of ASPP 049 on multipotency using LTC-IC and CFU assays. Subsequently, the mechanism of action was explored through transcriptomic profiles, which were validated by qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analysis.ResultThe supplementation of ASPP 049 increased the number of phenotypically defined primitive HSPCs (CD34+CD45+CD90+) two-fold relative to seeded hiPSC colonies, indicating enhanced HSC derivation from hiPSCs. Under ASPP 049-supplemented conditions, we observed elevated HSPC niches, including CD144+CD73- hemogenic- and CD144+CD73+ vascular-endothelial progenitors, during HSC differentiation. Moreover, harvested ASPP 049-treated cells exhibited improved self-renewal and a significantly larger proportion of different blood cell colonies with unbiased lineages, indicating enhanced HSC stemness properties. Transcriptomics and KEGG analysis of sorted CD34+CD45+ cells-related mRNA profiles revealed that the Hippo signaling pathway is the most significant in responding to WWTR1/TAZ, which correlates with the validation of the protein expression. Interestingly, ASPP 049-supplemented HSPCs upregulated 11 genes similarly to umbilical cord blood-derived HSPCs.ConclusionThese findings suggest that ASPP 049 can improve HSC-generating protocols with proliferative potentials, self-renewal ability, unbiased differentiation, and a definable mechanism of action for the clinical perspective of hematopoietic regenerative medicine.

AB  - Glutaredoxin (Grx) is a small molecular protein widely found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, serving various biological functions, including participation in redox reactions and exerting anti-apoptotic effects[1]. To evaluate the protective effect of recombinant Grx1 against oxidative stress, we constructed the pET-30a (+)/Grx1 recombinant plasmid and performed soluble expression and purification of the recombinant Grx1. In vitro experiments, including ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging assays, showed that recombinant Grx1 has significant antioxidant activity. Reactive oxygen species detection revealed that the levels of reactive oxygen species in the Grx1 treatment group decreased by 33.01 % compared to the H2O2 group. Flow cytometry analyses indicated that the number of apoptotic cells in the Grx1 treatment group decreased by 23.51 % relative to the H2O2 group. Additionally, qRT-PCR analysis showed that Grx1 significantly reduced the expression levels of genes such as IL1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and caspase-3 in PC12 cells. In vivo, recombinant Grx1 was utilized to treat cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury (CIRI). Histological staining revealed that recombinant Grx1 significantly mitigated hippocampal tissue damage. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that Grx1 can reduce neuronal apoptosis following CIRI by decreasing Bax expression while increasing Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, Grx1 was shown to modulate the HO-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway by elevating the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. In summary, this study successfully overexpressed biologically active Grx1 in E. coli, and confirms that recombinant Grx1 exhibits remarkable antioxidant activity in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, effectively alleviating oxidative stress damage associated with ischemic stroke.

AB  - Background Brain volume has been widely studied in the neuroimaging field, since it is an important and heritable trait associated with brain development, aging and various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified numerous associations between genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms and complex traits like brain volume. However, it is unclear how these genetic variations influence regional gene expression levels, which may subsequently lead to phenotypic changes. S-PrediXcan is a tissue-specific transcriptomic data analysis method that can be applied to bridge this gap. In this work, we perform an S-PrediXcan analysis on GWAS summary data from two large imaging genetics initiatives, the UK Biobank and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta Analysis, to identify tissue-specific transcriptomic effects on two closely related brain volume measures: total brain volume (TBV) and intracranial volume (ICV). Results As a result of the analysis, we identified 10 genes that are highly associated with both TBV and ICV. Nine out of 10 genes were found to be associated with TBV in another study using a different gene-based association analysis. Moreover, most of our discovered genes were also found to be correlated with multiple cognitive and behavioral traits. Further analyses revealed the protein-protein interactions, associated molecular pathways and biological functions that offer insight into how these genes function and interact with others. Conclusions These results confirm that S-PrediXcan can identify genes with tissue-specific transcriptomic effects on complex traits. The analysis also suggested novel genes whose expression levels are related to brain volumetric traits. This provides important insights into the genetic mechanisms of the human brain.

AB  - The objective of this study was to establish if polyglycerols with sulfate or sialic acid functional groups interact with high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and if so, which polyglycerol could prevent loss of morphological plasticity in excitatory neurons in the hippocampus. Considering that HMGB1 binds to heparan sulfate and that heparan sulfate has structural similarities with dendritic polyglycerol sulfates (dPGS), we performed the experiments to show if polyglycerols can mimic heparin functions by addressing the following questions: (1) do dendritic and linear polyglycerols interact with the alarmin molecule HMGB1? (2) Does dPGS interaction with HMGB1 influence the redox status of HMGB1? (3) Can dPGS prevent the loss of dendritic spines in organotypic cultures challenged with lip-opolysaccharide (LPS)? LPS plays a critical role in infections with Gram-negative bacteria and is commonly used to test candidate therapeutic agents for inflammation and endotoxemia. Pathologically high LPS concentrations and other stressful stimuli cause HMGB1 release and post-translational modifications. We hypothesized that (i) electrostatic interactions of hyperbranched and linear polysulfated polyglycerols with HMGB1 will likely involve sites similar to those of heparan sulfate. (ii) dPGS can normalize HMGB1 compartmentalization in microglia exposed to LPS and prevent dendritic spine loss in the excitatory hippocampal neurons. We performed immunocytochemistry and biochemical analyses combined with confocal microscopy to determine cellular and extracellular locations of HMGB1 and morphological plasticity. Our results suggest that dPGS interacts with HMGB1 similarly to heparan sulfate. Hyperbranched dPGS and linear sulfated polymers prevent dendritic spine loss in hippocampal excitatory neurons. MS/MS analyses reveal that dPGS-HMGB1 interactions result in fully oxidized HMGB1 at critical cysteine residues (Cys23, Cys45, and Cys106). Triply oxidized HMGB1 leads to the loss of its pro-inflammatory action and could participate in dPGS-mediated spine loss prevention. LPG-Sia exposure to HMGB1 results in the oxidation of Cys23 and Cys106 but does not normalize spine density.

AB  - Early-life stress (ELS) was found to increase the risk of adolescent depression, and clinical evidence indicated that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was decreased in patients with adolescent depression, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we utilized an ELS model of maternal separation with early weaning to explore the protective role of EPA in adolescent depression. We found that that ELS induced depression-like behavior rather than anxiety-like behavior in adolescent mice. RNA-sequencing results showed that ELS changed the transcription pattern in the liver, including 863 upregulated genes and 971 downregulated genes, especially those related to the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids metabolism in the liver. Moreover, ELS decreased the expression of the rate-limiting enzymes, fatty acid desaturases 1/2 (FADS1/2), involved in the biosynthesis of EPA in the liver. Additionally, ELS reduced the levels of EPA in the liver, serum, and hippocampus, and EPA administration improved depression-like behavior-induced by ELS. Our results provide transcriptomic evidence that ELS increases the risk of adolescent depression by reducing the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in the liver, especially EPA, and suggest that supplementation with EPA should be investigated as a potential treatment for adolescent depression.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder known to cause cognitive impairment among the elderly worldwide. Although physical exercise-induced adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) improves cognition, understanding its underlying molecular mechanisms requires further investigation using AD mouse models. In this present work, we subjected amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice to a 12-week aerobic treadmill exercise to investigate AHN and its potential mechanisms. We divided 3-month-old littermates wild-type and APP/PS1 transgenic male mice into four groups, and the exercise groups performed 12-week treadmill exercise. Next, we evaluated the influence of treadmill exercise on learning and memory capacity, AHN, and APP proteolytic pathway-related factors. As per our results, the treadmill exercise was able to improve the hippocampal microenvironment in APP/PS1 mice probably by regulating various neurotrophic factors and secretases resulting in APP cleavage through a non-amyloidogenic pathway, which seems to further promote new cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis. All of these effects ameliorate learning and memory capacity. This study provides a theoretical and experimental basis for understanding AHN in an AD mouse model, which is beneficial for preventing and treating AD.

AB  - Loss of active synapses and alterations in membrane lipids are crucial events in physiological aging as well as in neurodegenerative disorders. Both are related to the abnormal aggregation of amyloid-beta (A beta) species, generally known as amyloidosis. There are two major known human A beta species: A beta((1-40)) and A beta((1-42)). However, which of these species have more influence on active synapses and membrane lipids is still poorly understood. Additionally, the time-dependent effect of A beta species on alterations in membrane lipids of hippocampal neurones and glial cells remains unknown. Therefore, our study contributes to a better understanding of the role of A beta species in the loss of active synapses and the dysregulation of membrane lipids in vitro. We showed that A beta((1-40)) or A beta((1-42)) treatment influences membrane lipids before synaptic loss appears and that the loss of active synapses is not dependent on the A beta species. Our lipidomic data analysis showed early changes in specific lipid classes such as sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid neurones. Our results underscore the potential role of lipids as a possible early diagnostic biomarker in amyloidosis-related disorders.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of interleukin (IL)-4 on striatal neurons in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected rat striatum in vivo. Either LPS or PBS as a control was unilaterally injected into the striatum, and brain tissues were processed for immunohistochemical and Nissl staining or for hydroethidine histochemistry at the indicated time points after LPS injection. Analysis by NeuN and Nissl immunohistochemical staining showed a significant loss of striatal neurons at 1, 3, and 7 days post LPS. In parallel, IL-4 immunoreactivity was upregulated as early as 1 day, reached a peak at 3 days, and was sustained up to 7 days post LPS. Increased levels of IL-4 immunoreactivity were exclusively detected in microglia/macrophages, but not in neurons nor astrocytes. The neutralizing antibody (NA) for IL-4 significantly protects striatal neurons against LPS-induced neurotoxicity in vivo. Accompanying neuroprotection, IL-4NA inhibited activation of microglia/macrophages, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ROS-derived oxidative damage and nitrosative stress, and produced polarization of microglia/macrophages shifted from M1 to M2. These results suggest that endogenous IL-4 expressed in LPS-activated microglia/macrophages contributes to striatal neurodegeneration in which oxidative/nitrosative stress and M1/M2 polarization are implicated.

AB  - Following ischemia/reperfusion, AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate pathologic delayed neuronal death through sustained expression of calcium-permeable AMPARs, leading to excitotoxicity. Preventing the surface removal of GluA2-containing AMPARs may yield new therapeutic targets for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion. This study utilized acute organotypic hippocampal slices from aged male and female Sprague Dawley rats and subjected them to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) to examine the mechanisms underlying the internalization and degradation of GluA2-containing AMPARs. We determined the effect of OGD/R on AMPAR subunits at the protein and mRNA transcript levels utilizing Western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively. Hippocampal slices from male and female rats responded to OGD/R in a paradoxical manner with respect to AMPARs. GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits were degraded following OGD/R in male rats but were increased in female rats. There was a rapid decrease in GRIA1 (GluA1) and GRIA2 (GluA2) mRNA levels in the male hippocampus following ischemic insult, but this was not observed in females. These data indicate a sex-dependent difference in how AMPARs in the hippocampus respond to ischemic insult, and may help explain, in part, why premenopausal women have a lower incidence/severity of ischemic stroke compared with men of the same age.

AB  - The present study aimed to provide experimental evidence that CDELNs (coffee-derived exosome-like nanoparticles) may be a candidate for the treatment or prevention of amyloid-ss (A ss)induced Alzheimer's disease (AD). An in vitro Alzheimer's model was created with A ss-induced toxicity in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells (HT-22). A ss(( 1-42))-exposed cells were treated with different concentrations of CDELNs (1-50 mu g/ml) and the viability of cells was analyzed. The change in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m) of cells was also determined. CDELNs treatment increased the viability of A ss( 1-42)-toxicity-induced HT-22 cells significantly. The increase in the viability of A ss(( 1-42))-toxicity-induced cells was correlated with an improvement in Delta Psi(m). CDELNs treatment restored the dissipated Delta Psi(m). These results suggested that CDELNs protect neuronal cells against A ss(( 1-42))-induced neurotoxicity by repairing mitochondrial dysfunction. CDELNs might be a useful neuroprotective agent for the treatment or prevention of A ss-induced AD. Further animal and clinical studies should be carried out to investigate the neuroprotective potential of CDELNs against A ss-induced AD.

AB  - Sunflower oil (Helianthus annuus) contains a rich concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are susceptible to rapid oxidative processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the stabilizing effect of lipophilic extracts from two types of berries, sea buckthorn and rose hips, on sunflower oil. This research included the analysis of sunflower oil oxidation products and mechanisms, including the determination of chemical changes occurring in the lipid oxidation process via LC-MS/MS using electrospray ionization in negative and positive mode. Pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, and nonanal were identified as key compounds formed during oxidation. The individual profiles of the carotenoids from sea buckthorn berries were determined using RP-HPLC. The influence of the carotenoid extraction parameters ascertained from the berries on the oxidative stability of sunflower oil was analyzed. The dynamics of the accumulation of the primary and secondary products of lipid oxidation and the variation of the carotenoid pigment content in the lipophilic extracts of sea buckthorn and rose hips during storage demonstrated good stability at 4 degrees C in the absence of light for 12 months. The experimental results were applied to mathematical modeling using fuzzy sets and mutual information analysis, which allowed for the prediction of the oxidation of sunflower oil.

AB  - Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are complex vascular lesions with significant clinical risks. The Hippo signaling pathway, particularly its downstream effector YAP, plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. This study investigates the role of YAP and related molecular markers in bAVMs, focusing on the effects of embolization. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on tissue samples from bAVM patients (n = 127), as well as on healthy blood vessels (n = 17). YAP, HIF-1 alpha, FGFR1, CTGF, and CYR61 expression were quantified and correlated with clinical parameters. Results: In healthy vessels, YAP exhibited nuclear localization in (sub)endothelial cells and the tunica media, while CTGF and CYR61 were detected in the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix. The expression of YAP, CTGF, and CYR61 was significantly lower in bAVM tissues. Embolized bAVMs exhibited significantly higher expression of YAP, CTGF, and CYR61 compared to non-embolized tissues, suggesting a link between embolization and pro-angiogenic signaling. Additionally, FGFR1 was upregulated in embolized tissues. These results suggest that upregulation of YAP expression via the Hippo pathway might play a key role in bAVM pathophysiology. Embolization may further promote vascular remodeling. Dysregulation of YAP and related molecules in bAVMs warrants further studies to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting the Hippo pathway.

AB  - Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated ion channels that mediate nociception in the peripheral nervous system and contribute to fear and learning in the central nervous system. Sevanol was reported previously as a naturally-occurring ASIC inhibitor from thyme with favorable analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. Using electrophysiological methods, we found that in the high micromolar range, the compound effectively inhibited homomeric ASIC1a and, in sub- and lowmicromolar ranges, positively modulated the currents of alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2GABA(A) receptors. Next, we tested the compound in anxiety-related behavior models using a targeted delivery into the hippocampus with parallel electroencephalographic measurements. In the open field, 6 mu M sevanol reduced both locomotor and theta-rhythmic activity similar to GABA, suggesting a primary action on the GABAergic system. At 300 mu M, sevanol markedly suppressed passive avoidance behavior, implying alterations in conditioned fear memory. The observed effects could be linked to distinct mechanisms involving GABA(A)R and ASIC1a. These results elaborate the preclinical profile of sevanol as a candidate for drug development and support the role of ASIC channels in fear-related functions of the hippocampus.

AB  - Atherosclerosis (ATH) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are both age-dependent inflammatory diseases, associated with infiltrated macrophages and vascular pathology and overlapping molecules. C/EBP beta, an A beta or inflammatory cytokine-activated transcription factor, and AEP (asparagine endopeptidase) are intimately implicated in both ATH and AD; however, whether C/EBP beta/AEP signaling couples ATH to AD pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we show that C/EBP beta/AEP pathway mediates ATH pathology and couples ATH to AD. Deletion of C/EBP beta or AEP from primary macrophages diminishes cholesterol load, and inactivation of this pathway reduces foam cell formation and lesions in aorta in ApoE-/- mice, fed with HFD (high-fat-diet). Knockout of ApoE from 3xTg AD mouse model augments serum LDL and increases lesion areas in the aorta. Depletion of C/EBP beta or AEP from 3xTg/ApoE-/- mice substantially attenuates these effects and elevates cerebral blood flow and vessel length, improving cognitive functions. Strikingly, knockdown of ApoE from the hippocampus of 3xTg mice decreases the cerebral blood flow and vessel length and aggravates AD pathologies, leading to cognitive deficits. Inactivation of C/EBP beta/AEP pathway alleviates these events and restores cognitive functions. Hence, our findings demonstrate that C/EBP beta/AEP signaling couples ATH to AD via mediating vascular pathology.

AB  - Compared to other organs, the brain has limited antioxidant defenses. In particular, the hippocampus is the central region for learning and memory and is highly susceptible to oxidative stress. Glial cells are the most abundant cells in the brain, and sustained glial cell activation is critical to the neuroinflammation that aggravates neuropathology and neurotoxicity. Therefore, regulating glial cell activation is a promising neurotherapeutic treatment. Quinic acid (QA) and its derivatives possess anti -oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Although previous studies have evidenced QA's benefit on the brain, in vivo and in vitro analyses of its anti -oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in glial cells have yet to be established. This study investigated QA's rescue effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced behavior impairment. Orally administering QA restored social impairment and LPS-induced spatial and fear memory. In addition, QA inhibited proinflammatory mediator, oxidative stress marker, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in the LPS-injected hippocampus. QA inhibited nitrite release and extracellular signal -regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. Collectively, QA restored impaired neuroinflammation-induced behavior by regulating proinflammatory mediator and ERK activation in astrocytes, demonstrating its potential as a therapeutic agent for neuroinflammation-induced brain disease treatments.

AB  - Somatostatin receptor subtype 4 (SST4) has been shown to mediate analgesic, antidepressant and anti-inflammatory functions without endocrine actions; therefore, it is proposed to be a novel target for drug development. To overcome the species differences of SST4 receptor expression and function between humans and mice, we generated an SST4 humanized mouse line to serve as a translational animal model for preclinical research. A transposon vector containing the hSSTR4 and reporter gene construct driven by the hSSTR4 regulatory elements were created. The vector was randomly inserted in Sstr4-deficient mice. hSSTR4 expression was detected by bioluminescent in vivo imaging of the luciferase reporter predominantly in the brain. RT-qPCR confirmed the expression of the human gene in the brain and various peripheral tissues consistent with the in vivo imaging. RNAscope in situ hybridization revealed the presence of hSSTR4 transcripts in glutamatergic excitatory neurons in the CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus; in the GABAergic interneurons in the granular layer of the olfactory bulb and in both types of neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex, piriform cortex, prelimbic cortex and amygdala. This novel SST4 humanized mouse line might enable us to investigate the differences of human and mouse SST4 receptor expression and function and assess the effects of SST4 receptor agonist drug candidates.

AB  - Glutathione S-transferase alpha 2 (GSTA2), a member of the glutathione S-transferase family, plays the role of cellular detoxification against oxidative stress. Although oxidative stress is related to ischemic injury, the role of GSTA2 against ischemia has not been elucidated. Thus, we studied whether GSTA2 prevents ischemic injury by using the PEP-1-GSTA2 protein which has a cell-permeable protein transduction domain. We revealed that cell-permeable PEP-1-GSTA2 transduced into HT-22 cells and markedly protected cell death via the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage induced by oxidative stress. Additionally, transduced PEP-1-GSTA2 promoted mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) activation. Furthermore, PEP-1-GSTA2 regulated Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved Caspase-3 and -9 expression protein levels. An in vivo ischemic animal model, PEP-1-GSTA2, markedly prevented the loss of hippocampal neurons and reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes. These findings indicate that PEP-1-GSTA2 suppresses hippocampal cell death by regulating the MAPK and apoptotic signaling pathways. Therefore, we suggest that PEP-1-GSTA2 will help to develop the therapies for oxidative-stress-induced ischemic injury.

AB  - Bioactive peptides derived from milk proteins offer promising potential that can be unlocked through hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis is particularly noteworthy because of its mild conditions and its efficacy in producing peptides with various biological activities. This study focused on creating whey protein hydrolysates using three enzymes: pepsin, trypsin, and papain. The degree of hydrolysis and the antioxidant properties of the resulting peptides were evaluated, and papain demonstrated the highest degree of hydrolysis, leading to its selection for further investigation. LC-MS was employed to identify peptide sequences from the papain-derived hydrolysate, resulting in the identification of 107 distinct peptide sequences These peptides were predicted to exhibit a range of potential biological activities, including antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory effects, as well as roles in regulating glucose homeostasis, maintaining cardiovascular health, and supporting overall metabolic function. In vitro tests revealed the significant antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the hydrolysate, confirming the potential of papain-derived peptides for use in functional food and pharmaceutical applications. The novelty of this study lies in the identification of novel peptides with promising biological activities. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies are required to fully elucidate the health benefits of these peptides.

AB  - The hippocampal formation, particularly the CA2 subregion, is critical for social memory formation and memory processing, relying on synaptic plasticity-a fundamental mechanism by which synapses strengthen. Given the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in various nervous system processes, including learning and memory, we were particularly interested in exploring the involvement of RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as UHRF2 (NIRF), in social behavior and synaptic plasticity. Our results revealed altered social behavior in mice with systemic Uhrf2 knockout, including changes in nest building, tube dominance, and the three-chamber social novelty test. In Uhrf2 knockout mice, the entorhinal cortex-CA2 circuit showed significant reductions in synaptic plasticity during paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation, while the inability to evoke synaptic plasticity in the Schaffer-collateral CA2 synapses remained unaffected. These changes in synaptic plasticity correlated with significant changes in gene expression including genes related to vesicle trafficking and transcriptional regulation. The effects of Uhrf2 knockout on synaptic plasticity and the observed gene expression changes highlight UHRF2 as a regulator of learning and memory processes at both the cellular and systemic levels. Targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as UHRF2, may hold therapeutic potential for memory-related disorders, warranting further investigation.

AB  - Levetiracetam (LEV) suppresses the upregulation of proinflammatory molecules that occurs during epileptogenesis after status epilepticus (SE). Based on previous studies, LEV likely helps prevent the onset of epilepsy after insults to the brain, unlike other conventional anti-epileptic drugs. Recently, we discovered that the increase in Fosl1 expression that occurs after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation is suppressed by LEV and that Fosl1 inhibition suppresses inflammation in BV-2 microglial cells. These data indicate that Fosl1 is an important target of LEV and a key factor in preventing epilepsy onset. In this study, we examined the effects of LEV on Fosl1 expression and neuroinflammation in vivo. During epileptogenesis, the post-SE upregulation of hippocampal levels of Fosl1 and many inflammatory factors were suppressed by LEV. Fosl1 expression showed a characteristic pattern different from that of the expression of Fos, an immediate-early gene belonging to the same Fos family. At 2 days after SE, Fosl1 was predominantly expressed in astrocytes but was rarely detected in microglia, whereas Fos expression was distributed in various brain cell types. The expression of A2 astrocyte markers was similar to that of Fosl1 and was significantly suppressed by LEV. These results suggest that LEV may regulate astrocyte reactivity through regulation of Fosl1.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid in the brain. The cation channel TRPV2 may mediate the pathological changes in mild cognitive impairment. A high-affinity agonist of TRPV2 named cannabidiol is one of the candidate drugs for AD. However, the molecular mechanism of cannabidiol via TRPV2 in AD remains unknown. The present study investigated whether cannabidiol enhances the phagocytosis and clearance of microglial A beta via the TRPV2 channel. We used a human dataset, mouse primary neuron and microglia cultures, and AD model mice to evaluate TRPV2 expression and the ability of microglial amyloid-beta phagocytosis in vivo and in vitro. The results revealed that TRPV2 expression was reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of AD model mice and AD patients. Cannabidiol enhanced microglial amyloid-beta phagocytosis through TRPV2 activation, which increased the mRNA expression of the phagocytosis-related receptors, but knockdown of TRPV2 or Trem2 rescued the expression. TRPV2-mediated effects were also dependent on PDK1 /Akt signaling, a pathway in which autophagy was indispensable. Furthermore, cannabidiol treatment successfully attenuated neuroinflammation while simultaneously improving mitochondrial function and ATP production via TRPV2 activation. Therefore, TRPV2 is proposed as a potential therapeutic target in AD, while CBD is a promising drug candidate for AD.

AB  - Amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. In this study, a polysaccharide from Bletilla striata (BSP), with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, was extracted using a low-temperature method and tested for its efficacy against AD, in vitro using N2a and BV-2 cells, and in vivo using an AD rat model. The characterization of the extracted BSP for its molecular structure and functional groups demonstrated the effectiveness of the modified method for retaining its bioactivity. In vitro, BSP reduced by 20% reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in N2a cells (p = 0.0082) and the expression levels of inflammation-related genes by 3-fold TNF-alpha (p = 0.0048), 4-fold IL-6 (p = 0.0019), and 2.5-fold IL-10 (p = 0.0212) in BV-2 cells treated with A beta fibrils. In vivo, BSP recovered learning memory, ameliorated morphological damage in the hippocampus and cortex, and reduced the expression of the beta-secretase protein in AlCl3-induced AD rats. Collectively, these findings demonstrated the efficacy of BSP for preventing and alleviating the effects of AD.

AB  - Common and rare variation in CACNA1C gene expression has been consistently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. However, the underlying biological pathways that cause this association have yet to be fully determined. In this study, we present evidence that rats with a reduced gene dosage of Cacna1c have increased basal corticosterone levels in the periphery and reduced the expression of Nr3c1 encoding the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. These results are consistent, with an effect of Cacna1c dosage on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Heterozygous Cacna1c rats had lower levels of the histone markers H3K4me3 and H3K27acat exon 17 of the Nr3c1 gene. These histone modifications are typically linked to increased gene expression, but here were not associated with changes in the expression of exon 17 variants under non-stress conditions. Heterozygous Cacna1c rats additionally show increased anxiety behaviours. These results support an association of Cacna1c heterozygosity with the altered activity of the HPA axis and function in the resting state, and this may be a predisposing mechanism that contributes to the increased risk of psychiatric disorders with stress.

AB  - Neuroinflammation, a key pathological contributor to various neurodegenerative diseases, is mediated by microglial activation and subsequent secretion of inflammatory cytokines via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Moreover, neuroinflammation leads to synaptic loss and memory impairment. This study investigated the inhibitory effects of PNP001, a mixture of Trichosanthis Semen and Zingiberis Rhizoma in a ratio of 3:1, on neuroinflammation and neurological deficits induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). For the in vitro study, PNP001 was administered in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells, and reduced the pro-inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 by downregulating MAPK signaling. For the in vivo study, ICR mice were orally administered PNP001 for 18 consecutive days, and concurrently treated with LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 10 days, beginning on the 4th day of PNP001 administration. The remarkably decreased number of activated microglial cells and increased expression of pre- and post-synaptic proteins were observed more in the hippocampus of the PNP001 administered groups than in the LPS-treated group. Furthermore, daily PNP001 administration significantly attenuated long-term memory decline compared with the LPS-treated group. Our study demonstrated that PNP001 inhibits LPS-induced neuroinflammation and its associated memory dysfunction by alleviating microglial activation and synaptic loss.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction. The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with the action of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in AD remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs (SDELs) and establish lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks via RNA sequencing analysis and a quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assay using transgenic mice with five familial AD mutations. A total of 53 SDELs in the cortex and 51 SDELs in the hippocampus were identified, including seven core SDELs common to both regions. The functions and pathways were then investigated through the potential target genes of SDELs via Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses, which indicate biological effects, action distributions, and pathological transductions associated with AD. Based on the ceRNA hypothesis, integrated ceRNA networks in the cortex and hippocampus of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA were constructed. The core SDEL-mediated ceRNA relationship was established and the expression of these RNAs was verified by qPCR. The results identified lncRNA ENSMUST00000127786 and highlighted miRNAs and mRNAs as potential key mediators in AD. These findings provide AD-derived lncRNA-mediated ceRNA profiles, and further experimental evidence is needed to confirm these identified ceRNA regulatory relationships.

AB  - The neuroprotective properties of piperine, the major alkaloid extracted from black pepper, have been under investigation, but its mechanism of action in excitotoxicity is still poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of piperine with a focus on nerve growth factor (NGF) signalling in a kainic acid (KA) rat model of excitotoxicity. Rats were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) piperine (10 or 50 mg/kg) before KA injection (15 mg/kg, i.p.). Our results show that KA exposure in rats caused seizure behaviour, intrinsic neuronal hyperactivity, glutamate elevation, hippocampal neuronal damage, and cognitive impairment. These KA-induced alterations could be restored to the normal state by piperine treatment. In addition, piperine decreased the expression of the NGF precursor proNGF and NGF-degrading protease matrix metalloproteinase 9, whereas it increased the expression of proNGF processing enzyme matrix metalloproteinase 7, NGF, and NGF-activated receptor TrkA in the hippocampus of KA-treated rats. Furthermore, KA decreased phosphorylation of the protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) in the hippocampus, and piperine reversed these changes. Our data suggest that piperine protects hippocampal neurons against KA-induced excitotoxicity by upregulating the NGF/TrkA/Akt/GSK3 beta signalling pathways.

AB  - Long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) leads to peritoneal damage and chronic inflammation, resulting in peritoneal fibrosis (PF). Emerging evidence suggests that yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key player in fibrogenesis across various organs. However, its role in PD-induced PF remains unclear. We used NIH/3T3 cells, primary mouse fibroblasts, and conditional YAP knockout (CKO) mice with glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1)-specific YAP deletion. The effects of YAP knockdown and verteporfin, a YAP inhibitor, on fibroblast-to-mesenchymal transition (FMT) and angiogenesis were evaluated. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induced YAP expression and promoted fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT) in 3T3 fibroblasts, upregulating collagen 1A1, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). YAP knockdown and verteporfin treatment reduced these FMT markers and inhibited smad2/3 phosphorylation. In vivo, YAP and Gli1-expressing cells were upregulated in PD-induced PF. Conditional YAP knockout in Gli1(+) cells and verteporfin treatment significantly reduced fibrosis and alpha-SMA, collagen 1, TGF-beta, CTGF, and phosphorylated smad2/3 expression in the peritoneum and peritoneal angiogenesis. YAP plays a pivotal role in FMT during PD-induced PF. Conditional YAP deletion in Gli1-expressing cells and verteporfin treatment represent promising antifibrotic strategies for long-term PD patients.

AB  - GPR37L1 is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, which is implicated in neurological disorders, but its normal physiological role is poorly understood. Its close homologue, GPR37, is implicated in Parkinson's disease and affective disorders. In this study, we set out to characterize adult and middle-aged global GPR37L1 knock-out (KO) mice regarding emotional behaviors. Our results showed that GPR37L1KO animals, except adult GPR37L1KO males, exhibited impaired retention of aversive memory formation as assessed by the shorter retention latency in a passive avoidance task. Interestingly, the viral-mediated deletion of GPR37L1 in conditional knockout mice in the hippocampus of middle-aged mice also showed impaired retention in passive avoidance tasks, similar to what was observed in global GPR37L1KO mice, suggesting that hippocampal GPR37L1 is involved in aversive learning processes. We also observed that middle-aged GPR37L1KO male and female mice exhibited a higher body weight than their wild-type counterparts. Adult and middle-aged GPR37L1KO female mice exhibited a reduced level of serum corticosterone and middle-aged GPR37L1KO females showed a reduced level of epinephrine in the dorsal hippocampus in the aftermath of passive avoidance task, with no such effects observed in GPR37L1KO male mice, suggesting that lack of GPR37L1 influences behavior and biochemical readouts in age- and sex-specific manners.

AB  - This study was designed to dissect the function of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) in hippocampal neuron injury in epilepsy and its possible molecular basis. Status epilepticus (SE) mouse model was built and primary hippocampal neurons were isolated. qRT-PCR and Western blot were applied to quantify the levels of related genes and proteins. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by CCK-8, EdU, and flow cytometry assays. Inflammatory factors were detected using ELISA analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays were carried out to validate the relationship between miR-206-3p and PVT1 or CAMK4. PVT1 and CAMK4 were increased, and miR-206-3p was downregulated in the hippocampus and hippocampal neurons of SE mice. Knockdown of PVT1 or CAMK4 abated SE-induced proliferation inhibition, apoptosis, and inflammation in hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically, PVT1 could sponge miR-206-3p to upregulate the expression of CAMK4 in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, downregulation of miR-206-3p reversed the inhibitory effects of PVT1 knockdown on SE-induced apoptosis and inflammation in hippocampal neurons. Similarly, overexpression of CAMK4 abolished miR-206-3p-evoked arrest of apoptosis and inflammation in hippocampal neurons under SE condition. Collectively, PVT1 contributed to SE-induced apoptosis and inflammation in hippocampal neurons by modulating the miR-206-3p/CAMK4 axis, offering a novel insight into the prevention of epilepsy.

AB  - Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) represents a group of disorders characterized by cerebellum and pons hypoplasia, variable cerebral involvement, microcephaly, severe global developmental delay (GDD), and seizures. We sought the genetic cause of PCH in two siblings. Genetic workup was performed by whole-exome sequencing followed by Sanger validation. Morpholino-knockdown zebrafish embryos with human wild-type gene rescue were used to assess cerebellar development and motor function. Transfected mouse hippocampal cultures and electroporated mouse embryos were employed to assess functional effects on neuronal morphology and development. Both patients presented with profound GDD, severe microcephaly, cataracts, and variably seizures. Their MRIs demonstrated marked cerebellar and pontine hypoplasia. Both were homozygous for a c.416T > C, p.(Leu139Pro) MED29 variant which was predicted to be pathogenic. Locomotion and cerebellar GABAergic neurons development were both impaired in MED29 Morpholino-knockdown zebrafish and rescued by human wild-type gene expression. ShRNA-knockdown of MED29 in mouse hippocampal neurons decreased neurite length and arborization in vitro, and caused defective embryonic neuronal migration in vivo. Overexpression of MED29 p.(Leu139Pro) was consistent with a loss-of-function. Taken together, the Mediator complex regulates transcription processes, and defects in particular subunits are associated with distinct neurodevelopmental phenotypes involving PCH. We conclude that MED29 is a novel risk gene for PCH.

AB  - The Hippo pathway is an evolutionary conserved signaling network involved in several cellular regulatory processes. Dephosphorylation and overexpression of Yes-associated proteins (YAPs) in the Hippo-off state are common in several types of solid tumors. YAP overexpression results in its nuclear translocation and interaction with transcriptional enhanced associate domain 1-4 (TEAD1-4) transcription factors. Covalent and non-covalent inhibitors have been developed to target several interaction sites between TEAD and YAP. The most targeted and effective site for these developed inhibitors is the palmitate-binding pocket in the TEAD1-4 proteins. Screening of a DNA-encoded library against the TEAD central pocket was performed experimentally to identify six new allosteric inhibitors. Inspired by the structure of the TED-347 inhibitor, chemical modification was performed on the original inhibitors by replacing secondary methyl amide with a chloromethyl ketone moiety. Various computational tools, including molecular dynamics, free energy perturbation, and Markov state model analysis, were employed to study the effect of ligand binding on the protein conformational space. Four of the six modified ligands were associated with enhanced allosteric communication between the TEAD4 and YAP1 domains indicated by the relative free energy perturbation to original molecules. Phe229, Thr332, Ile374, and Ile395 residues were revealed to be essential for the effective binding of the inhibitors.

AB  - Although the major components of various organs of sea buckthorn have been identified (particularly phenolic compounds), biological properties of many of these phytochemicals still remain poorly characterized. In this study, we focused on the chemical composition and biological activity of preparations that were obtained from sea buckthorn twigs and leaves. The objective was to investigate cytotoxicity of these preparations against human fibroblast line HFF-1, using MTT reduction assay, their anti- or pro-oxidant activities against the effects of a biological oxidant -H2O2/Fe-on human plasma lipids and proteins in vitro (using TBARS and carbonyl groups as the markers of oxidative stress). Antimicrobial activity of the tested preparations against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as against fungi (Candida albicans, C. glabrata) by the EUCAST-approved broth microdilution method, followed by growth on solid media, were also assessed. Our analysis showed significant differences in chemical composition and biological properties of the tested preparations (A-F). All tested preparations from sea buckthorn twigs (D-F) and one preparation from sea buckthorn leaves (preparation C) may be a new source of phenolic antioxidants for pharmacological and cosmetic applications.

AB  - Amyloid beta 1-42 (A beta 42) aggregates acutely impair hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission, and 17 beta-estradiol is crucial for hippocampal LTP. We tested whether boosting the synthesis of neural-derived 17 beta-estradiol (nE2) saves hippocampal LTP by the neurotoxic action of A beta 42. Electrophysiological recordings were performed to measure dentate gyrus (DG) LTP in rat hippocampal slices. Using a pharmacological approach, we tested the ability of nE2 to counteract the LTP impairment caused by acute exposure to soluble A beta 42 aggregates. nE2 was found to be required for LTP in DG under physiological conditions. Blockade of steroid 5 alpha-reductase with finasteride, by increasing nE2 synthesis from testosterone (T), completely recovered LTP in slices treated with soluble A beta 42 aggregates. Modulation of the glutamate N-methyl-D aspartate receptor (NMDAR) by memantine effectively rescued the LTP deficit observed in slices exposed to A beta 42, and memantine prevented LTP reduction observed under the blocking of nE2 synthesis. nE2 is able to counteract A beta 42-induced synaptic dysfunction. This effect depends on a rapid, non-genomic mechanism of action of nE2, which may share a common pathway with glutamate NMDAR signaling.

AB  - Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiation was reported to be harmful to hippocampal neurons. However, the mechanism underlying EMP-induced neuronal damage remains unclear. In this paper, for the first time, we attempted to investigate the involvement of ferroptosis in EMP-induced neuronal damage and its underlying mechanism. In vivo studies were conducted with a rat model to examine the association of ferroptosis and EMP-induced hippocampal neuronal damage. Moreover, in vitro studies were conducted with HT22 neurons to investigate the underlying mechanism of EMP-induced neuronal ferroptosis. In vivo results showed that EMP could induce learning and memory impairment of rats, ferroptotic morphological damages to mitochondria, accumulation of malonaldehyde (MDA) and iron, overexpression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA, and downregulation of GPX4 protein in rat hippocampus. In vitro results showed that EMP could induce neuronal death, MDA accumulation, iron overload, PTGS2 overexpression, and GPX4 downregulation in HT22 neurons. These adverse effects could be reversed by either lipid peroxides scavenger ferrostatin-1 or overexpression of GPX4. These results suggest that EMP radiation can induce ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons via a vicious cycle of lipid peroxides accumulation and GSH/GPX4 axis downregulation. Lipid peroxides and the GSH/GPX4 axis provide potential effective intervention targets to EMP-induced hippocampal neuronal damage.

AB  - Objective: To establish a mouse model of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis and assess the potential therapeutic benefits of D-serine supplementation in mitigating synaptic plasticity impairments induced by anti-NMDAR antibodies. Methods: Anti-NMDAR antibodies were purified from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and verified using a cell-based assay. CSF from patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases served as the control. These antibodies were then injected intraventricularly into C57BL/6 mice. Forty-eight hours following the injection, mice were administered either D-serine (500 mg/kg) or sterile saline intraperitoneally for three consecutive days. Subsequent analyses included Western blotting, immunofluorescence, electrophysiological studies, and a series of behavioral tests to assess pathological changes caused by anti-NMDAR antibodies. Results: Mice injected with anti-NMDAR antibodies exhibited a significant reduction in hippocampal long-term potentiation compared to controls, which was notably ameliorated by D-serine treatment. Additionally, these mice displayed decreased levels of hippocampal membrane NMDAR1 protein and postsynaptic NMDAR1 density. However, D-serine administration did not significantly alter these conditions. Notably, no significant behavioral differences were observed between mice injected with anti-NMDAR antibodies and controls in open fields, elevated plus maze, novel object recognition, or Morris water maze tests. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that exogenous D-serine can improve hippocampal plasticity impairments caused by anti-NMDAR antibodies but does not reverse the decreased expression of NMDAR. Furthermore, a single intraventricular injection of patients' antibodies was insufficient to induce anti-NMDAR encephalitis-related behaviors in mice.

AB  - Background: Annually, millions of children undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Hospitals increasingly aim to scan young children awake, as doing so benefits both patients and health care systems. To help hospitals reduce the need for anesthesia, we have developed solutions to prepare pediatric patients at home and in the hospital. Objective: The goal of our project was to design, develop, and test a solution that extends our preparation solutions by guiding and engaging children during their MRI examination. Methods: Pediatric In-bore was designed to deliver a familiar experience by reusing design elements from our preparation solutions. It offers child-friendly movies and auditory and visual guidance about examination progress and breath holding. To evaluate children's liking and understanding of the solution, we conducted a usability study. Ten healthy children participated in a mock MRI examination featuring pediatric In-bore. We observed task compliance (ability to lie still and hold one's breath) and conducted guided interviews to assess their experience and understanding of the guidance offered. Results: Participants (aged 5 to 10 years) were generally positive about pediatric In-bore. They liked the main character (Ollie the elephant) and her movie. Auditory and visual guidance were generally liked and understood. All but one participant successfully managed to lie still during the mock examination, and 6 (60%) out of 10 participants successfully held their breath. Conclusions:Pediatric In-bore appears promising for engaging and guiding young children during awake MRI. It completes the Pediatric Coaching solution that now offers guidance throughout the MRI journey. Future research can expand on this work by evaluating the clinical impact of the Pediatric Coaching solution in a larger and more diverse sample of pediatric patients.

AB  - With the development of precision miniaturization of fluid transfer devices, high transfer performance and miniaturization for fluid transfer devices are valued. This paper proposes a valveless piezoelectric pump with a combination of rhinoceros horn and V-channel. High output performance is achieved by exploiting the unidirectional flow effect caused by the different coefficients of pressure loss in the forward and reverse directions caused by the convex and concave curved sections of the rhino horn and the V-channel. The theoretical analysis of the energy loss in the cavity and the simulation of the flow field in the cavity confirm the effectiveness of the structure. The theoretical optimum angle combination was further determined by varying the rhinoceros horn out-swing angle and the V-channel angle (10 & DEG;, 20 & DEG;, 30 & DEG;). The experimental data showed that the optimum output flow rate was 86.8 ml/min at 160 V and 40 Hz with channel angle of 20 & DEG; and swing angle of 10 & DEG;. This combined valveless piezoelectric pump reduces backflow, improves pump output performance and is expected to be used in biomedical high viscosity precision fluid transfer devices.

AB  - Studies have shown that diabetes is associated with the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. However, there is currently no effective treatment for diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction. The superior efficacy of liraglutide (LIRA) for cognitive impairment and numerous neurodegenerative diseases has been widely demonstrated. This study determined the effects of LIRA on diabetic cognitive impairment and on the levels of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, iron metabolism and ferroptosis in the hippocampus. Mice were injected daily with liraglutide (200 mu g/kg/d) for 5 weeks. LIRA could repair damaged neurons and synapses, and it increased the protein expression levels of PSD 95, SYN, and BDNF. Furthermore, LIRA significantly decreased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation levels by downregulating the production of ROS and MDA and upregulating SOD and GSH-Px in the serum and hippocampus, and the upregulation of SOD2 expression was also proven. The decreased levels of TfR1 and the upregulation of FPN1 and FTH proteins observed in the LIRA-treated db/db group were shown to reduce iron overload in the hippocampus, whereas the increased expression of Mtft and decreased expression of Mfrn in the mitochondria indicated that mitochondrial iron overload was ameliorated. Finally, LIRA was shown to prevent ferroptosis in the hippocampus by elevating the expression of GPX4 and SLC7A11 and suppressing the excessive amount of ACSL4; simultaneously, the damage to the mitochondria observed by TEM was also repaired. For the first time, we proved in the T2DM model that ferroptosis occurs in the hippocampus, which may play a role in diabetic cognitive impairment. LIRA can reduce oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and iron overload in diabetic cognitive disorders and further inhibit ferroptosis, thereby weakening the damage to hippocampal neurons and synaptic plasticity and ultimately restoring cognitive function.

AB  - Exosomes harvested from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) have shown treatment potential in many diseases. In vitro, Zeb2/Axin2 stimulated endogenous neurogenesis, which induced functional recovery after stroke. Here, we investigated whether the Zeb2/Axin2-enriched exosomes harvested from BMSCs transfected with a Zeb2/Axin2 overexpression plasmid would enhance neurological recovery. Compared with the control, both exosome treatments significantly improved functional recovery, and Zeb2/Axin2-enriched exosomes had significantly more improved effects on neurological function, neurogenesis, and neurite remodeling/neuronal dendrite plasticity than the control BMSC exosome treatment in a middle cerebral artery occlusion MCAO rat model. After stimulation with Zeb2/Axin2-enriched BMSC exosomes, the spatial memory and nerve function of MCAO rats showed marked recovery. The number of neurons was increased in the subventricular zone (SVZ), hippocampus, and cortex area, while the expression of nerve growth factors (NGF, BDNF, etc.) was upregulated. In the ischemic boundary zone, Zeb2/Axin2-enriched exosomes promoted synaptic remodeling by increasing the number of synapses and reversed the axonal loss of phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI-31) and synaptophysin (SYN) caused by ischemic injury, thus alleviating axonal demise and promoting synaptic proliferation. In vitro, Zeb2/Axin2-enriched exosomes significantly increased neurite branching and elongation of cultured cortical embryonic rat neurons under oxygen- and glucose-deprived (OGD) conditions. Moreover, Ex-Zeb2/Axin2-enriched exosomes downregulated the protein level of SOX10, endothelin-3/EDNRB, and Wnt/beta-catenin expression. In conclusion, exosomes harvested from Ex-Zeb2/Axin2 BMSC could improve post-stroke neuroplasticity and functional recovery in MCAO rats by promoting proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. The mechanism may be related to the SOX10, Wnt/beta-catenin, and endothelin-3/EDNRB pathways.

AB  - The present study demonstrates altered topographic distribution and enhanced neuronal expression of major adenosine-metabolizing enzymes, i.e. ecto-5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-nucleotidase (eN) and tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), as well as adenosine receptor subtype A(2A) in the hippocampus and cortex of male rats from early to late adulthood (3, 6, 12 and 15 months old males). The significant effect of age was demonstrated for the increase in the activity and the protein expression of eN and TNAP. At 15-m, enzyme histochemistry demonstrated enhanced expression of eN in synapse-rich hippocampal and cortical layers, whereas the upsurge of TNAP was observed in the hippocampal and cortical neuropil, rather than in cells and layers where two enzymes mostly reside in 3-m old brain. Furthermore, a dichotomy in A(1)R and A(2A)R expression was demonstrated in the cortex and hippocampus from early to late adulthood. Specifically, a decrease in A(1)R and enhancement of A(2A)R expression were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, the latter being almost exclusively localized in hippocampal pyramidal and cortical superficial cell layers. We did not observe any glial upregulation of A(2A)R, which was common for both advanced age and chronic neurodegeneration. Taken together, the results imply that the adaptative changes in adenosine signaling occurring in neuronal elements early in life may be responsible for the later prominent glial enhancement in A(2A)R-mediated adenosine signaling, and neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, which are the hallmarks of both advanced age and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Cognitive decline, an important comorbidity of type 2 diabetes (T2D), is attributed to oxidative stress and impaired cholinergic signaling in the brain. The alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChR) is densely distributed in the hippocampus and cortex, and exerts neuroprotective and procognitive actions. Ethyl gallate (EG), a natural phenolic antioxidant compound, showed high in-silico binding affinity towards alpha 7nAChR and brain penetrability. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the involvement of alpha 7nAChR in the potential of EG to ameliorate T2D-induced Alzheimer's disease-like condition. T2D was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) in rats on high-fat diet. Diabetic animals were treated with EG (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) for four weeks, and their learning and memory performance was evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM). Further, the brains were subjected to biochemical analysis of antioxidants like glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), and oxidative stress marker malonaldehyde (MDA). While diabetic rats showed a significant decline in cognitive performance in the MWM, a substantial improvement was noticed following EG treatment. Further, the diabetes-associated reductions in GSH, SOD, and CAT levels, along with increased MDA contents in the brain, were effectively restored by EG. Interestingly, pre-treatment with alpha 7nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the effects of EG on behavioral and biochemical parameters. The results suggest that EG may augment cholinergic signaling in the brain via alpha 7nAChR to mitigate oxidative stress, consequently alleviating T2D-associated dementia. Therefore, EG could be a potential candidate for addressing cognitive impairment comorbid with T2D.

AB  - Social isolation (SI) is chronic psycho-emotional stress for humans and other socially living species. There are few comparative studies that have measured monoamine levels in brain structures in male and female rats subjected to SI. Existing data is highly controversial. In our recent study, we investigated behavioral effects of SI prolonged up to 9 months on a rather large sample of 69 male and female Wistar rats. In the present study, we measured the levels of monoamines-norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and DA and 5-HT metabolites-in the brain structures of 40 rats from the same sample. The single-housed rats of both sexes showed hyperactivity and reduced reactivity to novelty in the Open Field test, and impaired passive avoidance learning. Regardless of their sex, by the time of sacrifice, the single-housed rats weighed less and had lower pain sensitivity and decreased anxiety compared with group-housed animals. SI decreased NE levels in the hippocampus and increased them in the striatum. SI induced functional activation of the DA-ergic system in the frontal cortex and hypothalamus, with increased DA and 3-methoxytyramine levels. SI-related changes were found in the 5-HT-ergic system: 5-HT levels increased in the frontal cortex and striatum, while 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid only increased in the frontal cortex. We believe that SI prolonged for multiple months could be a valuable model for comparative analysis of the behavioral alterations and the underlying molecular processes in dynamics of adaptation to chronic psychosocial stress in male and female rats in relation to age-dependent changes.

AB  - Adaptation to psychosocial stress is psychologically distressing, initiating/promoting comorbidity with alcohol use disorders. Emerging evidence moreover showed that ethanol (EtOH) exacerbates social -defeat stress (SDS)induced behavioral impairments, neurobiological sequelae, and poor therapeutic outcomes. Hence, this study investigated the effects of geraniol, an isoprenoid monoterpenoid alcohol with neuroprotective functions on EtOH escalated SDS-induced behavioral impairments, and neurobiological sequelae in mice. Male mice chronically exposed to SDS for 14 days were repeatedly fed with EtOH (2 g/kg, p. o.) from days 8 -14. From days 1 -14, SDS-EtOH co -exposed mice were concurrently treated with geraniol (25 and 50 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) orally. After SDS-EtOH translational interactions, arrays of behavioral tasks were examined, followed by investigations of oxido-inflammatory, neurochemicals levels, monoamine oxidase-B and acetylcholinesterase activities in the striatum, prefrontal -cortex, and hippocampus. The glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) expression was also quantified in the prefrontal -cortex immunohistochemically. Adrenal weights, serum glucose and corticosterone concentrations were measured. EtOH exacerbated SDS-induced low -stress resilience, social impairment characterized by anxiety, depression, and memory deficits were attenuated by geraniol (50 and 100 mg/kg) and fluoxetine. In line with this, geraniol increased the levels of dopamine, serotonin, and glutamic-acid decarboxylase enzyme, accompanied by reduced monoamine oxidase-B and acetylcholinesterase activities in the prefrontal -cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Geraniol inhibited SDS-EtOH-induced adrenal hypertrophy, corticosterone, TNF- alpha, IL -6 release, malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, with increased antioxidant activities. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that geraniol enhanced GFAP immunoreactivity in the prefrontal -cortex relative to SDS-EtOH group. We concluded that geraniol ameliorates SDS-EtOH interaction -induced behavioral changes via normalization of neuroimmune-endocrine and neurochemical dysregulations in mice brains.

AB  - Microglia play a crucial role in regulating neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD). Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, has been implicated in HIBD; however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) mediates neuroinflammation and microglial damage in HIBD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between HMGB1 and microglial pyroptosis and elucidate the mechanism involved in rats with HIBD (both sexes were included) and in BV2 microglia subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our results showed that HMGB1 inhibition by glycyrrhizin (20 mg/kg) reduced the expression of microglial pyroptosis-related proteins, including caspase-1, the N-terminus fragment of gasdermin D (N-GSDMD), and pyroptosis-related inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL) -1 beta and IL-18. Moreover, HMGB1 inhibition resulted in reduced neuronal damage in the hippocampus 72 h after HIBD and ultimately improved neurobehavior during adulthood, as evidenced by reduced escape latency and path length, as well as increased time and distance spent in the target quadrant during the Morris water maze test. These results revealed that HIBD-induced pyroptosis is mediated by HMGB1/receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) signaling (inhibition by FPS-ZM1, 1 mg/kg) and the activation of cathespin B (cat B). Notably, cat B inhibition by CA074-Me (5 mg/kg) also reduced hippocampal neuronal damage by suppressing microglial pyroptosis, thereby ameliorating learning and memory impairments caused by HIBD. Lastly, we demonstrated that microglial pyroptosis may contribute to neuronal damage through the HMGB1/RAGE/cat B signaling pathway in vitro. In conclusion, these results suggest that HMGB1/RAGE/cat B inhibitors can alleviate hippocampal injury by regulating microglial pyroptosis and caspase activation in HIBD, thereby reducing the release of proinflammatory mediators that destroy hippocampal neurons and induce spatial memory impairments.image

AB  - This study aimed to explore the antidepressant effect and underlying mechanism of the Alpinia oxyphylla Miq. volatile oil (AOVO) in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). C57BL/6 mice were grouped and administered with different dosages of AOVO (0.25, 0.50, 1.00, or 2.00 mL/kg body weight, i.g.), TAK242 (a TLR4 inhibitor, 0.75 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), or TAK242 (0.75 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) + AOVO (0.50 mL/kg body weight, i.g.) for 21 days. Depression-like symptoms in the mice were then evaluated through their body weight gain (BW), the open field test (OFT), the sucrose preference test (SPT), the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT), and forced swimming test (FST). The concentrations of interleukin-1 & beta; (IL-1 & beta;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor & alpha; (TNF-& alpha;), and 5-hydroxytyrptamine (5-HT) in the mice were determined using ELISA kits. He-matoxylin and eosin (HE) dying were performed for histopathological examination. The expression of inflam-matory proteins was assessed through western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence staining. AOVO was found to improve the behavioral indexes of CUMS-exposed mice behavioral and synergize TAK242 to mitigate both their depressive symptoms and neuroinflammation. Moreover, AOVO was found to inhibit the hippocampal damage, decrease inflammatory cytokines (Reduced IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, and TNF-& alpha; by 19.97 %, 22.87 %, and 24.13 %, respectively), and downregulate the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-& kappa;B signaling pathway-related proteins in the hippocampus of CUMS-exposed mice (Reduced TLR4, MyD88, and NF-& kappa;B by 46.14 %, 42.48 %, and 38.08 %, respectively). These findings demonstrate that AOVO can ameliorate depressive behaviors and mitigate neuro-inflammation in the CUMS-exposed mice via suppressing the TLR4-medicated MyD88/NF-& kappa;B signaling pathway.

AB  - Imipramine belongs to a group of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). It has been also documented that its antidepressant activity connects with the modulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and arachidonic acid (AA) turnover. Through this mechanism, imipramine can indirectly modify glutamate (Glu) transmission. Additionally, it has been shown that chronic treatment with imipramine results in the upregulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5 receptor) in the hippocampus of rats. Our previous study revealed that manipulation of the AA pathway via inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by selective COX-2 inhibitor (NS398) could effectively modulate the behavior of mice treated with imipramine. Here, we hypothesized that COX-2 inhibition could similarly to imipramine influence mGlu5 receptor, and thus NS398 can modulate the effect of imipramine on Glu. Moreover, such regulation changes should correspond with alterations in neurotransmission. Increased cPLA activity after imipramine administration may change the activity of the AA pathway and the endocannabinoid metabolism, e.g., 2-Arachidonyl-glycerol (2-AG). To verify the idea, mGlu5 receptor level was investigated in the hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice treated for 7 or 14 days with imipramine and/or COX-2 inhibitor: NS398. Western blot and PCR analyses were conducted. Moreover, the excitatory (Glu) and inhibitory (gamma-aminobutyric acid; GABA) neurotransmitters were measured using HPLC and 2-AG using ELISA. A time-dependent change in mGlu5 receptor and COX-2 protein level, COX-2 expression, and 2-AG level in the PFC after imipramine administration was found. Up-regulation of mGlu5 receptor after NS398 was found in HC and PFC. A structure-dependent shift between excitatory vs. inhibitory transmission was detected when NS398 and imipramine were co-administered.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) is a psychostimulant drug of abuse. METH use is associated with cognitive impairments and neurochemical abnormalities comparable to pathological changes observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These observations have stimulated the idea that METH abusers might be prone to develop AD-like signs and symptoms. Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is considered as a potential therapeutic intervention against AD. We thus conducted the present study to explore potential protective roles of melatonin against METH-induced deficits in learning and memory as well as in the appearance of AD-like pathological changes in METHtreated male Wistar rats. We found that melatonin ameliorated METH-induced cognitive impairments in those rats. Melatonin prevented METH-induced decrease in dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in rat hippocampus. Melatonin reversed METH-induced activation of 8-arrestin2, reduction of phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and METH-induced excessive activity of glycogen synthase kinase-38 (GSK38). Importantly, melatonin inhibited METH-induced changes in the expression of 8-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), and presenilin 1 (PS1), as well as the reduction of amyloid beta (A8)42 production. Immunofluorescence double-labeling demonstrated that melatonin not only prevented the METHinduced loss of DAT but also prevented METH-induced A842 overexpression in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3. Furthermore, melatonin also suppressed METH-induced increase in phosphorylated tau. Significantly, melatonin attenuated METH-induced increase in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype 2 B (NR2B) protein expression and restored METH-induced reduction of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This suggested that melatonin attenuated the toxic effect of METH on the hippocampus involving the amyloidogenic pathway. Taken together, our data suggest that METH abuse may be a predisposing risk factor for AD and that melatonin could serve as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent METH-induced AD like pathology.

AB  - Background Sodium benzoate (SB) is a widely used food preservative. However, excessive intake of a high dose of SB poses a risk of neurotoxicity. Ascorbic acid (AA) is a naturally occurring antioxidant found in fruits with reported neuroprotective properties. The present study investigated the neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in SB-treated rats and the ameliorative effect of AA in rats. Methods Forty-two male Wistar rats were divided into six groups (n = 7). Group 1 (vehicle, 10 ml/kg), Groups 2-4 rats SB (150, 300, and 600 mg/kg), Group 5 AA (100 mg/kg) and Group 6 (SB 600 mg/kg + AA 100 mg/kg). Treatment was daily administered for 28 days by oral route. Anxiogenic behavior, locomotor, and exploratory activities were evaluated in the open field monitored with a camera, and memory performance in Y-maze. Brain oxidative stress, inflammatory, apoptosis, and cholinergic markers were determined. The cortico-hippocampal tissues were examined histologically. Results SB-treated rats showed significant anxiogenic-like behavior and impairment in locomotor, exploratory, and memory performance. This was reversed in SB (600 mg/kg)-treated rats coadministered with AA. SB-treated rats showed a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities, increase malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, caspase-3, and acetylcholinesterase activity in the striatum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. These biochemical changes were reversed in AA-treated rats. Reduced cortico-hippocampal neuronal cell count and the pyknotic index were found in SB-treated rats, which was also reversed in AA-treated rats. Conclusion Conclusively, sodium-benzoate-induced neurobehavioral deficits and brain biochemical changes were ameliorated by ascorbic acid probably via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and apoptotic mechanisms.

AB  - Transcriptional enhanced associate domain (Tead)-mediated Hippo signaling pathway regulates diverse physiological processes; its dysfunction has been implicated in an increasing number of human gynecological cancers. The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz) binds to and then activates Tead through forming a three-helix bundle (THB) at their complex interface. The THB is defined by a double-helical hairpin from Tead and a single alpha-helix from Taz, serving as the key interaction hotspot between Tead and Taz. In the present study, the helical hairpin was derived from Tead protein to generate a hairpin segment, which is a 25-mer polypeptide consisting of a longer helical arm-1 and a shorter helical arm-2 as well as a flexible loop linker between them. Dynamics simulation and energetics characterization revealed that the hairpin peptide is intrinsically disordered when splitting from its protein context, thus incurring a large entropy penalty upon binding to Taz alpha-helix. A disulfide bridge was introduced across the two helical arms of hairpin peptide to obtain a strong binder termed TAZ-hTrap, which can maintain in a considerably structured, native-like conformation in unbound state, and the entropy penalty was minimized by disulfide stapling to effectively improve its affinity toward the alpha-helix. These computational findings can be further substantiated by circular dichroism and fluorescence polarization at molecular level, and viability assay also observed a potent cytotoxic effect on diverse human gynecological tumors at cellular level. In addition, we further demonstrated that the TAZ-hTrap has a good selectivity for its cognate Taz over other noncognate proteins that share a high conservation with the Taz alpha-helix.

AB  - BACKGROUNDCamellia oleifera shells (COS) are a by-product of camellia oil processing and are rich in polyphenols. To date, the polyphenols extracted from COS have not been fully developed. In this study, two polyphenol fractions, referred to as 20P and 40P, were obtained by sequentially eluting the COS crude extract from an AB-8 macroporous resin column using ethanol at concentrations of 20% and 40% with different polarities. In addition, the biotransformation processes of these two polyphenols and their effects on the gut microbiota were studied.RESULTSThe results of in vitro digestion showed that at the end of the intestinal digestion stage the total phenolic content (TPC) content (0.34 +/- 0.050 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) mg-1 dry weight (DW)) and antioxidant activity (0.53 +/- 0.0076 mg vitamin C (Vc) mg-1 DW) of the 20P component were significantly higher than those of the 40P component (0.19 +/- 0.020 mg GAE mg-1 DW; 0.39 +/- 0.016 mg Vc mg-1 DW). In addition, the experiment also found that the phenolic composition and transformation process of 20P and 40P components were significantly different, and the TPC content (0.30 +/- 0.058 mg GAE mg-1 DW) and antioxidant capacity (0.73 +/- 0.034 mg Vc mg-1 DW) of the 40P component were significantly higher than that of the 20P (0.13 +/- 0.035 mg GAE mg-1 DW); (0.19 +/- 0.013 mg Vc mg-1 DW) component during in vitro fermentation. This may be related to the types of compounds extracted by solvents with different polarities. In addition, both 20P and 40P components significantly regulated the gut microbiota and promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids.CONCLUSIONThese results indicate that polyphenols from different polar sources of COS can serve as valuable bioactive compounds with potential health-regulating properties.

AB  - Objectives: Exposure to maternal obesity has been shown to make offspring more prone to cognitive and metabolic disorders later in life. Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the fetal programming process is remarkable. ER stress can be activated by many chronic diseases, including obesity and diabetes. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the role of ER stress caused by maternal diet-induced obesity in the offspring hippocampus. We also evaluated the protective effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against ER stress.Methods: A rat obesity model was created by providing a high-fat (60 % kcal) diet. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was administered at a dosage of 150 mg/kg via the intragastric route. The animals were mated at the age of 12 weeks. The same diet was maintained during pregnancy and lactation. The experiment was terminated on the postnatal 28th day, and the offspring's brain tissues were examined. Immunohistochemical staining for ER stress markers was performed on sections taken from tissues after routine histological procedures.Results: The results revealed increased GRP78, PERK, and eIF2 alpha immunoreactivities in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) regions in the obese group offspring, while the expression of those markers in those regions normalized with NAC supplementation (p < 0.01). Statistical analysis of XBP1 immunoreactivity H-scores revealed no difference between the study groups (p > 0.05).Discussion: These results suggest that exposure to obesity during the prenatal period may cause increased ER stress in hippocampal neurons, which have an important role in the regulation of learning, memory and behavior, and this may contribute to decreased cognitive performance. On the other hand, NAC stands out as an effective agent that can counteract hippocampal ER stress.

AB  - To investigate the key molecular mechanisms of palmatine for the treatment of neuroinflammation through modulation of a pathway using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combined with network pharmacology, and animal experiments. Five alkaloid components were obtained from the traditional Chinese medicine Huangteng through literature mining. Molecular docking and MD simulation with acetylcholinesterase were used to screen palmatine. At the animal level, mice were injected with LPS intracerebrally to cause a neuroinflammatory model, and the Morris water maze experiment was performed to examine the learning memory of mice. Anxiety levels were tested using the autonomous activity behavior experiment with the open field and elevated behavior experiments. HE staining and Niss staining were performed on brain tissue sections to observe morphological lesions and apoptosis; serum was examined for inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta; Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression. The expression of PI3K/AKT/NFkB signaling pathway-related proteins was examined by Western blot. The results of network pharmacology showed that the screening of palmatine activation containing the PI3K/Akt/NFkB signaling pathway exerts antineuroinflammatory effects. Results from behavioral experiments showed that Pal enhanced learning memory in model mice, improved anxiety behavior, and significantly improved brain damage caused by neuroinflammation. The results of HE staining and Niss staining of brain tissue sections showed that palmatine could alleviate morphological lesions and nucleus damage in brain tissue. Palmatine improved the levels of serum inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta. SOD, MDA, CAT, ACH, and ACHE in the hippocampus were improved. Western blot results showed that palmatine administration ameliorated LPS-induced neuroinflammation through the PI3K/Akt/NFkB pathway.

AB  - It is still an urgent need to find alternative and effective therapies to combat epileptic seizures. Tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressant and calcineurin inhibitor is emerging as promising drug to suppress seizures. However, there are few reports applying tacrolimus to epilepsy and providing data for its antiseizure properties. In this study, we investigated the antiseizure effects of 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of tacrolimus treatment priorly to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induction of seizures in rats. As an experimental design, we establish two independent rat groups where we observe convulsive seizures following 70 mg/kg PTZ and sub-convulsive seizures detected by electroencephalography (EEG) following 35 mg/kg PTZ. Thereafter, we proceed with biochemical analyses of the brain including assessment of malondialdehyde level as an indicator of lipid peroxidation and detection of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity and PGF2 alpha. Tacrolimus pre-treatment dose-dependently resulted in lesser seizure severity according to Racine's scale, delayed start-up latency of the first myoclonic jerk and attenuated the spike percentages detected by EEG in seizure-induced rats. However, only the higher dose of tacrolimus was effective to restore lipid peroxidation. An increase in SOD activity was observed in the PTZ group, mediated by seizure activity per se, however, it was greater in the groups that received treatment with 5 and 10 mg/kg of Tacrolimus. PGF2 alpha bursts following PTZ induction of seizures were reversed by tacrolimus pre-treatment in a dose-dependent manner as well. We report that the well-known immunosuppressant tacrolimus is a promising agent to suppress seizures. Comparative studies are necessary to determine the possible utilization of tacrolimus in clinical cases.

AB  - Exercise benefits the brain, particularly the learning and memory center-the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC)-and holds promise for therapeutic applications addressing age-related cognitive deficits. While moderate-to-vigorousintensity exercise is commonly recommended for health benefits, our translational research proposes the effectiveness of very-light-intensity exercise in enhancing cognitive functions. However, the intensity-dependent characteristics of HPC activation have yet to be fully delineated; therefore, there is no evidence of whether such easily accessible exercises for people of all ages and most fitness levels can activate HPC neurons. Here, we aimed to clarify this question using a physiologically sound rat exercise model. We used a previously established rat treadmill running model within a metabolic chamber and measured maximal oxygen uptake (V(center dot)O2 max) during an incremental running test. Referring to the American College of Sports Medicine's V(center dot)O2 max-based intensity classification, rats were assigned to one of five groups: resting control, very-light, light, moderate, and vigorous exercise intensity. We immunohistochemically assessed the effects of a single bout of exercise on dHPC neuronal activity and measured V(center dot)O2 and blood lactate as exercise intensity indicators. dHPC neuronal activity increased with exercise intensity, even at light-intensity without blood lactate accumulation, and correlated positively with increasing V(center dot)O2. The dorsal dentate gyrus and CA1 sub-regions were markedly activated even by very-lightintensity exercise. Our findings demonstrate the intensity-dependent activation of dHPC neurons, with verylight-intensity exercise as the minimal intensity threshold. These strongly support our hypothesis that verylight-intensity exercise serves as a viable memory-enhancing strategy, beneficial for various populations including low-fitness individuals and the elderly.

AB  - "Lipid raft aging" in nerve cells represents an early event in the development of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Lipid rafts are key elements in synaptic plasticity, and their modification with aging alters interactions and distribution of signaling molecules, such as glutamate receptors and ion channels involved in memory formation, eventually leading to cognitive decline. In the present study, we have analyzed, in vivo, the effects of dietary supplementation of n-3 LCPUFA on the lipid structure, membrane microviscosity, domain organization, and partitioning of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in hippocampal lipid raffs in female mice. The results revealed several lipid signatures of "lipid rafts aging" in old mice fed control diets, consisting in depletion of n-3 LCPUFA, membrane unsaturation, along with increased levels of saturates, plasmalogens, and sterol esters, as well as altered lipid relevant indexes. These changes were paralleled by increased microviscosity and changes in the raft/non-raft (R/NR) distribution of AMPA-R and mGluR5. Administration of the n-3 LCPUFA diet caused the partial reversion of fatty acid alterations found in aged mice and returned membrane microviscosity to values found in young animals. Paralleling these findings, lipid rafts accumulated mGluR5, NMDA-R, and ASIC2, and increased their R/NR proportions, which collectively indicate changes in synaptic plasticity. Unexpectedly, this diet also modified the lipidome and dimension of lipid rafts, as well as the domain redistribution of glutamate receptors and acid-sensing ion channels involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, likely modulating functionality of lipid rafts in memory formation and reluctance to age-associated cognitive decline.

AB  - Chronic inflammatory pain and depression are highly comorbid, with nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons strongly associated with the onset and progression of the comorbidity. Electroacupuncture (EA), widely used to treat pain and mood disorders, may ameliorate chronic inflammatory pain and depression comorbidity (CIPDC) by inhibiting Nrf2-mediated ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons, though its mechanism of action remains partially understood. In this study, we established the CIPDC model by administering a subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the left hind paw. Evaluations of EA's effects on pain thresholds and depressive behaviors in CIPDC rats included paw withdrawal mechanical threshold, paw withdrawal thermal latency, sucrose preference test, open field test, and forced swim test assessments. HE staining was performed to assess the pathological and morphological alterations in hippocampal neurons. FJB staining was utilized to evaluate neuronal degeneration, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to examine ultrastructural changes in hippocampal neuronal mitochondria. Prussian blue staining was conducted to visualize ferrous ion deposition in the hippocampus, and the contents of ferrous ion (Fe2+), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) were measured using colorimetric assay kits. Western blotting (WB) was performed to determine the relative protein expression of Nrf2, FTH1, FTL, xCT, GPX4, ACSL4, LPCAT3, and LOX in the hippocampus. Additionally, the relative mRNA expression of FTH1, FTL, xCT, GPX4, ACSL4, LPCAT3, and LOX was analyzed by PCR. Flow cytometry was used to quantify ROS levels in the hippocampus, and immunofluorescence staining was applied to detect nuclear expression of Nrf2 as well as co-localization of GPX4 with the neuronal marker NeuN. Our results demonstrate that EA upregulates nuclear Nrf2 expression in hippocampal tissue, thereby alleviating iron metabolism dysregulation, enhancing antioxidant system activity, and reducing lipid peroxidation. This process inhibits ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons, promoting their repair and remodeling, and effectively treating CIPDC.

AB  - Purpose: Chronic stress is a significant risk factor for mood disorders such as depression, where synaptic plasticity plays a central role in pathogenesis. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Type-2 (TRPV2) Ion Channels are implicated in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disorders. Previous proteomic analysis indicated a reduction in TRPV2 levels in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model, yet its role in synaptic plasticity during depression remains to be elucidated. This study aims to investigate TRPV2's role in depression and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted using the TRPV2-specific agonist probenecid and ERK1/2 inhibitors SCH772984. In vivo, rats underwent six weeks of CUMS before probenecid administration. Depressive-like behaviors were assessed through behavioral tests. ELISA kits measured 5-HT, DA, NE levels in rat hippocampal tissues. Hippocampal morphology was examined via Nissl staining. In vitro, rat hippocampal neuron cell lines were treated with ERK1/2 inhibitors SCH772984 and probenecid. Western blot, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemical staining, and RT-qPCR assessed TRPV2 expression, neurogenesis-related proteins, synaptic markers, and ERK1/2-CREB-BDNF signaling proteins. Results: Decreased hippocampal TRPV2 levels were observed in CUMS rats. Probenecid treatment mitigated depressive-like behavior and enhanced hippocampal 5-HT, NE, and DA levels in CUMS rats. TRPV2 activation countered CUMS-induced synaptic plasticity inhibition. Probenecid activated the ERK1/2-CREB-BDNF pathway, suggesting TRPV2's involvement in this pathway via ERK1/2. Conclusion: These findings indicate that TRPV2 activation offers protective effects against depressive-like behaviors and enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity in CUMS rats via the ERK1/2-CREB-BDNF pathway. TRPV2 emerges as a potential therapeutic target for depression.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that seriously threatens the quality of life of the elderly. Its pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated. Ferroptosis, a cell death caused by excessive accumulation of iron -dependent lipid peroxides, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Uncontrolled lipid peroxidation is the core process of ferroptosis, and inhibiting lipid peroxidation of ferroptosis may be an important therapeutic target for AD. Based on previous studies, we mixed standards of icariin, astragaloside IV, and puerarin, named the standard mixture YHG, and investigated the effect of YHG on ferroptosis -lipid peroxidation in APP/PS1 mice. DFX, a ferroptosis inhibitor, was used as a control drug. In this study, APP/PS1 mice were used as an AD animal model, and behavioral experiments, iron level detection, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, lipid peroxidation level detection, antioxidant capacity detection, immunofluorescence, Western blot and realtime qPCR were performed. It was found that YHG could reduce body weight, significantly improve abnormal behaviors and the ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons in APP/PS1 mice. The results of biochemical tests showed that YHG reduced the contents of iron, malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid peroxide (LPO) in brain tissue and serum, and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH). Immunofluorescence, WesternBlot and real-time qPCR results showed that YHG could promote the expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Inhibited the expression of long -chain acyllipid coenzyme a synthetase 4(ACSL4) and lysophosphatidyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3). This study suggests that the mechanism by which YHG improves cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice may be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis-lipid peroxidation.

AB  - Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a critical role in neuronal damage in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Evidence shows that voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels regulate microglial activation. We previously reported that copper dyshomeostasis causes neuronal injury via activating microglia. This study was designed to explore the role of Kv1.1 channels in copper-evoked microglial neuroinflammation. BV-2 microglial cells were treated with Cu(II). DiBAC4(3) was used to measure membrane potential. Microglial activation and neuronal loss were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and immunostaining. Learning and memory function was assessed with Morris water maze task. Cu(II) caused a hyperpolarized membrane potential in microglial cells, an effect abolished by functional Kv1.1 blockade. Blockade of Kv1.1 and knock-down of Kv1.1 with small interfering RNA repressed Cu(II)-induced microglial production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Also, Kv1.1 inhibition attenuated activation of PI3K/Akt-ERK1/2 signaling pathway and production of mitochondrial reactive oxidative species as well as nuclear factor-kappa B activation in Cu(II)-stimulated microglia. Moreover, the Cu(II)-caused, microglia-mediated neurotoxicity (indicated by reduced neuronal survival and increased dendritic loss) was attenuated by Kv1.1 knock-down. In an in vivo mouse model, hippocampal injection of Cu(II) caused elevated Kv1.1 mRNA (but not other Kv1 channels) expression and enhanced microglial Kv1.1 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. Furthermore, blockade of Kv1.1 attenuated Cu(II)-induced microglial activation and neuronal dendritic loss in the hippocampus and learning and memory dysfunction. These findings suggest that inhibition of Kv1.1 ameliorates Cu(II)-induced microglial activation and cognitive impairment. Thus, it might represent a potential molecular target for antiinflammatory therapy of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - The role of oxidative stress in the initiation and progress of epilepsy is well established. Proanthocyanidins (PACs), a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, have been reported to possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological and therapeutic properties against oxidative stress. However, the protective effects of proanthocyanidins against epilepsy have not been clarified. In the present study, we used the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced epilepsy mouse model to explore whether proanthocyanidins could help to reduce oxidative stress and protect against epilepsy. Mice were allocated into four groups (n = 14 per each group): control, PTZ (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), PACs + PTZ (200 mg/kg, p.o.) and sodium valproate (VPA) + PTZ (200 mg/kg, p.o.). PTZ injection caused oxidative stress in the hippocampal tissue as represented by the elevated lipid peroxidation and NO synthesis and increased expression of iNOS. Furthermore, depleted levels of anti-oxidants, GSH, GR, GPx, SOD, and CAT also indicate that oxidative stress was induced in mice exposed to PTZ. Additionally, a state of neuroinflammation was recorded following the developed seizures. Moreover, neuronal apoptosis was recorded following the development of epileptic convulsions as confirmed by the elevated Bax and caspase-3 and the decreased Bcl2 protein. Moreover, AChE activity, DA, NE, 5-HT, brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and gene expression of Nrf2 have decreased in the hippocampal tissue of PTZ exposed mice. However, pre-treatment of mice with PACs protected against the generation of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation in the PTZ exposed mice brain as the biomarkers for all these conditions was bought to control levels. In addition, the gene expression of Nrf2 was significantly upregulated following PACs treatment. These results suggest that PACs can ameliorate oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway in PTZ induced seizures in mice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by clinical symptoms of memory and cognitive deficiencies. Postmortem evaluation of AD brain tissue shows proteinopathy that closely associate with the progression of this dementing disorder, including the accumulation of extracellular beta amyloid (A beta) and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Current therapies targeting A beta have limited clinical efficacy and life-threatening side effects and highlight the need for alternative treatments targeting pTau and other pathophysiologic mechanisms driving AD pathogenesis. The brain's extracellular matrices (ECM), particularly perineuronal nets (PNNs), play a crucial role in brain functioning and neurocircuit stability, and reorganization of these unique PNN matrices has been associated with the progression of AD and accumulation of pTau in humans. We hypothesize that AD-associated changes in PNNs may in part be driven by the accumulation of pTau within the brain. In this work, we investigated whether the presence of pTau influenced PNN structural integrity and PNN chondroitin sulfate-glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) compositional changes in two transgenic mouse models expressing tauopathy-related AD pathology, PS19 (P301S) and Tau4RTg2652 mice. We show that PS19 mice exhibit an age-dependent loss of hippocampal PNN CS-GAGs, but not the underlying aggrecan core protein structures, in association with pTau accumulation, gliosis, and neurodegeneration. The loss of PNN CS-GAGs were linked to shifts in CS-GAG sulfation patterns to favor the neuroregenerative isomer, 2S6S-CS. Conversely, Tau4RTg2652 mice exhibit stable PNN structures and normal CS-GAG isomer composition despite robust pTau accumulation, suggesting a critical interaction between neuronal PNN glycan integrity and neighboring glial cell activation. Overall, our findings provide insights into the complex relationship between PNN CS-GAGs, pTau pathology, gliosis, and neurodegeneration in mouse models of tauopathy, and offer new therapeutic insights and targets for AD treatment.

AB  - Objective: Obesity, which has become one of the main health problems, results from irregular and unhealthy nutrition. In particular, an increase in the intake of high-fat foods leads to obesity and associated disorders. It is noteworthy to specify that obese individuals have memory problems. This study aims to examine the effects of high-fat diet on hippocampus, with stereological, histopathological methods and STRING bioinformatic tool. Methods: Female Adult Sprague Dawley rats (n = 20) were equally divided into control (CONT) and high-fat diet (HFD) groups. The control group was given standard rat pellet feed, while the high-fat diet group was fed with a 40 % fat content for 2 months. Following the feeding program, rats were sacrificed. The collected blood samples were analyzed biochemically to determine the level of oxidative stress while performing a stereological and histopathological examination of the brain tissues. Functional protein-protein networks for BDNF, C-Fos, CAT, LPO, SOD and MPO by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were evaluated.
   Findings: The number of neurons decreased in the HFD group compared to the CONT group. Damage to the histological structure of the hippocampus region; such as degenerate neurons, damaged mitochondria and extended cisterns of the endoplasmic reticulum was observed. Although C-Fos level and oxidative stress parameters increased in HFD group, BDNF level decreased. While BDNF and C-Fos were observed in pathways related to neuron death, oxidative stress and memory, BDNF was pronounced in the mitochondria, and C-Fos in the endoplasmic reticulum.
   Discussion: This study shows that changes in both BDNF and C-Fos levels in obesity due to high-fat diet increase oxidative stress and cause neuron damage in the hippocampus.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is a significant factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of tau cleaved at Asp421 by caspase-3 leads to mitochondrial abnormalities and bioenergetic impairment. However, the underlying mechanism behind these alterations and their impact on neuronal function remains unknown. To investigate the mechanism behind mitochondrial dysfunction caused by this tau form, we used transient transfection and pharmacological approaches in immortalized cortical neurons and mouse primary hippocampal neurons. We assessed mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics function after expression of full-length tau and caspase-3-cleaved tau. We also evaluated the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and its conformation as a possible mechanism to explain mitochondrial impairment induced by caspase-3 cleaved tau. Our studies showed that pharmacological inhibition of mPTP by cyclosporine A (CsA) prevented all mitochondrial length and bioenergetics abnormalities in neuronal cells expressing caspase-3 cleaved tau. Neuronal cells expressing caspase-3-cleaved tau showed sustained mPTP opening which is mostly dependent on cyclophilin D (CypD) protein expression. Moreover, the impairment of mitochondrial length and bioenergetics induced by caspase-3-cleaved tau were prevented in hippocampal neurons obtained from CypD knock-out mice. Interestingly, previous studies using these mice showed a prevention of mPTP opening and a reduction of mitochondrial failure and neurodegeneration induced by AD. Therefore, our findings showed that caspase-3-cleaved tau negatively impacts mitochondrial bio-energetics through mPTP activation, highlighting the importance of this channel and its regulatory protein, CypD, in the neuronal damage induced by tau pathology in AD.

AB  - Background The existence of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) causes tumor relapses, metastasis and resistance to conventional therapy in breast cancer. NDR1 kinase, a component of the Hippo pathway, plays important roles in multiple biological processes. However, its role in cancer stem cells has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of NDR1 in modulating BCSCs. Methods The apoptosis was detected by Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. BCSCs were detected by CD24/44 or ALDEFLUOR staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. The proliferation ability of BCSCs was evaluated by sphere formation assay. The expression of interested proteins was detected by western blot analysis. The expression of HES-1 and c-MYC was detected by real-time PCR. Notch1 signaling activation was detected by luciferase reporter assay. Protein interaction was evaluated by immunoprecipitation. Protein degradation was evaluated by ubiquitination analysis. The clinical relevance of NDR1 was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Results NDR1 regulates apoptosis and drug resistance in breast cancer cells. The upregulation of NDR1 increases CD24(low)/CD44(high) or ALDEFLUOR(high) population and sphere-forming ability in SUM149 and MCF-7 cells, while downregulation of NDR1 induces opposite effects. NDR1 increased the expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) and activated the transcription of its downstream target (HES-1 and c-MYC). Critically, both suppression of Notch pathway activation by DAPT treatment or downregulation of Notch1 expression by shRNA reverses NDR1 enhanced BCSC properties. Mechanically, NDR1 interactes with both NICD or Fbw7 in a kinase activity-independent manner. NDR1 reduces the proteolytic turnover of NICD by competing with Fbw7 for NICD binding, thereby leading to Notch pathway activation. Furthermore, NDR1 might function as a hub to modulate IL-6, TNF-alpha or Wnt3a induced activation of Notch1 signaling pathway and enrichment of breast cancer stem cells. Moreover, we find that the elevation of NDR1 expression predictes poor survival (OS, RFS, DMFS and PPS) in breast cancer. Conclusion Our study revealed a novel function of NDR1 in regulating BCSC properties by activating the Notch pathway. These data might provide a potential strategy for eradicating BCSC to overcome tumor relapses, metastasis and drug resistance.

AB  - As the use of plastic-containing materials in our daily lives becomes increasingly common, exposure to nano -plastics accordingly becomes inevitable. Micro and nanoplastics released from large amounts of plastic waste constitute a serious environmental problem. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of polystyrene nanoplastic (PS-NP) on the hippocampus.Material and method: Thirty Wistar albino rats, 15 male and 15 female, aged 6-8 weeks, were used in the research. These were randomly divided into three groups of five males and five females each. A five-minute open field test was applied to all rats on the first and last days of the study. Three groups of rats (Control, NP1 and NP2) received the standard chow and water. Additionally, rats in the first neoplastic group (NP1) received 25 mg/kg PS-NP and rats in the second nanoplastic group (NP2) received 50 mg/kg PS-NP, at the same time each day by oral gavage. The rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia at the end of four weeks. The hippocampi were removed and subjected to histopathological and biochemical analyses.Results: Green fluorescent dots were detected in the hippocampi of both dose groups receiving nanoplastics (NPs) administered orally to female and male rats. Histopathological examination revealed neuronal degeneration in the hippocampi of male and female rats from both dose groups. However, while no significant difference was observed among the groups in terms of changes in antioxidant enzyme values and open-field test data in male rats, significant differences in peroxidase (POD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) values and fecal boli and grooming numbers were determined in female rats exposed to NPs. In conclusion, exposure to NP substances extend as far as the hippocampus, causing neuronal damage and behavioral problems.

AB  - 3-benzyl-5-((2-nitrophenoxy) methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3 H)-one (3BDO) is a mTOR agonist that inhibits autophagy. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 3BDO on seizure and cognitive function by autophagy regulation in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindled epileptic mice model. The PTZ-kindled epileptic mice model was used in study. The behavioral changes and electroencephalogram (EEG) of the mice in each group were observed. The cognitive functions were tested by Morris water maze test. The loss of hippocampal neurons was detected by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunofluorescence analysis. Immunohistochemistry, western blot and q-PCR were employed to detect the expression of autophagy-related proteins and mTOR in the hippocampus and cortex. Less seizures, increased hippocampal neurons and reduced astrocytes of hippocampus were observed in the 3BDO-treated epileptic mice than in the PTZ-kindled epileptic mice. Morris water maze test results showed that 3BDO significantly improved the cognitive function of the PTZ-kindled epileptic mice. Western blot analyses and q-PCR revealed that 3BDO inhibited the expression of LC3, Beclin-1, Atg5, Atg7 and p-ULK1/ULK1, but increased that of p-mTOR/mTOR, p-P70S6K/P70S6K in the hippocampus and temporal lobe cortex of epileptic mice. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence also showed 3BDO inhibited the LC3 expression and increased the mTOR expression in the hippocampus of epileptic mice. In addition, the autophagy activator EN6 reversed the decrease in the 3BDO-induced autophagy and aggravated the seizures and cognitive dysfunction in the epileptic mice. 3BDO regulates autophagy by activating the mTOR signaling pathway in PTZ-kindled epileptic mice model, thereby alleviating hippocampus neuronal loss and astrocytes proliferation, reducing seizures and effectively improving cognitive function. Therefore, 3BDO may have potential value in the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Background: Oxaliplatin is the first-line chemotherapy for patients with colon cancer (CC). However, its resistance limits its therapeutic efficacy. Methods: Oxaliplatin resistance-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the GSE42387 and GSE227315 datasets were identified through bioinformatics methods. Functional experiments were conducted both in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the roles of laminin subunit alpha 3 (LAMA3) in drug resistance and tumorigenesis. The downstream molecular mechanisms were explored using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis and western blot. Results: Six hub genes associated with oxaliplatin resistance were identified, including LAMB3, ITGA3, COL4A6, COL12A1, LAMA3, and LAMC2, all of which were highly expressed in oxaliplatin-resistant CC cell lines. LAMA3 knockdown sensitized CC cells to oxaliplatin treatment, resulting in further inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as an increase in apoptosis in CC cells. Additionally, LAMA3 knockdown promoted the therapeutic efficacy of oxaliplatin in the CC xenograft tumor models. Mechanistically, overexpression of YAP notably counteracted the enhanced sensitivity to oxaliplatin caused by LAMA3 knockdown, indicating that LAMA3 modulates oxaliplatin sensitivity in CC through the Hippo-YAP pathway. Conclusion: LAMA3 knockdown promotes CC sensitivity to oxaliplatin via modulating the Hippo-YAP pathway, providing new therapeutic targets for the CC treatment.

AB  - In cartilaginous fish, the immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNAR) is naturally devoid of light chains. The variable regions of IgNAR (VNARs) are solely responsible for antigen recognition, similar to VHHs (variable domain of the heavy chain of heavy-chain antibodies) in camelids. Although VNARs have attracted growing interest, generating VNARs against membrane proteins remains challenging. Furthermore, the structure of a VNAR in complex with a membrane protein has not yet been reported. This study features a membrane protein, Chlorella virus hyaluronan synthase (CvHAS), and provides a comprehensive methodological approach to generate its specific shark VNARs, addressing several major concerns and important optimizations. We showed that shark physiological urea pressure was tolerable for CvHAS, and indirect immobilization was strongly preferred over passive adsorption for membrane proteins. Together with optimizations to improve mononuclear cell (MC) viability and VNAR expression efficiency, we successfully generated S2F6, a CvHAS-specific VNAR with nM-level high affinity. The structure of the CvHAS-S2F6 complex was then determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), reporting the first membrane protein and VNAR complex structure. It shows that S2F6 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CvHAS, with a different epitope than the reported CvHAS-specific VHHs. This study provides valuable insights into developing VNARs for membrane proteins and their applications in structural biology.

AB  - Background: Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) causes excessive activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAr), leading to cortical and hippocampal neuron death. As opposite, enteroviral meningitis is more frequently benign. The kynurenine (KYN) pathway is the major catabolic route of tryptophan (TRP) and some of its metabolites are agonists or antagonists of NMDAr.Methods: In order to investigate the pathogen-specific patterns of KYN pathway modulation in the central nervous system of children with acute meningococcal (MM), pneumococcal (PM) or enteroviral (VM) meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of TRP, KYN, kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QUINA) were evaluated by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (uHPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry. In addition, CSF levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-& alpha; were quantified by multi-analyte flow assay. The data was mined and in-tegrated using statistical and machine learning methods.Results: The three forms of meningitis investigated herein up-regulated the neurotoxic branch of the KYN pathway within the intrathecal space. However, this response, represented by the concentration of QUINA, was six and nine times higher in PM patients compared to MM or VM, respectively. CSF levels of IL-6, TNF-& alpha;, and IL-10 were increased in MM and PM patients when compared to controls. In VM, CSF IL-6 and IL-10, but not TNF-& alpha; were increased compared to controls, although not reaching the high levels found in bacterial meningitis. No correlation was found between the concentrations or the ratios of any pair of KYN metabolites and any cytokine or standard cytochemical parameter tested.Conclusions: CNS infection with meningococci, pneumococci, and enteroviruses intrathecally activate the KYN pathway, favoring its neurotoxic branch. However, in PM, higher CSF levels of QUINA, compared to MM and VM, may contribute to its poorer neurologic outcome.

Finally, the effects of the predicted biogenesis pathway on the biological functions of A549/DDP cells were verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Result: The differentially transcribed genes of A549 and A549/DDP cells were analyzed by enrichment analysis and cell biological characteristics detection. The results showed that A549/DDP cells showed significantly increased resistance to cisplatin, glucose metabolism signaling pathway and glycolysis levels compared with A549 cells. Among glycolysis-related transcription genes, PKM had the most significant difference Fold Change is 8. LncRNA PCIF1 is a new marker of A549/DDP cells and can be used as a molecular sponge to regulate the expression of PKM. LncRNA PCIF1 targets miR-326 to induce PKM expression, promote glycolysis level, and enhance the resistance of A549/DDP cells to cisplatin. Conclusion: LncRNA PCIF1 as biomarkers of A549/DDP cells, higher expression can induce the PKM, promote cell glycolysis, lead to the occurrence of cisplatin resistance. LncRNA PCIF1 can be considered as a potential target for treating cisplatin-resistant NSCLC.

AB  - In this work, the effect of NiB on densification, phase, microstructure, distortion and mechanical properties of conventionally sintered ternary 90W-6Ni-4Co heavy alloy has been investigated without altering (Ni +NiB)/Co ratio. No intermetallic phase was detected in the heavy alloys upon addition of NiB. Instead, the partial and complete exchange of Ni with NiB in 90W-6Ni-4Co has elicited relatively better densification (> 99% theoretical), higher bulk hardness (HV3 similar to 389-396 VHN), higher hardness of matrix (similar to 352 HV0.025) when the alloys were sintered at 1500 degrees C. In addition to W grains and matrix, the completely NiB-sub-stituted heavy alloy (90W-6NiB-4Co) sintered at 1500 degrees C exhibits the occurrence of W-rich third phase which contains similar to 75 wt% of W. Although the samples prevented slumping at 1475 degrees C, elephant foot formation was found inevitable in the base composition (90W-6Ni-4Co) when sintering was carried out at 1500 degrees C. However, the decreased distortion parameter (from 24.8 to 8.5) with optimal NiB addition affirms the enhanced shape retention capability of 90W-3Ni-3NiB-4Co and 90W-6NiB-4Co heavy alloys. Room temperature compression test of WHAs sintered at 1475 degrees C was performed at a fixed strain rate of 0.1 s(-1). No crack formation was observed in NiB containing samples up to 40% deformation. Moreover, the systematic addition of 3-6 wt% NiB resulted in lower coefficient of thermal expansion of NiB-containing heavy alloys in the temperature range of 400-600 degrees C.

AB  - Neuronal cell death remains the principal pathophysiologic hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases and the main challenge for treatment strategies. Thioredoxin1 (Trx1) is a major cytoplasmic thiol oxidoreductase protein involved in redox signaling, hence a crucial player in maintaining neuronal health. Trx1 levels are notably reduced in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, however, the impact of this decrease on neuronal physiology remains largely unexplored. This is mainly due to the nature of Trx1 redox regulatory role which is afforded by a rapid electron transfer to its oxidized protein substrates. During this reaction, Trx1 forms a transient bond with the oxidized disulfide bond in the substrate. This is a highly fast reaction which makes the identification of Trx1 substrates a technically challenging task. In this project, we utilized a transgenic mouse model expressing a Flag-tagged mutant form of Trx1 that can form stable disulfide bonds with its substrates, hence allowing identification of the Trx1 target proteins. Autophagy is a vital housekeeping process in neurons that is critical for degradation of damaged proteins under oxidative stress conditions and is interrupted in neurodegenerative diseases. Given Trx1's suggested involvement in autophagy, we aimed to identify potential Trx1 substrates following pharmacologic induction of autophagy in primary cortical neurons. Treatment with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, significantly reduced neurite outgrowth and caused cytoskeletal alterations. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we have identified 77 Trx1 target proteins associated with a wide range of cellular functions including cytoskeletal organization and neurodegenerative diseases. Focusing on neuronal cytoskeleton organization, we identified a novel interaction between Trx1 and RhoB which was confirmed in genetic models of Trx1 downregulation in primary neuronal cultures and HT22 mouse immortalized hippocampal neurons. The applicability of these findings was also tested against the publicly available proteomic data from Alzheimer's patients. Our study uncovers a novel role for Trx1 in regulating neuronal cytoskeleton organization and provides a mechanistic explanation for its multifaceted role in the physiology and pathology of the nervous system, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent type of liver cancer, and CD24 gene is reportedly involved in HCC progression. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of CD24 in HCC remain unclear. In this study, we established a primary HCC mouse model and observed that CD24, induced by inactivation of the Hippo pathway, was highly expressed in HCC. Using a systematic molecular and genomic approach, we identified the HippoYAP1-SOX4 pathway as the mechanism through which YAP1 induces CD24 upregulation in HCC cells. CD24 knockdown significantly attenuated YAP1 activation-induced HCC. These findings shed light on the link between CD24 and HCC progression, particularly in the Hippo-inactivated subclass of HCC. Therefore, CD24 may serve as a potential target for specific treatment of this HCC subclass.

AB  - AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ion channel tetramers that mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission. They are composed of four subunits (GluA1-GluA4); the GluA2 subunit dominates AMPAR function throughout the forebrain. Its extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) determines receptor localization at the synapse, ensuring reliable synaptic transmission and plasticity. This synaptic anchoring function requires a compact NTD tier, stabilized by a GluA2-specific NTD interface. Here we show that low pH conditions, which accompany synaptic activity, rupture this interface. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that protonation of an interfacial histidine residue (H208) centrally contributes to NTD rearrangement. Moreover, in stark contrast to their canonical compact arrangement at neutral pH, GluA2 cryo-electron microscopy structures exhibit a wide spectrum of NTD conformations under acidic conditions. We show that the consequences of this pH-dependent conformational control are twofold: rupture of the NTD tier slows recovery from desensitized states and increases receptor mobility at mouse hippocampal synapses. Therefore, a proton-triggered NTD switch will shape both AMPAR location and kinetics, thereby impacting synaptic signal transmission.
   Combining patch-clamp electrophysiology, molecular dynamics simulations, cryo-electron microscopy and imaging of neuronal synapses, the authors reveal how AMPA glutamate receptors are regulated by protons that are released from synaptic vesicles during signal transmission.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is a key factor in cognitive and behavioral changes seen in patients with non-CNS cancers, and cytokine levels in the blood are often used as a proxy for brain inflammation. However, this approach has yielded inconsistent results, and a common inflammatory signature remains elusive. To explore whether a bloodto-brain inflammatory signature exists across breast cancer types, we assessed cytokine and glial protein responses in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and their relationship to serum cytokines in mice bearing three different mammary cancers (n = 40). While cytokine profiles in both serum and brain varied by cancer type, IL-1 beta and IL-4 were consistently altered across brain regions. In some cases, elevated serum IL-1 alpha and IL-6 correlated with increased hippocampal IL-6. These findings support the use of blood cytokines to identify cancer patients at risk for cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities. However, our data also suggest that relying solely on serum cytokines may lead to under-diagnosis, as some mice exhibited brain cytokine elevations without changes in serum levels. This underscores the need for a broader range of inflammatory markers in blood to better identify at-risk patients. Brain region-specific differences in the cytokine response to mammary cancer highlighted the hippocampus as more vulnerable to cancer-induced inflammation than the PFC. We observed regionspecific glial cell reactivity, however, only astrocyte and oligodendrocyte markers were correlated with cytokine changes within the hippocampus. Elevated serum IL-1 alpha and IL-6 were correlated with reduced cortical astrocyte reactivity, suggesting that these cytokines can inform glial cell-specific changes in this region.

AB  - Camellia seed oil (CSO), extracted from Camellia seeds, contains numerous beneficial bioactive components. While the majority of produced CSO is utilized in food applications, its use in life sciences and health fields remains relatively limited. To expand its applications, this study investigated the potential anti-inflammatory activity of CSO and its underlying molecular mechanism through zebrafish and cellular models. The results demonstrated that CSO promotes neutrophil migration in zebrafish, inhibits oxidative damage occurrence, and enhances repair of damaged caudal fins. Furthermore, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages, CSO suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation and prevented the reduction in phagocytic capacity. Additionally, analysis revealed that five-year stored Camellia seed oil (FYSCSO) exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity compared to newly produced oil, which may be attributed to increased linoleic acid content and decreased oleic acid content. Mechanistic studies have shown that CSO possesses significant anti-inflammatory properties mediated through activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. This study advances understanding of CSO's biological functions and molecular mechanisms, providing foundational insights for its development in life and health applications.

AB  - Targeted therapy is an effective and appropriate approach with low side effects in cancer therapy compared with other treatment approaches. Epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR, is a favorable biomarker as targeted therapy because it overexpresses in several cancers. Monoclonal antibodies are common agents for targeted therapy. Nanobody is the smallest format of monoclonal antibodies with unique properties that include hiding epitope targeting, high stability, low production cost, and ease of connection to other components. The main challenge in targeted therapy by monoclonal antibodies is their immunogenicity due to their non-human nature. In this study, we designed, constructed, and evaluated a novel humanized anti- EGFR biparatopic nanobody, hu7CG2. The hu7CG2 was designed by grafting the complementarity-determining regions of two camelid anti- EGFR nanobodies known as 7C12 and EG2 to a universal scaffold and then connected with a glycine-serine linker. The results of antigen-binding activity and cell viability assays showed that the hu7CG2 inhibited the growth of EGFR overexpression tumor cells. The data showed that hu7CG2 might be a useful tool in the targeting and treatment of tumor cells.

AB  - Depression is considered to be the most common mental disorder and is probed by several studies that chronic mild stress contributes to depression, and fortunately, most antidepressants ameliorate depressive-like behavior accompanied with reversed hippocampal neurogenesis defects. In our present study, we confirmed that different antidepressants repaired the stress induced neuronal and behavioral deficits by modulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Antidepressant treatment restored the adult hippocampal neurodegeneration, which was impaired by chronic unpredicted mild stress displaying decreased proliferation and neuronal differentiation but increased apoptosis of newly formed neurons in dentate gyrus. Notably, sucrose preference ratio significantly correlated with both neuronal differentiation proportion and newborn apoptosis proportion, suggesting a mechanistic relationship between neurogenesis and behavior. Indeed, the neotype TREK-1 potassium channel blocker expressed an earlier and pronounced antidepressant manifestation compared to the traditional selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine. We therefore conclude that the administration of TREK-1 potassium channel antagonism can reverse the depressive deficits caused by chronic stress quickly via regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Overexposure to manganese (Mn) or iron (Fe) may lead to neurological damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subchronic Mn and Fe exposure, alone or in combination, on the distribution of other elements and the relationship between Mn and Fe levels in whole blood and brain. Forty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into control, Mn-exposed, Fe-exposed, and combined Mn-Fe-exposed groups, with 10 rats assigned randomly to each group. The control, Mn-exposed, Fe-exposed group and the combined Mn-Fe-exposed groups were injected intraperitoneally with equal amounts of saline, 5 mg/kg MnCl2, 20 mg/kg FeSO4 or 5 mg/kg MnCl2+20 mg/kg FeSO4 once a day, 5 days a week for 8 weeks. The levels of Mn, Fe and other metallic elements [including barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), strontium (Sr), antimony (Sb), lead (Pb), vanadium (V) and copper (Cu)] in whole blood and brain tissue (including the globus pallidus, hippocampus, striatum and substantia nigra) were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results of this study show that, in whole blood, Mn levels were increased (p < 0.05) in the Mn-exposed group, Fe levels were decreased in both the Fe-exposed (p < 0.05) and Mn-exposed groups (p < 0.01), and Sb levels were increased in both the Mn-exposed and combined Mn-Fe-exposed groups (p < 0.05). In the substantia nigra, the levels of Be (p < 0.01), Sr (p < 0.05), and Cu (p < 0.001) were increased in the Fe-exposed group; the levels of Cu were also significantly increased in the Mn-exposed group (p < 0.01) and the combined Mn-Fe-exposed group (p < 0.0001); the levels of V were decreased (p < 0.05) in the combined Mn-Fe-exposed group; and the levels of V were decreased in the Fe-exposed group (p < 0.01 ), Mn-exposed group (p < 0.05) and combined Mn-Fe-exposed group (p < 0.001) had decreased Ba levels. In the pallidum, Fe levels were increased in the Mn-Fe co-exposed group (p < 0.0001); Ba (p < 0.01) and Pb (p < 0.05) levels were decreased in the Fe-exposed group; Ba (p < 0.05) levels were decreased in the Mn-exposed group; and Ba levels were increased in the Mn-Fe co-exposed group (p < 0.05). In the hippocampus, Mn (p < 0.01), Cu (p < 0.05), Sb (p < 0.01), and V (p < 0.05) levels were increased in the Fe-exposed group; Mn levels were increased in the Mn-exposed group (p < 0.01) and the combined Mn-Fe-exposed group (p < 0.0001). In the striatum, Be levels were decreased in the Mn-Fe combined exposure group (p < 0.05). Mn and Fe levels in whole blood and brain tissue can reflect the accumulation of Mn and Fe. These measurements can serve as valuable predictive biomarkers for subchronic Mn or Fe exposure and combined Mn-Fe exposure. The interactions between Mn and Fe and the distribution and abnormalities of the essential metal elements in the central nervous system and other organs need to be further investigated.

AB  - Camellia oleifera fruit shells are often discarded as byproducts in the C. oleifera industry. There is a general interest in isolating high-value natural products to valorize those fruit shells with green, rapid, and effective extraction methods. This study employed 43 combinations of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to extract polysaccharides from C. oleifera fruit shells. Two choline chloride-based DESs and a ternary DES with propionic acid and 1,3-butanediol as hydrogen bond donors exhibited relatively high extraction efficiency. The polysaccharide yield reached 15.03 +/- 0.35 % under optimized extraction time (55 min), extraction temperature (70 degrees C), and DES water content (33.33 %). The physicochemical composition and preliminary structure of obtained polysaccharides were characterized. Additionally, DESs-extracted polysaccharides exhibited higher in vitro antioxidant activities and hypoglycemic effects compared to water-extracted polysaccharides. These findings suggested that the optimized DES-assisted extraction method could be a potential approach for polysaccharides extraction from C. oleifera.

AB  - Objective Obesity has been identified as one of the most important risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. Physical exercise can ameliorate learning and memory deficits by reversing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we aimed to determine whether 8 weeks of treadmill exercise could alleviate hippocampus-dependent memory impairment in high-fat diet-induced obese mice and investigate the potential mechanisms involved. Methods A total of sixty 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice, weighing between 20-30 g, were randomly assigned to 3 distinct groups, each consisting of 20 mice. The groups were designated as follows: control (CON), high-fat diet (HFD), and high-fat diet with exercise (HFD-Ex). Prior to the initiation of the treadmill exercise protocol, the HFD and HFD-Ex groups were fed a high-fat diet (60% fat by kcal) for 20 weeks. The mice in the HFD-Ex group underwent treadmill exercise at a speed of 8 m/min for the first 10 min, followed by 12 m/min for the subsequent 50 min, totally 60 min of exercise at a 0 degrees slope, 5 d per week, for 8 weeks. We employed Y-maze and novel object recognition tests to assess hippocampusdependent memory and utilized immunofluorescence, Western blot, Golgi staining, and ELISA to analyze axon length, dendritic complexity, number of spines, the expression of c-fos, doublecortin (DCX), postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95), synaptophysin (Syn), interleukin-1(3 (IL-1(3), and the number of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) positive cells. Results Mice with HFD-induced obesity exhibit hippocampus-dependent memory impairment, and treadmill exercise can prevent memory decline in these mice. The expression of DCX was significantly decreased in the HFD-induced obese mice compared to the control group (P<0.001). Treadmill exercise increased the expression of c-fos (P<0.001) and DCX (P=0.001) in the hippocampus of the HFD-induced obese mice. The axon length (P<0.001), dendritic complexity (P<0.001), the number of spines (P<0.001) and the expression of PSD95 (P<0.001) in the hippocampus were significantly decreased in the HFD-induced obese mice compared to the control group. Treadmill exercise increased the axon length (P=0.002), dendritic complexity (P<0.001), the number of spines (P<0.001) and the expression of PSD95 (P=0.001) of the hippocampus in the HFD-induced obese mice. Our study found a significant increase in MHC-II positive cells (P<0.001) and the concentration of IL-1(3 (P<0.001) in the hippocampus of HFD-induced obese mice compared to the control group. Treadmill exercise was found to reduce the number of MHC-II positive cells (P<0.001) and the concentration of IL-1(3 (P<0.001) in the hippocampus of obese mice induced by a HFD. Conclusion Treadmill exercise led to enhanced neurogenesis and neuroplasticity by increasing the axon length, dendritic complexity, dendritic spine numbers, and the expression of PSD95 and DCX, decreasing the number of MHC-II positive cells and neuroinflammation in HFD-induced obese mice. Therefore, we speculate that exercise may serve as a nonpharmacologic method that protects against HFD-induced hippocampus-dependent memory dysfunction by enhancing neuroplasticity and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of obese mice.

AB  - Sulforaphane (SFN), a potent nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activator, presents a potential role in improving Alzheimer's disease (AD)-specific symptoms. However, the regulation mechanism of SFN in AD is poorly understood. Here, we established AD models both in vitro and in vivo. Animal behaviors were tested by the Morris water maze test. The pathology of the hippocampus and the content of A beta were detected. SFN (40 mg kg(-1)) decreased the escape latency (24.96 +/- 7.43 s) and increased the target-zone frequency (3.19 +/- 1.19) in rats. SFN improved the pathological morphology and the number of neurons in the hippocampus. Additionally, SFN significantly upregulated the contents of thioredoxin and glutathione as well as the activities of antioxidant enzymes, along with the expression of the Nrf2 protein. Conversely, SFN lowered the A beta content and ROS level in N2a/APP cells. After silencing the Nrf2 by SiRNA, the inhibitory effects of SFN on ROS and A beta production were partially weakened. In conclusion, the improvement of AD by SFN was closely related with Nrf2 activation.

T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
KW  - BDNF
AB  - Long-term consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) can cause glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, damage the brain and nervous system and result in cognitive impairment. The objective of this study was to investigate the preventative effects of Lactobacillus paracasei (Jlus66, a probiotic extracted from cheese in Northeast China) on cognitive impairment associated with HFD. The water maze was used to compare memory changes in mice fed HFD with or without Jlus66. Hippocampal tissue morphology was examined using H&E staining. The expression of neurotrophic factors BDNF, PSD95 and SNAP25, insulin resistance related proteins IRS-1, AKT and GSK3 beta, and inflammatory related proteins JNK and p38 were detected using western blotting. The results showed that Jlus66 significantly increased the expression of BDNF, PSD95 and SNAP25 (p < 0.01, respectively), increased expression of p-AKT (p < 0.05), p-IRS-1Y(612) and p-GSK3 beta (p < 0.01, respectively), and reduced the expression of p-IRS-1S(307), p-JNK and p-p38 (p < 0.05) compared with the HFD group. We conclude that Jlus66 can ameliorate cognitive impairment via insulin signaling and neuroinflammation pathways.

AB  - Under physiological conditions, the energetic demand of the brain is met by glucose oxidation. However, ample evidence suggests that lactate produced by astrocytes through aerobic glycolysis may also be an oxidative fuel, highlighting the metabolic compartmentalization between neural cells. Herein, we investigate the roles of glucose and lactate in oxidative metabolism in hippocampal slices, a model that preserves neuron-glia interactions. To this purpose, we used high-resolution respirometry to measure oxygen consumption (O-2 flux) at the whole tissue level and amperometric lactate microbiosensors to evaluate the concentration dynamics of extracellular lactate. We found that lactate is produced from glucose and transported to the extracellular space by neural cells in hippocampal tissue. Under resting conditions, endogenous lactate was used by neurons to support oxidative metabolism, which was boosted by exogenously added lactate even in the presence of excess glucose. Depolarization of hippocampal tissue with high K+ significantly increased the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, which was accompanied by a transient decrease in extracellular lactate concentration. Both effects were reverted by inhibition of the neuronal lactate transporter, monocarboxylate transporters 2 (MCT2), supporting the concept of an inward flux of lactate to neurons to fuel oxidative metabolism. We conclude that astrocytes are the main source of extracellular lactate which is used by neurons to fuel oxidative metabolism, both under resting and stimulated conditions.

AB  - Malfunction of astrocytic K+ regulation contributes to the breakdown of extracellular K+ homeostasis during ischemia and spreading depolarization events. Studying astroglial K+ changes is, however, hampered by a lack of suitable techniques. Here, we combined results from fluorescence imaging, ion-selective microelectrodes, and patch-clamp recordings in murine neocortical slices with the calculation of astrocytic [K+]. Brief chemical ischemia caused a reversible ATP reduction and a transient depolarization of astrocytes. Moreover, astrocytic [Na+] increased by 24 mM and extracellular [Na+] decreased. Extracellular [K+] increased, followed by an undershoot during recovery. Feeding these data into the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation revealed a baseline astroglial [K+] of 146 mM, an initial K+ loss by 43 mM upon chemical ischemia, and a transient K+ overshoot of 16 mM during recovery. It also disclosed a biphasic mismatch in astrocytic Na+/K+ balance, which was initially ameliorated, but later aggravated by accompanying changes in pH and bicarbonate, respectively. Altogether, our study predicts a loss of K+ from astrocytes upon chemical ischemia followed by a net gain. The overshooting K+ uptake will promote low extracellular K+ during recovery, likely exerting a neuroprotective effect. The resulting late cation/anion imbalance requires additional efflux of cations and/or influx of anions, the latter eventually driving delayed astrocyte swelling.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a devastating neonatal brain condition caused by lack of oxygen and limited blood flow. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a classic paradigm with a complex stimulation of physical, cognitive, and social components. EE can exert neuroplasticity and neuroprotective effects in immature brains. However, the exact mechanism of EE on the chronic condition of HIE remains unclear. HIE was induced by a permanent ligation of the right carotid artery, followed by an 8% O-2 hypoxic condition for 1 h. At 6 weeks of age, HIE mice were randomly assigned to either standard cages or EE cages. In the behavioral assessments, EE mice showed significantly improved motor performances in rotarod tests, ladder walking tests, and hanging wire tests, compared with HIE control mice. EE mice also significantly enhanced cognitive performances in Y-maze tests. Particularly, EE mice showed a significant increase in Ca-v 2.1 (P/Q type) and presynaptic proteins by molecular assessments, and a significant increase of Ca-v 2.1 in histological assessments of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These results indicate that EE can upregulate the expression of the Ca-v 2.1 channel and presynaptic proteins related to the synaptic vesicle cycle and neurotransmitter release, which may be responsible for motor and cognitive improvements in HIE.

AB  - Rare ginsenosides are the major components of red ginseng. However, there has been little research into the relationship between the structure of ginsenosides and their anti-inflammatory activity. In this work, BV-2 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or nigericin, the anti-inflammatory activity of eight rare ginsenosides, and the target proteins expression of AD were compared. In addition, the Morris water maze test, HE staining, thioflavins staining, and urine metabonomics were used to evaluate the effect of Rh4 on AD mice. Our results showed that their configuration influences the anti-inflammatory activity of ginsenosides. Ginsenosides Rk1, Rg5, Rk3, and Rh4 have significant anti-inflammatory activity compared to ginsenosides S-Rh1, R-Rh1, S-Rg3, and R-Rg3. Ginsenosides S-Rh1 and S-Rg3 have more pronounced anti-inflammatory activity than ginsenosides R-Rh1 and R-Rg3, respectively. Furthermore, the two pairs of stereoisomeric ginsenosides can significantly reduce the level of NLRP3, caspase-1, and ASC in BV-2 cells. Interestingly, Rh4 can improve the learning ability of AD mice, improve cognitive impairment, reduce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and A beta deposition, and regulate AD-related pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the sphingolipid metabolism. Our findings conclude that rare ginsenosides with a double bond have more anti-inflammatory activity than those without, and 20(S)-ginsenosides have more excellent anti-inflammatory activity than 20(R)-ginsenosides.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease, is the most common cause of dementia in humans worldwide. Although more in-depth research has been carried out on AD, the therapeutic effect of AD is not as expected, and natural active substances are increasingly sought after by scientists. In the present study, we evaluated two benzaldehydes from a coral-derived Aspergillus terreus strain C23-3, their anti-neuroinflammatory activity in microglia (BV-2), and their neuroprotective activity and mechanisms in hippocampal neuronal cells (HT-22). These include the protein expression of iNOS, COX-2, MAPKs pathways, Tau protein-related pathways, caspases family-related signaling pathways. They also include the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-18 and ROS, as well as the level of mitochondrial oxidative stress and neuronal cell apoptosis. The results showed that both benzaldehydes were effective in reducing the secretion of various inflammatory mediators, as well as pro-inflammatory factors. Among these, benzaldehyde 2 inhibited mitochondrial oxidative stress and blocked neuronal cell apoptosis through Tau protein-related pathways and caspases family-related signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting beta-amyloid (A beta)-induced neurological damage. This study reveals that benzaldehyde 2 has potential as a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease, and offers a new approach to the high-value use of marine natural products.

AB  - The yellowing process is the crucial step to form the characteristic sensory and chemical properties of yellow tea. To investigate the chemical changes and the associations with sensory traits during yellowing, yellow teas with different yellowing times (0-13 h) were prepared for sensory evaluation and chemical analysis. The intensities of umami and green-tea aroma were reduced whereas sweet taste, mellow taste and sweet aroma were increased under long-term yellowing treatment. A total of 230 chemical constituents were determined, among which 25 non-volatiles and 42 volatiles were the key chemical contributors to sensory traits based on orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA), multiple factor analysis (MFA) and multidimensional alignment (MDA) analysis. The decrease in catechins, flavonol glycosides and caffeine and the increase in certain amino acids contributed to the elevated sweet taste and mellow taste. The sweet, woody and herbal odorants and the fermented and fatty odorants were the key contributors to the characteristic sensory feature of yellow tea with sweet aroma and over-oxidation aroma, including 7 ketones, 5 alcohols, 1 aldehyde, 5 acids, 4 esters, 5 hydrocarbons, 1 phenolic compound and 1 sulfocompound. This study reveals the sensory trait-related chemical changes in the yellowing process of tea, which provides a theoretical basis for the optimization of the yellowing process and quality control of yellow tea.

AB  - We previously demonstrated that cullin 4B (CUL4B) upregulation was associated with worse outcomes of pleural mesothelioma (PM) patients, while the overexpression of its paralog CUL4A was not associated with clinical outcomes. Here, we aimed to identify the distinct roles of CUL4B and CUL4A in PM using an siRNA approach in PM cell lines (ACC Meso-1 and Mero82) and primary culture. The knockdown of CUL4B and CUL4A resulted in significantly reduced colony formation, increased cell death, and delayed cell proliferation. Furthermore, similar to the effect of CUL4A knockdown, downregulation of CUL4B led to reduced expression of Hippo pathway genes including YAP1, CTGF, and survivin. Interestingly, CUL4B and not CUL4A knockdown reduced TGF-beta 1 and MMP2 expression, suggesting a unique association of CUL4B with this pathway. However, the treatment of PM cells with exogenous TGF-beta 1 following CUL4B knockdown did not rescue PM cell growth. We further analyzed ACC Meso-1 xenograft tumor tissues treated with the cullin inhibitor, pevonedistat, which targets protein neddylation, and observed the downregulation of human TGF-beta 1 and MMP2. In summary, our data suggest that CUL4B overexpression is important for tumor cell growth and survival and may drive PM aggressiveness via the regulation of TGF-beta 1 expression and, furthermore, reveal a new mechanism of action of pevonedistat.

AB  - Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a post-translational modification of proteins by transferring poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) to acceptor proteins by the action of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Two tankyrase (TNKS) isoforms, TNK1 and TNK2 (TNKS1/2), are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and participate in diverse cellular functions, including wnt/beta-catenin signaling, telomere maintenance, glucose metabolism and mitosis regulation. For wnt/beta-catenin signaling, TNKS1/2 catalyze poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Axin, a key component of the beta-catenin degradation complex, which allows Axin's ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby activating beta-catenin signaling. In the present study, we focused on the functions of TNKS1/2 in neuronal development. In primary hippocampal neurons, TNKS1/2 were detected in the soma and neurites, where they co-localized with PAR signals. Treatment with XAV939, a selective TNKS1/2 inhibitor, suppressed neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. In addition, XAV939 also suppressed norepinephrine uptake in PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line. These effects likely resulted from the inhibition of beta-catenin signaling through the stabilization of Axin, which suggests TNKS1/2 enhance Axin degradation by modifying its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, thereby stabilizing wnt/beta-catenin signaling and, in turn, promoting neurite outgrowth and synapse formation.

LMS cell lines SK-LMS-1 and SK-UT-1 were used for both in vitro and in vivo analysis. Results showed that NT5DC2 is aberrantly upregulated in LMS. Its overexpression was associated with unfavourable survival. Deletion of NT5DC2 significantly reduced the expression of cyclin B1, cyclin A2, cyclin E1 and CDK1 and increased G1 phase arrest in LMS cell lines, and suppressed their proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. NT5DC2 interacted with unpalmitoylated TEAD4, and this association reduced TEAD4 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. TRIM27 is a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that induces K27/48-linked ubiquitination of unpalmitoylated TEAD4 at Lys278. TEAD4 inhibition significantly suppressed LMS cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Dual-luciferase assay demonstrated that TEAD4 could bind to the NT5DC2 promoter and activate its transcription. Based on these findings, we infer that the NT5DC2-TEAD4 positive feedback loop plays an important role in LMS development and might serve as a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - We studied the effects of stimulation of the medial septal area on the gene expression in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Rats under urethane anesthesia were implanted with a recording electrode in the right hippocampus and stimulating electrode in the dorsal medial septum (dMS) or medial septal nucleus (MSN). After one-hour-long deep brain stimulation, we collected ipsi- and contralateral dorsal and ventral hippocampi. Quantitative PCR showed that deep brain stimulation did not cause any changes in the intact contralateral dorsal and ventral hippocampi. A comparison of ipsi- and contralateral hippocampi in the control unstimulated animals showed that electrode implantation in the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus led to a dramatic increase in the expression of immediate early genes (c-fos, arc, egr1, npas4), neurotrophins (ngf, bdnf) and inflammatory cytokines (il1b and tnf, but not il6) not only in the area close to implantation site but also in the ventral hippocampus. Moreover, the stimulation of MSN but not dMS further increased the expression of c-fos, egr1, npas4, bdnf, and tnf in the ipsilateral ventral but not dorsal hippocampus. Our data suggest that the activation of medial septal nucleus can change the gene expression in ventral hippocampal cells after their priming by other stimuli.

AB  - (1) Background: The c-Jun-NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase involved in regulating physiological processes in the central nervous system. However, the dual genetic deletion of Mkk4 and Mkk7 (upstream activators of JNK) in adult mice is not reported. The aim of this study was to induce the genetic deletion of Mkk4/Mkk7 in adult mice and analyze their effect in hippocampal neurogenesis. (2) Methods: To achieve this goal, Actin-Cre(ERT2) (Cre(+/)(-)), Mkk4(flox/flox), Mkk7(flox/flox) mice were created. The administration of tamoxifen in these 2-month-old mice induced the gene deletion (Actin-Cre(ERT2) (Cre(+/-)), Mkk4( increment / increment ), Mkk7( increment / increment ) genotype), which was verified by PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry techniques. (3) Results: The levels of MKK4/MKK7 at 7 and 14 days after tamoxifen administration were not eliminated totally in CNS, unlike what happens in the liver and heart. These data could be correlated with the high levels of these proteins in CNS. In the hippocampus, the deletion of Mkk4/Mkk7 induced a misalignment position of immature hippocampal neurons together with alterations in their dendritic architecture pattern and maturation process jointly to the diminution of JNK phosphorylation. (4) Conclusion: All these data supported that the MKK4/MKK7-JNK pathway has a role in adult neurogenic activity.

AB  - Aims: This study aims to investigate whether melatonin (MLT) exerts protective effects against cognitive impairment following exertional heat stroke (EHS) by modulating ferroportin (Fpn) to alleviate hippocampal ferroptosis and neuroinflammation. Results: Following EHS, genes such as Mt1, Mt2, and Trf were notably upregulated in the hippocampal tissue, whereas genes such as Slc40a1 (encoding Fpn 1) and Il33 were downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis implicated ferroptosis as a dominant. MLT significantly ameliorated learning and memory deficits observed in EHS mice. This treatment also modulated ferroptosis markers, such as Fpn, xCT, ferritin H, and glutathione peroxidase 4, reduced hippocampal iron overload, and decreased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Furthermore, MLT treatment reduced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation and mitigated mitochondrial and neuronal damage in the hippocampal tissue. Strikingly, conditional Fpn knockout abolished MLT's benefits: Fpn-cKO + MLT mice showed persistent iron accumulation, elevated IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and failed cognitive recovery. Innovation: Our study reveals that MLT prevents EHS-induced neurodegeneration by enhancing Fpn-dependent iron efflux, a mechanism that concurrently resolves hippocampal iron overload, suppresses ferroptosis, and dampens neuroinflammation. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that MLT mitigates EHS-related cognitive impairment by restoring hippocampal iron homeostasis and suppressing neuroinflammation, primarily through Fpn-dependent mechanisms.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition in which amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques trigger oxidative stress (OS) and neuroinflammation, causing memory loss. OS and neurodegeneration can also be caused by reactive astrocytes, thereby promoting AD via toxic metabolite accumulation in the astrocytic urea cycle. However, the effect of molecular hydrogen (H2) on this cycle remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether H2 treatment could reduce OS-induced neurodegeneration and memory loss. 5xFAD (n = 14) and wild-type (n = 15) mice were randomized into four groups and treated with either 3% hydrogen gas (H2) or vehicle for 60 days. Cognitive behaviors were evaluated using the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. In addition, we used biochemical assays to measure ammonia and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in the hippocampi of the mice and A beta O-treated primary mouse astrocytes. A beta, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the expression of inflammatory markers were evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We observed that H2 treatment significantly prevented cognitive deficits, oxidative stress, the accumulation of toxic metabolites, and the increase in inflammatory markers in 5xFAD mice. These results suggest that H2 therapy can mitigate toxic metabolites in the astrocytic urea cycle, thereby reducing neurodegeneration and memory loss in AD.

AB  - Despite the known therapeutic uses of dexamethasone (DEX), the specific mechanisms underlying its neurotoxic effects in neuronal cells, particularly in undifferentiated human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells, remain inadequately understood. This study aims to elucidate these mechanisms, emphasizing bioenergetics, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, thereby providing novel insights into the cellular vulnerabilities induced by chronic DEX exposure. The findings revealed significant reductions in cell viability, altered membrane integrity with LDH leakage, decreased intracellular ATP production, and the electron transport chain complexes I and III activity inhibition. DEX significantly increased the release of the reactive species and peroxidation of lipids, as well as of Nrf2 expression. At the same time, it simultaneously led to a decline in the activities of the antioxidant catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes, along with a depletion of glutathione reserves. The apoptosis process was exhibited by a significant elevation of caspases 3 and 8 activities with overexpression of mRNA BAX, inhibition of BCL-2, and a significant upregulation of the BAX/BCL-2 ratio. Assessment of neuronal development genes (GAP43 , CAMK2A, CAMK2B, TUBB3, and Wnts) by quantitative PCR assay showed increased expression of CAMK2A, , CAMK2B, and Wnt3a with a significant reduction in GAP43 mRNA levels. Collectively, this study proved that DEX was cytotoxic to SH-SY5Y via bioenergetic disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a concern following anesthesia, particularly in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study compared the cognitive and pathological effects of propofol and remimazolam in a mouse model with AD following surgery. Five-month-old male ApoE4-KI mice underwent abdominal surgery under either propofol (170 mg/kg) or remimazolam (85 mg/kg) anesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze and Y-maze, and neuronal apoptosis and amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus were evaluated preoperatively and at 2, 4, and 7 days postoperatively. Both groups showed similar postoperative cognitive functions, with increased relative escape latency at day 2 and decreased relative spontaneous alternation at days 4 and 7. However, the neuropathological analysis revealed that propofol-induced significantly more neuronal death in the CA3 (days 4 and 7) and DG (days 2, 4, and 7), and greater A beta accumulation in the CA3 (days 2 and 4) and DG (days 2 and 7) compared to remimazolam (p < 0.05). Propofol was associated with more pronounced neuropathologic changes in the hippocampus compared to remimazolam. These findings suggest remimazolam may be a safer anesthetic for patients at risk for neurodegenerative disorders, as it is associated with less severe hippocampal pathology, which is characteristic of AD.

AB  - Oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) are related neuropeptides that exert a wide range of effects on general health, homeostasis, development, reproduction, adaptability, cognition, social and nonsocial behaviors. The two peptides are mainly of hypothalamic origin and execute their peripheral and central physiological roles via OXT and AVP receptors, which are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family. These receptors, largely distributed in the body, are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus, a brain region particularly vulnerable to stress exposure and various lesions. OXT and AVP have important roles in the hi ppocampus, by modulating important processes like neuronal excitability, network oscillatory activity, synaptic plasticity, and social recognition memory. This chapter includes an overview regarding OXT and AVP structure, synthesis, receptor distribution, and functions, focusing on their relationship with the hippocampus and mechanisms by which they influence hippocampal activity.

AB  - The rich and diverse phytoconstituents of wheatgrass have established it as a natural antioxidant and detoxifying agent. The anti-inflammatory potential of wheatgrass has been studied extensively. However, the neuroprotective potential of wheatgrass has not been studied in depth. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective response of wheatgrass against age-related scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice. Scopolamine is an established anticholinergic drug that demonstrates the behavioural and molecular characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. In the current study, wheatgrass extracts (prepared from 5 and 7 day old plantlets) were administered to scopolamine-induced memory deficit mice. The Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests demonstrated that wheatgrass treatment improves the behavior and simultaneously enhances the memory of amnesic mice. We further evaluated the expression of neuroinflammation related genes and proteins in the hippocampal region of mice. Wheatgrass significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of neuroprotective markers such as BDNF and CREB in scopolamine-induced mice. Simultaneously, wheatgrass also downregulated the expression of inflammatory markers such as TNF-alpha and tau genes in these mice. The treatment of scopolamine-induced memory impaired mice with wheatgrass resulted in an elevation in the level of the phosphorylated form of ERK and Akt proteins. Wheatgrass treatment of mice also regulated the phosphorylation of tau protein and simultaneously prevented its aggregation in the hippocampal region of the brain. Overall, this study suggests the therapeutic potential of wheatgrass in the treatment of age-related memory impairment, possibly through the involvement of ERK/Akt-CREB-BDNF pathway and concomitantly ameliorating the tau-related pathogenesis.

AB  - Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) has been associated to aging and age-related pathologies. Specifically, an age-dependent accumulation of isoform 3 of SIRT2 in the CNS has been demonstrated; however, no study has addressed the behavioral or molecular consequences that this could have on aging. In the present study, we have designed an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV-CAG-Sirt2.3-eGFP) for the overexpression of SIRT2.3 in the hippocampus of 2 month-old SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice. Our results show that the specific overexpression of this isoform does not induce significant behavioral or molecular effects at short or long term in the control strain. Only a tendency towards a worsening in the performance in acquisition phase of the Morris Water Maze was found in SAMP8 mice, together with a significant increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il-1 beta. These results suggest that the age-related increase of SIRT2.3 found in the brain is not responsible for induction or prevention of senescence. Nevertheless, in combination with other risk factors, it could contribute to the progression of age-related processes. Understanding the specific role of SIRT2 on aging and the underlying molecular mechanisms is essential to design new and more successful therapies for the treatment of age-related diseases.

AB  - Phytochemical investigation of the leaves of Camellia ptilosperma S. Y. Liang et Q. D. Chen led to the isolation of ten undescribed compounds, including six new triterpenes (1-6) and four new pheophorbide-related compounds (7-10). Meanwhile, the cytotoxic activity of the six triterpenes against six cancer cell lines was evaluated by MTT assay. Compound 2 showed potent cytotoxicity toward HepG2 cells with an IC50 value of 2.57 mu M. Compounds 4 and 5 exhibited cytotoxicity against MDA-MB231 cells, with IC50 values of 11.31 and 5.52 mu M, respectively. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of four new pheophorbides against these cancer cells was evaluated both in the presence and absence of light treatment. Compound 7 exhibited exceptional photocytotoxicity against Hela, MCF-7, and A549 cells, with IC50 values of 0.43 mu M, 0.28 mu M, and 0.92 mu M, respectively. Compound 10 demonstrated significant photodynamic cytotoxic activity against BEL-7402 and HepG2 cells with IC50 values of 0.77 mu M and 0.33 mu M, respectively. The photodynamic antibacterial activity of 7-10 was also tested for S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa under direct illumination. Compounds 8 and 10 exhibited sensitivity to E. coli and demonstrated a photodynamic antibacterial effect, with a MIC value of 0.625 mu M.

AB  - Sulforaphane (SFN) is a potent activator of the transcriptional factor, Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-Related factor 2 (NRF2). SFN and its precursor, glucoraphanin (sulforaphane glucosinolate, SGS), have been shown to ameliorate cognitive function in clinical trials and in vivo studies. However, the effects of SGS on age-related cognitive decline in Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 (SAMP8) is unknown. In this study, we determined the preventive potential of SGS on age-related cognitive decline. One-month old SAMP8 mice or control SAM resistance 1 (SAMR1) mice were fed an ad libitum diet with or without SGS-containing broccoli sprout powder (0.3% w/w SGS in diet) until 13 months of age. SGS significantly improved long-term memory in SAMP8 at 12 months of age. Interestingly, SGS increased hippocampal mRNA and protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1 alpha) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which are master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, both in SAMR1 and SAMP8 at 13 months of age. Furthermore, mRNAs for nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory complex enzymes, but not mitochondrial DNA itself, were increased by SGS in SAMP8 mice. These results suggest that SGS prevents age-related cognitive decline by maintaining mitochondrial function in senescence-accelerated mice.

AB  - Brain tissue may be especially sensitive to electromagnetic phenomena provoking signs of neural stress in cerebral activity. Fifty-four adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent ELISA and immunohistochemistry testing of four relevant anatomical areas of the cerebrum to measure biomarkers indicating induction of heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70), glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) after single or repeated exposure to 2.45 GHz radiation in the experimental set-up. Neither radiation regime caused tissue heating, so thermal effects can be ruled out. A progressive decrease in GCR and HSP-70 was observed after acute or repeated irradiation in the somatosensory cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus. In the limbic cortex; however, values for both biomarkers were significantly higher after repeated exposure to irradiation when compared to control animals. GFAP values in brain tissue after irradiation were not significantly different or were even lower than those of nonirradiated animals in all brain regions studied. Our results suggest that repeated exposure to 2.45 GHz elicited GCR/HSP-70 dysregulation in the brain, triggering a state of stress that could decrease tissue anti-inflammatory action without favoring glial proliferation and make the nervous system more vulnerable.

AB  - T-2 toxin and deoxynivalenol (DON) are two prevalent mycotoxins that cause cartilage damage in Kashin-Beck disease (KBD). Cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in chondrocytes is a significant pathological feature of KBD. It has been shown that the Hippo pathway is involved in cartilage ECM degradation. This study aimed to examine the effect of YAP, a major regulator of the Hippo pathway, on the ECM degradation in the hiPS-derived chondrocytes (hiPS-Ch) model of KBD. The hiPS-Ch injury models were established via treatment with T-2 toxin/DON alone or in combination. We found that T-2 toxin and DON inhibited the proliferation of hiPS-Ch in a dose-dependent manner; significantly increased the levels of YAP, SOX9, and MMP13; and decreased the levels of COL2A1 and ACAN (all p values < 0.05). Immunofluorescence revealed that YAP was primarily located in the nuclei of hiPS-Ch, and its expression level increased with toxin concentrations. The inhibition of YAP resulted in the dysregulated expression of chondrogenic markers (all p values < 0.05). These findings suggest that T-2 toxin and DON may inhibit the proliferation of, and induce the ECM degradation, of hiPS-Ch mediated by YAP, providing further insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to cartilage damage caused by toxins.

AB  - CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a rare and severe neurodevelopmental disease caused by mutations in the X-linked CDKL5 gene, is characterized by early-onset epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autistic features. Although pharmacotherapy has shown promise in the CDD mouse model, safe and effective clinical treatments are still far off. Recently, we found increased microglial activation in the brain of a mouse model of CDD, the Cdkl5 KO mouse, suggesting that a neuroinflammatory state, known to be involved in brain maturation and neuronal dysfunctions, may contribute to the pathophysiology of CDD. The present study aims to evaluate the possible beneficial effect of treatment with luteolin, a natural flavonoid known to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities, on brain development and behavior in a heterozygous Cdkl5 (+/-) female mouse, the mouse model of CDD that best resembles the genetic clinical condition. We found that inhibition of neuroinflammation by chronic luteolin treatment ameliorates motor stereotypies, hyperactive profile and memory ability in Cdkl5 +/- mice. Luteolin treatment also increases hippocampal neurogenesis and improves dendritic spine maturation and dendritic arborization of hippocampal and cortical neurons. These findings show that microglia overactivation exerts a harmful action in the Cdkl5 +/- brain, suggesting that treatments aimed at counteracting the neuroinflammatory process should be considered as a promising adjuvant therapy for CDD.

AB  - Although sex differences in the brain are prevalent, the knowledge about mechanisms underlying sex-related effects on normal and pathological brain functioning is rather poor. It is known that female and male brains differ in size and connectivity. Moreover, those differences are related to neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, and molecular signaling pathways. Among different processes assuring proper synapse functions are posttranslational modifications, and among them, S-palmitoylation (S-PALM) emerges as a crucial mechanism regulating synaptic integrity. Protein S-PALM is governed by a family of palmitoyl acyltransferases, also known as DHHC proteins. Here we focused on the sex-related functional importance of DHHC7 acyltransferase because of its S-PALM action over different synaptic proteins as well as sex steroid receptors. Using the mass spectrometry-based PANIMoni method, we identified sex-dependent differences in the S-PALM of synaptic proteins potentially involved in the regulation of membrane excitability and synaptic transmission as well as in the signaling of proteins involved in the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. To determine a mechanistic source for obtained sex-dependent changes in protein S-PALM, we analyzed synaptoneurosomes isolated from DHHC7-/- (DHHC7KO) female and male mice. Our data showed sex-dependent action of DHHC7 acyltransferase. Furthermore, we revealed that different S-PALM proteins control the same biological processes in male and female synapses.

AB  - Acute activation of innate immune response in the brain, or neuroinflammation, protects this vital organ from a range of external pathogens and promotes healing after traumatic brain injury. However, chronic neuroinflammation leading to the activation of immune cells like microglia and astrocytes causes damage to the nervous tissue, and it is causally linked to a range of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and many others. While neuroinflammation is a key target for a range of neuropathological diseases, there is a lack of effective countermeasures to tackle it, and existing experimental therapies require fairly invasive intracerebral and intrathecal delivery due to difficulty associated with the therapeutic crossover between the blood-brain barrier, making such treatments impractical to treat neuroinflammation long-term. Here, we present the development of an optimal neurotherapeutic using our Nanoligomer Discovery Engine, by screening downregulation of several proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., Interleukin-1fi or IL-1fi, tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNFa, TNF receptor 1 or TNFR1, Interleukin 6 or IL-6), inflammasomes (e.g., NLRP1), key transcription factors (e.g., nuclear factor kappa-B or NF-kappa fi) and their combinations, as upstream regulators and canonical pathway targets, to identify and validate the best-in-class treatment. Using our high-throughput drug discovery, target validation, and lead molecule identification via a bioinformatics and artificial intelligence-based ranking method to design sequence-specific peptide molecules to up-or downregulate gene expression of the targeted gene at will, we used our discovery engine to perturb and identify most effective upstream regulators and canonical pathways for therapeutic intervention to reverse neuroinflammation. The lead neurotherapeutic was a combination of Nanoligomers targeted to NF-kappa fi (SB.201.17D.8_NF-kappa fi1) and TNFR1 (SB.201.18D.6_TNFR1), which were identified using in vitro cell-based screening in donor-derived human astrocytes and further validated in vivo using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. The combination treatment SB_NI_111 was delivered without any special formulation using a simple intraperitoneal injection of low dose (5 mg/kg) and was found to significantly suppress the expression of LPS-induced neuroinflammation in mouse hippocampus. These results point to the broader applicability of this approach towards the development of therapies for chronic neuroinflammation-linked neurodegenerative diseases, sleep countermeasures, and others, and the potential for further investigation of the lead neurotherapeutic molecule as reversible gene therapy.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) belong to Theaceae family, in the section Thea. Tea plants are widely distributed in subtropical and tropical regions in the word. alpha -carotene and beta -carotene in the tea leaves belong to carotenoids, which are associated with the aroma and color of the tea. Phytoene synthase (PSY) is a rate-limiting enzyme in carotenoids biosynthesis. We identified three CsPSY genes in 'Shuchazao', named CsPSY1, CsPSY2, and CsPSY3. Structural analysis of three CsPSY genes showed that CsPSY1 had a longer intro structure. The cis-acting elements of CsPSYs promoter were mainly associated with light-responsiveness, abiotic stress-responsiveness, and hormone-responsiveness. CsPSY1 exhibited expression in all tissues of the tea plants, whereas CsPSY2 and CsPSY3 were trace expression levels in all tissues. The positive expression of CsPSY1 under hormonal and abiotic stresses suggested its role in plant development and defense responses. The amino acid sequence of CsPSY1 was highly conserved in eight tea cultivars. The recombinant vector pCAMBIA1301-CsPSY1 was constructed to stabilize the overexpression of CsPSY1 in carrot. The contents of alpha -carotene and beta -carotene in transgenic carrot callus were significantly increased. This study provides a foundational basis for further research on the function of CsPSYs and carotenoids accumulation in tea plants.

AB  - Fluorosis can induce neurotoxicity. Sodium butyrate (SB), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has important research potential in correcting glucose metabolism disorders and is widely used in a variety of neurological diseases and metabolic diseases, but it is not yet known whether it plays a role in combating fluoride-induced neurotoxicity. This study aims to evaluate the effect of SB on fluoride neurotoxicity and the possible associated mechanisms. The results of HE staining and Morris water maze showed that, in mice exposed to 100 mg/L fluoride for 3 months, the hippocampal cells arranged in loosely with large cell gaps and diminished in number. One thousand milligram per kilogram per day SB treatment improved fluoride-induced neuronal cell damage and spatial learning memory impairment. Western blot results showed that the abundance of malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in the hippocampus of fluorosis mice was increased, the abundance of pyruvate kinase M (PKM), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hexokinase (HK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated Akt (P-AKT), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) was inhibited, and the content of lactate and ATP was decreased. SB treatment reversed the decreased glycolysis in the hippocampus of fluorosis mice. These results suggested that SB could ameliorate fluorosis-induced neurotoxicity, which might be linked with its function in regulating glycolysis as well as inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/HIF-1 alpha pathway.

AB  - Neurotoxic side effects of chemotherapy include deficits in attention, memory, and executive functioning. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies. In mice, cisplatin causes long-term cognitive deficits, white matter damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and loss of synaptic integrity. We hypothesized that MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) could restore cisplatin-induced cognitive impairments and brain damage. Animals were injected with cisplatin intraperitoneally and treated with MSC-derived sEVs intranasally 48 and 96 h after the last cisplatin injection. The puzzle box test (PBT) and the novel object place recognition test (NOPRT) were used to determine cognitive deficits. Synaptosomal mitochondrial morphology was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against synaptophysin and PSD95 was applied to assess synaptic loss. Black-Gold II staining was used to quantify white matter integrity. Our data show that sEVs enter the brain in 30 min and reverse the cisplatin-induced deficits in executive functioning and working and spatial memory. Abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology, loss of white matter, and synaptic integrity in the hippocampus were restored as well. Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of regenerative functions after treatment with sEVs, pointing to a possible role of axonal guidance signaling, netrin signaling, and Wnt/Ca2+ signaling in recovery. Our data suggest that intranasal sEV treatment could become a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of chemobrain.

AB  - Fibrosis is an important phenomenon as it can occur early in the pathogenesis of asthma; it may be associated with disease severity and resistance to therapy. There is a strong evidence that infection caused by human rhinovirus (HRV) contributes to remodelling process, but there is lack of studies clearly explaining this pathway. Synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). presents immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory features. In this study, we examined immunomodulatory properties of ciglitazone -PPAR-gamma agonist, in development and modulation of airway remodelling. Epithelial cells (NHBE) and two lines of fibroblasts (WI-38, HFL1) were stimulated with ciglitazone and rhinovirus. The expression of genes related to airway remodelling process were analysed in the cells; moreover NF-kappa B, c-Myc and STAT3 were silenced in order to estimate potential pathways involved. Ciglitazone decreased mRNA expression of MMP-9 and TGF-beta. It also modified the expression of alpha-SMA and collagen after rhinovirus infection. Transcription factors knockdown altered the levels of expression. The results suggest possible anti-fibrotic activity of PPAR-gamma agonist in human airway cells. Ciglitazone has been shown to be dependent on NF-kappa B-and STAT3-related pathways, thus, the PPAR-gamma agonist may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of airway remodelling in asthma.

AB  - We hypothesized that auditory stimulation could reduce the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and that audiovisual stimulation could have additional effects through multisensory integration. We exposed 12 month old Apoe(tm1.1(APOE*4)Adiuj) mice (a mouse model of sporadic AD) to auditory (A) or audiovisual stimulation (AV) at 40 Hz for 14 days in a soundproof chamber system (no stimulation, N). Behavioral tests were performed before and after each session, and their brain tissues were assessed for amyloid-beta expression and apoptotic cell death, after 14 days. Furthermore, brain levels of acetylcholine and apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed. In the Y-maze test, the percentage relative alternation was significantly higher in group A than in group N mice. Amyloid-beta and TUNEL positivity in the hippocampal CA3 region was significantly lower in group A and group AV mice than in group N mice (p < 0.05). Acetylcholine levels were significantly higher in group A and group AV mice than in group N mice (p < 0.05). Compared to group N mice, expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3 was lower in group A, and expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was higher in group AV. In a mouse model of early-stage sporadic AD, auditory or audiovisual stimulation improved cognitive performance and neuropathology.

AB  - Prolactin is a hormone for which actions on the central nervous system such as neurogenesis and neuroprotection have been described by acting on specific receptors. The presence of prolactin receptors in the brain, including the hippocampus, is well documented; however, it is unknown whether these receptors change with age and whether they are related to sex. For this reason, a study of the expression of prolactin receptors, in the short and long isoforms, in the hippocampus of male and female rats has been carried out by qPCR and in situ hybridization, with a densitometric analysis in the following life stages: prepubertal, postpubertal, young adult, adult, and old. The results revealed the greater expression of the long isoform than of the short isoform in males, but not in females, with significant differences between males and females and in the different life stages studied. With significant differences, the highest expression of both isoforms appeared in male rats in the postpubertal stage, and the lowest expression was observed in adult and old animals. In situ hybridization showed differences in the localization of PRLR mRNA expression in CA1, CA3, and DG depending on the age and sex of the rats. The results obtained suggest that hippocampal aging is related to a decrease in prolactin receptors, which helps to better understand brain aging.

AB  - The neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau and extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid (A beta). Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), as a novel therapeutic target, shows promise for the treatment of human AD, but the regulatory mechanisms of DAPK1 expression in AD remain unclear. In this study, we identified miR-143-3p as a promising candidate for targeting DAPK1. miR-143-3p directly bound to the 3 ' untranslated region of human DAPK1 mRNA and inhibited its translation. miR-143-3p decreased tau phosphorylation and promoted neurite outgrowth and microtubule assembly. Moreover, miR-143-3p attenuated amyloid precursor protein (APP) phosphorylation and reduced the generation of A beta 40 and A beta 42. Furthermore, restoring DAPK1 expression with miR-143-3p antagonized the effects of miR-143-3p in attenuating tau hyperphosphorylation and A beta production. In addition, the miR-143-3p levels were downregulated and correlated inversely with the expression of DAPK1 in the hippocampus of AD patients. Our results suggest that miR-143-3p might play critical roles in regulating both aberrant tau phosphorylation and amyloidogenic processing of APP by targeting DAPK1 and thus offer a potential novel therapeutic strategy for AD.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of neurological dysfunction and disability. This study aimed to investigate the transcriptomic changes and the functional consequences in TBI, focusing on the interplay between inflammation and mitochondrial impairment. Brain tissue samples from TBI patients and healthy controls were subjected to RNA-sequencing analysis. Mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells were treated with inflammatory cytokine and the PGC-1 alpha activator ZLN005. Mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were assessed using Seahorse respirometry, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and molecular assays. A TBI mouse model was established to evaluate the therapeutic effects of ZLN005. Transcriptome profiling revealed downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, particularly those encoded by the mitochondrial genome, along with enrichment of neurodegenerative pathways in TBI patients. Concomitantly, pro-inflammatory signaling pathways showed upregulation. In vitro studies demonstrated that inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha treatment impaired mitochondrial respiration, induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in HT-22 cells, which could be rescued by ZLN005-mediated PGC-1 alpha activation and restoration of OXPHOS gene expression. Administration of ZLN005 in the TBI mouse model alleviated neuronal cell death, preserved mitochondrial integrity, normalized OXPHOS gene levels in brain tissues, and improved cognitive function. This study uncovers a mechanistic link between inflammation-induced downregulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS genes and neuronal damage in TBI. Targeting this pathway by activating PGC-1 alpha represents a potential therapeutic strategy for TBI.

AB  - The small GTPase RAS acts as a plasma membrane-anchored intracellular neurotrophin counteracting neuronal degeneration in the brain, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In transgenic mice expressing constitutively activated V12-Ha-RAS selectively in neurons, proteome analysis uncovered a 70% decrease in voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1) in the cortex and hippocampus. We observed a corresponding reduction in the levels of mRNA splicing variant coding for plasma membrane-targeted VDAC-1 (pl-VDAC-1) while mRNA levels for mitochondrial membrane VDAC-1 (mt-VDAC-1) remained constant. In primary cortical neurons derived from V12-Ha-RAS animals, a decrease in pl-VDAC-1 mRNA levels was observed, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in the ferricyanide reductase activity associated with VDAC-1 protein. Application of MEK inhibitor U0126 to transgenic cortical neurons reconstituted pl-VDAC-1 mRNA to reach wild-type levels. Excitotoxic glutamate-induced cell death was strongly attenuated in transgenic V12-Ha-RAS overexpressing cortical cultures. Consistently, a neuroprotective effect could also be achieved in wild-type cortical cultures by the extracellular application of channel-blocking antibody targeting the N-terminus of VDAC-1. These results may encourage novel therapeutic approaches toward blocking pl-VDAC-1 by monoclonal antibody targeting for complementary treatments in transplantation and neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a complex psychopathology whose treatment is still challenging. Given the limitations of existing antipsychotics, there is urgent need for novel drugs with fewer side effects. SEP-363856 (SEP-856) is a novel psychotropic agent currently under phase III clinical investigation for schizophrenia treatment. In this study, we investigated the ability of an acute oral SEP-856 administration to modulate the functional activity of specific brain regions at basal levels and under glutamatergic or dopaminergic-perturbed conditions in adult rats. We found that immediate-early genes (IEGs) expression was strongly upregulated in the prefrontal cortex and, to a less extent, in the ventral hippocampus, suggesting an activation of these regions. Furthermore, SEP-856 was effective in preventing the hyperactivity induced by an acute injection of phencyclidine (PCP), but not of d-amphetamine (AMPH). The compound effectively normalized the PCP-induced increase in IEGs expression in the PFC at all doses tested, whereas only the highest dose determined the major modulations on AMPH-induced changes. Lastly, SEP-856 acute administration corrected the cognitive deficits produced by subchronic PCP administration. Taken together, our data provide further insights on SEP-856, suggesting that modulation of the PFC may represent an important mechanism for the functional and behavioural activity of this novel compound.

AB  - Tea plants, as essential health beverages, are widely recognized for their rich content of antioxidant metabolites. This study utilized metabolomics analysis techniques to compare the metabolic differences between Camellia tachangensis F. C. Zhang, Camellia gymnogyna Hung T. Chang, and Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kunzte, aiming to reveal their potential antioxidant activities. By applying UPLC-MS/MS technology, we analyzed metabolites in the samples and identified 1056 metabolites. We utilized statistical methods such as orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and principal component analysis to evaluate and compare the variations in the samples. An intersection analysis of metabolites from the three types of tea plants identified 29 major differential metabolites. Functional annotation and pathway analysis of these differential metabolites were conducted, ultimately discussing 24 antioxidant-related metabolites, primarily belonging to flavonoids, phenolic acids, and other categories. Among the three types of tea, C. tachangensis has the highest content of procyanidin B4, which is the most abundant substance in this tea. In terms of the impact of this substance on tea, it is known to have antioxidant properties and contributes to the overall antioxidant capacity of tea. In both C. gymnogyna and C. sinensis, the top 5 antioxidant metabolites include substances such as apigenin-6,8-di-C-glucoside (vicenin-2), epigallocatechin, and apigenin-5-O-glucoside. These substances belong to the flavonoid class and contribute to the antioxidant properties of these teas. Beyond the flavonoids and phenolic acids, other classes of metabolites in tea plants also exhibited significant antioxidant properties. These different metabolites play a key role in the antioxidant function of tea, contributing to their potential health benefits. The metabolites provide crucial insights for exploring and developing high-antioxidant products that occur naturally.

AB  - Many relevant studies, as well as clinical practice, confirm that untreated diabetes predisposes the development of neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Having regard for the fact that PPAR gamma are widely distributed in the brain and PPAR gamma ligands may regulate the inflammatory process, the anti-inflammatory potential of the PPAR gamma agonist, pioglitazone, was assessed in a mouse model of neuroinflammation related with diabetes. In this regard, the biochemical and molecular indicators of neuroinflammation were determined in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of diabetes mice. The levels of cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF) and the expression of genes (Tnfrsf1a and Cav1) were measured. In addition, behavioral tests such as the open field test, the hole-board test, and the novel object recognition test were conducted. A 14-day treatment with pioglitazone significantly decreased IL-6 and TNF alpha levels in the prefrontal cortex and led to the downregulation of Tnfrsf1a expression and the upregulation of Cav1 expression in both brain regions of diabetic mice. Pioglitazone, by targeting neuroinflammatory signaling, improved memory and exploratory activity in behavioral tests. The present study provided a potential theoretical basis and therapeutic target for the treatment of neuroinflammation associated with diabetes. Pioglitazone may provide a promising therapeutic strategy in diabetes patients with muffled of behavioral activity.

AB  - The G allele of rs4702 polymorphism has been reported to reduce the production of mature BDNF and FURIN, both of which were closely associated with cognitive functions. Real-time PCR, ELISA and luciferase assay were performed to explore the interactions between miR-338-3p, FURIN and BDNF. T-RFLP was used to assess the intestinal flora in the stool samples of glioma patients after radiotherapy. We grouped the 106 glioma patients recruited according to the rs4702 polymorphism. The results showed no obvious correlation between rs4702 polymorphism and the expression of miR-338-3p. However, rs4702-A was associated with increased expression of FURIN and BDNF in the serum and PBMC of glioma patients after radiotherapy. Besides, the study found that rs4702-A was remarkably associated with increased enterotype I and decreased enterotype III in the stool of glioma patients after radiotherapy. Rs4702-A was also proved to be closely associated with increased MMSE, role functioning and social functioning at three months after radiotherapy. Furthermore, miR-338-3p repressed the expression of FURIN-G. Compared with G allele, the presence of A allele of rs4702 polymorphism in FURIN could obstruct the suppressive effect of miR-338-3p upon the expression of FURIN and BDNF in intestinal flora. Therefore, the carriers of A allele will be challenged with less risk of radiotherapy-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - While chronic stress increases hyperpolarization-activated current (I-h) in dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons, the underlying molecular mechanisms are entirely unknown. Following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), susceptible mice displayed social avoidance and impaired spatial working memory, which were linked to decreased neuronal excitability, increased perisomatic hyperpolarizationactivated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 1 protein expression, and elevated I-h in dorsal but not ventral CA1 neurons. In control mice, bath application of corticosterone reduced neuronal excitability, increased tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b) and HCN1 protein expression, and elevated I-h in dorsal but not ventral CA1 region/neurons. Corticosteroneinduced upregulation of functional Ih was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), HCN channels, and the protein kinase A (PKA) but not the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) pathway. Three months after the end of CSDS, susceptible mice displayed persistent social avoidance when exposed to a novel aggressor. The sustained behavioral deficit was associated with lower neuronal excitability and higher functional I-h in dorsal CA1 neurons, both of which were unaffected by corticosterone treatment. Our findings show that corticosterone treatment mimics the pathophysiological effects of dorsal CA1 neurons/region found in susceptible mice. The aberrant expression of HCN1 protein along the somatodendritic axis of the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region might be the molecular mechanism driving susceptibility to social avoidance.

AB  - The role of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in the normalfunctioningof the central nervous system and synaptic plasticity is well established.However, dysregulated kinase activity can have a significant impacton neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Cdk5 hyperactivationis linked to diabetes-associated neurodegeneration, but the underlyingmechanism is not fully understood. Our study reveals that oxidativestress can lead to Cdk5 hyperactivity, which in turn is linked toneurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Specifically, our experimentswith N2A cells overexpressing Cdk5 and its activators p35 and p25show ER stress, resulting in activation of the unfolded protein response(UPR) pathway. We identified Cdk5 as the epicenter of this regulatoryprocess, leading to the activation of the CDK5-IRE1-XBP1 arm of UPR.Moreover, our study demonstrated that Cdk5 hyperactivation can leadto ER stress and activation of the UPR pathway, which may contributeto cognitive impairments associated with diabetes. Our findings alsosuggest that antioxidants such as NAC and GSH can decrease deregulatedCdk5 kinase activity and rescue cells from UPR-mediated ER stress.The accumulation of phosphorylated Tau protein in AD brain proteinhas been widely described earlier. Notably, we observed that oraltreatment with NAC decreased Cdk5 kinase activity in the hippocampus,attenuated high levels of phospho-tau (ser396), and ameliorated memoryand learning impairments in a type 2 diabetic (T2D) mouse model. Additionally,the high-fat-induced T2D model exhibits elevated phospho-tau levels,which are rescued by the NAC treatment. Taken together, these resultssuggest that targeting Cdk5 may be a promising therapeutic strategyfor treating diabetes-associated cognitive impairments.

AB  - Selenium binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) is involved in neurologic disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. However, the role of SELENBP1 in the neurogenesis of depression, which is a neurologic disorder, and the underlying mechanisms of oxidative stress and inflammation in depression remain unknown. In this study, we evaluated the changes in the expression levels of SELENBP1 in the hippocampus of a mouse model of depression and in the serum of human patients with depression using the Gene Expression Omnibus database. These changes were validated using blood samples from human patients with depression and mouse models with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like behavior. We also investigated the effects of SELENBP1 knockout (KO) on inflammation, oxidative stress, and hippocampal neurogenesis in mice with CUMS-induced depression. Our results revealed that SELENBP1 levels was decreased in the blood of human patients with depression and in the hippocampus of mice with CUMS-induced depression. SELENBP1 KO increased CUMS-induced depressive behavior in mice and caused dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. This led to a decrease in the numbers of doublecortin- and Ki67-positive cells, which might aggravate CUMS-induced depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that SELENBP1 might be involved in the regulation of neurogenesis in mice with depression and could be served as a potential target for diagnosing and treating depression.

AB  - St. John's wort is an herb, long used in folk medicine for the treatment of mild depression. Its antidepressant constituent, hyperforin, has properties such as chemical instability and induction of drug-drug interactions that preclude its use for individual pharmacotherapies. Here we identify the transient receptor potential canonical 6 channel (TRPC6) as a druggable target to control anxious and depressive behavior and as a requirement for hyperforin antidepressant action. We demonstrate that TRPC6 deficiency in mice not only results in anxious and depressive behavior, but also reduces excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells. Using electrophysiology and targeted mutagenesis, we show that hyperforin activates the channel via a specific binding motif at TRPC6. We performed an analysis of hyperforin action to develop a new antidepressant drug that uses the same TRPC6 target mechanism for its antidepressant action. We synthesized the hyperforin analog Hyp13, which shows similar binding to TRPC6 and recapitulates TRPC6-dependent anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in mice. Hyp13 does not activate pregnan-X-receptor (PXR) and thereby loses the potential to induce drug-drug interactions. This may provide a new approach to develop better treatments for depression, since depression remains one of the most treatment-resistant mental disorders, warranting the development of effective drugs based on naturally occurring compounds.

AB  - Ozone (O-3) is an oxidating tropospheric pollutant. When O-3 interacts with biological substrates, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are formed. Severe oxidative damage exhausts the endogenous antioxidant system, which leads to the decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Curcumin (CUR) is a natural polyphenol with well-documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effects of curcumin on CAT, GPx, and SOD activity and the inhibition of oxidative damage after the acute and chronic exposure to O-3. Fifty male Wistar rats were divided into five experimental groups: the intact control, CUR-fed control, exposed-to-O-3 control, CUR-fed (preventive), and CUR-fed (therapeutic) groups. These two last groups received a CUR-supplemented diet while exposed to O-3. These experiments were performed during acute- and chronic-exposure phases. In the preventive and therapeutic groups, the activity of plasma CAT, GPx, and SOD was increased during both exposure phases, with slight differences; concomitantly, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation were inhibited. For this reason, we propose that CUR could be used to enhance the activity of the antioxidant system and to diminish the oxidative damage caused by exposure to O-3.

AB  - The adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist SCH58261 has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. However, its role in chronic periodontitis (CP)-induced cognitive impairment, which is associated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P. gingivalis LPS), remains unclear. This study investigated the role of SCH58261 in mice with CP-induced cognitive impairment. C57BL/6J mice were used to develop CP model by injecting 0.5 mg/kg P. gingivalis LPS into the palatal gingival sulcus of maxillary first molars twice a week for four weeks. The mice were divided into control, P. gingivalis LPS (P-LPS), P-LPS + SCH58261, and SCH58261 groups. The passive avoidance test (PAT) and Morris water maze (MWM) were used to assess cognition in mice. Furthermore, CD73/adenosine, neuroinflammation, glutamate transporters, and glutamate were assessed. Compared with the P-LPS group, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg SCH58261 increased latency and decreased error times in PAT, but increased platform crossing number in MWM. SCH58261 inhibited microglial activation, and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and glutamate levels, but increased GLT-1 and PSD95 expression in the hippocampus. This was the first report of SCH58261 treatment for CP-induced cognitive impairment, which may be related to its anti-inflammatory activities and anti-glutamate excitatory neurotoxicity. This suggests that SCH58261 can be used as a novel agent to treat cognitive impairment.

AB  - Disruptions in brain energy metabolism, oxidative damage, and neuroinflammation are commonly seen in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Microglial activation is the hallmark of neuroinflammation. After brain injury, microglia also act as a double-edged sword with distinctive phenotypic changes. Therefore, therapeutic applications to potentiate microglia towards pro-inflammatory response following brain injury have become the focus of attention in recent years. Here, in the current study, we investigated the hypothesis that 17 beta-estradiol could rescue the mouse brain against apoptotic cell death and neurodegeneration by suppressing deleterious proinflammatory response probably by abrogating metabolic stress and oxidative damage after brain injury. Male C57BL/6N mice were used to establish a cortical stab wound injury (SWI) model. Immediately after brain injury, the mice were treated with 17 beta-estradiol (10 mg/kg, once every day via i.p. injection) for one week. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis was performed to examine the cortical and hippocampal brain regions. For the evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), we used specific kits. Our findings revealed that 17 beta-estradiol treatment significantly alleviated SWI-induced energy dyshomeostasis and oxidative stress by increasing the activity of phospho-AMPK (Thr172) and by regulating the expression of an antioxidant gene (Nrf2) and cytoprotective enzymes (HO-1 and GSH) to mitigate ROS. Importantly, 17 beta-estradiol treatment downregulated gliosis and proinflammatory markers (iNOS and CD64) while significantly augmenting an anti-inflammatory response as evidenced by the robust expression of TGF-beta and IGF-1 after brain injury. The treatment with 17 beta-estradiol also reduced inflammatory mediators (Tnf-alpha, IL-1 beta, and COX-2) in the injured mouse. Moreover, 17 beta-estradiol administration rescued p53-associated apoptotic cell death in the SWI model by regulating the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins (Bax and Bcl-2) and caspase-3 activation. Finally, SWI + 17 beta-estradiol-treated mice illustrated reduced brain lesion volume and enhanced neurotrophic effect and the expression of synaptic proteins. These findings suggest that 17 beta-estradiol is an effective therapy against the brain secondary injury-induced pathological cascade following trauma, although further studies may be conducted to explore the exact mechanisms.

AB  - Aucubin is an iridoid glycoside that displays various pharmacological actions including antioxidant activity. However, there are few reports available on the neuroprotective effects of aucubin against ischemic brain injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether aucubin protected against damage to hippocampal function induced by forebrain ischemia-reperfusion injury (fIRI) in gerbils, and to examine whether aucubin produced neuroprotection in the hippocampus against fIRI and to explore its mechanisms by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and Western analysis. Gerbils were given intraperitoneal injections of aucubin at doses of 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg, respectively, once a day for seven days before fIRI. As assessed by the passive avoidance test, short-term memory function following fIRI significantly declined, whereas the decline in short-term memory function due to fIRI was ameliorated by pretreatment with 10 mg/kg, but not 1 or 5 mg/kg, of aucubin. Most of the pyramidal cells (principal cells) of the hippocampus died in the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) area four days after fIRI. Treatment with 10 mg/kg, but not 1 or 5 mg/kg, of aucubin protected the pyramidal cells from IRI. The treatment with 10 mg/kg of aucubin significantly reduced IRI-induced superoxide anion production, oxidative DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation in the CA1 pyramidal cells. In addition, the aucubin treatment significantly increased the expressions of superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2) in the pyramidal cells before and after fIRI. Furthermore, the aucubin treatment significantly enhanced the protein expression levels of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin-like growth factor-I, in the hippocampal CA1 area before and after IRI. Collectively, in this experiment, pretreatment with aucubin protected CA1 pyramidal cells from forebrain IRI by attenuating oxidative stress and increasing neurotrophic factors. Thus, pretreatment with aucubin can be a promising candidate for preventing brain IRI.

AB  - Background: Lung ischemia reperfusion injury (LIRI) is a severe complication after lung transplantation (LT). Ferroptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of LIRI. Maresin1 (MaR1) is an endogenous pro-resolving lipid mediator that exerts protective effects against multiorgan diseases. However, the role and mechanism of MaR1 in the ferroptosis of LIRI after LT need to be further investigated. Methods: A mouse LT model and a pulmonary vascular endothelial cell line after hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) culture were established in our study. Histological morphology and inflammatory cytokine levels predicted the severity of LIRI. Cell viability and cell injury were determined by CCK-8 and LDH assays. Ferroptosis biomarkers, including Fe2+, MDA, 4-HNE, and GSH, were assessed by relevant assay kits. Transferrin receptor (TFRC) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) protein levels were examined by western blotting. In vitro, lipid peroxide levels were detected by DCFH-DA staining and flow cytometry analysis. The ultrastructure of mitochondria was imaged using transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, the potential mechanism by which MaR1 regulates ferroptosis was explored and verified with signaling pathway inhibitors using Western blotting. Results: MaR1 protected mice from LIRI after LTx, which was reversed by the ferroptosis agonist Sorafenib in vivo. MaR1 administration decreased Fe2+, MDA, 4-HNE, TFRC, and ACSL4 contents, increased GSH levels, and ameliorated mitochondrial ultrastructural injury after LTx. In vitro, Sorafenib resulted in lower cell viability and worsened cell injury and enhanced the hallmarks of ferroptosis after H/R culture, which was rescued by MaR1 treatment. Mechanistically, the protein kinase A and YAP inhibitors partly blocked the effects of MaR1 on ferroptosis inhibition and LIRI protection. Conclusions: This study revealed that MaR1 alleviates LIRI and represses ischemia reperfusion-induced ferroptosis via the PKA-Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, which may offer a promising theoretical basis for the clinical application of organ protection after LTx.

AB  - Bacterial sepsis induces the production of excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, resulting in tissue injury and hyperinflammation. Patients recovering from sepsis have increased rates of central nervous system (CNS) morbidities, which are linked to long-term cognitive impairment, such as neurodegenerative pathologies. This paper focuses on the tissue injury and hyperinflammation observed in the acute phase of sepsis and on the development of long-term neuroinflammation associated with septicemia. Here we evaluate the effects of Coriolus versicolor administration as a novel approach to treat polymicrobial sepsis. Rats underwent cecal ligation and perforation (CLP), and Coriolus versicolor (200 mg/kg in saline) was administered daily by gavage. Survival was monitored, and tissues from vital organs that easily succumb to infection were harvested after 72 h to evaluate the histological changes. Twenty-eight days after CLP, behavioral analyses were performed, and serum and brain (hippocampus) samples were harvested at four weeks from surgery. Coriolus versicolor increased survival and reduced acute tissue injury. Indeed, it reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream, leading to a reduced chronic inflammation. In the hippocampus, Coriolus versicolor administration restored tight junction expressions, reduce cytokines accumulation and glia activation. It also reduced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome components expression. Coriolus versicolor showed antioxidant activities, restoring glutathione (GSH) levels and catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and reducing lipid peroxidation, nitrite and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Importantly, Coriolus versicolor reduced amyloid precursor protein (APP), phosphorylated-Tau (p-Tau), pathologically phosphorylated tau (PHF1), phosphorylated tau (Ser202 and Thr205) (AT8), interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) expression, and beta-amyloid accumulation induced by CLP. Indeed, Coriolus versicolor restored synaptic dysfunction and behavioral alterations. This research shows the effects of Coriolus versicolor administration on the long-term development of neuroinflammation and brain dysfunction induced by sepsis. Overall, our results demonstrated that Coriolus versicolor administration was able to counteract the degenerative process triggered by sepsis.

AB  - Tobacco smoking is a preventable main cause of fatal diseases. Accurate measurements of the effects it has on neurotransmitters are essential in developing new strategies for smoking cessation. Moreover, measurements of neurotransmitter levels can aid in developing drugs that counteract the effects of smoking. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a fast, simultaneous and sensitive method for measuring the levels of neurotransmitters in rat brain after the exposure of tobacco cigarettes. The selected neurotransmitters include dopamine, GABA, serotonin, glutamine and glutamate. The method is based on high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation was achieved within 3 min using a Zorbax SB C-18 column (3.0 x 100 mm, 1.8 mu m particle size). The mobile phase consisted of HPLC-grade water and acetonitrile each containing 0.3% heptafluorobutyric acid and 0.5% formic acid at gradient conditions. The linear range was 0.015-0.07, 825-7,218, 140-520, 63.42-160.75 and 38.25 x 10(3) to 110.35 x 10(3) ng/ml for dopamine, GABA, serotonin, glutamine and glutamate, respectively. Inter- and intra-run accuracy were in the range 97.82-103.37% with a precision (CV%) of <= 0.90%. The results revealed that 4 weeks of cigarette exposure significantly increased neurotransmitter levels after exposure to tobacco cigarettes in various brain regions, including the hippocampus and the amygdala. This increase in neurotransmitters levels may in turn activate the nicotine dependence pathway.

AB  - BackgroundDobutamine hydrochloride (DH), a common inotropic drug used for heart failure, has recently been discovered to inhibit Yes-Associated Protein (YAP). YAP is a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway and plays a crucial role in the regulation of hematopoietic cell growth. The decrease in YAP activity has been shown to increase hematogenic differentiation and the generation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Therefore, this study investigates the effect of DH on enhancing the hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs toward HSPCs.MethodsThis study used isogenic hiPSCs to study the effect of DH during various stages of their hematogenic differentiation using an in vitro culture system. The differentiating hiPSCs were cultured under specific conditions, including defined differentiation media composition and controlled oxygen tension throughout the differentiation process. The percentages of iPSC-derived HSPCs were assessed using flow cytometry to evaluate the expression of HSPC markers, including CD34(+), CD43(+), and CD45(+)/(-). The HSPC production yield and the multilineage differentiation capacity of the resulting hiPSC-derived HSPCs were determined at the end of culture.ResultsThe findings indicate that DH treatment significantly inhibits YAP activity and increases the hematogenic differentiation of hiPSCs and the yield of HSPCs at the end of culture. Specifically, inhibiting YAP activity with DH during the transition of hiPSCs from the hematoendothelial progenitor (HE) stage to the hematopoietic stage (endothelial to hematopoietic transition, EHT) proved to be the most effective in increasing HSPC production from hiPSCs.ConclusionsThis study highlights the potential of the inotropic drug DH as a novel agent to enhance hematogenic differentiation and improve the yield of hiPSC-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). DH was found to significantly inhibit YAP activity, which in turn promoted hematopoietic specification, particularly when administered during the critical endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) stage. These findings suggest that repurposing DH could offer a valuable strategy to increase the efficiency of hiPSC-derived HSPC production, advancing its potential for therapeutic and clinical applications in regenerative medicine and hematopoietic cell therapies.

AB  - Motivation: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) harbor genetic variants modulating gene transcription. Fine mapping of regulatory variants at these loci is a daunting task due to the juxtaposition of causal and linked variants at a locus as well as the likelihood of interactions among multiple variants. This problem is exacerbated in genes with multiple cis-acting eQTL, where superimposed effects of adjacent loci further distort the association signals.
   Results: We developed a novel algorithm, TreeMap, that identifies putative causal variants in cis-eQTL accounting for multisite effects and genetic linkage at a locus. Guided by the hierarchical structure of linkage disequilibrium, TreeMap performs an organized search for individual and multiple causal variants. Via extensive simulations, we show that TreeMap detects co-regulating variants more accurately than current methods. Furthermore, its high computational efficiency enables genome-wide analysis of long-range eQTL. We applied TreeMap to GTEx data of brain hippocampus samples and transverse colon samples to search for eQTL in gene bodies and in 4 Mbps gene-flanking regions, discovering numerous distal eQTL. Furthermore, we found concordant distal eQTL that were present in both brain and colon samples, implying long-range regulation of gene expression.

AB  - With more than 90,000 muscle fascicles, the elephant trunk is a complex biological structure and the largest known muscular hydrostat. It achieves unprecedented control through intricately orchestrated contractions of a wide variety of muscle architectures. Fascinated by the elephant trunk's unique performance, scientists of all disciplines are studying its anatomy, function, and mechanics, and use it as an inspiration for biomimetic soft robots. Yet, to date, there is no precise mapping between microstructural muscular activity and macrostructural trunk motion, and our understanding of the elephant trunk remains incomplete. Specifically, no model of the elephant trunk employs formal physics-based arguments that account for its complex muscular architecture, while preserving low computational cost to enable fast screening of its configuration space. Here we create a reduced-order model of the elephant trunk that can - within a fraction of a second - predict the trunk's motion as a result of its muscular activity. To ensure reliable results in the finite deformation regime, we integrate first principles of continuum mechanics and the theory of morphoelasticity for fibrillar activation. We employ dimensional reduction to represent the trunk as an active slender structure, which results in closed-form expressions for its curvatures and extension as functions of muscle activation and anatomy. We create a high-resolution digital representation of the trunk from magnetic resonance images to quantify the effects of different muscle groups. We propose a general solution method for the inverse motion problem and apply it to extract the muscular activations in three representative trunk motions: picking a fruit; lifting a log; and lifting a log asymmetrically. For each task, we identify key features in the muscle activation profiles. Our results suggest that the elephant trunk either autonomously reorganizes muscle activation upon reaching the maximum contraction or chooses the inverse problem branches that avoid reaching the contraction constraints throughout the motion. Our study provides a complete quantitative characterization of the fundamental science behind elephant trunk biomechanics, with potential applications in the material science of flexible structures, the design of soft robots, and the creation of flexible prosthesis and assist devices.

AB  - On-site diagnostic tests that accurately identify disease biomarkers lay the foundation for self-healthcare applications. However, these tests routinely rely on single-mode signals and suffer from insufficient accuracy, especially for multiplexed point-of-care tests (POCTs) within a few minutes. Here, this work develops a dual-mode multiclassification diagnostic platform that integrates an electrochemiluminescence sensor and a field-effect transistor sensor in a microfluidic chip. The microfluidic channel guides the testing samples to flow across electro-optical sensor units, which produce dual-mode readouts by detecting infectious biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB), human rhinovirus (HRV), and group B streptococcus. Then, machine-learning classifiers generate three-dimensional (3D) hyperplanes to diagnose different diseases (GBS). Dual-mode readouts derived from distinct mechanisms enhance the anti-interference ability physically, and machine-learning-aided diagnosis in high-dimensional space reduces the occasional inaccuracy mathematically. Clinical validation studies with 501 unprocessed samples indicate that the platform has an accuracy approaching 99%, higher than the 77%-93% accuracy of rapid point-of-care testing technologies at 100% statistical power (>150 clinical tests). Moreover, the diagnosis time is 5 min without a trade-off of accuracy. This work solves the occasional inaccuracy issue of rapid on-site diagnosis, endowing POCT systems with the same accuracy as laboratory tests and holding unique prospects for complicated scenes of personalized healthcare.

AB  - Recently, the four 5,5 '-diphenylhydantoin Schiff bases, possessing different aromatic species (SB1-Ph, SB2-Ph, SB3-Ph and SB4-Ph) were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for anticonvulsant activity in combination with phenytoin. In the present study, the SB1-Ph and SB4-Ph compounds were selected, based on their anticonvulsant potency, and compared with their cis isomers, prepared after a one-hour exposure to the UV source, for their anticonvulsant potency in the maximal electroshock (MES) test and the kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) test in mice. In the MES test, the cis SB1-Ph compound exhibited superior to phenytoin and trans isomer activity in the three tested doses, while the cis SB4-Ph compound entirely suppressed the electroshock-induced seizure spread at the highest dose of 40 mg/kg. Pretreatment with the cis SB1-Ph compound and the cis SB4-Ph at the doses of 40 mg/kg, respectively, for seven days, significantly attenuated the severity of KA SE compared to the matched control group pretreated with a vehicle, while phenytoin was ineffective in this test. The cis SB4-Ph but not the cis SB1-Ph demonstrated an antioxidant effect against the KA-induced SE in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that trans-cis conversion of 5,5 '-diphenylhydantoin Schiff bases has potential against seizure spread in the MES test and mitigated the KA-induced SE. The antioxidant potency of cis SB4-Ph might be associated with its efficacy in mitigating the SE.

AB  - Purpose: Diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is a neurological complication caused by diabetes mellitus, and its underlying mechanism has not been fully clarified. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) has been demonstrated to have treatment effects on multiple neurologic diseases. The objective of this research is to explore the role and underlying mechanism of AS-IV in the treatment of DE, utilizing the methods of network pharmacology and experimental validation. Methods: Multiple public databases were used to search for the targets of AS-IV. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE16135) was analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DE. The Venn diagram was employed to determine the intersecting genes. These genes were considered potential therapeutic targets of ASIV in DE and were annotated using bioinformatics techniques. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed utilizing Cytoscape software to identify the core targets of action. Additionally, molecular docking was conducted to validate the binding affinity of AS-IV to the main targets. Finally, we validated the predictive outcomes of network pharmacology in a DE rat model induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Results: Through the application of network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses, we discovered the top two hub targets (EGFR and JAK2). Subsequent molecular docking analysis showed that AS-IV was precisely located within the binding sites of both EGFR and JAK2, with binding energies of -8.18 kJ/mol and -10.94 kJ/ mol, respectively. Behavioral experiments demonstrated that the treated rats showed improvements in cognitive impairment. Following AS-IV treatment, there was a significant reduction in amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampal tissue of DE rats. Furthermore, TUNEL staining and Western blot analyses demonstrated that AS-IV suppressed neuronal apoptosis and inhibited the activation of the EGFR/JAK2/ STAT3 signaling pathway. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that the AS-IV has the potential to improve cognitive impairment in DE rats by mitigating neuronal apoptosis through the EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which provides important implications for the treatment of DE.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition in which clinical symptoms are highly correlated with the loss of glutamatergic synapses. While later stages of AD are associated with markedly decreased glutamate levels due to neuronal loss, in the early stages, pathological accumulation of glutamate and hyperactivity contribute to AD pathology and cognitive dysfunction. There is increasing awareness that presynaptic dysfunction, particularly synaptic vesicle (SV) alterations, play a key role in mediating this early-stage hyperactivity. In the current study, we sought to determine whether the 3xTg mouse model of AD that exhibits both beta-amyloid (A beta) and tau-related pathology would exhibit similar presynaptic changes as previously observed in amyloid or tau models separately. Hippocampal cultures from 3xTg mice were used to determine whether presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporters (VGlut) and glutamate are increased at the synaptic level while controlling for postsynaptic activity. We observed that 3xTg hippocampal cultures exhibited increased VGlut1 associated with an increase in glutamate release, similar to prior observations in cultures from tau mouse models. However, the SV pool size was also increased in 3xTg cultures, an effect not previously observed in tau mouse models but observed in A beta models, suggesting the changes in pool size may be due to A beta and not tau. Second, we sought to determine whether treatment with troriluzole, a novel 3rd generation tripeptide prodrug of the glutamate modulator riluzole, could reduce VGlut1 and glutamate release to restore cognitive deficits in 8-month-old 3xTg mice. Treatment with troriluzole reduced VGlut1 expression, decreased basal and evoked glutamate release, and restored cognitive deficits in 3xTg mice. Together, these findings suggest presynaptic alterations are early events in AD that represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention, and these results support the promise of glutamate-modulating drugs such as troriluzole in Alzheimer's disease.image<br />

AB  - The aim of this study to investigate the effects of melamine exposure from the weaning period on the developing brain in rats. Female Wistar albino rats (21 days old, n = 18) were divided into 3 groups, all animals were weighed daily and dose-adjusted. For 3 weeks, 0.1 mL of saline was administered by oral gavage to the control group, 50 mg/kg of melamine to the second group, and 75 mg/kg of melamine to the third group were administered by oral gavage by dissolving in 0.1 mL of saline. On the postnatal 45th day, the rats were sacrificed under anesthesia and brain tissues placed in neutral formalin. After routine tissue processing, brain sections were stained with hematoxylin&eosin(H&E) and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase(TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling(TUNEL), IBA-1, Glial Fibrillar Acidic Protein(GFAP), Tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), and SMI-70 antibodies as immunohistochemically. In the results, according to apoptotic index(AI) results, there was a significant increase in the 75 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg melamine groups compared to the control groups (p < 005). There was a significant increase in the number of anti- TNF-? positive neurons and the number of anti-GFAP positive astrocytes in both melamine groups compared to the control group (p < 001). In terms of SMI-71, an increase was found in the 75 mg/kg group compared to other groups (p 001), while no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of IBA-1 (p 0.01). there was no statistically significant difference in the body and brain weight between both melamine treatment groups (75 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) and the control group (p 005). Melamine exposure (50 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg) from the weaning period causes apoptosis and inflammation in the developing brain, and the disruptions in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) significantly increase exposure to 75 mg/kg.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, characterized by the abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates in the brain, known as neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques. It is believed that an imbalance between cerebral and peripheral pools of A beta may play a relevant role in the deposition of A beta aggregates. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of the removal of A beta from blood plasma on the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. We performed monthly plasma exchange with a 5% mouse albumin solution in the APP/PS1 mouse model from 3 to 7 months old. At the endpoint, total A beta levels were measured in the plasma, and soluble and insoluble brain fractions were analyzed using ELISA. Brains were also analyzed histologically for amyloid plaque burden, plaque size distributions, and gliosis. Our results showed a reduction in the levels of A beta in the plasma and insoluble brain fractions. Interestingly, histological analysis showed a reduction in thioflavin-S (ThS) and amyloid immunoreactivity in the cortex and hippocampus, accompanied by a change in the size distribution of amyloid plaques, and a reduction in Iba1-positive cells. Our results provide preclinical evidence supporting the relevance of targeting A beta in the periphery and reinforcing the potential use of plasma exchange as an alternative non-pharmacological strategy for slowing down AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Focal cortical infarction leads to secondary degeneration of the ipsilateral hippocampus, which is associated with poststroke cognitive impairment. VX-765 is a potent small-molecule caspase-1 inhibitor that protects against central nervous system diseases. The present study aimed to determine the protective effects of VX-765 on beta-amyloid (A beta) deposition and secondary degeneration in the hippocampus as well as cognitive decline after cortical infarction. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) model and randomly divided into the vehicle and VX-765 groups. Rats in the vehicle and VX-765 groups, respectively, were subcutaneously injected with VX-765 (50 mg/kg/d) and an isopycnic vehicle once a day for 28 days, starting 1 h after dMCAO. At the end of this 28-day period, cognitive impairment was evaluated with the Morris water maze, and secondary hippocampal damage was evaluated with Nissl staining and immunostaining methods. Neuronal damage and pyroptosis were detected by TUNEL and immunoblotting. The results revealed that VX-765 treatment ameliorated poststroke cognitive dysfunction after ischemia. VX-765 reduced A beta deposition, neuronal loss, and glial activation compared with the vehicle control. In addition, VX-765 treatment increased BDNF levels and normalized synaptophysin protein levels in the hippocampus after cortical infarction. Notably, VX-765 treatment significantly reduced the expression of the pyroptosis-related molecules caspase-1, NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), gasdermin D, IL-1 beta, and IL-18. Additionally, VX-765 significantly decreased the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells and the levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 (cC3) and enhanced the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl after ischemia. Inflammatory pathways, such as the NF-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, were inhibited by VX-765 treatment after ischemia. These findings revealed that VX-765 reduced A beta deposition, pyroptosis, and apoptosis in the ipsilateral hippocampus, which may be associated with reduced secondary degeneration and cognitive decline following focal cortical infarction.

AB  - The cholinergic efferent network from the medial septal nucleus to the hippocampus is crucial for learning and memory. This study aimed to clarify whether hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP) has a rescue function in the cholinergic dysfunction of HCNP precursor protein (HCNP-pp) conditional knockout (cKO). Chemically synthesized HCNP or a vehicle were continuously administered into the cerebral ventricle of HCNP-pp cKO mice and littermate floxed (control) mice for two weeks via osmotic pumps. We immunohistochemically measured the cholinergic axon volume in the stratum oriens and functionally evaluated the local field potential in the CA1. Furthermore, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor (TrkA and p75NTR) abundances were quantified in wild-type (WT) mice administered HCNP or the vehicle. As a result, HCNP administration morphologically increased the cholinergic axonal volume and electrophysiological theta power in HCNP-pp cKO and control mice. Following the administration of HCNP to WT mice, TrkA and p75NTR levels also decreased significantly. These data suggest that extrinsic HCNP may compensate for the reduced cholinergic axonal volume and theta power in HCNP-pp cKO mice. HCNP may function complementarily to NGF in the cholinergic network in vivo. HCNP may represent a therapeutic candidate for neurological diseases with cholinergic dysfunction, e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.

AB  - Background. Due to the interactions between neuroinflammation and coagulation, the neural effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (IP), n = 20) and treatment with the anti-thrombotic enoxaparin (1 mg/kg, IP, 15 min, and 12 h following LPS, n = 20) were studied in C57BL/6J mice. Methods. One week after LPS injection, sensory, motor, and cognitive functions were assessed by a hot plate, rotarod, open field test (OFT), and Y-maze. Thrombin activity was measured with a fluorometric assay; hippocampal mRNA expression of coagulation and inflammation factors were measured by real-time-PCR; and serum neurofilament-light-chain (NfL), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured by a single-molecule array (Simoa) assay. Results. Reduced crossing center frequency was observed in both LPS groups in the OFT (p = 0.02), along with a minor motor deficit between controls and LPS indicated by the rotarod (p = 0.057). Increased hippocampal thrombin activity (p = 0.038) and protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) mRNA (p = 0.01) were measured in LPS compared to controls, but not in enoxaparin LPS-treated mice (p = 0.4, p = 0.9, respectively). Serum NfL and TNF-alpha levels were elevated in LPS mice (p < 0.05) and normalized by enoxaparin treatment. Conclusions. These results indicate that inflammation, coagulation, neuronal damage, and behavior are linked and may regulate each other, suggesting another pharmacological mechanism for intervention in neuroinflammation.

AB  - Thus far, many hypotheses have been proposed explaining the cause of depression. Among the most popular of these are: monoamine, neurogenesis, neurobiology, inflammation and stress hypotheses. Many studies have proven that neurogenesis in the brains of adult mammals occurs throughout life. The generation of new neurons persists throughout adulthood in the mammalian brain due to the proliferation and differentiation of adult neural stem cells. For this reason, the search for drugs acting in this mechanism seems to be a priority for modern pharmacotherapy. Paroxetine is one of the most commonly used antidepressants. However, the exact mechanism of its action is not fully understood. The fact that the therapeutic effect after the administration of paroxetine occurs after a few weeks, even if the levels of monoamine are rapidly increased (within a few minutes), allows us to assume a neurogenic mechanism of action. Due to the confirmed dependence of depression on serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid levels, studies have been undertaken into paroxetine interactions with these primary neurotransmitters using in silico and in vitro methods. We confirmed that paroxetine interacts most strongly with monoamine transporters and shows some interaction with gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters. However, studies of the potency inhibitors and binding affinity values indicate that the neurogenic mechanism of paroxetine's action may be determined mainly by its interactions with serotonin transporters.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases remain a major therapeutic challenge in aging populations. Acyl-ghrelin, a 28-amino acid gut hormone, demonstrates neuroprotective effects but is limited by instability, rapid clearance, and non-specific distribution when systemically delivered. Nose-to-brain delivery using nanotechnology offers a promising alternative. Gold nanorods (AuNRs), with high therapeutics loading capacity, are proposed as carriers for intranasal acyl-ghrelin delivery. The previous study demonstrates that intranasal AuNRs effectively reach the brain with minimal systemic exposure. This work investigates the feasibility of using acyl-ghrelin gold nanoconjugates to deliver and retain its pharmacological activity through intranasal administration for neurodegenerative diseases. Acyl-ghrelin is conjugated via its C-terminus to hetero-functional polyethylene glycol (PEG) using EDC/sulfo-NHS coupling chemistry, then attached to AuNRs through stable Au & horbar;S bonds. Reaction conditions are optimized to minimize multi-PEG substitution, preserving acyl-ghrelin bioactivity and preventing AuNR cross-linking. The resulting nanoconjugates successfully deliver ghrelin to the brain, reaching peak levels at 10 min post-administration with approximate to 2067.6 +/- 760.6 pg g-1 of brain, a fourfold increase over native expression. Importantly, the peptide retains biological function, as evidenced by AMPK phosphorylation at 30-60 min, a key marker of ghrelin-induced neuroprotection. These findings support intranasal AuNR-mediated delivery of acyl-ghrelin as a promising strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The present study was aimed at evaluating the influence of the subchronic exposure of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and nickel (Ni) mixtures on affective behaviors, memory impairment, and oxidative stress (OS) in the hippocampus. Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into 5 equal groups. Group 1 (control) received a saline solution (NaCl 0.9%). Groups 2, 3, and 4 received Cd (0.25 mg/kg), Cu (0.5 mg/kg), and Ni (0.25 mg/kg), respectively, while group 5 received a Cd, Cu, and Ni mixture through intraperitoneal injections for 2 months. After the exposure period, all rats were submitted to behavioral tests. Subsequently, OS markers and histological changes in the rats' hippocampi were assessed. Results showed that a 2-month exposure to the mixtures of metals (MM) has led to higher anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors and cognitive deficits in rats when compared to the control group and the individual metals. Furthermore, the MM induced heightened OS, evidenced by the rise in lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide levels. These effects were accompanied by a decrease in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the hippocampus. The histopathological analysis also supported that MM caused a neuronal loss in the CA3 sub-region. Overall, this study underscores that subchronic exposure to the Cd, Cu, and Ni mixture induces an OS status and histological changes in the hippocampus, with important affective and cognitive behavior variations in rats.

AB  - The effects of aging on the nervous system are well documented. However, most previous studies on this topic were performed on the central nervous system. The present study was carried out on the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of mice, and focused on age-related changes in DRG neurons and satellite glial cells (SGCs). Intracellular electrodes were used for dye injection to examine the gap junction-mediated coupling between neurons and SGCs, and for intracellular electrical recordings from the neurons. Tactile sensitivity was assessed with von Frey hairs. We found that 3-23% of DRG neurons were dye-coupled to SGCs surrounding neighboring neurons in 8-24-month (Mo)-old mice, whereas in young adult (3 Mo) mice, the figure was 0%. The threshold current for firing an action potential in sensory neurons was significantly lower in DRGs from 12 Mo mice compared with those from 3 Mo mice. The percentage of neurons with spontaneous subthreshold membrane potential oscillation was greater by two-fold in 12 Mo mice. The withdrawal threshold was lower by 22% in 12 Mo mice compared with 3 Mo ones. These results show that in the aged mice, a proportion of DRG neurons is coupled to SGCs, and that the membrane excitability of the DRG neurons increases with age. We propose that augmented neuron-SGC communications via gap junctions are caused by low-grade inflammation associated with aging, and this may contribute to pain behavior.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and high blood pressure (BP) are prevalent age-related diseases with significant unexplained heritability. A thorough analysis of genetic pleiotropy between AD and BP will lay a foundation for the study of the associated molecular mechanisms, leading to a better understanding of the development of each phenotype. We used the conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method to identify novel genetic loci associated with both AD and BP. The cFDR approach improves the effective sample size for association testing by combining GWAS summary statistics for correlated phenotypes. We identified 50 pleiotropic SNPs for AD and BP, 7 of which are novel and have not previously been reported to be associated with either AD or BP. The novel SNPs located at STK3 are particularly noteworthy, as this gene may influence AD risk via the Hippo signaling network, which regulates cell death. Bayesian colocalization analysis demonstrated that although AD and BP are associated, they do not appear to share the same causal variants. We further performed two sample Mendelian randomization analysis, but could not detect a causal effect of BP on AD. Despite the inability to establish a causal link between AD and BP, our findings report some potential novel pleiotropic loci that may influence disease susceptibility. In summary, we identified 7 SNPs that annotate to 4 novel genes which have not previously been reported to be associated with AD nor with BP and discuss the possible role of one of these genes, STK3 in the Hippo signaling network.

AB  - The ability of endocannabinoid (eCB) to change functional microglial phenotype can be explored as a possible target for therapeutic intervention. Since the inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the main catabolic enzyme of anandamide (AEA), may provide beneficial effects in mice model of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology, we aimed at determining whether the FAAH inhibitor URB597 might target microglia polarization and alter the cytoskeleton reorganization induced by the amyloid-beta peptide (A beta). The morphological evaluation showed that A beta treatment increased the surface area of BV-2 cells, which acquired a flat and polygonal morphology. URB597 treatment partially rescued the control phenotype of BV-2 cells when co-incubated with A beta. Moreover, URB597 reduced both the increase of Rho protein activation in A beta-treated BV-2 cells and the A beta-induced migration of BV-2 cells, while an increase of Cdc42 protein activation was observed in all samples. URB597 also increased the number of BV-2 cells involved in phagocytosis. URB597 treatment induced the polarization of microglial cells towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype, as demonstrated by the decreased expression of iNOS and pro-inflammatory cytokines along with the parallel increase of Arg-1 and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, these data suggest that FAAH inhibition promotes cytoskeleton reorganization, regulates phagocytosis and cell migration processes, thus driving microglial polarization towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype.

AB  - Midlife overweight and obesity are risk factors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer' s disease (AD) in late life. In addition to increasing risk of obesity and cognitive dysfunction, diets rich in fats also contributes to an imbalance of gut microbiota. Xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) are a kind of prebiotic with several biological advantages, and can selectively promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the gut. To explore whether XOS can alleviate cognitive decline induced by high -fat diet (HFD) through improving gut microbiota composition, mice were fed with normal control or 60% HFD for 9 weeks to induce obesity. After that, mice were supplemented with XOS (30 g or 60 g/kg-diet) or without, respectively, for 12 weeks. The results showed that XOS inhibited weight gain, decreased epidydimal fat weight, and improved fasting blood sugar and blood lipids in mice. Additionally, XOS elevated spatial learning and memory function, decreased amyloid plaques accumulation, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and improved neuroinflammation status in hippocampus. Changes in glycerolipids metabolism-associated lipid compounds caused by HFD in hippocampus were reversed after XOS intervention. On the other hand, after XOS intervention, increase in immune-mediated bacteria, Faecalibacterium was observed. In conclusion, XOS improved gut dysbiosis and ameliorated spatial learning and memory dysfunction caused by HFD by decreasing cognitive decline-associated biomarkers and changing lipid composition in hippocampus.

AB  - Khat (Catha edulis) is an evergreen shrub whose buds and leaves give a state of delight and euphoria when chewed. Cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant that is among the active ingredients in khat, is able to downregulate glutamate transporter subtype I (GLT-1). Neurobehavioral dysfunctions such as altered locomotor activity, anorexia, and nociception have been observed in animals exposed to cathinone. Interestingly, treatment with a beta-lactam antibiotic such as ceftriaxone, which upregulates GLT-1, normalizes cathinone-induced conditioned place preference, and alters repetitive movements in rats. However, little is known about the role of the glutamatergic system in memory dysfunction and anxiety-like behaviors in mice exposed to khat. We found here that clavulanic acid, a beta-lactam-containing compound and GLT-1 upregulator, would modulate the neurobehavioral changes, including memory impairment and anxiety-like behaviors, associated with repeated exposure of mice to khat. Our data supported that clavulanic acid could improve memory impairment and anxiety-like behaviors through upregulating GLT-1 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), an effect abolished with a selective GLT-1 blocker. This upregulation was associated with restored glutamate/cystine antiporter expression in the NAc using a Western blotting assay. Cathine and cathinone were identified in khat extract using the gas chromatography technique. Our work provides preclinical insight into the efficacy of beta-lactam-containing compounds for the attenuation of neurobehavioral changes induced by khat exposure.

TI  - Impaired Hippocampal Long-Term Potentiation and Memory Deficits upon Haploinsufficiency of MDGA1 Can Be Rescued by Acute Administration of D-Cycloserine

AB  - The maintenance of proper brain function relies heavily on the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits, governed in part by synaptic adhesion molecules. Among these, MDGA1 (MAM domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 1) acts as a suppressor of synapse formation by interfering with Neuroligin-mediated interactions, crucial for maintaining the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance. Mdga1-/- mice exhibit selectively enhanced inhibitory synapse formation in their hippocampal pyramidal neurons, leading to impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory function; however, it has not been fully investigated yet if the reduction in MDGA1 protein levels would alter brain function. Here, we examined the behavioral and synaptic consequences of reduced MDGA1 protein levels in Mdga1+/- mice. As observed in Mdga1-/- mice, Mdga1+/- mice exhibited significant deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks, such as the Morris water maze and contextual fear-conditioning tests, along with a significant deficit in the long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses. The acute administration of D-cycloserine, a co-agonist of NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor), significantly ameliorated memory impairments and restored LTP deficits specifically in Mdga1+/- mice, while having no such effect on Mdga1-/- mice. These results highlight the critical role of MDGA1 in regulating inhibitory synapse formation and maintaining the E/I balance for proper cognitive function. These findings may also suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting the E/I imbalance to alleviate cognitive deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Neurologic manifestations are an immediate consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, which, however, may also trigger long-term neurological effects. Notably, COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms show elevated levels of biomarkers associated with brain injury, including Tau proteins linked to Alzheimer's pathology. Studies in brain organoids revealed that SARS-CoV-2 alters the phosphorylation and distribution of Tau in infected neurons, but the mechanisms are currently unknown. We hypothesize that these pathological changes are due to the recruitment of Tau into stress granules (SGs) operated by the nucleocapsid protein (NCAP) of SARS-CoV-2. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether NCAP interacts with Tau and localizes to SGs in hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we tested whether SUMOylation, a posttranslational modification of NCAP and Tau, modulates their distribution in SGs and their pathological interaction. We found that NCAP and Tau colocalize and physically interact. We also found that NCAP induces hyperphosphorylation of Tau and causes cognitive impairment in mice infected with NCAP in their hippocampus. Finally, we found that SUMOylation modulates NCAP SG formation in vitro and cognitive performance in infected mice. Our data demonstrate that NCAP induces Tau pathological changes both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that SUMO2 ameliorates NCAP-induced Tau pathology, highlighting the importance of the SUMOylation pathway as a target of intervention against neurotoxic insults, such as Tau oligomers and viral infection.

AB  - Insulin signaling disruption and caspase-3 cleavage play a pathologic role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence suggested that cinnamaldehyde (Cin), the major component of cinnamon, has the ability to act as a neuroprotective agent. However, little evidence is available to demonstrate its effectiveness in regulating the insulin and caspase-3 signaling pathways and underlying molecular mechanisms. Therefore, the present study was conducted to correlate the molecular mechanisms of these signaling pathways and Cin treatment on animal behavioral performance in an intracerebroventricular (ICV)-streptozotocin (STZ, 3 mg/kg) model. The sporadic AD rat model was treated with Cin (10 and 100 mg/kg; intraperitoneal, i.p) daily for 2 weeks. Novel object recognition (NOR), Morris water maze (MWM), and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests were performed to assess recognition/spatial memory and anxiety-like behavior, respectively. Hippocampal A beta aggregation was assessed using Congo red staining. The activity of hippocampal caspase-3 and IRS-1/Akt/GSK-3 beta signaling pathways were analyzed using the Western blot technique. The results revealed that Cin (100 mg/kg, effective dose) improved recognition/spatial memory deficits and anxiety-like behavior. In addition, Cin negated the effects of STZ on Ap aggregation and caspase-3 cleavage in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the Western blot method showed that hippocampal IRS-1/AKT/GSK-3 beta phosphorylation was altered in ICV-STZ animal model, while Cin modulated this signaling pathway through decreasing Phospho.IRS-1(ser307)/Total. IRS-1 ratio and also increasing Phospho.Akt(ser473)/Total.Akt and Phospho.GSK-3 beta(ser9)/Total.GSK-3 beta ratios. These findings suggest that Cin is involved in the regulation of hippocampal IRS-1/AKT/GSK-3 beta and caspase-3 pathways in a sporadic AD model, and modulation of these signaling pathways also influences the animal behavioral performance.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the influence of sex/age on depressive-like behaviors in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice model, and explore the underlying mechanisms. Tail suspension test and forced swimming test were used to evaluate the depressive-like behaviors. SIRT1 mRNA expression was assessed by PCR. Levels of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), SIRT1, NF-kappa B, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the behavior tests, under the same LPS stimulation, significant depressive-like behavior was observed in young male mice but not in young female mice, however, female mice were more likely to be depressed than male mice in the old age. Moreover, we found agerelated depression difference existed only in female mice. In the experiments of mechanism exploration in old female mice, E2 improved LPS-induced depressive-like behavior, and simultaneously elevated SIRT1 levels and downregulated expressions of NF-kappa B and inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Interestingly, ER alpha inhibition, not ER beta inhibition, abolished E2's function. Additionally, SIRT1 antagonist also reversed E2's effects on depressive-like behavior and the expressions of NF-kappa B and inflammatory cytokines. These results suggested that E2 could protect the old female mice from depression via E2/ER alpha/SIRT1/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In other words, LPS-induced depression was associated with ER-alpha/SIRT1/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in old female mice. By comparing the results of mechanism exploration in old male mice and old female mice and the different expression levels of E2, SIRT1, NF-kappa B and inflammatory cytokines in young female mice and old female mice, we speculate that the age or gender-related depression difference may be associated with the different activation levels of the ER alpha/SIRT1/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent mode of cell death associated with the occurrence and development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective drugs available to prevent or treat these aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. Vitamin D (VD) is an antioxidant and immunomodulator, but its relationship with ferroptosis in aging-related neurodegenerative diseases has not been extensively studied. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of VD in learning and memory in aging mice. To examine whether VD protects aging hippocampal neurons, we used physiologically active 1,25(OH)2D3. We established aging models in vivo (C57BL/6 mice) and in vitro (HT22 cells) using D-galactose (D-gal). The results demonstrated that VD could improve learning and memory in mice aged via the use of D-gal, and it reduced damage to hippocampal neurons. VD could regulate ferroptosis-related proteins (increasing GPX4 expression and decreasing ACSL4 and ALOX15 protein expression levels), increasing GSH levels, reducing MDA and intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels, as well as total iron and Fe2+ levels, and improving mitochondrial morphology, thereby alleviating ferroptosis in aging hippocampal neurons. Additionally, VD activated the VDR/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis. Notably, when the VDR was knocked down, VD lost its ability to activate Nrf2. Consequently, inhibiting Nrf2 decreased the protective effect of VD against ferroptosis in aged hippocampal neurons. In summary, VD activates the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway through the VDR, effectively preventing ferroptosis induced by aging in hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Obesity in middle age increases AD risk and severity, which is alarming given that obesity prevalence peaks at middle age and obesity rates are accelerating worldwide. Midlife, but not late-life obesity increases AD risk, suggesting that this interaction is specific to preclinical AD. AD pathology begins in middle age, with accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta), hyperphosphorylated tau, metabolic decline, and neuroinflammation occurring decades before cognitive symptoms appear. We used a transcriptomic discovery approach in young adult (6.5 months old) male and female TgF344-AD rats that overexpress mutant human amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 and wild-type (WT) controls to determine whether inducing obesity with a high-fat/high-sugar "Western" diet during preclinical AD increases brain metabolic dysfunction in dorsal hippocampus (dHC), a brain region vulnerable to the effects of obesity and early AD. Analyses of dHC gene expression data showed dysregulated mitochondrial and neurotransmission pathways, and up-regulated genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. Western diet amplified the number of genes that were different between AD and WT rats and added pathways involved in noradrenergic signaling, dysregulated inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, and decreased intracellular lipid transporters. Importantly, the Western diet impaired dHC-dependent spatial working memory in AD but not WT rats, confirming that the dietary intervention accelerated cognitive decline. To examine later consequences of early transcriptional dysregulation, we measured dHC monoamine levels in older (13 months old) AD and WT rats of both sexes after long-term chow or Western diet consumption. Norepinephrine (NE) abundance was significantly decreased in AD rats, NE turnover was increased, and the Western diet attenuated the AD-induced increases in turnover. Collectively, these findings indicate obesity during prodromal AD impairs memory, potentiates AD-induced metabolic decline likely leading to an overproduction of cholesterol, and interferes with compensatory increases in NE transmission.

AB  - Mutations in PSEN1 were first discovered as a cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 1995, yet the mechanism(s) by which the mutations cause disease still remains unknown. The generation of novel mouse models assessing the effects of different mutations could aid in this endeavor. Here we report on transgenic mouse lines made with the Delta 440 PSEN1 mutation that causes AD with parkinsonism:- two expressing the un-tagged human protein and two expressing a HA-tagged version. Detailed characterization of these lines showed that Line 305 in particular, which expresses the untagged protein, develops age-dependent memory deficits and pathologic features, many of which are consistent with features found in AD. Key behavioral and physiological alterations found in the novel 305 line included an age-dependent deficit in spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze, a decrease in exploration of the center of an open field box, a decrease in the latency to fall on a rotarod, a reduction in synaptic strength and pair-pulse facilitation by electrophysiology, and profound alterations to cerebral blood flow regulation. The pathologic alterations found in the line included, significant neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cortex, astrogliosis, and changes in several proteins involved in synaptic and mitochondrial function, Ca2+ regulation, and autophagy. Taken together, these findings suggest that the transgenic lines will be useful for the investigation of AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Natural matrices have historically been a cornerstone in drug discovery, offering a rich source of structurally diverse and biologically active compounds. However, research on natural products often faces significant challenges due to the complexity of natural matrices, such as urine, and the limitations of bioactivity assessment assays. To ensure reliable insights, it is crucial to optimize experimental conditions to reveal the bioactive potential of samples, thereby improving the validity of statistical analyses. Approaches in metabolomics further strengthen this process by identifying and focusing on the most promising compounds within natural matrices, enhancing the precision of bioactive metabolite prioritization. In this study, we assessed the bioactivity of 17 dromedary urine samples on human renal cells under serum-reduced conditions (1%FBS) in order to minimize possible FBS-derived interfering factors. Using viability assays and Annexin V/PI staining, we found that the tumor renal cell lines Caki-1 and RCC-Shaw were more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the small molecules present in dromedary urine compared to non-tumor HK-2 cells. Employing NMR metabolomics analysis combined with detected in vitro activity, our statistical model highlights the presence of bioactive compounds in dromedary urine, such as azelaic acid and phenylacetyl glycine, underscoring its potential as a sustainable source of bioactive molecules within the framework of green chemistry and circular economy initiatives.

AB  - Neuroactive steroids (i.e., sex steroid hormones and neurosteroids) are important physiological regulators of nervous function and potential neuroprotective agents for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Sex is an important component of such effects. However, even if fluctuations in sex steroid hormone level during the menstrual cycle are associated with neuropathological events in some women, the neuroactive steroid pattern in the brain across the ovarian cycle has been poorly explored. Therefore, we assessed the levels of pregnenolone, progesterone, and its metabolites (i.e., dihydroprogesterone, allopregnanolone and isoallopregnanolone), dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone and its metabolites (i.e., dihydrotestosterone, 3 alpha-diol and 17(3-estradiol) across the rat ovarian cycle to determine whether their plasma fluctuations are similar to those occurring in the central (i.e., hippocampus and cerebral cortex) and peripheral (i.e., sciatic nerve) nervous system. Data obtained indicate that the plasma pattern of these molecules generally does not fully reflect the events occurring in the nervous system. In addition, for some neuroactive steroid levels, the pattern is not identical between the two brain regions and between the brain and peripheral nerves. Indeed, with the exception of progesterone, all other neuroactive steroids assessed here showed peculiar regional differences in their pattern of fluctuation in the nervous system during the estrous cycle. These observations may have important diagnostic and therapeutic consequences for neuropathological events influenced by the menstrual cycle.

AB  - Objective: To identify early follicular phase microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) that are altered in serum of women with endometriosis. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Large university-affiliated in vitro fertilization center. Patient(s): Women with (n = 21) and without (n = 24) endometriosis. Intervention(s): Serum samples were obtained from laparoscopy-confirmed patients with endometriosis. Main Outcome Measure(s): The differential expression of serum miRNAs relative to controls was measured using the NanoString nCounter technology and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in an independent cohort of 27 patients with endometriosis and controls (n = 24). Microribonucleic acid target signaling pathways and genes were analyzed bioinformatically. A chemically modified stable miR-34-3p oligonucleotide was used to examine the effect on proliferation of VK2E6/E7 endometrial cells in vitro. Result(s): Eighteen miRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and 1 miRNA (hsa-miR-34c-3p) was significantly down-regulated in the follicular phase of patients with endometriosis. The analysis of target signaling pathways using TargetScan predicted regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B, Hippo, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, transforming growth factor beta, and endometrial cancer pathways, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, by these miRNAs. The analysis of sequence complementarity identified prostaglandin E2 receptor 4, interleukin 6 signal transducer, and polo-like kinase 4 genes as possible direct targets of hsa-miR-34-3p. DSDI-1, a chemically modified stable miR-34-3p oligonucleotide, reduced cell proliferation in VK2E6/E7 endometrial cells in vitro. Conclusion(s): The follicular phase miRNA levels are altered in serum of women with endometriosis and may be useful as reproducible detection biomarkers for early diagnosis of endometriosis. hsa-miR-34-3p is significantly down-regulated in endometriosis, targets endometriosis genes, and reduces endometrial cell proliferation in vitro. These results support hsa-miR-34-3p as a potential therapeutic target in endometriosis. (Fertil Steril Sci (R) 2022;3:269-78. (c) 2022 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

AB  - Oxidative stress is a pivotal driver of epileptogenesis and seizure-induced neuronal pathology, with NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) serving as a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain. Despite its established role in seizure pathophysiology, the therapeutic implications of selective NOX2 inhibition in epilepsy remain insufficiently explored. Here, we investigate the effect of GSK2795039, a potent NOX2 inhibitor, using both in vitro and in vivo epilepsy models. In vitro, mixed cortical neuroglial cultures were treated with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and picrotoxin (PTX) to induce epileptiform activity. Calcium imaging and dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence assays revealed that GSK2795039 significantly reduced synchronous Ca2+ oscillations and ROS accumulation. In vivo, adult rats implanted with ECoG transmitters were pretreated with GSK2795039 prior to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) administration to evoke seizures. ECoG recording and behavioral seizure scoring showed that GSK2795039 pretreatment inhibited the seizure severity, duration and cumulative seizure burden. Molecular analyses, including quantitative PCR and western blotting, revealed a significant downregulation of NOX2 mRNA in both the hippocampus and cortex, although protein levels remained unchanged. Additionally, immunofluorescence and histological staining confirmed that GSK2795039 mitigated oxidative DNA damage, preserved hippocampal neuronal integrity, and differentially modulated pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. These findings underscore NOX2 inhibition as a compelling neuroprotective strategy and highlight the potential of GSK2795039 to suppress oxidative and inflammatory cascades in epilepsy. Targeting NOX2 may represent a promising avenue for precision therapeutics in oxidative stress-driven epilepsy.

AB  - Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a global public health problem and is frequently comorbid with mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death, which is involved in the pathological process of various diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, but the role of ferroptosis in the mediation of AUD and its induced mental disorders is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether ferroptosis was involved in alcohol-induced depressive and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Following an 8-week period of intermittent alcohol exposure, the alcohol group showed noticeable depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. In addition, nissl staining revealed that alcohol exposure induced neuron damage in the hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice. The levels of synapse-related proteins were significantly reduced in the alcohol group. Iron staining demonstrated that alcohol increased the number of iron-positive staining cells. The protein expression of the transferrin receptor (TFRC) was increased, and the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was decreased, respectively, in the alcohol group. Furthermore, the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 significantly prevented alcohol-induced neuron damage and enhanced the expression of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor 2B (NR2B), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor 1 (GluA1) and GPX4 in vitro. These results indicated that alcohol exposure could induce depressive and anxiety-like behaviors, and that this effect may occur via activating ferroptosis.

AB  - An early and persistent sign of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is glucose hypometabolism, which can be evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([F-18]FDG). Cannabidiol has demonstrated neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties but has not been evaluated by PET imaging in an AD model. Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ) is a validated model for hypometabolism observed in AD. This proof-of-concept study evaluated the effect of cannabidiol treatment in the brain glucose metabolism of an icv-STZ AD model by PET imaging. Wistar male rats received 3 mg/kg of STZ and [F-18]FDG PET images were acquired before and 7 days after STZ injection. Animals were treated with intraperitoneal cannabidiol (20 mg/kg-STZ-cannabidiol) or saline (STZ-saline) for one week. Novel object recognition was performed to evaluate short-term and long-term memory. [F-18]FDG uptake in the whole brain was significantly lower in the STZ-saline group. Voxel-based analysis revealed a hypometabolism cluster close to the lateral ventricle, which was smaller in STZ-cannabidiol animals. The brain regions with more evident hypometabolism were the striatum, motor cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, which was not observed in STZ-cannabidiol animals. In addition, STZ-cannabidiol animals revealed no changes in memory index. Thus, this study suggests that cannabidiol could be an early treatment for the neurodegenerative process observed in AD.

AB  - Vascular development is essential for the establishment of the circulatory system during embryonic development and requires the proliferation of endothelial cells. However, the underpinning regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report that geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), a metabolite involved in protein geranylgeranylation, plays an indispensable role in embryonic vascular development. GGPP is synthesized by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS) in the mevalonate pathway. The selective knockout of Ggpps in endothelial cells led to aberrant vascular development and embryonic lethality, resulting from the decreased proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of endothelial cells during vasculogenesis. The defect in protein geranylgeranylation induced by GGPP depletion inhibited the membrane localization of RhoA and enhanced yes-associated protein (YAP) phosphorylation, thereby prohibiting the entry of YAP into the nucleus and the expression of YAP target genes related to cell proliferation and the antiapoptosis process. Moreover, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by simvastatin induced endothelial cell proliferation defects and apoptosis, which were ameliorated by GGPP. Geranylgeraniol (GGOH), a precursor of GGPP, ameliorated the harmful effects of simvastatin on vascular development of developing fetuses in pregnant mice. These results indicate that GGPP-mediated protein geranylgeranylation is essential for endothelial cell proliferation and the antiapoptosis process during embryonic vascular development.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a life disabling, multisystem neuropsychiatric disease mostly derived from complex epigenetic-mediated neurobiological changes causing behavioural deficits. Neurochemical disorganizations, neurotrophic and neuroimmune alterations are some of the challenging neuropathologies proving unabated during psychopharmacology of schizophrenia, further bedeviled by drug-induced metabolic derangements including alteration of amino acids. In first-episode schizophrenia patients, taurine, an essential beta-amino acid represses psychotic-symptoms. However, its anti-psychotic-like mechanisms remain incomplete. This study evaluated the ability of taurine to prevent or reverse ketamine-induced experimental psychosis and the underlying neurochemical, neurotrophic and neuroinmune mechanisms involved in taurine's clinical action. The study consisted of three different experiments with Swiss mice (n = 7). In the drug alone, mice received saline (10 mL/kg/p.o./day), taurine (50 and 100 mg/kg/p.o./day) and risperidone (0.5 mg/kg/p.o./day) for 14 days. In the preventive study of separate cohort, mice were concomitantly given ketamine (20 mg/kg/i.p./day) from days 8 to 14. In the reversal study, mice received ketamine for 14 days before taurine or risperidone treatments from days 8 to 14 respectively. Afterwards, stereotypy behaviour, social, non-spatial memory deficits, and body weights were assessed. Neurochemical (dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, glutamic acid decarboxylase, (GAD)), brain derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6, (IL-6)] were assayed in the striatum, prefrontal-cortex and hippocampal area. Taurine attenuates ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like behaviour without changes in body weight. Taurine reduced ketamine-induced dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine changes, and increased GAD and BDNF levels in the striatum, prefrontal-cortex and hippocampus, suggesting increased GABAergic and neurotrophic transmissions. Taurine decreases ketamine-induced increased in TNF-alpha and IL-6 concentrations in the striatum, prefrontal-cortex and hippocampus. These findings also suggest that taurine protects against schizophrenia through neurochemical modulations, neurotrophic enhancement, and inhibition of neuropathologic cytokine activities.

AB  - Purpose: Nitric oxide (NO) is an important messenger molecule widely present in the human body. However, the role of nasal NO (nNO) in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (Eos CRSwNP) remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value and underlying mechanism of nNO in Eos CRSwNP.Methods: The medical records of 84 non-Eos CRSwNP patients, 55 Eos CRSwNP patients, and 37 control subjects were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnostic value of nNO for Eos CRSwNP was assessed. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and tight junctions (TJs) components claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 was detected in the nasal polyps. Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) were co-treated with eNOS inhibitor (L-NAME) or Akt inhibitor (MK-2206), interleukin (IL)-13, and dexamethasone (Dex). The level of NO and the expression of TJs and Akt/eNOS pathways were examined.Results: The nNO levels of the CRSwNP group were significantly lower than those of the control group. Compared with the non-Eos CRSwNP group, the Eos CRSwNP group showed higher nNO level. The combination of nNO level, eosinophilic percentage, and posterior ethmoid score had a better predictive value for Eos CRSwNP (AUC = 0.855). The expression of iNOS, eNOS, and p-eNOS was higher in the CRSwNP groups than in the control group, and p-eNOS expression was higher in the Eos CRSwNP group than in the non-Eos CRSwNP group. The expression of TJs was lower in the Eos CRSwNP group than in the non-Eos CRSwNP and control group. IL-13 decreased TJ expression in HNECs, while Dex promoted Akt and eNOS phosphorylation, NO production and TJ expression. Furthermore, these effects of Dex were inhibited by L-NAME and MK-2206 in HNECs.Conclusion: nNO may have a high diagnostic value in Eos CRSwNP, and Akt/eNOS pathway may promote the generation of NO to protect TJs. NO may have a potentially important role in the diagnosis and treatment of Eos CRSwNP.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a common complication associated with the use of chemotherapeutics. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing anticancer agent capable of causing potential neurotoxic effects via cytokine-induced oxidative and nitrosative damage to brain tissues. On the other hand, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a nutritional supplement, is reputable for its excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities. Consequently, the objective of the current investigation was to examine any potential neuroprotective and memory-improving benefits of ALA against DOX-induced behavioral and neurological anomalies. DOX (2 mg/kg/week, i.p.) was administrated for 4 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats. ALA (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) was administered for 4 weeks. The Morris water maze (MWM) and novel objective recognition task (NORT) tests were used to assess memory function. Biochemical assays with UV-visible spectrophotometry were used to analyze oxidative stress markers [malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonylation (PCO)], endogenous antioxidants [reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)] and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in hippocampal tissue. Inflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)], nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (NRF-2) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured in hippocampus tissue using 2-7-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay with fluorimetry. ALA treatment significantly protected against DOX-induced memory impairment. Furthermore, ALA restored hippocampal antioxidants, halted DOX-induced oxidative and inflammatory insults via upregulation of NRF-2/HO-1 levels, and alleviated the increase in NF-kappa B expression. These results indicate that ALA offers neuroprotection against DOX-induced cognitive impairment, which could be attributed to its antioxidant potential via the NRF-2/HO-1 signaling pathway.

AB  - The mechanisms of ictal discharge initiation remain incompletely understood, particularly the paradoxical role of inhibitory fast-spiking interneurons in seizure generation. Using simultaneous whole-cell recordings of interneurons and pyramidal neurons combined with extracellular [K+]o monitoring in mouse entorhinal cortex-hippocampal slices (4-aminopyridine model of epileptiform activity), we identified a critical transition sequence: interneurons displayed high-frequency firing during the preictal phase before entering depolarization block (DB). DB onset coincided with the peak of rate of extracellular [K+] accumulation. Pyramidal cells remained largely silent during interneuronal hyperactivity but started firing within 1.1 +/- 0.3 s after DB onset, marking the transition to ictal discharges. This consistent sequence (interneuron DB -> [K+]o rate peak -> pyramidal cell firing) was observed in 100% of entorhinal cortex recordings. Importantly, while neurons across all entorhinal cortical layers synchronously fired during the first ictal discharge, hippocampal CA1 neurons showed fundamentally different activity: they generated high-frequency interictal bursts but did not participate in ictal events, indicating region-specific seizure initiation mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that interneuron depolarization block acts as a precise temporal switch for ictogenesis and suggest that the combined effect of disinhibition and K+-mediated depolarization triggers synchronous pyramidal neuron recruitment. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for seizure initiation in focal epilepsy, highlighting fast-spiking interneurons dysfunction as a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common complication of severe sepsis. Irisin is a novel exercise induced myokine involved in the regulation of adipose browning and thermogenesis. This study is designed to verify the existence of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of SAE and demonstrate that irisin attenuated cognitive dysfunction in SAE mice via inhibition of hippocampus ferroptosis. A mouse SAE model was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and in vitro model was established by LPS-stimulated hippocampus cells. Irisin were pre-treated in the models. We found that SAE triggered hippocampus ferroptosis, as evidenced by increasing ROS, iron content and MDA and reducing GSH level as well as altered ferroptosis-related protein (GPX4, ACSL4 and SLC7A11) expression, whereas irisin attenuated CLP-induced learning and memory dysfunction, neurologic severity score and hippocampus ferroptosis and microglial activation in SAE mice. However, the protective effect of irisin was eliminated by ferroptosis inducer Erastin. Consistently, irisin reduced ferroptosis and improved mitochondrial dysfunction in LPS-induced HT-22 cells, as evidenced by decreased lipid ROS and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, proteomics identified the differentially expressed proteins linked to ferroptosis in SAE. We also observed that irisin-mediated anti-ferroptosis was abolished by siRNA-Nrf2 or in Nrf2-/-mice. Transwell assay revealed that irisin could prevent the recruitment and chemotaxis of microglial cells induced by ferroptotic hippocampal cells. In conclusion, irisin could ameliorate inflammatory microenvironment in SAE by suppressing hippocampus ferroptosis via the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Synaptic dysfunction is an established early symptom, which correlates strongly with cognitive decline, and is hypothesised to mediate the diverse neuronal network abnormalities observed in AD. However, how synaptic dysfunction contributes to network pathology and cognitive impairment in AD remains elusive. Here, we present a grid-cell-to-place-cell transformation model of long-term CA1 place cell dynamics to interrogate the effect of synaptic loss on network function and environmental representation. Synapse loss modelled after experimental observations in the APP/PS1 mouse model was found to induce firing rate alterations and place cell abnormalities that have previously been observed in AD mouse models, including enlarged place fields and lower across-session stability of place fields. Our results support the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits, and demonstrate how impaired environmental representation may arise in the early stages of AD. We further propose that dysfunction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells may cause distinct impairments in place cell function, namely reduced stability and place map resolution.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a typical type-2 inflammation involving several cytokines and is associated with epithelial cell dysfunction. Oncostatin M (OSM) (belonging to the interleukin(IL)-6 family) could be a key driver of epithelial barrier dysfunction. Therefore, we investigated the presence of OSM and IL-6 and the expression pattern of tight junctions (TJs) in the nasal tissue of CRSwNP patients and controls using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. Then, their potential role in the epithelial barrier was evaluated in vitro in 27 different primary cultures of human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) by measuring TJ expression and transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) with or without OSM or IL-6 (1, 10, and 100 ng/mL). The effect on ciliary beating efficiency was evaluated by high-speed videomicroscopy and on repair mechanisms with a wound healing model with or without OSM. OSM and IL-6 were both overexpressed, and TJ (ZO-1 and occludin) expression was decreased in the nasal polyps compared to the control mucosa. OSM (100 ng/mL) but not IL-6 induced a significant decrease in TJ expression, TEER, and ciliary beating efficiency in HNECs. After 24 h, the wound repair rate was significantly higher in OSM-stimulated HNECs at 100 ng/mL. These results suggest that OSM could become a new target for monoclonal antibodies.

AB  - In the central nervous system, some specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms modulate pathways involved in neuronal plasticity. Accumulating evidence suggests that PDE9 may be a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases. In the current study, computational techniques were used to identify a nature-inspired PDE9 inhibitor bearing the scaffold of an isoflavone, starting from a database of synthetic small molecules using a ligand-based approach. Furthermore, docking studies supported by molecular dynamics investigations allowed us to evaluate the features of the ligand-target complex. In vitro assays confirmed the computational results, showing that the selected compound inhibits the enzyme in the nanomolar range. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of gene and protein levels of PDE9 in organotypic hippocampal slices, observing an increase following exposure to kainate (KA). Importantly, the PDE9 inhibitor reduced CA3 damage induced by KA in a dose-dependent manner in organotypic hippocampal slices. Taken together, these observations strongly support the potential of the identified nature-inspired PDE9 inhibitor and suggest that such a molecule could represent a promising lead compound to develop novel therapeutic tools against neurological diseases..

AB  - Leucine is a common nutritional supplement, and recently, research concerned with the improvement role of leucine in neuropsychiatric disorders has been increasingly emphasized. However, it is unclear what role leucine plays in depression. In this study, the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model was used to simulate depression associated with social avoidance in humans. CSDS mice display a depressive state and social avoidance behavior. Untargeted serum metabolomics and pathway analysis indicated that abnormal amino acid metabolism may be the key to abnormal behavior in CSDS mice. Among these metabolites, leucine shows a specific and significant positive correlation with social interaction rate. Targeted metabolomics determine the decreased level of leucine and related metabolites in the serum and hippocampus of CSDS mice. Moreover, immunohistochemical results also indicate an increasing expression of IDO1 in hippocampal tissues in CSDS mice, and neurons may be damaged. Subsequently, leucine was administered to investigate its influence on CSDS mice, and the results revealed that leucine had a good effect on depressive states and social avoidance behaviors. Taken together, we aim to identify the important role of leucine as a functional food supplement to improve depression and social avoidance behavior through the above findings.

AB  - Amyloid ?-peptides (A?) are considered as a major hallmark of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) that can induce synaptic loss and apoptosis in brain regions, particularly in the cortex and the hippocampus. Evidence suggests that crocin, as the major component of saffron, can exhibit neuromodulatory effects in AD. However, specific data related to their efficacy to attenuate the synaptic loss and neuronal death in animal models of AD are limited. Hence, we investigated the efficacy of crocin in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus and also in frontal cortex neurons employing a rat model of AD. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control, sham, AD model, crocin, and AD model + crocin groups, with 8 rats per group. AD model was established by injecting A?1?42 into the frontal cortex rats, and thereafter the rats were administrated by crocin (30 mg/kg) for a duration of 12-day. The number of live cells, neuronal arborization and apoptosis were measured using a Cresyl violet, Golgi-Cox and TUNEL staining, respectively. Results showed that, the number of live cells in the hippocampus pyramidal neurons in the CA3 and granular cells in the DG regions of the AD rats significantly decreased, which was significantly rescued by crocin. Compared with the control group, the axonal, spine and dendrites arborization in the frontal cortex and CA3 region of the AD model group significantly decreased. The crocin could significantly reverse this arborization loss in the AD rats (P < 0.05). The apoptotic cell number in the CA3 and DG regions in the AD model group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05), while crocin significantly decreased the apoptotic cell number in the AD group (P < 0.05). Conclusion. Crocin can improve the synaptic loss and neuronal death of the AD rats possibly by reducing the neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - Lanthanum can induce neurotoxicity and impair cognitive function; therefore, research on the mechanism by which the ability to learning and memory is decreased by lanthanum is vitally important for protecting health. Microglia are a type of neuroglia located throughout the brain and spinal cord that play an important role in the central nervous system. When overactive, these cells can cause the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines that can damage neighboring neurons. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of lanthanum in the form of lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) on learning and the memory of mice and determine whether there is a relationship between hippocampal neurons or learning and memory damage and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines. Four groups of pregnant Chinese Kun Ming mice were exposed to 0, 18, 36, or 72 mM LaCl3 in their drinking water during lactation. The offspring were then exposed to LaCl3 in the breast milk at birth until weaning and then exposed to these concentrations in their drinking water for 2 months after weaning. The results showed that LaCl3 impaired learning and memory in mice and injured their neurons, activated the microglia, and significantly overregulated the mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and nitric oxide in the hippocampus. The results of this study suggest that lanthanum can impair learning and memory in mice, possibly by over-activating the microglia.

AB  - The Hippo pathway mediates renal maladaptive repair after acute kidney injury (AKI), which has been considered a driving force in the progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). LATS2, a core kinase of the Hippo pathway, exerts non-Hippo-dependent functions in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell fate, providing new insights into AKI and further repair. However, its role remains unknown. Here, we utilized a proximal tubular Lats2 conditional knockout mouse strain (Lats2-CKO) to evaluate the effect of LATS2 deficiency on ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI-to-CKD transition. Lats2-CKO mice presented with more severe tubular maladaptive repair, inflammatory infiltration, interstitial fibrosis, and apoptosis following AKI. Importantly, we discovered that Lats2 ablation caused the activation of p53, with increased levels of cellular apoptotic molecules (p21, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3), and decreased levels of anti-apoptotic molecules (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL). Pifithirin-alpha (p53 inhibitor) effectively attenuated renal fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in Lats2-CKO mice after AKI. Consistently, in vitro Lats2 overexpression decreased p53, p21, Bax and cleaved caspase 3 expression after hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) treatment. Of note, the phosphorylation of MDM2, which promotes the ubiquitination degradation of p53, at site Ser186 was decreased in Lats2-CKO kidneys, but increased by Lats2 overexpression in vitro. Therefore, LATS2 deficiency aggravated ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced maladaptive repair via regulating the tubular MDM2-p53 axis in AKI-to-CKD transition.

AB  - Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCh)-peptide conjugates were produced by grafting CMCh with peptides from hemp seed, maize and casein. The nanoemulsions stabilized by these conjugates had smaller droplet size and better emulsifying properties. Nanoemulsions stabilized by conjugates were used to develop active films containing Camellia essential oil and the effect of conjugation on physicochemical properties of resulting films was evaluated. Water vapor and oxygen barrier properties, tensile strength, flexibility, and temperature of endothermic peak increased 6.6-19.8% and 6.9-27.2%, 40.1-96.6%, 61.4-83.3% and 7.8-18.5%, respectively when the CMCh-peptide conjugates were used to emulsify the essential oil. The conjugation helped to form compact structure. All of the films containing essential oil emulsions stabilized by conjugates showed the ability to extend the shelf-life of blueberry by maintaining the firmness, reducing the weight loss and slowing down the formation of soluble solids.

AB  - Background: Impairment in neurogenesis correlates with memory and cognitive dysfunction in AD patients. In the recent decade, therapies with stem cell bases are growing and proved to be efficient. This study is a preliminary attempt to explore the impact of NTF-SCs on hippocampal neurogenesis mediated by the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade in AD-like mouse brain parenchyma.
   Methods: The BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: Control, AD +Vehicle, AD+ TF-SCs-CM and AD+NTF-SCs (n = 10). For AD induction, 100 mu M A beta(1-42) was injected into lateral ventricles. The AD-like model was confirmed via passive avoidance test and Thioflavin-S staining 21 days following A beta injection. Next, NTF-SCs were differentiated from ADMSCs, and both NTF-SCs and supernatant (NTF-SCs-CM) were injected into the hippocampus after AD confirmation. Endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation capacity was assessed after 50 mg/kbW BrdU injection for 4 days using immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The percent of BrdU/Nestin and BrdU/NeuN positive NSCs were calculated. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect genes related to the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade. The spatial learning and memory alternation was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM).
   Results: Data showed the reduction in escape latency over 5 days in the AD mice compared to the control group. The administration of NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM increased this value compared to the AD-Vehicle group. Both NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM were the potential to reduce the cumulative distance to the platform in AD mice compared to the AD-Vehicle group. The time spent in target quadrants was ameliorated following NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM transplantation followed by an improved MWM performance. IF imaging revealed the increase in BrdU/Nestin(+) and BrdU/NeuN(+) in AD mice that received NTF-SCs and NTF-SCs-CM, indicating enhanced neurogenesis. Based on real-time PCR analysis, the expression of PI3K, Akt, MAPK, ERK, Wnt, and beta-catenin was upregulated and coincided with the suppression of GSK-3 beta after injection of NTF-SCs-CM and NTF-SCs. In this study, NTF-SCs had superior effects in AD mice that received NTF-SCs compared to NTF-SCs-CM.
   Conclusions: The activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway via NTF-SCs can be touted as a possible therapeutic approach to restore neurogenesis in AD mice.

AB  - Oil-tea camellia fruit shell (CFS) is a very abundant waste lignocellulosic resource. The current treatments of CFS, i.e. composting and burning, pose a severe threat on environment. Up to 50 % of the dry mass of CFS is composed of hemicelluloses. However, chemical structures of the hemicelluloses in CFS have not been extensively studied, which limits their high-value utilization. In this study, different types of hemicelluloses were isolated from CFS through alkali fractionation with the assistance of Ba(OH)2 and H3BO3. Xylan, galacto-glucomannan and xyloglucan were found to be the major hemicelluloses in CFS. Through methylation, HSQC and HMBC analyses, we have found that the xylan in CFS is composed of & RARR;4)-& beta;-D-Xylp-(1 & RARR; and & RARR;3,4)-& beta;-D-Xylp-(1 & RARR; linked by (1 & RARR;4)-& beta; glycosidic bond as the main chain; the side chains are & alpha;-L-Fucp-(1 & RARR;, & RARR;5)-& alpha;-L-Araf-(1 & RARR;, & beta;-D-Xylp-(1 & RARR;, & alpha;-L-Rhap- (1 & RARR; and 4-O-Me-& alpha;-D-GlcpA-(1 & RARR;, connected to the main chain through (1 & RARR;3) glycosidic bond. The main chain of galacto-glucomannan in CFS consists of & RARR;6)-& beta;-D-Glcp-(1 & RARR;, & RARR;4)-& beta;-D-Glcp-(1 & RARR;, & RARR;4,6)-& beta;-D-Glcp-(1 & RARR; and & RARR;4)-& beta;-D-Manp-(1 & RARR;; the side chains are & beta;-D-Glcp-(1 & RARR;, & RARR;2)-& beta;-D-Galp-(1 & RARR;, & beta;-D-Manp-(1 & RARR; and & RARR;6)-& beta;-D-Galp-(1 & RARR; connected to the main chain through (1 & RARR;6) glycosidic bonds. Moreover, galactose residues are connected by & alpha;-L-Fucp-(1 & RARR;. The main chain of xyloglucan is composed of & RARR;4)-& beta;-D-Glcp-(1 & RARR;, & RARR;4,6)-& beta;-D-Glcp-(1 & RARR; and & RARR;6)-& beta;-D-Glcp-(1 & RARR;; the side groups, i.e. & beta;-D-Xylp-(1 & RARR; and & RARR;4)-& beta;-D-Xylp-(1 & RARR;, are connected to the main chain by (1 & RARR;6) glycosidic bond; & RARR;2)-& beta;-D-Galp-(1 & RARR; and & alpha;-L-Fucp-(1 & RARR; can also connect to & RARR;4)-& beta;-D-Xylp-(1 & RARR; forming di-or trisaccharide side chains.

AB  - The non-receptor focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is highly expressed in the central nervous system during development, where it regulates neurite outgrowth and axon guidance, but its role in the adult healthy and diseased brain, specifically in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is largely unknown. Using the 3xTg-AD mouse model, which carries three mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (APP KM670/671NL Swedish, PSEN1 M146V, MAPT P301L) and develops age-related progressive neuropathology including amyloid plaques and Tau tangles, we describe here, for the first time, the in vivo role of FAK in AD pathology. Our data demonstrate that while site-specific knockdown in the hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice has no effect on learning and memory, hippocampal overexpression of the protein leads to a significant decrease in learning and memory capabilities, which is accompanied by a significant increase in amyloid beta (A beta) load. Furthermore, neuronal morphology is altered following hippocampal overexpression of FAK in these mice. High-throughput proteomics analysis of total and phosphorylated proteins in the hippocampi of FAK overexpressing mice indicates that FAK controls AD-like phenotypes by inhibiting cytoskeletal remodeling in neurons which results in morphological changes, by increasing Tau hyperphosphorylation, and by blocking astrocyte differentiation. FAK activates cell cycle re-entry and consequent cell death while downregulating insulin signaling, thereby increasing insulin resistance and leading to oxidative stress. Our data provide an overview of the signaling networks by which FAK regulates AD pathology and identify FAK as a novel therapeutic target for treating AD.

AB  - Background and Aims Increasing research evidence indicates that temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) induced by kainic acid (KA) has high pathological similarities with human TLE. KA induces excitotoxicity (especially in the acute phase of the disease), which leads to neurodegeneration and epileptogenesis through oxidative stress and inflammation. Ferulic acid (FA) is one of the well-known phytochemical compounds that have shown potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and promise in treating several diseases. The current study set out to investigate the neuroprotective effects of FA in a rat model of TLE. Methods Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Pretreatment with FA (100 mg/kg/day p.o.) started one week before the intrahippocampal injection of KA (0.8 mu g/mu l, 5 mu l). Seizures were recorded and evaluated according to Racine's scale. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring its indicators, including malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite, and catalase. Histopathological evaluations including Nissl staining and immunohistochemical staining of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and neural nitric oxide synthases (nNOS) were performed for the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Results Pretreatment with FA significantly attenuates the severity of the seizure and prevents neuronal loss in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in rats with KA-induced post-status epilepticus. Also, nitrite concentration and nNOS levels were markedly diminished in FA-pretreated animals compared to non-pretreated epileptic rats. Conclusion Our findings indicated that neuroprotective properties of FA, therefore, could be considered a valuable therapeutic supplement in treating TLE.

AB  - Doxorubicin (Dox) is one of the most frequently prescribed anti-cancer drugs. However, treatment with Dox is limited due to cumulative cardiotoxicity. 3-O-beta-d-Sophorosylkaempferol-7-O-{3-O-[2(E)-2,6-dimethyl-6-hydroxyocta-2,7-dienoyl]}-alpha-L-rhamnoside (F-A), kaempferol 3-sophoroside 7-rhamnoside (F-B), and hippophanone (F-C) were successfully obtained by purification and separation of seabuckthorn seed residue in our previous research. This study was undertaken to investigate the protective effect of three flavonoids against Dox-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. 2 ',7 '-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to determine the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). ATP content was measured using an assay kit. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure. The expression levels of proteins (p-JNK, JNK, p-Akt, Akt, p-P38, P38, p-ERK, ERK, p-Src, Src, Sab, IRE1 alpha, Mfn1, Mfn2, and cleaved caspase-3) were evaluated by Western blot. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock Vina. The three flavonoids could significantly relieve Dox-induced cardiac injury and inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The mechanisms were mainly related to the stability of mitochondrial structure and function maintained by suppressing the production of intracellular ROS, p-JNK and cleaved caspase-3, and increasing ATP contents and protein expression of mitochondrial mitofusin (Mfn1, Mfn2), Sab and p-Src. Pretreatment with flavonoids from Hippophae rhamnoides Linn. can reduce Dox-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis based on the 'JNK-Sab-Ros' signal pathway.

AB  - Aging and genetic predisposition are the primary risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), while chronic stress represents a modifiable risk factor that can accelerate aging and drive AD progression. However, the complex interplay between aging, chronic stress and genetic underpinnings in AD pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Notably, cognitive phenotyping in AD mouse models has yielded inconsistent results. In this study, we characterized the age-dependent trajectory of phenotypes in 5xFAD mice on a congenic C57BL/6 J background. These mice harbor five familial AD (FAD)-related mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1) genes. A beta plaque deposition was detected in specific brain regions by 4 months of age, but cognitive performance remained intact at this stage. However, by 8-9 months, these mice developed impairments in spatial working memory, novel object recognition memory, and social recognition memory. By 11 months, they also showed metabolic alterations, including lower body weight, higher energy expenditure and increased locomotor activity. Furthermore, after 10 days of chronic social isolation-unpredictable stress, 4-month-old 5xFAD mice exhibited cognitive deficits, accompanied by increased A beta accumulation in the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. In contrast, age- and sex-matched wild-type littermate controls subjected to the same stress paradigm showed no significant cognitive changes. These observations suggest that A beta deposition increases stress vulnerability in 5xFAD mice. We conclude that the phenotypic expression of AD-related gene mutations, including pathological changes and cognitive decline, progresses with age and can be induced by chronic psychological stress, underscoring the interactive effects of stress, aging, and genetic vulnerability on disease onset and severity.

AB  - African ostrich chicks (Struthio camelus) were divided into six groups, and each received different levels of boric acid (source of boron) in the drinking water (0, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 640 mg/L respectively) to examine the histological, apoptotic, bio-chemical, and transcriptomic parameters. Morphological analysis in different groups was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining, and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay. The biochemical profile was evaluated spectrophotometrically. Detailed RNA-Seq of the data was performed using the transcriptomic method. H & E staining showed well-developed liver structure up to the 160 mg/L boric acid (BA) supplement groups, while BA doses (320 mg/L and 640 mg/L) caused changes in hepatocytes and portal triads. PAS staining showed that glycogen levels were optimal in the 80 mg/L BA dose group, but a reduction in glycogen levels was observed after this group, particularly in the 640 mg/L BA supplement group. Cellular apoptosis showed a biphasic pattern, and the BA dose above 160 mg/L enhanced cell death. In addition, serum analysis showed that doses of 80-160 mg BA were beneficial for ostrich liver. Then, the transcriptome analysis of the 80 mg dose also showed mainly positive effects on the liver. These results demonstrated that chronic BA exposure (320-640 mg) can cause significant histological, apoptotic, and biochemical changes in African ostrich liver, while the adequate dose of supplementation (particularly 80 mg BA) promotes liver growth.

AB  - Dephosphorylation of target proteins at serine/threonine residues is one of the most crucial mechanisms regulating their activity and, consequently, the cellular functions. The role of phosphatases in synaptic plasticity, especially in long-term depression or depotentiation, has been reported. We studied serine/threonine phosphatase activity during the protein synthesis blocker (PSB)-induced impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP). Established protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B, calcineurin) inhibitor cyclosporin A prevented the LTP early phase (E-LTP) decline produced by pretreatment of hippocampal slices with cycloheximide or anisomycin. For the first time, we directly measured serine/threonine phosphatase activity during E-LTP, and its significant increase in PSB-treated slices was demonstrated. Nitric oxide (NO) donor SNAP also heightened phosphatase activity in the same manner as PSB, and simultaneous application of anisomycin + SNAP had no synergistic effect. Direct measurement of the NO production in hippocampal slices by the NO-specific fluorescent probe DAF-FM revealed that PSBs strongly stimulate the NO concentration in all studied brain areas: CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG). Cyclosporin A fully abolished the PSB-induced NO production in the hippocampus, suggesting a close relationship between nNOS and PP2B activity. Surprisingly, cyclosporin A alone impaired short-term plasticity in CA1 by decreasing paired-pulse facilitation, which suggests bi-directionality of the influences of PP2B in the hippocampus. In conclusion, we proposed a minimal model of signaling events that occur during LTP induction in normal conditions and the PSB-treated slices.

AB  - High salt (HS) consumption is an independent risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, stroke, and cerebral small vessel disease related to cognitive decline. Recently, Alzheimer's disease-like pathology changes have been reported as consequences of a HS diet in wild-type (wt) mice. However, it has not been revealed how HS diets accelerate the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in APP/PS1 mice. Here, we fed APP/PS1 mice a HS diet or normal diet (ND) for six months; the effects of the HS/ND on wt mice were also observed. The results of our behavior test reveal that the HS diet exacerbates anxiety, beta-amyloid overload, neuron loss, and synapse damage in the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice; this was not observed in HS-treated wt mice. RNA sequencing shows that nearly all serpin family members were increased in the hippocampus of HS-treated APP/PS1 mice. Gene function analysis showed that a HS diet induces neurodegeneration, including axon dysfunction and neuro-ligand-based dysfunction, and regulates serine protein inhibitor activities. The mRNA and protein levels of Serpina3n were dramatically increased. Upregulated Serpina3n may be the key for beta-amyloid aggregation and neuronal loss in the hippocampus of HS-treated APP/PS1 mice. Serpina3n inhibition attenuated the anxiety and increased the number of neurons in the hippocampal CA1(cornu ammonis) region of APP/PS1 mice. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms by which excessive HS diet deteriorates anxiety in AD mice. Therefore, decreasing daily dietary salt consumption constitutes a pivotal public health intervention for mitigating the progression of neuropathology, especially for old patients and those with neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Tideglusib is a non-competitive GSK-3 beta inhibitor which contain 1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione moiety, and now mainly used for progressive supranuclear palsy due to the lack of some primary cognitive endpoints and secondary endpoints in a phase IIb trail for Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, insufficient evidence exists to support that there are obvious covalent bonds between Tideglusib and GSK-3 beta. Targeted covalent inhibition strategy could improve the binding efficiency, selectivity and duration of kinase inhibitors. Based on the above premise, two series of targeted compounds with acryloyl warheads were designed and synthesized. The kinase inhibitory activity of the selected compound 10a with better neuroprotective effect improved 2.7 fold than that of Tideglusib. After the preliminary screening of GSK-3 beta inhibition and neuroprotective activity, the mechanism action of the selected compound 10a was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results confirmed that 10a with excellent selectivity among the whole tested kinases could significantly reduce the expressions of APP and p-Tau via increasing the level of p-GSK-3 beta. The pharmacodynamic assay in vivo showed that 10a could markedly improve the learning and memory functions in AD mice induced by AlCl3 combined with D-galactose. At the same time, the damage of hippocampal neurons in AD mice was obviously reduced. Accordingly, the introduction of acryloyl warheads could increase the GSK-3 beta inhibitory activity of 1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives, and the selected compound 10a deserves further research as an effective GSK-3 beta inhibitor for the potential treatment of AD.

AB  - Increasing evidence demonstrated that mitophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) was closely associated with memory decline in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Tea polyphenols (TP), an excellent natural antioxidant, has been reported to have neuroprotective properties in aging and diabetes, but the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. This study targets ERS-mitophagy in hippocampal neurons to investigate the improvement effect of memory in aged T2DM rats by TP. Rats were randomly divided into the control group, the aged group, the aged T2DM model group, the TP 75, 150, 300 mg/kg groups. TP 300 mg/kg ameliorated mitophagy by decreasing the levels of p-mTOR (S2448), P62 and HSP60 and increasing the levels of PINK1 and Parkin, the ratio of LC3II/LC3I, co-localization of LC3 and HSP60 and the number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. TP 300 mg/kg attenuated ERS by downregulating the levels of p-PERK, p-eIF2 alpha, ATF4, GRP78 and restoring the ER structure. To further verify epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is the main active component of TP, enhanced mitophagy by inhibiting ERS, PC12 cells were pretreated with ERS activator tunicamycin (TM) or ERS inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA). The results showed that the improvement of mitophagy by EGCG was inhibited by TM and promoted by 4-PBA. Collectively, ERS-mitophagy in hippocampal neurons plays a key role in the improvement of memory by TP in aged T2DM rats. This study will provide a new perspective and strategy for the prevention of memory decline in elderly with T2DM.

AB  - Epilepsy is a diverse brain disorder, and the pathophysiology of its various forms and comorbidities is largely unknown. A recent machine learning method enables us to estimate an individual's "brain-age" from MRI; this brain-age prediction is expected as a novel individual biomarker of neuropsychiatric disorders. The aims of this study were to estimate the brain-age for various categories of epilepsy and to evaluate clinical discrimination by brain-age for (1) the effect of psychosis on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), (2) psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) from MRI-negative epilepsies, and (3) progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) from juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). In total, 1196 T1-weighted MRI scans from healthy controls (HCs) were used to build a brain-age prediction model with support vector regression. Using the model, we calculated the brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD: predicted age-chronological age) of the HCs and 318 patients with epilepsy. We compared the brain-PAD values based on the research questions. As a result, all categories of patients except for extra-temporal lobe focal epilepsy showed a significant increase in brain-PAD. TLE with hippocampal sclerosis presented a significantly higher brain-PAD than several other categories. The mean brain-PAD in TLE with inter-ictal psychosis was 10.9 years, which was significantly higher than TLE without psychosis (5.3 years). PNES showed a comparable mean brain-PAD (10.6 years) to that of epilepsy patients. PME had a higher brain-PAD than JME (22.0 vs. 9.3 years). In conclusion, neuroimaging-based brain-age prediction can provide novel insight into or clinical usefulness for the diverse symptoms of epilepsy.

AB  - High post-menopausal levels of the pituitary gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are strongly associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have shown recently that FSH directly activates the hippocampal FSH receptors (FSHRs) to drive AD-like pathology and memory loss in mice. To unequivocally establish a role for FSH in memory loss, we depleted the Fshr on a 3xTg background and utilized Morris Water Maze to study deficits in spatial memory. 3xTg;Fshr(+/+) mice displayed impaired spatial memory at 5 months of age. The loss of memory acquisition and retrieval were both rescued in 3xTg;Fshr(-/-) mice and, to a lesser extent, in 3xTg;Fshr(+/-) mice-documenting clear gene-dose-dependent prevention of spatial memory loss. Furthermore, at 5 and 8 months, sham-operated 3xTg;Fshr(-/-) mice showed better memory performance during the learning and/or retrieval phases, further suggesting that Fshr deletion prevents age-related progression of memory deficits. This prevention was not seen when mice were ovariectomized, except in the 8-month-old 3xTg;Fshr(-/-) mice. There was also a gene-dose-dependent reduction mainly in the amyloid beta 40 isoform in whole brain extracts. Finally, serum FSH levels <8 ng/mL in 16-month-old APP/PS1 mice were associated with better retrieval of spatial memory. Collectively, the data provide compelling genetic evidence for a protective effect of inhibiting FSH signaling on the progression of spatial memory deficits in mice and lay a firm foundation for the use of an FSH-blocking agent for the early prevention of memory loss in post-menopausal women.

AB  - Patients diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) show persistent cognitive disabilities, including memory deficits. However, the neurobiological substrates underlying these deficits remain unclear. Here, we show that prenatal and lactation alcohol exposure (PLAE) in mice induces FASD-like memory impairments. This is accompanied by a reduction of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) in the hippocampus specifically in a childhood-like period (at post-natal day (PD) 25). To determine their role in memory deficits, two pharmacological approaches were performed during this specific period of early life. Thus, memory performance was tested after the repeated administration (from PD25 to PD34) of: i) URB597, to increase NAEs, with GW9662, a PPAR-gamma antagonist; ii) pioglitazone, a PPAR-gamma agonist. We observed that URB597 suppresses PLAE-induced memory deficits through a PPAR-gamma dependent mechanism, since its effects are prevented by GW9662. Direct PPAR-gamma activation, using pioglitazone, also ameliorates memory impairments. Lastly, to further investigate the region and cellular specificity, we demonstrate that an early overexpression of PPAR-gamma, by means of a viral vector, in hippocampal astrocytes mitigates memory deficits induced by PLAE. Together, our data reveal that disruptions of PPAR-gamma signaling during neurodevelopment contribute to PLAE-induced memory dysfunction. In turn, PPAR-gamma activation during a childhood-like period is a promising therapeutic approach for memory deficits in the context of early alcohol exposure. Thus, these findings contribute to the gaining insight into the mechanisms that might underlie memory impairments in FASD patients.

AB  - Environmental factors like diet have been linked to depression and/or relapse risk in later life. This could be partially driven by the food metabolome, which communicates with the brain via the circulatory system and interacts with hippocampal neurogenesis (HN), a form of brain plasticity implicated in depression aetiology. Despite the associations between HN, diet and depression, human data further substantiating this hypothesis are largely missing. Here, we used an in vitro model of HN to test the effects of serum samples from a longitudinal ageing cohort of 373 participants, with or without depressive symptomology. 1% participant serum was applied to human fetal hippocampal progenitor cells, and changes in HN markers were related to the occurrence of depressive symptoms across a 12-year period. Key nutritional, metabolomic and lipidomic biomarkers (extracted from participant plasma and serum) were subsequently tested for their ability to modulate HN. In our assay, we found that reduced cell death and increased neuronal differentiation were associated with later life depressive symptomatology. Additionally, we found impairments in neuronal cell morphology in cells treated with serum from participants experiencing recurrent depressive symptoms across the 12-year period. Interestingly, we found that increased neuronal differentiation was modulated by increased serum levels of metabolite butyrylcarnitine and decreased glycerophospholipid, PC35:1(16:0/19:1), levels - both of which are closely linked to diet - all in the context of depressive symptomology. These findings potentially suggest that diet and altered HN could subsequently shape the trajectory of late-life depressive symptomology.

AB  - Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS) is a genetic disorder caused by point mutations or deletions in the gene-encoding transcription factor TRPS1. TRPS patients display a range of skeletal dysplasias, including reduced jaw size, short stature, and a cone-shaped digit epiphysis. Certain TRPS patients experience early onset coxarthrosis that leads to a devastating drop in their daily activities. The etiologies of congenital skeletal abnormalities of TRPS were revealed through the analysis of Trps1 mutant mouse strains. However, early postnatal lethality in Trps1 knockout mice has hampered the study of postnatal TRPS pathology. Here, through epigenomic analysis we identified two previously uncharacterized candidate gene regulatory regions in the first intron of Trps1. We deleted these regions, either individually or simultaneously, and examined their effects on skeletal morphogenesis. Animals that were deleted individually for either region displayed only modest phenotypes. In contrast, the Trps1 Delta int/Delta int mouse strain with simultaneous deletion of both genomic regions exhibit postnatal growth retardation. This strain displayed delayed secondary ossification center formation in the long bones and misshaped hip joint development that resulted in acetabular dysplasia. Reducing one allele of the Trps1 gene in Trps1 Delta int mice resulted in medial patellar dislocation that has been observed in some patients with TRPS. Our novel Trps1 hypomorphic strain recapitulates many postnatal pathologies observed in human TRPS patients, thus positioning this strain as a useful animal model to study postnatal TRPS pathogenesis. Our observations also suggest that Trps1 gene expression is regulated through several regulatory elements, thus guaranteeing robust expression maintenance in skeletal cells.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide. Given that learning and memory are impaired in this pathology, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) appear as key players in the onset and progression of the disease. NMDARs are glutamate receptors, mainly located at the post-synapse, which regulate voltage-dependent influx of calcium into the neurons. They are heterotetramers, and there are different subunits that can be part of the receptors, which are usually composed of two obligatory GluN1 subunits plus either two NR2A or two NR2B subunits. NR2A are mostly located at the synapse, and their activation is involved in the expression of pro-survival genes. Conversely, NR2B are mainly extrasynaptic, and their activation has been related to cell death and neurodegeneration. Thus, activation of NR2A and/or inactivation of NR2B-containing NMDARS has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to treat AD. Here, we wanted to investigate the main differences between both subunits signalling in neuronal primary cultures of the cortex and hippocampus. It has been observed that A beta induces a significant increase in calcium release and also in MAPK phosphorylation signalling in NR2B-containing NMDAR in cortical and hippocampal neurons. However, while NR2A-containing NMDAR decreases neuronal death and favours cell viability after A beta treatment, NR2B-containing NMDAR shows higher levels of cytotoxicity and low levels of neuronal survival. Finally, it has been detected that NMDAR has no effect on pTau axonal transport. The present results demonstrate a different role between GluNA and GluNB subunits in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

AB  - There is growing need to increase the knowledge on the cannabinoid ligands in the treatment of overactive bladder. Among potential candidates, arachidonyl-2 '-chloroethylamide (ACEA), a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist is proposed. The aim of this paper was to determine if ACEA, a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist, could reverse the effects of corticosterone (CORT), characteristic of depressive and bladder overactivity potential. The animals (48 female rats) were divided into four groups: I-control, II-received CORT, III-received ACEA, and IV-received the combination of CORT and ACEA. The conscious cystometry, forced swim test (FST), and locomotor activity measurements were performed 3 days after the last dose of ACEA, followed by ELISA measurements. In group IV, ACEA restored urodynamic parameters that were altered by CORT. CORT prolonged the immobility time in FST and the values were lowered by ACEA. ACEA normalized the expression of c-Fos in all the analyzed central micturition centers (group IV vs. group II). ACEA restored the CORT-induced changes in the biomarkers in urine (BDNF, NGF), bladder detrusor (VAChT, Rho kinase), bladder urothelium (CGRP, ATP, CRF, OCT-3, TRPV1), and hippocampus (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and Il-6, CRF, IL-10, BDNF, NGF). In conclusion, ACEA was proven to reverse CORT-induced changes in both cystometric and biochemical parameters that are determinants of OAB/depression, which represents an example of an existing link between OAB and depression via cannabinoid receptors.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of quercetin on the alterations of serum elements in perimenopausal depression rat model induced by ovariectomy combined with chronic unpredictable mild stress (OVX-CUMS) and possible mechanisms. According to the results of the sucrose preference test, the rats were randomly assigned to four groups: sham, OVX-CUMS, OVX-CUMS + 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-estradiol: 0.27 mg/kg.bw), and OVX-CUMS + Quercetin (Quercetin: 50 mg/kg.bw). At the end of experiment, serum and prefrontal cortex of rats were collected. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis showed that levels of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), selenium (Se), cobalt (Co) and zinc (Zn) decreased, and levels of iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) increased in serum and prefrontal cortex of OVX-CUMS rats compared with sham group (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, the levels of the above elements in prefrontal cortex had correlation with behavioral characteristics in OVX-CUMS rats (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). The abnormal elements in serum may cross blood-brain-barrier into the brain and induce oxidative stress, leading to ferroptosis. Furtherly, the expressions of ferroptosis-related protein including GPX4 and SLC7A11 were decreased in prefrontal cortex of OVX-CUMS rats (p < 0.01), which confirmed the above results. Quercetin treatment restored the above abnormal indicators (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) induced by OVX-CUMS in rats. Our study suggested that quercetin regulated variation of elements in serum and prefrontal cortex, further inhibiting ferroptosis in prefrontal cortex through alleviating oxidative stress in OVX-CUMS rats.

AB  - The excessive activation of microglia cell induced by adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) leads to neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. The endocannabinoid system plays a key role in the modulation of microglia activation. Accumulating evidence suggests that regular exercise improves learning and memory deficits in AIE models. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of treadmill exercise intervention on the cognitive performance, activation of microglia cells and the expression of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) in the hippocampus of AIE rats. Here, we show that AIE rats exhibited cognitive impairments, whereas the treadmill exercise improves the cognitive performance in AIE rats. In order to explore the possible mechanisms for the exercise-induced attenuation of cognitive disorder, we examined the neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. We found that treadmill exercise led to the decrease in the level of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and the increase in the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10). In addition, we found that treadmill exercise reduced the excessive activation of the microglia cell in the hippocampus of AIE rats. Finally, we found that AIE led to a decrease in the expression of CB1R and CB2R in the hippocampus; however, the treadmill exercise further decreased the expression of CB2R in the hippocampus of AIE rats. Our results suggest that treadmill exercise attenuates AIE-induced neuroinflammation and the excessive activation of hippocampus microglial cells, which may contribute to the exercise-induced improvement of cognitive performance in AIE rats.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain. They are composed of aggregated amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) misfolded into beta-sheets which are the cause of the AD memory impairment and dementia. Memory depends on the hippocampal formation and maintenance of synapses by long-term potentiation (LTP), whose main steps are the activation of NMDA receptors, the phosphorylation of CaMKII alpha and the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor CREB. It is known that A beta oligomers (oA beta) induce synaptic loss and impair the formation of new synapses. Here, we have studied the effects of oA beta on CaMKII alpha. We found that oA beta produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), that induce CaMKII alpha oxidation in human neuroblastoma cells as we assayed by western blot and immunofluorescence. Moreover, this oxidized isoform is significantly present in brain samples from AD patients. We found that the oxidized CaMKII alpha is active independently of the binding to calcium/calmodulin, and that CaMKII alpha phosphorylation is mutually exclusive with CaMKII alpha oxidation as revealed by immunoprecipitation and western blot. An in silico modelling of the enzyme was also performed to demonstrate that oxidation induces an activated state of CaMKII alpha. In brains from AD transgenic models of mice and in primary cultures of murine hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that the oxidation of CaMKII alpha induces the phosphorylation of CREB and its translocation to the nucleus to promote the transcription of ARC and BDNF. Our data suggests that CaMKII alpha oxidation would be a pro-survival mechanism that is triggered when a noxious stimulus challenges neurons as do oA beta.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE) causes persistent abnormalities in the functioning of neuronal networks, often resulting in worsening epileptic seizures. Many details of cellular and molecular mechanisms of seizure-induced changes are still unknown. The lithium-pilocarpine model of epilepsy in rats reproduces many features of human temporal lobe epilepsy. In this work, using the lithium-pilocarpine model in three-week-old rats, we examined the morphological and electrophysiological changes in the hippocampus within a week following pilocarpine-induced seizures. We found that almost a third of the neurons in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus died on the first day, but this was not accompanied by impaired synaptic plasticity at that time. A diminished long-term potentiation (LTP) was observed following three days, and the negative effect of SE on plasticity increased one week later, being accompanied by astrogliosis. The attenuation of LTP was caused by the weakening of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent signaling. NMDAR-current was more than two-fold weaker during high-frequency stimulation in the post-SE rats than in the control group. Application of glial transmitter D-serine, a coagonist of NMDARs, allows the enhancement of the NMDAR-dependent current and the restoration of LTP. These results suggest that the disorder of neuron-astrocyte interactions plays a critical role in the impairment of synaptic plasticity.

AB  - After the discovery of endogenous dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) as a potential biological equivalent of nitric oxide (NO), bioinorganic engineering of [Fe(NO)(2)] unit has emerged to develop biomimetic DNICs [(NO)(2)Fe(L)(2)] as a chemical biology tool for controlled delivery of NO. For example, water-soluble DNIC [Fe-2(mu-SCH2CH2OH)(2)(NO)(4)] (DNIC-1) was explored for oral delivery of NO to the brain and for the activation of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the kinetics and mechanism for cellular uptake and intracellular release of NO, as well as the biocompatibility of synthetic DNICs, remain elusive. Prompted by the potential application of NO to dermato-physiological regulations, in this study, cellular uptake and intracellular delivery of DNIC [Fe-2(mu-SCH2CH2COOH)(2)(NO)(4)] (DNIC-2) and its regulatory effect/biocompatibility toward epidermal cells were investigated. Upon the treatment of DNIC-2 to human fibroblast cells, cellular uptake of DNIC-2 followed by transformation into protein-bound DNICs occur to trigger the intracellular release of NO with a half-life of 1.8 +/- 0.2 h. As opposed to the burst release of extracellular NO from diethylamine NONOate (DEANO), the cell-penetrating nature of DNIC-2 rationalizes its overwhelming efficacy for intracellular delivery of NO. Moreover, NO-delivery DNIC-2 can regulate cell proliferation, accelerate wound healing, and enhance the deposition of collagen in human fibroblast cells. Based on the in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility evaluation, biocompatible DNIC-2 holds the potential to be a novel active ingredient for skincare products.

AB  - The 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 (11 beta HSD-1) is a predominant 11 beta-reductase regenerating bioactive glucocorticoids (cortisol, corticosterone) from inactive 11-keto forms (cortisone, dehydrocorticosterone), expressed mainly in the brain, liver and adipose tissue. Although the expression levels of 11 beta HSD-1 mRNA are known to be influenced by glucocorticoids, its tissue-specific regulation is not completely elucidated. In this study, we examined the effect of persistent glucocorticoid excess on the expression of 11 beta HSD-1 mRNA in the hippocampus, liver, and abdominal adipose tissue in vivo using quantitative real-time PCR. We found that, in C57BL/6J mice treated with corticosterone (CORT) pellet for 2 weeks, 11 beta HSD-1 mRNA decreased in the hippocampus (HIPP) and liver, whereas it increased in the abdominal fat (FAT), compared with placebo treatment [HIPP: placebo 1.00 +/- 0.14, CORT 0.63 +/- 0.04; liver: placebo 1.00 +/- 0.08, CORT 0.73 +/- 0.06; FAT: placebo 1.00 +/- 0.16, CORT 2.26 +/- 0.39]. Moreover, in CRH transgenic mice, an animal model of Cushing's syndrome with high plasma CORT level, 11 beta HSD-1 mRNA was also decreased in the hippocampus and liver, and increased in the abdominal adipose tissue compared to that in wild-type mice. These changes were reversed after adrenalectomy in CRH-Tg mice. Altogether, these results reveal the differential regulation of 11 beta HSD-1 mRNA by glucocorticoid among the tissues examined.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults and is becoming a major public health crisis as life expectancy increases worldwide. A major contributor to this disease is a deficiency in melatonin signaling. We have recently synthesised a series of melatonin analogs containing donepezil fragments. These compounds have been tested both in silico and in vitro. In this study, a particularly potent compound, 3a, was evaluated in a hybrid rat model of melatonin deficiency and AD. Rats underwent pinealectomy followed one week later by bilateral intracerebroventricular infusion of A beta(1-42) (1 mu g/mu L). A 14-day subchronic treatment with compound 3a was started simultaneously with the neurotoxin infusion. Melatonin was used as a reference drug, while a matched sham group received vehicle treatment. One week after the A beta(1-42) infusion, the rats' cognitive functions were assessed using two Y-maze protocols, object recognition and object location tests. Markers of oxidative stress, including hippocampal glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde, were assessed by ELISA. Compound 3a effectively prevented cognitive impairment induced by the AD model, and its effects were comparable to those of melatonin. In addition, this melatonin analogue with a donepezil fragment reduced AD-associated oxidative stress and suppressed model-associated increased A beta(1-42) levels in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that melatonin analogs containing donepezil fragments are promising therapeutic options for targeting oxidative stress associated with AD.

AB  - Both post-mortem and in vivo data argue for dopamine dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the timing and regional progression of dopaminergic systems alterations in AD are still debated. The aim of the study was to investigate in vivo the pattern of dopaminergic changes and connectivity using DAT-SPECT imaging in patients across the AD spectrum. Fifty-nine AD patients (n = 21 AD-MCI; n = 38 AD-DEM) and a control group (CG) of n = 45 age- and sex-matched individuals entered the study and underwent 123I-FP-CIT dopaminergic imaging. The occipital binding was used as reference region to obtain single-subject binding in different brain regions. Between-group differences in 123I-FP-CIT binding in both mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways were assessed using an ANCOVA test, adjusting for the effect of center of imaging acquisition, age, and sex. Regions resulting from the voxel-wise direct comparison between AD-MCI and AD-DEM were considered as a seed of interest for a voxel-wise interregional correlation analysis. Both AD-MCI and AD-DEM patients showed dopaminergic depletion within the basal ganglia, whereas cortico-limbic regions (namely hippocampus, amygdala, anterior and middle cingulate, frontal cortex and thalamus) resulted impaired only in the dementia phase. The brain voxel-wise interregional correlation analysis showed a progressive pattern of disruption of caudate/thalamus dopaminergic connectivity to hippocampus and amygdala from AD-MCI to AD-DEM stages. This study indicates basal ganglia dopaminergic alterations and connectivity disruption in the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems already in early stage AD, extending to several cortico-limbic regions in dementia phases.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) is linked to the development of many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and autism. Centella asiatica (CA) is a regenerating herb traditionally used to stimulate memory. This study was designed to assess the neuroprotective role of ethanolic extract of CA (CAE) in AlCl3-induced neurological conditions in rats. Adult rats were chronically treated with AlCl3 (100 mg/kg b.w./day) for 60 days to establish the dementia model, and co-administration of CAE was evaluated for its ability to attenuate the toxic effect of AlCl3. CAE was given orally at a dose of 150 and 300 mg/kg b.w./day, for 60 days. The behavioral performances of rats were tested through Y-maze and open field tests. Lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity were evaluated to measure oxidative stress; and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was assessed to evaluate cholinergic dysfunction in the rat brain. H&E staining was used to assess structural abnormalities in the cortex and hippocampus. The result showed that AlCl3 induces cognitive dysfunction (impaired learning and memory, anxiety, diminished locomotor activity), oxidative stress, cholinergic impairment, and histopathological alteration in the rat brain. Co-administration of CAE with AlCl3 markedly protects the brain from AlCl3-induced cognitive dysfunction, oxidative stress, AChE activity, and cytoarchitectural alterations. Furthermore, 15 days CAE treatment after 45 days AlCl3 administration markedly ameliorates the AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity indicating its potential for therapeutic use.

AB  - Transcriptional enhanced associate domains (Teads) are the downstream effectors of the hippo signaling pathway and have been recognized as attractive druggable targets of gastric cancer. The biological function of Teads is regulated by diverse cofactors. In this study, the intermolecular interactions of Teads with their cognate cofactors were systematically characterized at structural, thermodynamic and dynamic levels. The Teads possess a double-stranded helical hairpin that is surrounded by three independent structural elements beta-sheet, alpha-helix and omega-loop of cofactor proteins and plays a central role in recognition and association with cofactors. A number of functional peptides were split from the hairpin region at Tead-cofactor complex interfaces, which, however, cannot maintain in native conformation without the support of protein context and would therefore incur a considerable entropy penalty upon competitively rebinding to the interfaces. Here, we further used disulfide and hydrocarbon bridges to cyclize and staple the hairpin and helical peptides, respectively. The chemical modification strategies were demonstrated to effectively constrain peptide conformation into active state and to largely reduce peptide flexibility in free state, thus considerably improving their affinity. Since the cyclization and stapling only minimize the indirect entropy cost but do not influence the direct enthalpy effect upon peptide binding, the designed conformationally constrained peptides can retain in their native selectivity over different cofactors. This is particularly interesting because it means that the cyclized/stapled, affinity-improved peptides can specifically compete with their parent Teads for the cofactor arrays as they share consistent target specificity.

AB  - Oocytes experience detrimental osmotic stress during vitrification and warming procedures because of the osmolality imbalance between the vitrification-warming fluids and the intracellular environment. Cellular osmotic homeostasis can be preserved by glycine, a powerful osmolyte with antioxidant properties. We aimed to examine the influences of supplementing glycine to the vitrification solutions (VS) on the developmental potential of vitrified/warmed immature dromedary camel oocytes following IVM/IVF and in vitro embryo culture (IVC). Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from dromedary camel ovaries and randomly allocated into two groups namely control (oocytes subjected directly to IVM) and vitrified (COCs were vitrified into VS supplemented with 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mM glycine). For vitrification, COCs were equilibrated for 3 min in 12.5% ethylene glycol; EG plus 12.5% dimethyl sulfoxide; DMS and then they were vitrified for 60 s in VS composed of 25% EG + 25% DMSO using solid surface vitrification (SSV). Warming of vitrified oocytes was conducted in decreasing concentrations of trehalose solution. Following vitrification and warming, the morphologically viable oocytes were subjected to IVM for 36 h. Matured oocytes were then fertilized in vitro by epididymal spermatozoa and cultured for seven days. The results showed that the percentage of viable oocytes assessed by trypan blue stain was significantly higher (p <= .05) in the 1.0 mM glycine-supplemented group than 0.0- and 2.0-mM glycine-supplemented ones (90.0 % vs. 80.0% and 76.6%, respectively). However, no significant difference was observed between 0.5 mM glycine and other vitrified groups. Nuclear maturation rates, cleavage (48-h post-insemination; pi) and blastocyst rate (7-days pi) were significantly lower in vitrified groups than control ones (p <= .05). Among vitrified groups, these parameters were the highest in the 1.0 mM glycine-supplemented group. Taken together, supplementation of vitrification solutions with 1.0 mM glycine could enhance the developmental potential of vitrified/warmed immature dromedary camel oocytes.

AB  - The encoding product of Chordin-like 2 (CHRDL2) is a member of the chordin family of proteins, which has been shown to be aberrantly expressed in several types of solid tumors. The regulatory underlying mechanisms of CHRDL2, however, remain poorly understood in gastric cancer (GC). In the present study, we determined that CHRDL2 was abnormally upregulated in human gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. We also showed that CHRDL2 was positively associated with T stage, the pathological stage, distant metastasis, and poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, the serum level of CHRDL2 was obviously higher in GC patients than normal people, and is positively correlated with later TNM stage, deeper T stage, later N stage and poorer dif-ferentiation. Moreover, we verified that overexpressing CHRDL2 promoted the proliferation and cell cycle transition of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the opposite results were observed in CHRDL2-depleted cells. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of Yes-associated protein (YAP), transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and the total levels MST2 were decreased in CHRDL2 overexpressing cells. Consistent with previous findings, we observed the converse results in CHRDL2-silenced GC cells. Additionally, knockdown of YAP and overexpression of STK3 (MST2) could reverse the effects of CHRDL2 overexpression-induced pro-liferation of GC cells in vitro. Taken together, CHRDL2 plays a key role by activating the YAP/TAZ pathway in gastric cancer. Therefore, CHRDL2 could serve as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of gastric cancer.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder with a long prodromal period. An APPNL-G-F knock-in mouse model is a preclinical model to study incipient pathologies during the early stages of AD. Despite behavioral tests revealing broad cognitive deficits in APPNL-G-F mice, detecting these impairments at the early disease phase has been challenging. In a cognitively demanding task that assessed episodic-like memory, 3-month-old wild-type mice could incidentally form and retrieve 'what-where- when' episodic associations of their past encounters. However, 3-month-old APPNL-G-F mice, corresponding to an early disease stage without prominent amyloid plaque pathology, displayed impairment in recalling 'what-where' information of past episodes. Episodic-like memory is also sensitive to the effect of age. Eight -month-old wild-type mice failed to retrieve conjunctive 'what-where- when' memories. This deficit was also observed in 8-month-old APPNL-G-F mice. c-Fos expression revealed that impaired memory retrieval in APPNL-G-F mice was accompanied by abnormal neuronal hyperactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex and CA1 dorsal hippocampus. These observations can be used for risk stratification during preclinical AD to detect and delay the progression into dementia.

AB  - In general, strategies for spatial navigation could employ one of two spatial reference frames: egocentric or allocentric. Notwithstanding intuitive explanations, it remains unclear however under what circumstances one strategy is chosen over another, and how neural representations should be related to the chosen strategy. Here, we first use a deep reinforcement learning model to investigate whether a particular type of navigation strategy arises spontaneously during spatial learning without imposing a bias onto the model. We then examine the spatial representations that emerge in the network to support navigation. To this end, we study two tasks that are ethologically valid for mammals-guidance, where the agent has to navigate to a goal location fixed in allocentric space, and aiming, where the agent navigates to a visible cue. We find that when both navigation strategies are available to the agent, the solutions it develops for guidance and aiming are heavily biased towards the allocentric or the egocentric strategy, respectively, as one might expect. Nevertheless, the agent can learn both tasks using either type of strategy. Furthermore, we find that place-cell-like allocentric representations emerge preferentially in guidance when using an allocentric strategy, whereas egocentric vector representations emerge when using an egocentric strategy in aiming. We thus find that alongside the type of navigational strategy, the nature of the task plays a pivotal role in the type of spatial representations that emerge.
   Author summary
   Most species rely on navigation in space to find water, food, and mates, as well as to return home. When navigating, humans and animals can use one of two reference frames: one based on stable landmarks in the external environment, such as moving due north and then east, or one centered on oneself, such as moving forward and turning left. However, it remains unclear how these reference frames are chosen and interact in navigation tasks, as well as how they are supported by representations in the brain. We therefore modeled two navigation tasks that would each benefit from using one of these reference frames, and trained an artificial agent to learn to solve them through trial and error. Our results show that when given the choice, the agent leveraged the appropriate reference frame to solve the task, but surprisingly could also use the other reference frame when constrained to do so. We also show that the representations that emerge to enable the agent to solve the tasks exist on a spectrum, and are more complex than commonly thought. These representations reflect both the task and reference frame being used, and provide useful insights for the design of experimental tasks to study the use of navigational strategies.

AB  - The ketogenic diet (KD) has been proposed as a potential treatment for depression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate further the effects of KD on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression in mice and investigate the underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrated that KD intervention significantly alleviated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors, as evidenced by a decrease in immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test, an increase in distance traveled in the open field test, and a greater preference for sucrose in the sucrose preference test. KD alleviated neuroinflammation by reducing the levels of glial cell activation markers Iba-1 and GFAP, inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and COX-2, and suppressing the overactivation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Furthermore, KD increased the number of DCX-, BrdU-, and PSD95-positive cells in the hippocampus and enhanced the BDNF/TrkB/CREB and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways, thereby promoting hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings suggested that KD alleviated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice by reducing neuroinflammation, enhancing neurotrophic signaling, and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for its potential as a novel dietary antidepressant therapy.

AB  - Aging is a natural process accompanied by inflammation and oxidative stress and is closely associated with age-related diseases. As a direct precursor of glutathione, gamma-glutamylcysteine (gamma-GC) possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; however, whether gamma-GC plays an important role in anti-aging remains unknown. Here, we investigated the protective effects and mechanisms of gamma-GC in D-galactose (D-gal)-induced senescence in PC12 cells and aging mice. Our results showed that gamma-GC treatment significantly reduced the percentage of senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal)-positive cells and inhibited D-gal-induced cell cycle arrest in PC12 cells. The results of Nissl and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in mouse brain showed that gamma-GC treatment markedly reversed the damage in the hippocampus of D-gal-induced aging mice. Moreover, gamma-GC increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to promote the nuclear translocation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) while inhibiting the nuclear translocation of deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1), which leads to the activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and deacetylation of p53 in the nucleus. Therefore, gamma-GC may be a potential therapeutic candidate compound for the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease marked by mitochondrial dysfunction, amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregation, and neuronal cell loss. G-protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) has been used as a promising target for insulin receptors in diabetes therapy, but GPR55's role in AD is still unidentified. Gelatin (GE) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymeric hydrogels are commonly used in the drug delivery system. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the preparation of magnesium hydroxide nanocomposite using Clitoria ternatea (CT) flower extract, GE, and PEG (GE/PEG/Mg(OH)2NCs) by the green precipitation method. The synthesized GE/PEG/Mg (OH)2NCs were used to determine the effect of GPR55 activation of intracerebroventricular administration on streptozotocin (ICV-STC)-induced cholinergic dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. The GE/PEG/Mg(OH)2NCs were administered following bilateral ICV-STC administration (3 mg/kg) in experimental rats. Neurobehavioral assessments were performed using a Morris water maze (MWM) and a passive avoidance test (PA). Cholinergic and antioxidant activity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial complex activity were estimated in the cortex and hippocampus through biochemical analysis. Inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta) were determined using the ELISA method. Our study results demonstrated that the GE/ PEG/Mg(OH)2NCs treatment significantly improved spatial and non-spatial memory functions in behavioral studies. Moreover, the treatment with GE/PEG/Mg(OH)2NCs group significantly attenuated cholinergic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers, and also highly improved anti-oxidant activity (GSH, SOD, CAT, and GPx) in the cortex and hippocampus regions. The western blot results suggest the activation of the GPR55 protein expression through GE/PEG/Mg(OH)2NCs. The histopathological studies showed clear cytoplasm and healthy neurons, effectively promoting neuronal activity. Furthermore, the molecular docking results demonstrated the binding affinity and potential interactions of the compounds with the AChE enzyme. In conclusion, the GE/PEG/Mg(OH)2NCs treated groups showed reduced neurotoxicity and have the potential as a therapeutic agent to effectively target AD.

AB  - The dorsal (DRN) and median (MRN) raphe are important nuclei involved in similar functions, including mood and sleep, but playing distinct roles. These nuclei have a different composition of neuronal types and set of neuronal connections, which among other factors, determine their neuronal dynamics. Most works characterize the neuronal dynamics using classic measures, such as using the average spiking frequency (FR), the coefficient of variation (CV), and action potential duration (APD). In the current study, to refine the characterization of neuronal firing profiles, we examined the neurons within the raphe nuclei. Through the utilization of nonlinear measures, our objective was to discern the redundancy and complementarity of these measures, particularly in comparison with classic methods. To do this, we analyzed the neuronal basal firing profile in both nuclei of urethane-anesthetized rats using the Shannon entropy (Bins Entropy) of the inter-spike intervals, permutation entropy of ordinal patterns (OP Entropy), and Permutation Lempel-Ziv Complexity (PLZC). Firstly, we found that classic (i.e., FR, CV, and APD) and nonlinear measures fail to distinguish between the dynamics of DRN and MRN neurons, except for the OP Entropy. We also found strong relationships between measures, including the CV with FR, CV with Bins entropy, and FR with PLZC, which imply redundant information. However, APD and OP Entropy have either a weak or no relationship with the rest of the measures tested, suggesting that they provide complementary information to the characterization of the neuronal firing profiles. Secondly, we studied how these measures are affected by the oscillatory properties of the firing patterns, including rhythmicity, bursting patterns, and clock-like behavior. We found that all measures are sensitive to rhythmicity, except for the OP Entropy. Overall, our work highlights OP Entropy as a powerful and useful quantity for the characterization of neuronal discharge patterns.
   The spiking activity of neurons in a certain population can be characterized by different measures. Classic methods to do this characterization are the firing rate, which is the number of spikes per second, the action potential duration, which measures the duration of the spike, and the coefficient of variation, which quantifies the regularity in the inter-spike intervals. In this work, we tested these linear methods and added three different measures of complexity to characterize the neuronal activity of two groups of neurons in the rat: the dorsal and median raphe. These nonlinear measures quantify the degree of uncertainty or average information in the sequence of inter-spike intervals, and are called Shannon entropy (Bins Entropy), Permutation entropy (OP Entropy), and Permutation Lempel-Ziv Complexity (PLZC). We found that only the OP Entropy was sensitive to the different activity from the DRN and MRN neurons. Additionally, OP Entropy has either a weak or no relationship with the rest of the measures tested, providing complementary information to the characterization of the neuronal activity. We also show that OP Entropy is unaffected by other patterns in the signal, like rhythmicity or burst patterns, concluding that OP Entropy is a good measure to characterize the neuronal activity.

AB  - A crucial aspect of neural engineering is the ability to manipulate proteins that are substantially involved in axonal outgrowth and maintenance. Previous work in this field has shown that applying low-magnitude (piconewton) forces to early stage neurons can result in altered distributions of critical structural proteins, such as the microtubule-associated protein Tau. Uncovering the mechanisms of Tau redistribution could provide a tool for manipulating dysregulated forms of the protein. This study examined how the transport of Tau responded to intra-axonal nanomagnetic forces (NMFs) in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. High magnification, live cell fluorescent imaging was employed to visualize the transport of both full-length human Tau (hTau40) and amine-terminated, starch-coated fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (afMNPs) to observe how these cell-internal forces could impact the transport of hTau40 within the axon. Here, we found that afMNPs acted by pulling on hTau40 puncta under NMF application, especially within cortical cells, where afMNPs were more likely to be found within the axon. Forces greater than 1 pN enabled differentiated transport speeds and displacement of hTau40 based on relative force direction. This data indicates that NMF can be utilized to engineer hTau40 transport, even in cells at later stages of maturation.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health concern that can result in long-term neurological impairments. Calpain is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that is activated within minutes after TBI, and sustained calpain activation is known to contribute to neurodegeneration and blood-brain barrier dysregulation. Based on its role in disease progression, calpain inhibition has been identified as a promising therapeutic target. Efforts to develop therapeutics for calpain inhibition would benefit from the ability to measure calpain activity with spatial precision within the injured tissue. In this work, we designed an activity-based nanotheranostic (ABNT) that can both sense and inhibit calpain activity in TBI. To sense calpain activity, we incorporated a peptide substrate of calpain flanked by a fluorophore/quencher pair. To inhibit calpain activity, we incorporated calpastatin peptide, an endogenous inhibitor of calpain. Both sensor and inhibitor peptides were scaffolded onto a polymeric nanoscaffold to create our ABNT. We show that in the presence of recombinant calpain, our ABNT construct is able to sense and inhibit calpain activity. In a mouse model of TBI, systemically administered ABNT can access perilesional brain tissue through passive accumulation and inhibit calpain activity in the cortex and hippocampus. In an analysis of cellular calpain activity, we observe the ABNT-mediated inhibition of calpain activity in neurons, endothelial cells, and microglia of the cortex. In a comparison of neuronal calpain activity by brain structure, we observe greater ABNT-mediated inhibition of calpain activity in cortical neurons compared to that in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we found that apoptosis was dependent on both calpain inhibition and brain structure. We present a theranostic platform that can be used to understand the regional and cell-specific therapeutic inhibition of calpain activity to help inform drug design for TBI.

AB  - Emerging techniques for mapping mRNAs within the subcellular compartments of live cells hold great promise for advancing our understanding of the spatial distribution of transcripts and enabling the study of single-cell dynamics in health and disease. This is particularly critical for polarized cells, such as neurons, where mRNA compartmentalization is essential for regulating gene expression, and defects in these localization mechanisms are linked to numerous neurological disorders. However, many subcellular analysis techniques require a compromise between subcellular precision, live-cell measurements, and nondestructive access to single cells in their native microenvironment. To overcome these challenges, we employ a single-cell technology that we have recently developed, the nanotweezer, which features a nanoscale footprint (similar to 100 nm), avoids cytoplasmic fluid aspiration, and enables rapid RNA isolation from living cells with minimal invasiveness. Using this tool, we investigate single-cell mRNA compartmentalization in the soma and dendrites of hippocampal neurons at different stages of neuronal development. By combining precise targeting with sequential sampling, we track changes in mRNA abundance at dendritic spine regions of the same neuron, both before and after stimulation. This minimally invasive approach enables time-resolved, subcellular gene expression profiling of the same single cell. This could provide critical insights into polarized cells and advance our understanding of biological processes and complex diseases.

AB  - Aging-related decline in memory and synaptic function are associated with the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, attributed to the overexpression of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). The membrane insertion of AMPAR governed by the AMPAR auxiliary proteins is essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (LTP). In this study, we demonstrated the hippocampal expression of the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins gamma-8 (TARP gamma 8) was reduced in aged mice along with the reduced CaMKII alpha activity and memory impairment. We further showed that TARP gamma 8 expression was dependent on CaMKII alpha activity. Inhibition of CaMKII alpha activity significantly reduced the hippocampal TARP gamma 8 expression and CA3-CA1 LTP in young mice to a similar level to that of the aged mice. Furthermore, the knockdown of hippocampal TARP gamma 8 impaired LTP and memory in young mice, which mimicked the aging-related changes. We confirmed the enhanced hippocampal VGCC (Cav-1.3) expression in aged mice and found that inhibition of VGCC activity largely increased both p-CaMKII alpha and TARP gamma 8 expression in aged mice, whereas inhibition of NMDAR or Calpains had no effect. In addition, we found that the exogenous expression of human TARP gamma 8 in the hippocampus in aged mice restored LTP and memory function. Collectively, these results indicate that the synaptic and cognitive impairment in aging is associated with the downregulation of CaMKII alpha-TARP gamma 8 signaling caused by VGCC activation. Our results suggest that TARP gamma 8 may be a key molecular biomarker for brain aging and that boosting CaMKII alpha-TARP gamma 8 signaling may be critical for the restoration of synaptic plasticity of aging and aging-related diseases.
   Aging is associated with increased VGCC activity and blunted NMDAR function, which causes dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and impairment of synaptic plasticity (LTP). TARP gamma 8 expression is dependent on CaMKII alpha activity, which is mediated by VGCC activity. The downregulation of CaMKII alpha-TARP gamma 8 signaling caused by VGCC-mediated calcium influx results in aging-related impairment of synaptic plasticity and spatial learning.image

AB  - Despite relatively high maturation rate of in vitro matured oocytes in the dromedary camel, however, blastocyst production is very low after in vitro fertilization (IVF). Herein, the influences of oocyte collection method (follicular aspiration vs slicing; Experiment I), the addition of Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) the maturation medium (Experiment II) on in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocyte were investigated. Although the nuclear maturation did not differ regardless of collecting method, follicular aspiration led to lower degeneration rates than those in controls (P < 0.05). The percentages of oocytes at MII were greater in presence of IGF-1 than in its absence (71.9% vs 48.4%, respectively, P<0.05). Additionally, the percentages of degenerated oocytes were higher in the control group compared to oocytes cultured in the presence of IGF-I (23.6% vs 10.4%, respectively, P<0.05). IGF-I treatment improved the quality of MII matured oocytes as evidenced by the decrease of cathepsin B (CTSB) activity, a marker of poor quality oocytes, when compared to control ones (P < 0.05). In conclusion, follicular aspiration decreased the degeneration rate; however, it had no effect on completion of maturation. IGF-I enhanced the IVM of oocyte and decreased rate.

AB  - Respiratory pathogens kill more people than any other infectious agent each year worldwide. Development of novel, economically friendly, sustainable, and highly efficient materials against viruses is a major challenge. Herein, we describe a nanostructured material composed of very small crystalline phosphate copper nanoparticles synthesized using a new biohybrid technology that employs a biological agent for its formation at room temperature in aqueous media. The evaluation of different enzymes in the final preparation of the nanomaterial or even in synthetic methods was performed. Biochemical characterization revealed the formation of Cu species in the protein network. The best biomaterial synthesized using a lipase called BioCuNPs showed excellent inhibition capacity against functional proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); for example, assent 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro) complete inhibition was achieved by using 5 mu g/mL, or acetone (ACE)-spike protein interaction was inhibited by more than 80% in the presence of 400 mu g/mL of BioCuNPs. Taking these in vitro results into account, an efficacy analysis against human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-E229) coronavirus was performed. A virus reduction of 99% was obtained in 5 min. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 virus was tested to demonstrate high efficiency, with > 99% inhibition in 15 min using 500 microgram of material. To determine the wide applicability of this nanohybrid against viruses, an evaluation was carried out against a non-enveloped virus such as Human Rhinovirus (HRV-14), obtaining a virus reduction of 99.9% in 5 min. Finally, the virucidal capacity against different bacteriophages was also evaluated, obtaining an excellent inhibition effect against Phage phi X174 (99.999% reduction in 5 min).

AB  - ObjectiveThe irrational use of antibiotics is a leading contributor to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic stewardship (AS) interventions predominantly focus on prescribers. This study investigated the influence and participation of inpatients in infection-related care, including antibiotic decision-making, within and across two tertiary hospitals in South Africa (Cape Town) and India (Kerala). MethodsThrough ethnographic enquiry of clinical practice in surgical pathways, including direct nonparticipant observation of clinical practices, healthcare worker (HCW), patient and carer interactions in surgical ward rounds and face-to-face interviews with participants (HCWs and patients), we sought to capture the implicit and explicit influence that patients and carers have in infection-related care. Field notes and interview transcripts were thematically coded, aided by NVivo 12 (R) Pro software. ResultsWhilst observational data revealed the nuanced roles that patients/carers play in antibiotic decision-making, HCWs did not recognize these roles. Patients and carers, though invested in patient care, are not routinely involved, nor are they aware of the opportunities for engagement in infection-related decision-making. Patients associated clinical improvement with antibiotic use and did not consider hospitalization to be associated with infection acquisition or transmission, highlighting a lack of understanding of the threat of infection and antibiotic resistance. Patients' economic and cultural positionalities may influence their infection-related behaviours. In the study site in India, cultural norms mean that carers play widespread but unrecognized roles in inpatient care, participating in infection prevention activities. ConclusionFor patients to have a valuable role in AS and make informed decisions regarding their infection-related care, a mutual understanding of their role in this process among HCWs and patients is crucial. The observed differences between the two study sites indicate the critical need for understanding and addressing the contextual drivers that impact effective patient-centred healthcare delivery. Patient or Public ContributionEthnographic observations and interviews conducted in this study involved patients as participants. Patients were recruited for interviews after obtaining signed informed consent forms. Patients' identities were completely anonymized when presenting the study findings.

AB  - The risk assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic were primarily based on dose-response models derived from the pooled datasets for infection of animals susceptible to SARS-CoV. Despite similarities, differences in susceptibility between animals and humans exist for respiratory viruses. The two most commonly used dose-response models for calculating the infection risk of respiratory viruses are the exponential and the Stirling approximated beta-Poisson (BP) models. The modified version of the one-parameter exponential model or the Wells-Riley model was almost solely used for infection risk assessments during the pandemic. Still, the two-parameter (alpha and beta) Stirling approximated BP model is often recommended compared to the exponential dose-response model due to its flexibility. However, the Stirling approximation restricts this model to the general rules of beta >> 1 and alpha MUCH LESS-THAN beta, and these conditions are very often violated. To refrain from these requirements, we tested a novel BP model by using the Laplace approximation of the Kummer hypergeometric function instead of the conservative Stirling approximation. The datasets of human respiratory airborne viruses available in the literature for human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and human rhinovirus (HRV-16 and HRV-39) are used to compare the four dose-response models. Based on goodness-of-fit criteria, the exponential model was the best fitting model for the HCoV-229E (k = 0.054) and for HRV-39 datasets (k = 1.0), whereas the Laplace approximated BP model followed by the exact and Stirling approximated BP models are preferred for both the HRV-16 (alpha = 0.152 and beta = 0.021 for Laplace BP) and the HRV-16 and HRV-39 pooled datasets (alpha = 0.2247 and beta = 0.0215 for Laplace BP).

AB  - Fat depots or triglycerides are hydrolysed by the action of lipases in fish to be used for energy and/or for growth and reproduction. In herbivores fishes, de novo synthesis of lipids from non-lipid substrates (glucose) leads to fat deposits and/or fatty infiltration in organs especially on ovaries limiting its normal functions. This study was aimed to understand lipases from the digestive tract (DT) of adult Hypselobarbus pulchellus of different sizes, their partial purification, characterisation and their isozymes. In-vitro hydrolysis study on interaction of carbohydrate with proteins was evaluated to establish specific protein selection that combat undue glucose release. Results of the study identified four lipase isoenzymes of similar to mol. wt 19.88, 24.29, 32.86, 54.56 kDa with optimal pH of 3.5 and 8, pH stability between pH 5.5-10; optimal temperature at 35 degrees C and heat stability between 35 and 45 degrees C. Characterisation studies indicated presence of thiol group in their active site and Ca, Na and Zn ions activated lipase activity. Rice bran as carbohydrate source when used along with azolla (plant protein) and fish meal (animal protein) may combat undue release of excess glucose that leads to visceral fat formation in H. pulchellus as assessed from in vitro studies.

AB  - Rhinoviruses (RVs) evoke as many as 85% of acute asthma exacerbations in children and 50% in adults and can induce airway hyperresponsiveness and decrease efficacy of current therapeutics to provide symptom relief. Using human precision-cut lung slices (hPCLSs), primary human air-liquid interface-differentiated airway epithelial cells (HAECs), and human airway smooth muscle (HASM) as preclinical experimental models, we demonstrated that RV-C15 attenuates agonist-induced bronchodilation. Specifically, airway relaxation to formoterol and cholera toxin, but not forskolin (Fsk), was attenuated following hPCLS exposure to RV-C15. In isolated HASM cells, exposure to conditioned media from RV-exposed HAECs decreased cellular relaxation in response to isoproterenol and prostaglandin E-2, but not Fsk. Additionally, cAMP generation elicited by formoterol and isoproterenol, but not Fsk, was attenuated following HASM exposure to RV-C15-conditioned HAEC media. HASM exposure to RV-C15-conditioned HAEC media modulated expression of components of relaxation pathways, specifically GNAI1 and GRK2. Strikingly, similar to exposure to intact RV-C15, hPCLS exposed to UV-inactivated RV-C15 showed markedly attenuated airway relaxation in response to formoterol, suggesting that the mechanism(s) of RV-C15-mediated loss of bronchodilation is independent of virus replication pathways. Further studies are warranted to identify soluble factor(s) regulating the epithelial-driven smooth muscle loss of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor function.

AB  - DS severely impacts tea plant growth and yield. Foliar application of Methyl jasmonate (MJ)-loaded Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) (MJ-CNPs) significantly boost tea DS resistance, necessitating further mechanism exploration. This study comprehensively investigated alterations at the phenotypic, biochemical, and genetic levels. Relative water content, total pigment content, and soluble proteins decreased, while soluble sugar increased significantly under DS and with apparent recovery after MJ-CNPs treatment. Catechins exhibited a significant decrease under DS, especially EGCG (24.6 to 13.4 mg center dot g-1), but were absolutely mitigated by treatment. Antioxidant capacities (DPPH, FRAP, ABTS, and SOA) showed a further improvement by MJ-CNPs treatment. Endogenous ABA and SA increased under DS, further elevated by MJ-CNPs. CsNCED, CsPYL8, CsPP2C, CsMYB, and CsABF genes involved in ABA-dependent pathways were confirmed with promoted expressions by foliar pretreatment.

AB  - Pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera, a polyphagus herbivore causes extensive economic losses to crops, including pigeonpea. Exploitation of pod borer resistance in wild relatives is pertinent due to the absence of resistance sources in cultivated pigeonpea and crossing-incompatibility with the resistant wild relatives. We present leads obtained in deeper understanding of pod borer resistance mechanism in Cajanus platycarpus, a pigeonpea wild relative. Surge in cellular ROS during herbivory leads to redox-PTMs (post translational modifications) of methionine-rich proteins including antioxidant enzymes, causing oxidative damage. Plants then officiate methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs), that maintain the redox status of methionine and hence homeostasis. We demonstrate functionality of MSRs (MSRA and MSRB) in the resistance response of the wild relative to pod borer. Among 5 MSRA and 3 MSRB genes, CpMSRA2 and CpMSRB1 were herbivore-responsive based on expression during herbivory. Clues about the stress-responsiveness were obtained upon analyses of cis-elements and co-expressing genes. Apparently, the wild relative followed a non-canonical mode of redox management, as divulged by antioxidant enzymes and the scavenging capacity. Differential lipid peroxidation as an early response provided evidences for an effective redox management in the wild relative. This is the first report signifying redox homeostasis in the resistance response towards herbivory.

AB  - Plant glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is involved in germinal development and stress response. In the present study, 15 GSK3 members were identified in tea plants and categorised into four subfamilies. During brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated cold stress, the expression levels of the Camellia sinensis synthase kinase1(CsSK1) gene was significantly down-regulated. This gene is highly homologous to the gene encoding BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE (BIN2) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). These results suggest that CsSK1 is a candidate gene involved in BR-mediated cold stress in tea plants. Overexpression of the CsSK1 gene in A. thaliana reduced the survival rate of plants at low temperatures, thereby weakening cold tolerance. However, after silencing the CsSK1 in tea plants, cold tolerance was enhanced. In this study, we determined that the protein Camellia sinensis sumo conjugation enzyme1 (CsSCE1) interacts with CsSK1. Silencing of CsSCE1 weakened the cold tolerance of tea plants, indicating that CsSCE1 positively regulates plant cold resistance. Additionally, silencing of CsSCE1 enhanced the expression of CsSK1; similarly, the expression of CsSCE1 increased after CsSK1 was silenced. In summary, CsSK1 interacts with CsSCE1 and plays a negative regulatory role in cold tolerance in tea plants. This study provides new insights into the role of BRs in the regulation of cold tolerance in plants.

AB  - Cyp17a is a key enzyme in steroidogenesis and reproduction in vertebrates. In teleosts, two paralogous genes, cyp17a1 and cyp17a2, have been identified, and while the potential impact of mutations in these genes have been studied, a comprehensive comparative analysis of their regulatory mechanisms in teleost reproduction remains lacking. In this study, we established a double mutant (dko) of cyp17a1 and cyp17a2 and conducted a transcriptome analysis of their gonads to systematically investigate the differences in steroidogenesis and gene expression between the two genes. Phenotypic analysis revealed that both cyp17a1- /- and dko mutants exhibited a reduced gonadosomatic index, abnormal Leydig cell proliferation, and male infertility. RNA sequencing of the testes identified 2688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with significant variations between the mutants and wild-type males. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs were enriched in pathways related to steroid biosynthesis, HIF-1, PPAR, and Hippo signaling. Furtherly, steroid profiling confirmed cyp17a1- /- -specific androgen and estrogen deficiency (T, 11-KT, E1, and E2), while revealing dko-specific deficiencies in DHP, cortisol, and cortisone, alongside an overaccumulation of corticosterone, highlighting paralog-specific substrate preferences. These findings underscore the Cyp17a paralogs as critical regulators of testicular metabolictransport networks, thereby offering insights into male infertility linked to steroid biosynthesis defects.

AB  - The Spotted knifejaw was previously considered a predominantly carnivorous species, but emerging evidence suggests that it exhibits omnivorous characteristics. However, the mechanisms underpinning its dietary remain poorly understood; Behavioral experiments have demonstrated that the fish shows preferences for both carnivorous and herbivorous foods and olfactory dysfunction was found to significantly reduced the responsiveness to food stimuli. Anatomical and histological analyses revealed a well-developed olfactory system, with increases in the number of olfactory lamellae and epithelial cells at 50 and 120 dph, which were consistent with spatio-temporal gene expression patterns. Genomic analyses identified ORs within the GPCR family, including 164 MORs, 77 TAARs, 4 V1Rs, and 7 V2Rs. Notably, a significant expansion of the delta subtype of MORs was observed suggesting a role in omnivorous adaptation. Transcriptomic WGCNA revealed the pathways related to protein digestion and absorption, pancreatic secretion, olfactory transduction, and gastric acid secretion. It is hypothesized that the expansion of TAAR13c is related to the carnivorous nature of O. punctatus. In situ hybridization confirmed the expression of key ORs in olfactory epithelial cells, sensory neurons, and intestinal endocrine cells, and functional validation of ORs using the dual luciferase assay, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing omnivory in the Spotted knifejaw.

AB  - To develop a greener and more efficient method for producing cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) from raw plants, an AlCl3-enhanced ternary deep eutectic solvent, DES2 (consisting of choline chloride, citric acid, and AlCl3 center dot 6H(2)O in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:0.08), was synthesized. Raw elephant grass (EG) was pretreated with DES2, followed by sodium chlorite (NaClO2) bleaching and ultrasonic disruption to extract high-performance CNFs. The DES2 and NaClO2 treatments effectively removed hemicellulose and lignin, achieving removal rates of 99.23 % and 99.62 %, respectively, while maintaining a cellulose content of 78.3 %. DES2 demonstrated easy recyclability and maintained excellent biomass pretreatment performance even after multiple cycles. Following a brief 30-min intermittent ultrasound treatment, the resulting CNFs demonstrated superior crystallinity, increased carboxyl content, and a narrower width distribution compared to CNFs obtained from AlCl3-free DES1. Optimized conditions at 110 degrees C yielded CNFs with 85.3 % crystallinity, 0.64 mmol/g carboxyl content, 5.15 nm width distribution, and excellent dispersion in water for at least six months. Additionally, CNFs enhanced the tensile strength of chia seed mucilage (CM) composite films, showing a significant improvement to 26.6 MPa, representing a 231.3 % increase over the control film. This study offers a promising approach for efficiently producing CNFs from raw plants.

AB  - Plant-based meat analogs often exhibit poor elasticity, limited water-holding capacity, and lack a well-integrated fat-phase, which limits their applications in food industry. This study aimed to introduce camellia seed-derived oleosomes as templates for lipid droplets into textured soy protein-wheat gluten, followed by dual-crosslinking using transglutaminase (TG) and sodium alginate with varying Ca2+ concentrations. Results showed that oleosomes inclusion transformed the porous structures of textured proteins into droplet-embedded protein matrices, along with enhanced hardness, increased lightness, and reduced redness. TG induction promoted the epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)-lysine bonds between oleosomes and continuous-phase proteins, while sodium alginate, reinforced by Ca2+, created a robust network structure with smaller pore sizes and more interaction zones that tightly held the oleosomes. The addition of 10-20 mM CaCl2 significantly increased the immobilized water content, G ' values and promoted the transformation of beta-turns to beta-sheets. According to Lissajous-Bowditch analyses, oleosome-protein meat analog was identified as a soft gel, exhibiting erratic and abrupt changes at strain <= 10 %. In contrast, TG-treated analogs, particularly those with both TG and Ca2+, exhibited greater structural elasticity and resistance to large deformations (<= 500 %), due to double-network structures with enhanced mechanical strength and reversible deformation resistance. Additionally, double-crosslinked meat analogs significantly influenced the rate of lipid digestion.

AB  - Coating seeds with biocontrol agents represents an effective approach for managing soil-borne plant diseases. However, improving the viability of biocontrol microorganisms on the seed surface or in the rhizosphere remains a big challenge due to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this work, we developed a microbial seed coating strategy that uses sporopollenin exine capsules (SECs) as carriers for the encapsulation of the biofilm-like biocontrol bacteria. SECs was extracted from camellia bee pollen, and then characterized by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), elemental analysis and thermal gravity analysis (TG). The Paenibacillus polymyxa ZF129, a biocontrol bacterium, was introduced into SECs using the vacuum-incubation method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Notably, the ZF129 cell formed a biofilm-like structure inside the SECs, which enhanced their tolerance to acidic stress. As a proof of concept, we applied ZF129-loaded SECs to coat pak choi seeds using a straightforward plate-shaking technique. The coated seeds demonstrated a high control efficacy of up to 60.46 % against clubroot disease. Overall, this study sheds light on the application of SECs as promising carrier for the encapsulation of biofilm-like biocontrol bacteria, further augmenting the biocontrol functionality of microbial seed coating.

AB  - The development of the extraction process for improving the starch yield from unconventional plants is emerging as a topic of interest. In this respect, the present work aimed to optimize the starch extraction from the corms of elephant foot yam (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius) with the help of response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The RSM model performed better than the ANN in predicting the starch yield with higher precision. In this connection, this study for the first time reports the significant improvement of starch yield from A. paeoniifolius (51.76 g/100 g of the corm dry weight). The extracted starch samples based on yield - high (APHS), medium (APMS), and low (APLS) exhibited a variable granule size (7.17-14.14 mu m) along with low ash content, moisture content, protein, and free amino acid indicating purity and desirability. The FTIR analysis also confirmed the chemical composition and purity of the starch samples. Moreover, the XRD analysis showed the prevalence of C-type starch (2 theta = 14.303 degrees). Based on other physicochemical, biochemical, func-tional, and pasting properties, the three starch samples showed more or less similar characteristics thereby indicating the sustentation of beneficial attributes of starch molecules irrespective of the variation in extraction parameters.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) are perennial woody economic crops that are often exposed to a range of abiotic stresses, especially low temperatures, during development. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a nonprotein amino acid widely distributed in plants that is involved in the low-temperature response of plants. Here, we found that CsGAT1 was upregulated in tea leaves subjected to low-temperature stress according to transcriptomic data. Heterologous expression of CsGAT1 in a yeast mutant revealed that it specifically transports GABA. Subcellular localization assays revealed that CsGAT1 was located on the plasma membrane. The organizational localization experiments revealed that the expression level of CsGAT1 was relatively high in the old leaves and roots and relatively low in the flowers. Testing of different cold-tolerant tea germplasm resources revealed that cultivars with relatively low cold resistance presented relatively low CsGAT1 expression and GABA levels. In addition, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CsGAT1 presented high levels of GABA accumulation and significant lowtemperature resistance. In summary, we believe that CsGAT1 regulates the ability of tea plants to resist lowtemperature stress by changing the concentration of GABA inside and outside the cell. This study provides a theoretical basis for breeding new tea cultivars with strong resistance to low-temperature stress during production.

AB  - In spite of the increasing amount of literature on the production and application of lignin nanoparticles (LNPs), little or no attention has been paid so far to the influence of different production methods on the properties of these nanostructures. Herein, we propose a comprehensive study to assess the impact of several factors on the color, morphology, colloidal stability, antioxidant capacity, and UV-shielding performance of LNPs. LNPs were obtained by two different routes: a bottom-up approach based on the self-assembly in a solvent-antisolvent system with acetone/lignin/water; or a top-down approach based on the ultrasonication of never-dried lignin aqueous suspensions. The starting lignin was extracted from elephant grass leaves or stems, so that the influence of anatomical origin and molecular weight could also be investigated. Moreover, lignin was oxidized prior to being converted into LNPs, allowing for comparisons between different oxidation degrees. This study showed that interesting properties of LNPs can be easily tailored and combined focusing on the various applications of these versatile nanostructures. In a model application, different types of LNPs were incorporated into poly(vinyl alcohol)-based nanocomposites, modulating the UV-protection capability of the polymer matrix.

AB  - Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is an important economical crop that frequently suffers from various herbicides, especially glyphosate. However, the molecular responses and regulatory mechanisms of glyphosate stress in tea plants remain poorly understood. Here, we reported a transcriptome dataset and identified large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under glyphosate exposure. Next, two glutathione S-transferase genes (CsGSTU8-1 and CsGSTU8-2) that upregulated significantly were screened as candidate genes. Tissue-specific expression patterns showed that both CsGSTU8-1 and CsGSTU8-2 had extremely high expression levels in the roots and were predominantly localized in the nucleus and plasma membrane based on subcellular localization. Both were significantly upregulated at different time points under various stressors, including drought, cold, salt, pathogen infections, and SA treatments. An enzymatic activity assay showed that CsGSTU8-1 catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (CDNB). Functional analysis in yeast verified that the two genes significantly contributed to the detoxification of glyphosate, and CsGSTU8-1 had a stronger role in detoxification than CsGSTU8-2. Taken together, these findings provide insights into the molecular responses of tea plants to glyphosate and the functions of CsGSTU8s in glyphosate detoxification, which can be used as a promising genetic resource for improving herbicide resistance in tea cultivars.

AB  - In response to neuronal activity changes, the adult hippocampal circuits undergo continuous synaptic remodeling, which is essential for information processing, learning, and memory encoding. Glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, actively regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity by coordinating the neuronal activity-induced synaptic changes at the circuit level. Emerging evidence suggests that the crosstalk between neurons and glia in the adult hippocampus is region specific and that the mechanisms controlling this process are critically dependent on secreted factors. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a cytokine of the IL-1 family, is a key factor that modulates such glia-driven neuromodulations in two distinct hippocampal circuits. The activation of IL-33 and its receptor complex is important for maintaining the excitatory synaptic activity in the cornu ammonis 1 subregion and the remodeling of dentate gyrus synapses through activity-dependent astrocyte-synapse and microglia-synapse interactions, respectively. Meanwhile, the dysregulation of this signaling is implicated in multiple neurological disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease. Further investigations of how IL-33/ST2 signaling is regulated in a region-specific manner as well as its diverse functions in glia-synapse communications in the adult hippocampal circuitry will provide insights into the nature of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and homeostasis in health and disease.

AB  - Biomechanical contributions of the extracellular matrix underpin cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, signal transduction, and other fate decisions. As such, biomaterials whose mechanics can be spatiotemporally altered- particularly in a reversible manner- are extremely valuable for studying these mechanobiological phenomena. Herein, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogel model consisting of two interpenetrating step-growth networks is introduced that are independently formed via largely orthogonal bioorthogonal chemistries and sequentially degraded with distinct recombinant sortases, affording reversibly tunable stiffness ranges that span healthy and diseased soft tissues (e.g., 500 Pa-6 kPa) alongside terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single-cell analysis in a near "biologically invisible" manner. Spatiotemporal control of gelation within the primary supporting network is achieved via mask-based and two-photon lithography; these stiffened patterned regions can be subsequently returned to the original soft state following sortase-based secondary network degradation. Using this approach, the effects of 4D-triggered network mechanical changes on human mesenchymal stem cell morphology and Hippo signaling, as well as Caco-2 colorectal cancer cell mechanomemory using transcriptomics and metabolic assays are investigated. This platform is expected to be of broad utility for studying and directing mechanobiological phenomena, patterned cell fate, and disease resolution in softer matrices.
   Biomaterials that can dynamically change stiffnesses are essential in further understanding the role of extracellular matrix mechanics. Using independently formulated and subsequently degradable interpenetrating hydrogel networks, the stiffening/softening of cell-laden matrices is reversibly and spatiotemporally triggered. Terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single-cell analysis is permitted in a near "biologically invisible" manner. image

AB  - Severe nasal polyposis and mucosal inflammation, in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) may include a dysregulated eicosanoid profile, but a clinical role for eicosanoids in CRS with nasal polyps (NP; CRSwNP) re-mains to be elucidated. This study focused on assessing levels and clinical implications of inflammatory medi-ators in nasal secretions and urine from patients with different NP severity or Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD). Levels of leukotrienes E4 and B4, prostaglandins D2 and E2 as well as 15(S)-hydroxyeicosate-traenoic acid were measured with enzyme immunoassays and cytokines with magnetic bead immunoassays. Patients with CRSwNP were subdivided based on NP score; CRSwNP-low (NP score & LE; 4, n = 11) or CRSwNP-high (NP score & GE; 5, n = 32) and compared to CRS without polyps (CRSsNP, n = 12), CRSwNP-AERD (n = 11) and individuals without CRS (n = 25). Smell test score, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), blood eosinophils and Sinonasal outcome test-22 were assessed as clinical markers. Leukotriene E4, prostaglandin D2 and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in nasal secretions correlated with NP score. Nasal leukotriene E4 also correlated with FeNO and smell test score, with highest levels found in CRSwNP-AERD. Levels of prostaglandin D2 in nasal secretion as well as urinary levels of the prostaglandin D2 metabolite 11 beta-prostaglandin F2 alpha differed between CRSNP-high and CRSwNP-low. Urinary 11 beta-prostaglandin F2 alpha was associated with asthma comorbidity whereas a similar association with prostaglandin D2 in nasal secretions was not observed. In conclusion, subdividing patients based on NP severity in combination with analysis of eicosanoids in non-invasively collected nasal se-cretions, may have clinical implications when assessing CRS disease severity.

AB  - The French voyage of exploration to New Holland (Australia) between 1800 and 1804, commanded by Nicolas Baudin (1754-1803), made substantial natural history collections, notably capturing dwarf emus from the two distinct populations on King Island (Ile King) in Bass Strait (December 1802) and Kangaroo Island (Ile Decres) (January 1803). Two of these emus survived their voyage to France, were housed briefly at the Empress Josephine's menagerie at Malmaison, and then the zoological park of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. Both died in 1822. With the wild populations on both islands exterminated soon after Baudin's visit, two watercolours, one by Charles-Alexandre Lesueur (1778-1846) and one by Leon de Wailly (fl. 1801-1824), have been central to the history of the dwarf emus. However, an important contemporary engraving by Nicolas Huet (1770-1830) depicting the two surviving emus in captivity has been overlooked. This essay explores the history of the images of the now extinct dwarf emus, as well as the production and significance of Huet's engraving.

AB  - A rapid and accurate yield estimation is of great significance to the management and sustainable development of Camellia Oleifera forests. Consequently, the simultaneous and accurate detection of key phenology features of Camellia Oleifera (buds, flowers, fruits) is crucial for precise yield estimation. This not only enables robotic harvesting but also allows for the prediction of peak flowering and fruit ripening periods to determine the optimal harvesting time. However, in recent studies, only Camellia Oleifera fruits have been marked and detected. Therefore, to enable rapid yield estimation, it is necessary to simultaneously detect the key phenology stages (buds, flowers, fruits) of Camellia Oleifera. In this study, we annotated, trained, and predicted Camellia Oleifera buds, flowers, and fruits collected via field cameras to observe their daily quantitative changes. Quantity change curves were generated to estimate crucial phenology stages. Phenology feature detection and transfer learning were performed using the YOLO v5 model, widely used YOLO v3 model, and CenterNet model with center point prediction, all trained on the same dataset. The best model for phenology feature detection was selected based on a comparison of average precision, with the YOLO v5 model achieving a higher mean Average Precision (mAP) value of 91.31 % compared to the CenterNet (85.43 %) and YOLO v3 (81.00 %) models. In YOLO v5, the AP values for bud, flower, and fruit detection were 82.80 %, 98.13 %, and 92.99 %, respectively, surpassing the CenterNet model by 3.97 %, 2.44 %, and 11.23 %, and the YOLO v3 model by 6.39 %, 17.13 %, and 11.67 %. The image size was adapted from 4000 x 3000 pixels to 512 x 512 pixels for model optimization. Additionally, data from the Seedling Center of Liuyang City collected at different years and times were utilized to showcase the generalizability and scalability of the selected models, resulting in mAP values of 86.14 %, 80.17 %, and 69.20 % for the three above-mentioned models respectively. The plotted phenology change curves unveiled that Camellia Oleifera undergoes four stages: fruit enlargement period, bud enlargement period, flowering period, and flower wilting period. The conclusion can be drawn that using field cameras and YOLOv5 can simultaneously achieve real-time detection of key phenology features (buds, flowers, and fruits) of Camellia Oleifera, in order to further record crucial phenology patterns (such as flowering peaks and fruit ripening periods). This study offers theoretical references and scientific evidence for monitoring changes in key phenology features of Camellia Oleifera.

AB  - The disparity between the postoperative outcomes of rhinoplasty and the expected results frequently necessitates secondary or multiple surgeries as a compensatory measure, greatly diminishing patient satisfaction. However, there is renewed optimism for addressing these challenges through the innovative realm of Four-Dimensional (4D) printing. This groundbreaking technology enables three-dimensional objects with shape-memory properties to undergo predictable transformations under specific external stimuli. Consequently, implants crafted using 4D printing offer significant potential for dynamic adjustments. Inspired by worms in our research, we harnessed 4D printing to fabricate a Shape-Memory Polyurethane (SMPU) for use as a nasal augmentation prosthesis. The choice of SMPU was guided by its Glass Transition Temperature (Tg), which falls within the acceptable temperature range for the human body. This attribute allowed for temperature-responsive intraoperative self-deformation and postoperative remodeling. Our chosen animal model for experimentation was rabbits. Taking into account the anatomical structure of the rabbit nose, we designed and produced nasal augmentation prostheses with superior biocompatibility. These prostheses were then surgically implanted in a minimally invasive manner into the rabbit noses. Remarkably, they exhibited successful temperature-controlled in-surgery self-deformation according to the predetermined shape and non-invasive remodeling within a mere 9 days post-surgery. Subsequent histological evaluations confirmed the practical viability of these prostheses in a living organism. Our research findings posit that worm-inspired 4D-printed SMPU nasal prostheses hold significant promise for achieving dynamic aesthetic adjustments.

AB  - The "Bodleian Plate", an early eighteenth-century engraved copper printing plate, bears a series of images of buildings erected in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, as well as depictions of plants and animals. Four of these natural history images portray fragments of marine algae here identified as Sargassum spp. (Sargassaceae) and Ascophyllum nodosum (Fucaceae). A fifth botanical subject is identified as fragments of the inflorescences of Tilia sp. (Malvaceae). Two of the Sargassum fragments show commensal marine organisms, a bryozoan ( probably Jellyella tuberculata (Membraniporidae)) and goose barnacles (Lepas sp. (Crustacea; Cirripedia)). A seahorse (Hippocampus sp. (Syngnathidae)), a ground beetle and a spider are also depicted. These new identifications contradict the hypothesis that the illustrations portray agricultural or other commodities of financial importance in Virginia during the early 1700s. A putative link with William Byrd II of Westover, Virginia, is not supported by the natural history images.

AB  - Hippocampal reverse replay, a phenomenon in which recently active hippocampal cells reactivate in the reverse order, is thought to contribute to learning, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), in animals. Here, we present a novel computational model which exploits reverse replay to improve stability and performance on a homing task. The model takes inspiration from the hippocampal-striatal network, and learning occurs via a three-factor RL rule. To augment this model with hippocampal reverse replay, we derived a policy gradient learning rule that associates place-cell activity with responses in cells representing actions and a supervised learning rule of the same form, interpreting the replay activity as a 'target' frequency. We evaluated the model using a simulated robot spatial navigation task inspired by the Morris water maze. Results suggest that reverse replay can improve performance stability over multiple trials. Our model exploits reverse reply as an additional source for propagating information about desirable synaptic changes, reducing the requirements for long-time scales in eligibility traces combined with low learning rates. We conclude that reverse replay can positively contribute to RL, although less stable learning is possible in its absence. Analogously, we postulate that reverse replay may enhance RL in the mammalian hippocampal-striatal system rather than provide its core mechanism.

AB  - One of the critical limitations in architectural design optimization (ADO) is slow convergence due to high-dimensional and multiscale variables. For the rapid and optimal digital prototyping of architectural forms, this paper proposes a novel metaheuristic optimization technique that hybridizes standard low-level algorithms: the differential evolutionary cuckoo-search-integrated tabu-adaptive pattern search (DECS-TAPS). We compared DECS-TAPS to 10 major standard algorithms and 31 hybrids through 14 benchmark tests and investigated multi-objective ADO problems to prove the computational effectiveness of multiple algorithm hybridization. Our findings show that DECS-TAPS is vastly efficient and superior to the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy algorithm in multifunnel and weak structural functions. The global sensitivity analysis demonstrated that integrating multiple algorithms is likely conducive to lowering parameter dependence and increasing robustness. For the practical application of DECS-TAPS in building simulation and design automation, Zebroid-a Rhino Grasshopper (GH) add-on-was developed using IronPython and the GH visual scripting language.

AB  - In nature, very few animals locomote on two legs. Static bipedalism can be found in four limbed and five limbed animals like dogs, cats, birds, monkeys and kangaroos, but it cannot be seen in hexapods or other multi-limbed animals. In this paper, we present a simulation with a novel perspective on the evolution of static bipedalism, with a virtual creature evolving its body and controllers, and we apply an evolutionary algorithm to explore the locomotion transition from octapods to bipods. We find that the presence of four limbs in the evolutionary trajectory of the creature scaffolds a parametric jump that enables bipedalism, and shows that hexapods, without undergoing such transformation, struggle to evolve into bipeds. An analysis of the transitional parameters points to the role of a shorter femur length in helping maintain the stability of the body, and the tibia length is responsible for improving the forward speed.

AB  - Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process involving several stages of tissue repair. This study has shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from the callus of Camellia japonica L. and their associated microRNAs (miRNAs) possess significant wound healing activities. In human fibroblasts, EVs from C. japonica L. stimulated wound healing and upregulated collagen gene expression. The EVs also decreased inflammation levels in human keratinocytes, supporting wound healing. Among the miRNAs identified, miR408, one of the abundant miRNAs in the EVs, also showed similar wound healing efficacy. These findings suggest that both EVs and miR408 from the callus of C. japonica L. play a pivotal role in promoting wound healing. Additionally, this study shows that the regulation of miRNAs between different kingdoms can be achieved and suggests a new direction for the utilization of plant-derived components.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer among women globally. Protein concentrations of Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase-1 (LATS1) and Nuclear Factor Kappa-B (NF-kappa B) have been identified as prospective biomarkers of radioresistance in cervical cancer. This preliminary study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of LATS1 and NF-kappa B levels as a biomarker for radioresistance and evaluate their response to radiation in cervical cancer patients. A comprehensive cross-sectional study was conducted involving 114 subjects diagnosed with advanced stages cervical cancer (stage IIIB and IVA) who underwent definitive radiotherapy. The concentrations of LATS1 and NF-kappa B were measured using ELISA from biopsy samples taken prior to the initiation of radiotherapy. This study's finding included 114 subjects, with a median age of 53 years. A total of 85 (74.5%) subjects had stage IIIB, while 29 (25.4%) subjects had stage IVA. The cut-offs for LATS1 and NF-kappa B were 0.02765 ng/mg and 192.42 pg/mg, respectively. Subjects with a higher expression of LATS1 were found to be unresponsive to radiation therapy (p <= 0.001; AUC = 32.7%), and subjects with a lower expression of NF-kappa B were found to be unresponsive to radiation therapy (p = 0.009; AUC = 61%). This study suggests that elevated LATS1 expression may inversely predict radioresistance, while NF-kappa B expression shows a weak correlation with resistance to radiation therapy.

AB  - Circular RNAs can regulate the development and progression of ischemic cerebral disease. However, it remains unclear whether they play a role in acute ischemic stroke. To investigate the role of the circular RNA Rap1b (circRap1b) in acute ischemic stroke, in this study we established an in vitro model of acute ischemia and hypoxia by subjecting HT22 cells to oxygen and glucose deprivation and a mouse model of acute ischemia and hypoxia by occluding the right carotid artery. We found that circRap1b expression was remarkably down-regulated in the hippocampal tissue of the mouse model and in the HT22 cell model. In addition, Hoxa5 expression was strongly up-regulated in response to circRap1b overexpression. Hoxa5 expression was low in the hippocampus of a mouse model of acute ischemia and in HT22-AIS cells, and inhibited HT22-AIS cell apoptosis. Importantly, we found that circRap1b promoted Hoxa5 transcription by recruiting the acetyltransferase Kat7 to induce H3K14ac modification in the Hoxa5 promoter region. Hoxa5 regulated neuronal apoptosis by activating transcription of Fam3a, a neuronal apoptosis-related protein. These results suggest that circRap1b regulates Hoxa5 transcription and expression, and subsequently Fam3a expression, ultimately inhibiting cell apoptosis. Lastly, we explored the potential clinical relevance of circRap1b and Hoxa5 in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the mechanism by which circRap1b inhibits neuronal apoptosis in acute ischemic stroke.

AB  - Green synthesis of nanoparticles has drawn huge attention in the last decade due to their eco-friendly, biocompatible nature. Phyto-assisted synthesis of metallic nanoparticles is widespread in the field of nanomedicine, especially for antimicrobial and anticancer activity. Here in the present research work, investigators have used the stem extract of the Himalayan plant Hippophae rhamnoides L, for the synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs). The synthesized of CuNPs were analyzed by using sophisticated instruments, i.e., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The size of the synthesized CuNPs was varying from 38 nm to 94 nm which were mainly spherical in shape. Further, the potential of the synthesized CuNPs was evaluated as an anticancer agent on the Hela cell lines, by performing an MTT assay. In the MTT assay, a concentration-dependent activity of CuNPs demonstrated the lower cell viability at 100 mu g/mL and IC50 value at 48 mu g/mL of HeLa cancer cell lines. In addition to this, apoptosis activity was evaluated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, Annexin V, and Propidium iodide (PI) staining, wherein the maximum ROS production was at a dose of 100 mu g per mL of CuNPs with a higher intensity of green fluorescence. In both DAPI and PI staining, maximum nuclear condensation was observed with 100 mu g/mL of CuNPs against HeLa cell lines.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) through mechanisms that remain incompletely characterized. Similar to AD, TBI models present with cellular metabolic alterations and modulated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Specifically, AD and TBI tissues display increases in amyloid-beta as well as its precursor, the APP C-terminal fragment of 99 a.a. (C99). Our recent data in cell models of AD indicate that C99, due to its affinity for cholesterol, induces the formation of transient lipid raft domains in the ER known as mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes ("MAM" domains). The formation of these domains recruits and activates specific lipid metabolic enzymes that regulate cellular cholesterol trafficking and sphingolipid turnover. Increased C99 levels in AD cell models promote MAM formation and significantly modulate cellular lipid homeostasis. Here, these phenotypes were recapitulated in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in adult mice. Specifically, the injured cortex and hippocampus displayed significant increases in C99 and MAM activity, as measured by phospholipid synthesis, sphingomyelinase activity and cholesterol turnover. In addition, our cell type-specific lipidomics analyses revealed significant changes in microglial lipid composition that are consistent with the observed alterations in MAM-resident enzymes. Altogether, we propose that alterations in the regulation of MAM and relevant lipid metabolic pathways could contribute to the epidemiological connection between TBI and AD.

AB  - Mitochondria play a key role in cellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. Dysfunction in the organelle Ca2+ handling appears to be involved in several pathological conditions, ranging from neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac failure and malignant transformation. In the past years, several targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) have been developed to study Ca2+ dynamics inside mitochondria of living cells. Surprisingly, while there is a number of transgenic mice expressing different types of cytosolic GECIs, few examples are available expressing mitochondria-localized GECIs, and none of them exhibits adequate spatial resolution. Here we report the generation and characterization of a transgenic mouse line (hereafter called mt-Cam) for the controlled expression of a mitochondriatargeted, Fo<spacing diaeresis> rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Cameleon, 4mtD3cpv. To achieve this goal, we engineered the mouse ROSA26 genomic locus by inserting the optimized sequence of 4mtD3cpv, preceded by a loxP-STOP-loxP sequence. The probe can be readily expressed in a tissue-specific manner upon Cre recombinase-mediated excision, obtainable with a single cross. Upon ubiquitous Cre expression, the Cameleon is specifically localized in the mitochondrial matrix of cells in all the organs and tissues analyzed, from embryos to aged animals. Ca2+ imaging experiments performed in vitro and ex vivo in brain slices confirmed the functionality of the probe in isolated cells and live tissues. This new transgenic mouse line allows the study of mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics in different tissues with no invasive intervention (such as viral infection or electroporation), potentially allowing simple calibration of the fluorescent signals in terms of mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]).

AB  - Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with significant neurological complications, yet the mechanisms underlying brain injury remain unclear. This study investigated the role of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in exacerbating CPB-induced neuronal apoptosis and identified vulnerable brain regions. Utilizing a rat CPB model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) cellular model, we demonstrated that IL-17A levels were markedly elevated in the hippocampus post-CPB, correlating with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-mediated apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the enrichment of IL-17 signaling and apoptosis-related pathways. IL-17A-Neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the ERS inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) significantly attenuated neurological deficits and hippocampal neuronal damage. Mechanistically, IL-17A activated the Act1-IRE1-JNK1 axis, wherein heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) competitively regulated Act1-IRE1 interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the enhanced Hsp90-Act1 binding post-CPB, promoting IRE1 phosphorylation and downstream caspase-12 activation. In vitro, IL-17A exacerbated OGD/R-induced apoptosis via IRE1-JNK1 signaling, reversible by IRE1 inhibition. These findings identify the hippocampus as a key vulnerable region and delineate a novel IL-17A/Act1-IRE1-JNK1 pathway driving ERS-dependent apoptosis. Targeting IL-17A or Hsp90-mediated chaperone switching represents a promising therapeutic strategy for CPB-associated neuroprotection. This study provides critical insights into the molecular crosstalk between systemic inflammation and neuronal stress responses during cardiac surgery.

AB  - Dendritic spines are crucial for excitatory synaptic transmission as the size of a spine head correlates with the strength of its synapse. The distribution of spine head sizes follows a lognormal-like distribution with more small spines than large ones. We analysed the impact of synaptic activity and plasticity on the spine size distribution in adult-born hippocampal granule cells from rats with induced homo- and heterosynaptic long-term plasticity in vivo and CA1 pyramidal cells from Munc13-1/Munc13-2 knockout mice with completely blocked synaptic transmission. Neither the induction of extrinsic synaptic plasticity nor the blockage of presynaptic activity degrades the lognormal-like distribution but changes its mean, variance and skewness. The skewed distribution develops early in the life of the neuron. Our findings and their computational modelling support the idea that intrinsic synaptic plasticity is sufficient for the generation, while a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic synaptic plasticity maintains lognormal-like distribution of spines.

AB  - Aion is an anion-conducting, bistable channelrhodopsin that enables long-term silencing of neuronal networks, as demonstrated in organotypic hippocampal cultures and Drosophila melanogaster larvae.
   Optogenetic silencing allows to reveal the necessity of selected neuronal populations for various neurophysiological functions. These range from synaptic transmission and coordinated neuronal network activity to control of specific behaviors. An ideal single-component optogenetic silencing tool should be switchable between active and inactive states with precise timing while preserving its activity in the absence of light until switched to an inactive state. Although bistable anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (ACRs) were previously engineered to reach this goal, their conducting state lifetime was limited to only a few minutes and some ACRs were not fully switchable. Here we report Aion, a bistable ACR displaying a long-lasting open state with a spontaneous closing time constant close to 15 min. Moreover, Aion can be switched between the open and closed state with millisecond precision using blue and orange light, respectively. The long conducting state enables overnight silencing of neurons with minimal light exposure. We further generated trafficking-optimized versions of Aion, which show enhanced membrane localization and allow precisely timed, long-lasting all-optical control of nociceptive responses in larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. Thus, Aion is an optogenetic silencing tool for inhibition of neuronal activity over many hours which can be switched between an active and inactive state with millisecond precision.

AB  - Objective How do birds navigate their way? It is one of the interesting question about homing pigeons, however the genetic of navigation has reminded as a puzzle. Optic lobe, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cere were collected for RNA sampling. The generated RNA-seq represent RNA resequencing data for racing homer (homing) pigeon and other rock pigeon breeds. The obtained data set can provide new insight about hippocampus role and GSR contribution to pigeon magnetoreception. Data description To investigate the navigation ability of rock pigeon breeds, 60 whole transcriptome sequence data sets related to homing pigeon, Shiraz tumblers, feral pigeons and Persian high flyers were obtained. RNA extraction was performed from three brain regions (optic lobe, olfactory bulb, hippocampus) and cere. Paired-end 150 bp short reads (Library size 350 bp) were sequenced by Illumina Hiseq 2000. In this way, about 342.1 Gbp and 130.3 Gb data were provided. The whole transcriptome data sets have been deposited at the NCBI SRA database (PRJNA532674). The submitted data set may play critical role to describe the mechanism of navigation ability of rock pigeon breeds.

AB  - Evidence suggests that rapid changes to supporting glia may predispose individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) to such comorbidities. Here, we interrogated the expression of astrocyte- and microglial-specific markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) in the rat brain in the first 24 hours following SCI. Female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent thoracic laminectomy; half of the rats received a mild contusion injury at the level of the T10 vertebral body (SCI group), the other half did not (Sham group). Twenty-four hours post-surgery the amygdala, periaqueductal grey, prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, lateral thalamus, hippocampus (dorsal and ventral) in rats were collected. GFAP and Iba1 mRNA and protein levels were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. In SCI rats, GFAP mRNA and protein expression increased in the amygdala and hypothalamus. In contrast, gene and protein expression decreased in the thalamus and dorsal hippocampus. Interestingly, Iba1 transcripts and proteins were significantly diminished only in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, where gene expression diminished. These findings demonstrate that as early as 24 hours post-SCI there are region-specific disruptions of GFAP and Iba1 transcript and protein levels in higher brain regions. All procedures were approved by the University of Technology Sydney Institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee (UTS ACEC13-0069).

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that inevitably results in dementia and death. Currently, there are no pathogenetically grounded methods for the prevention and treatment of AD, and all current treatment regimens are symptomatic and unable to significantly delay the development of dementia. The accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta), which is a spontaneous, aggregation-prone, and neurotoxic product of the processing of signaling protein APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein), in brain tissues, primarily in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex, was for a long time considered the main cause of neurodegenerative changes in AD. However, attempts to treat AD based on decreasing A beta production and aggregation did not bring significant clinical results. More and more arguments are arising in favor of the fact that the overproduction of A beta in most cases of AD is not the initial cause, but a concomitant event of pathological processes in the course of the development of sporadic AD. The concept of neuroinflammation has come to the fore, suggesting that inflammatory responses play the leading role in the initiation and development of AD, both in brain tissue and in the periphery. The hypothesis about the key role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD opens up new opportunities in the search for ways to treat and prevent this socially significant disease.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis is defined as the process by which new neurons are produced from neural stem cells in the adult brain. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that regulate this process is essential for the development of effective interventions aimed at decelerating the decline of adult neurogenesis associated with ageing. Mathematical models provide a valuable tool for studying the dynamics of neural stem cells and their lineage, and have revealed alterations in these processes during the ageing process. The present study draws upon experimental data to explore how these processes are modulated by investigating regulatory feedback mechanisms among neural populations through the lens of nonlinear differential equations models. Our observations indicate that the time evolution of the neural lineage is predominantly regulated by neural stem cells, with more differentiated neural populations exerting a comparatively weaker influence. Furthermore, we shed light on the manner in which different subpopulations govern these regulations and gain insights into the impact of specific perturbations on the system.

AB  - YAP and TAZ are transcriptional co-activators that are inhibited by sequestration in the cytoplasm. Cellular signalling pathways integrate soluble, mechanical (cytoskeleton, adhesion), and geometric (cell size, morphology) cues to regulate the translocation of YAP/TAZ to the nucleus. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, both signalling and morphogenesis are frequently rewired, leading to increased YAP/TAZ translocation, which drives proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance. However, whether this increased YAP/TAZ translocation is due to alterations in upstream signalling events or changes in cell morphology remains unclear. To gain insight into YAP/TAZ regulation in TNBC cells, we performed multiplexed quantitative genetic screens for YAP/TAZ localisation and cell shape, enabling us to determine whether changes in YAP/TAZ localisation following gene knockdown could be explained by alterations in cell morphology. These screens revealed that the focal adhesion (FA)-associated RhoGEF DOCK5 is essential for YAP/TAZ nuclear localisation in TNBC cells. DOCK5-defective cells exhibit defects in FA morphogenesis and fail to generate a stable, polarised leading edge, which we propose contributes to impaired YAP/TAZ translocation. Mechanistically, we implicate DOCK5's ability to act as a RacGEF and as a scaffold for NCK/AKT as key to its role in FA morphogenesis. Importantly, DOCK5 is essential for promoting the resistance of LM2 cells to the clinically used MEK inhibitor Binimetinib. Taken together, our findings suggest that DOCK5's role in TNBC cell shape determination drives YAP/TAZ upregulation and drug resistance.

AB  - Hyperhomocysteinemia (hHCY) is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of homocysteine in plasma. hHCY correlates with a high risk of migraine headaches, especially migraine with aura. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of depolarization passing through neurons and glial cells of the cortex and is considered an electrophysiological correlate of migraine aura. The aim of the present study was to analyze neuronal activity and CSD in the somatosensory cortex of rats in vivo with prenatal hHCY and to assess cortex viability after 2 h of CSD generation. Female rats were fed a diet high in methionine, and their offspring with high homocysteine levels in plasma were further used in experiments. Recurrent CSD was evoked by local KCl application on the dura surface. Neuronal viability was assessed by measuring the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the brain and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining of the somatosensory cortex after two hours of CSD generation. Animals with hHCY exhibited higher neuronal activity, and more CSDs were generated in response to KCl, indicating higher cortical excitability. Propagation of recurrent CSD was impaired in supragranular cortical layers, and the recovery of multiple unit activity and evoked sensory potentials after CSD was delayed in the hHCY group. Finally, in animals with prenatal hHCY, an ischemic focus was identified as a consequence of multiple CSDs, along with elevated levels of LDH activity in brain tissues, suggestive of diminished neuronal viability. These findings imply that prolonged elevated levels of homocysteine may not only predispose to migraine with aura but also potentially elevate the risk of migrainous infarction.

AB  - Proteins can be successfully localized in post-mortem (PM) brain tissue sections if the time until PM tissue sampling is not too long. In this study, we show that this also applies to the localization of RNA and in particular to the RNA of microglia-specific receptor proteins using the probes and the RNAscope (TM) Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Kit v2 from Advanced Cell Diagnostics. Brains were removed from killed mice after different PM delays and processed into paraffin sections. In sections of brains from animals whose cadavers had been kept at room temperature (21 degrees C) before tissue removal, ubiquitously expressed RNAs of genes with low to high expression levels (Polr2a, PPIB, and UBC) were reliably detected in the brain sections even if tissue removal was delayed by up to 48 h. In addition, microglia-specific G protein-coupled receptor RNA (Gpr34, P2ry12) could be reliably assigned to microglia by simultaneous labeling of the microglia with microglia-specific antibodies (Iba1 or P2ry12). Only after a delay of 48 h until tissue removal were the receptor RNA signals significantly lower. The reduction in receptor RNA signals could be delayed if the animal cadavers were stored at 4 degrees C until the brains were removed. Tissue sections of PM brain samples allow the spatial and cellular localization of specific RNA, at least if the sampling takes place within the first 24 h of PM.

AB  - Social hierarchies can be inferred through observational learning of social relationships between individuals. Yet, little is known about the causal role of specific brain regions in learning hierarchies. Here, using transcranial direct current stimulation, we show a causal role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in learning social versus non-social hierarchies. In a Training phase, participants acquired knowledge about social and non-social hierarchies by trial and error. During a Test phase, they were presented with two items from hierarchies that were never encountered together, requiring them to make transitive inferences. Anodal stimulation over mPFC impaired social compared with non-social hierarchy learning, and this modulation was influenced by the relative social rank of the members (higher or lower status). Anodal stimulation also impaired transitive inference making, but only during early blocks before learning was established. Together, these findings demonstrate a causal role of the mPFC in learning social ranks by observation.
   A brain stimulation study (tDCS) on healthy humans shows that the medial prefrontal cortex plays a causal role in learning social hierarchical relationships by observation.

AB  - Herein, we describe the generation of potent NK cell engagers (NKCEs) based on single domain antibodies (sdAbs) specific for NKp46 harboring the humanized Fab version of Cetuximab for tumor targeting. After immunization of camelids, a plethora of different VHH domains were retrieved by yeast surface display. Upon reformatting into Fc effector-silenced NKCEs targeting NKp46 and EGFR in a strictly monovalent fashion, the resulting bispecific antibodies elicited potent NK cell-mediated killing of EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells with potencies (EC(50)killing) in the picomolar range. This was further augmented via co-engagement of Fc gamma receptor IIIa (Fc gamma RIIIa). Importantly, NKp46-specific sdAbs enabled the construction of various NKCE formats with different geometries and valencies which displayed favorable biophysical and biochemical properties without further optimization. By this means, killing capacities were further improved significantly. Hence, NKp46-specific sdAbs are versatile building blocks for the construction of different NKCE formats.

AB  - Many animals and humans use scream calls to signal imminent threats, which typically evoke alarm and escape responses in recipients. Compared to animals, human scream calls are more diversified with varying levels of alarm signaling. Certain low-alarm human screams thus might not elicit full neural alarm cascades and threat avoidance actions. Here we investigated the neural circuits for decoding alarm and avoid-approach information from positive and negative scream calls in humans. Alarm and avoid-approach decisions showed minimal neural overlap, with alarm decisions recruiting neural cascades of sensory-affective decoding for action preparation, whereas avoid-approach judgments recruited neural systems for spatio-affective decoding for social decision-making. Furthermore, decision patterns revealed both an alarm quotient and an avoid quotient for risk arbitration, which linked the likelihood of an urgent response (alarm, avoid) to a slowing of choosing a potential safe option in response to scream calls. While the avoid quotient positively predicted neural activity in a broad cortico-limbic network, the alarm quotient predicted neural suppression with increasing alarm levels, especially in the amygdala as part of a presumed limbic alarm system. This points to a critical involvement of the amygdala at neural levels of choice arbitrations rather than in threat evaluations signaled by screams.

AB  - The signaling pathways behind severe astrocytic lysis with Aquaporin4 auto-antibody (AQP4-IgG) seropositivity, and reactive astrocytosis with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein auto-antibody (MOG-IgG) seropositivity, remain largely unexplored in Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), while almost no molecular details being known about double-seronegative (DN) patients. Recent discovery of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in DN NMOSD patients' cerebrospinal fluid, akin to AQP4-IgG + ve cases, suggests astrocytopathy. Here, we aim to study small non coding RNA (sncRNA) signature alterations in astrocytes exposed to AQP4-IgG + ve and MOG-IgG + ve patient sera, and their potential resemblance with DN-NMOSD. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) revealed differential expression of several microRNAs with notable alterations in hsa-miR-6824-3p, hsamiR-324-5p and hsa-miR-4466 respectively upon sera treatment. Results with DN-NMOSD patient sera are majorly similar to that of AQP4+ve sera. Strikingly, in all three treatments, hsa-miR-200b-3p was significantly upregulated. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that Hippo and FoxO signaling pathways were primarily impacted in AQP4-IgG + ve and double negative sera treated cells whereas, MOG-IgG + ve sera treatment perturbed the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, NGS also revealed differential expression of several piRNAs in cells upon treatment with AQP4-IgG + ve and MOG-IgG + ve sera and VEGF signaling was identified as the common target of differentially expressed piRNAs of both the groups. This study, for the first time, revealed that the molecular pathophysiology of double-seronegative NMOSD might involve astrocytopathy akin to AQP4+ve NMOSD, thus pointing towards the possible existence of unidentified astrocytic autoimmune targets and identified the major alterations in intracellular sncRNAs and the associated overall cellular signaling pathways that potentially contribute to the fate of astrocytes during the progression of the disease.

AB  - The intricacies of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis are being increasingly illuminated by the exploration of epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation. This review comprehensively surveys recent human-centered studies that investigate whole genome DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. The examination of various brain regions reveals distinctive DNA methylation patterns that associate with the Braak stage and Alzheimer's disease progression. The entorhinal cortex emerges as a focal point due to its early histological alterations and subsequent impact on downstream regions like the hippocampus. Notably, ANK1 hypermethylation, a protein implicated in neurofibrillary tangle formation, was recurrently identified in the entorhinal cortex. Further, the middle temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex were shown to exhibit significant hypermethylation of genes like HOXA3, RHBDF2, and MCF2L, potentially influencing neuroinflammatory processes. The complex role of BIN1 in late-onset Alzheimer's disease is underscored by its association with altered methylation patterns. Despite the disparities across studies, these findings highlight the intricate interplay between epigenetic modifications and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Future research efforts should address methodological variations, incorporate diverse cohorts, and consider environmental factors to unravel the nuanced epigenetic landscape underlying Alzheimer's disease progression.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) falls into the family Theaceae, is a valuable commercial crop, and tea products made from its buds and young leaves are favored by consumers all over the world. The more common Thea plant is Camellia sinensis (C. sinensis), but its most important relative, Camellia taliensis (C. taliensis), is also utilized by locals in the area of cultivation to manufacture tea. In this investigation, C. taliensis (DL) and C. sinensis (QJZ) were characterized in terms of their agronomic traits, physicochemical indices, metabolomics, and transcriptomics. The leaf area of DL is larger than that of QJZ; the color of DL's buds and leaves is yellowish-green, while that of QJZ's is green. DL's buds and leaves are more densely velvety than those of QJZ. The HPLC results indicated that the physicochemical contents varied considerably between the two samples, with DL having greater concentrations of EGCG and GABA than QJZ, while QJZ had remarkably higher concentrations of C, CA, and EGC than DL. A total of 2269 metabolites and 362,190,414 genes were positively identified, with the number of DAMs and DEGs being 1001 and 34,026, respectively. The flavonoids, phenolic acids, and alkaloid metabolites were dramatically different between the two tea group plants. Bioinformatics profiling revealed that the DAMs and DEGs of the two tea group plants interacted with each other and were involved in metabolic pathways, including "biosynthesis of secondary metabolites", "biosynthesis of amino acids", "biosynthesis of cofactors", "phenylpropanoid biosynthesis", and "flavonoid biosynthesis". Overall, these results provide statistical support for germplasm conservation and production for both C. taliensis and C. sinensis.

AB  - Neurons grow neurites of several tens of micrometers in length, necessitating active transport from the cell body by motor proteins. By tracking fluorophores as minimally invasive labels, MINFLUX is able to quantify the motion of those proteins with nanometer/millisecond resolution. Here we study the substeps of a truncated kinesin-1 mutant in primary rat hippocampal neurons, which have so far been mainly observed on polymerized microtubules deposited onto glass coverslips. A gentle fixation protocol largely maintains the structure and surface modifications of the microtubules in the cell. By analyzing the time between the substeps, we identify the ATP-binding state of kinesin-1 and observe the associated rotation of the kinesin-1 head in neurites. We also observed kinesin-1 switching microtubules mid-walk, highlighting the potential of MINFLUX to study the details of active cellular transport.

AB  - Background: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD; MIM 242650) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by malfunction of the motile cilia resulting in reduced mucociliary clearance of the airways. Together with recurring infections of the lower respiratory tract, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a hallmark symptom of PCD. Data on genotype-phenotype correlations in the upper airways are scarce.Materials and methods: We investigated the prevalence, radiologic severity, and impact on health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of CRS in 58 individuals with genetically confirmed PCD. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the predicted ultrastructural phenotype based on genetic findings.Results: Among 58 individuals harboring pathogenic variants in 22 distinct genes associated with PCD, all were diagnosed with CRS, and 47% underwent sinus surgery. A total of 36 individuals answered a German-adapted version of the 20-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20-GAV) with a mean score of 35.8 +/- 17, indicating a remarkably reduced HrQoL. Paranasal sinus imaging of 36 individuals showed moderate-to-severe opacification with an elevated Lund-Mackay Score (LMS) of 10.2 +/- 4.4. Bilateral agenesis of frontal sinus (19%) and sphenoid sinus (9.5%) was a frequent finding in individuals aged 16 years or older. Subgroup analysis for predicted ultrastructural phenotypes did not identify differences in HrQoL, extent of sinus opacification, or frequency of aplastic paranasal sinuses.Conclusion: PCD is strongly associated with CRS. The high burden of disease is indicated by decreased HrQoL. Therefore, the upper airways of PCD individuals should be evaluated and managed by ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialists. Genetically determined PCD groups with predicted abnormal versus (near) normal ultrastructure did not differ in disease severity. Further studies are needed to gain evidence-based knowledge of the phenotype and management of upper airway manifestations in PCD. In addition, individuals with agenesis of the frontal and sphenoid paranasal sinuses and chronic respiratory symptoms should be considered for a diagnostic evaluation of PCD.

AB  - Habit formation is a process in which an action becomes involuntary. While goal-directed behavior is driven by its consequences, habits are elicited by a situation rather than its consequences. Existing theories have proposed that actions are controlled by corresponding two distinct systems. Although canonical theories based on such distinctions are starting to be challenged, there are a few theoretical frameworks that implement goal-directed behavior and habits within a single system. Here, we propose a novel theoretical framework by hypothesizing that behavior is a network composed of several responses. With this framework, we have shown that the transition of goal-directed actions to habits is caused by a change in a single network structure. Furthermore, we confirmed that the proposed network model behaves in a manner consistent with the existing experimental results reported in animal behavioral studies. Our results revealed that habit could be formed under the control of a single system rather than two distinct systems. By capturing the behavior as a single network change, this framework provides a new perspective on studying the structure of the behavior for experimental and theoretical research.
   Habit formation can be explained in terms of changes in the network structure of behavior without assuming explicitly distinct systems.

AB  - Pseudomonas fluorescens GM16 associates with Populus, a model plant in biofuel production. Populus releases abundant phenolic glycosides such as salicin, but P. fluorescens GM16 cannot utilize salicin, whereas Pseudomonas strains are known to utilize compounds similar to the aglycone moiety of salicin-salicyl alcohol. We propose that the association of Pseudomonas to Populus is mediated by another organism (such as Rahnella aquatilis OV744) that degrades the glucosyl group of salicin. In this study, we demonstrate that in the Rahnella-Pseudomonas salicin co-culture model, Rahnella grows by degrading salicin to glucose 6-phosphate and salicyl alcohol which is secreted out and is subsequently utilized by P. fluorescens GM16 for its growth. Using various quantitative approaches, we elucidate the individual pathways for salicin and salicyl alcohol metabolism present in Rahnella and Pseudomonas, respectively. Furthermore, we were able to establish that the salicyl alcohol cross-feeding interaction between the two strains on salicin medium is carried out through the combination of their respective individual pathways. The research presents one of the potential advantages of salicyl alcohol release by strains such as Rahnella, and how phenolic glycosides could be involved in attracting multiple types of bacteria into the Populus microbiome.

AB  - The amyloid-beta (A beta) oligomer, rather than the A beta monomer, is considered to be the primary initiator of Alzheimer's disease. It was hypothesized that p(A beta 3-10)10-MT, the recombinant A beta 3-10 gene vaccine of the A beta oligomer has the potential to treat Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we intramuscularly injected the p(A beta 3-10)10-MT vaccine into the left hindlimb of APP/PS1/tau triple-transgenic mice, which are a model for Alzheimer's disease. Our results showed that the p(A beta 3-10)10-MT vaccine effectively reduced A beta oligomer levels and plaque deposition in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, decreased the levels tau protein variants, reduced synaptic loss, protected synaptic function, reduced neuron loss, and ameliorated memory impairment without causing any cerebral hemorrhaging. Therefore, this novel DNA vaccine, which is safe and highly effective in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, holds a lot of promise for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in humans.

AB  - The milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) appears to play an important role in infant neurocognitive development; however, its mechanism(s) of action remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of a dietary MFGM supplement on the lipid profiles of different neonatal brain regions. Ten-day-old male piglets (4-5 kg) were fed unsupplemented infant formula (control, n = 7) or an infant formula supplemented with low (4%) or high (8%) levels of MFGM (n = 8 each) daily for 21 days. Piglets were then euthanized, and brain tissues were sectioned. Untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry lipidomics was performed on the cerebellum, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and the rest of the brain. The analyses identified 271 and 171 lipids using positive and negative ionization modes, respectively, spanning 16 different lipid classes. MFGM consumption did not significantly alter the lipidome in most brain regions, regardless of dose, compared to the control infant formula. However, 16 triacylglyceride species were increased in the hippocampus (t-test, p-value < 0.05) of the high-supplemented piglets. Most lipids (262 (96.7%) and 160 (93.6%), respectively) differed significantly between different brain regions (ANOVA, false discovery rate corrected p-value < 0.05) independent of diet. Thus, this study highlighted that dietary MFGM altered lipid abundance in the hippocampus and detected large differences in lipid profiles between neonatal piglet brain regions.

AB  - The Hippo pathway is a key regulatory pathway that is tightly regulated by mechanical cues such as tension, pressure, and contact with the extracellular matrix and other cells. At the distal end of the pathway is the yes-associated protein (YAP), a well-characterized transcriptional regulator. Through binding to transcription factors such as the TEA Domain TFs (TEADs) YAP regulates expression of several genes involved in cell fate, proliferation and death decisions. While the function of YAP as direct transcriptional regulator has been extensively characterized, only a small number of studies examined YAP function as a regulator of gene expression via microRNAs. We utilized bioinformatic approaches, including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-Seq, to identify potential new targets of YAP regulation and identified miR-30a as a YAP target gene in Schwann cells. We find that YAP binds to the promoter and regulates the expression of miR-30a. Moreover, we identify several YAP-regulated genes that are putative miR30a targets and focus on two of these, protein tyrosine pohosphatase non-receptor type 13 (PTPN13) and Kruppel like factor 9. We find that YAP regulation of Schwann cell proliferation and death is mediated, to a significant extent, through miR-30a regulation of PTPN13 in Schwann cells. These find-ings identify a new regulatory function by YAP, mediated by miR-30a, to downregulate expression of PTPN13 and Kruppel like factor 9. These studies expand our understanding of YAP function as a regulator of miRNAs and illustrate the complexity of YAP transcriptional functions.

AB  - This paper presents a method for pixel-wise classification applied for the first time on hippocampus histological images. The goal is achieved by representing pixels in a 14-D vector, composed of grey-level information and moment invariants. Then, several popular machine learning models are used to categorize them, and multiple metrics are computed to evaluate the performance of the different models. The multilayer perceptron, random forest, support vector machine, and radial basis function networks were compared, achieving the multilayer perceptron model the highest result on accuracy metric, AUC, and F1 score with highly satisfactory results for substituting a manual classification task, due to an expert opinion in the hippocampus histological images.

AB  - Gotts et al. test different theoretical model predictions for repetition-associated alterations in functional and/or effective brain connectivity using fMRI. They report that the generated data is most consistent with a Synchrony model-based prediction and provide data which informs the refinement of all models tested.
   Stimulus identification commonly improves with repetition over long delays ("repetition priming"), whereas neural activity commonly decreases ("repetition suppression"). Multiple models have been proposed to explain this brain-behavior relationship, predicting alterations in functional and/or effective connectivity (Synchrony and Predictive Coding models), in the latency of neural responses (Facilitation model), and in the relative similarity of neural representations (Sharpening model). Here, we test these predictions with fMRI during overt and covert naming of repeated and novel objects. While we find partial support for predictions of the Facilitation and Sharpening models in the left fusiform gyrus and left frontal cortex, the data were most consistent with the Synchrony model, with increased coupling between right temporoparietal and anterior cingulate cortex for repeated objects that correlated with priming magnitude across participants. Increased coupling and repetition suppression varied independently, each explaining unique variance in priming and requiring modifications of all current models.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury-induced unfavorable outcomes in human patients have independently been associated with dysregulated levels of monoamines, especially epinephrine, although few preclinical studies have examined the epinephrine level in the central nervous system after traumatic brain injury. Epinephrine has been shown to regulate the activities of spinal motoneurons as well as increase the heart rate, blood pressure, and blood flow to the hindlimb muscles. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine the impact of repeated blast-induced traumatic brain injury on the epinephrine levels in several function-specific central nervous system regions in rats. Following three repeated blast injuries at 3-day intervals, the hippocampus, motor cortex, locus coeruleus, vestibular nuclei, and lumbar spinal cord were harvested at post-injury day eight and processed for epinephrine assays using a high-sensitive electrochemical detector coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography. Our results showed that the epinephrine levels were significantly decreased in the lumbar spinal cord tissues of blast-induced traumatic brain injury animals compared to the levels detected in age- and sex-matched sham controls. In other function-specific central nervous system regions, although the epinephrine levels were slightly altered following blast-induced traumatic brain injury, they were not statistically significant. These results suggest that blast injury-induced significant downregulation of epinephrine in the lumbar spinal cord could negatively impact the motor and cardiovascular function. This is the first report to show altered epinephrine levels in the spinal cord following repetitive mild blast-induced traumatic brain injury.

AB  - The Hippo signaling is instrumental in regulating organ size, regeneration, and carcinogenesis. The cytoskeleton emerges as a primary Hippo signaling modulator. Its structural alterations in response to environmental and intrinsic stimuli control Hippo signaling pathway activity. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the cytoskeleton regulation of Hippo signaling are not fully understood. RAP2 GTPase is known to mediate the mechanoresponses of Hippo signaling via activating the core Hippo kinases LATS1/2 through MAP4Ks and MST1/2. Here we show the pivotal role of the reciprocal regulation between RAP2 GTPase and the cytoskeleton in Hippo signaling. RAP2 deletion undermines the responses of the Hippo pathway to external cues tied to RhoA GTPase inhibition and actin cytoskeleton remodeling, such as energy stress and serum deprivation. Notably, RhoA inhibitors and actin disruptors fail to activate LATS1/2 effectively in RAP2deficient cells. RNA sequencing highlighted differential regulation of both actin and microtubule networks by RAP2 gene deletion. Consistently, Taxol, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, was less effective in activating LATS1/2 and inhibiting cell growth in RAP2 and MAP4K4/6/7 knockout cells. In summary, our fi ndings position RAP2 as a central integrator of cytoskeletal signals for Hippo signaling, which offers new avenues for understanding Hippo regulation and therapeutic interventions in Hippo-impaired cancers.

AB  - Stress is known to induce a reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and anxiety-like behaviors. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are secreted in response to stress, and the hippocampus possesses the greatest levels of GC receptors, highlighting the potential of GCs in mediating stress-induced hippocampal alterations and behavior deficits. Herein, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the hippocampus following corticosterone (CORT) exposure revealed the central regulatory role of the p21 (Cdkna1a) gene, which exhibited interactions with oxidative stress-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs), suggesting a potential link between p21 and oxidative stress-related pathways. Remarkably, p21-overexpression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus partially recapitulated CORT-induced phenotypes, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, diminished AHN, dendritic atrophy, and the onset of anxiety-like behaviors. Significantly, inhibiting ROS exhibited a partial rescue of anxiety-like behaviors and hippocampal alterations induced by p21-overexpression, as well as those induced by CORT, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting ROS or p21 in the hippocampus as a promising avenue for mitigating anxiety disorders provoked by chronic stress.

AB  - A magnetoencephalography study reveals that tonal musical sequences recruit neural activity in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex, while atonal sequences activate auditory regions, suggesting the involvement of a cortico-subcortical brain network in auditory recognition.
   Auditory recognition is a crucial cognitive process that relies on the organization of single elements over time. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying the conscious recognition of auditory sequences varying in complexity. To study this, we asked 71 participants to learn and recognize simple tonal musical sequences and matched complex atonal sequences while their brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results reveal qualitative changes in neural activity dependent on stimulus complexity: recognition of tonal sequences engages hippocampal and cingulate areas, whereas recognition of atonal sequences mainly activates the auditory processing network. Our findings reveal the involvement of a cortico-subcortical brain network for auditory recognition and support the idea that stimulus complexity qualitatively alters the neural pathways of recognition memory.

AB  - Raftlin, as an inflammatory biomarker, has been previously reported in chronic inflammatory diseases. This study investigates the expression of Raftlin in cigarette smokers and in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), as well as evaluating its correlation with interleukin-17 (IL-17) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. A total of 30 CRSwNP non-smoking and 16 CRSwNP + SK (smoking) patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery were enrolled, while 20 middle turbinate tissue pieces were examined and performed as the control group. In nasal mucosa epithelial staining, Raftlin levels were elevated in the columnar cells and were stained much more intensely in the CRSwNP and CRSwNP + SK groups. Raftlin was located more closely to the apical region of the epithelium in the CRSwNP + SK group; however, the Raftlin levels from whole nasal tissue pieces, according to ELISA data, showed that there was no significant difference between the three different study groups. A positive relationship by Pearson correlation was found between IL-17 or TNF-alpha levels and Raftlin levels. Taken together, these data indicate that increasing Raftlin expression in columnar cells might involve nasal epithelial remodeling in smokers with CRSwNP.

AB  - Tau aggregates accumulate in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain according to the established Braak staging scheme and spread from transentorhinal over limbic regions to the neocortex. To impact the management of AD patients, an in vivo tool for tau Braak staging is needed. First-generation tau tracers have limited performance in detecting early stages of tau. Therefore, we tested the corresponding capability of the next-generation tau tracer, F-18-PI-2620. We analyzed F-18-PI-2620 multicenter PET data from 37 beta-amyloid-positive AD dementia patients and those from 26 healthy controls. We applied kinetic modeling of the 0-60 min p.i. PET data using MRTM2 with the lower cerebellum as the reference region to extract Braak stage-dependent distribution volume ratios, whereas controls were used to define Braak stage PET positivity thresholds. Stage-dependent PET positivity widely followed the Braak scheme (except Braak stage III) presenting descending frequency of PET positivity from Braak I (43%), II (38%), III (49%), IV (35%), V (30%) to VI (14%). A strictly hierarchical model was met by 64% of AD dementia cases. Nineteen percent showed a hippocampal sparing tauopathy pattern. Thus, we could assign 87% to the six-stage hierarchical Braak model including tauopathy variants. F-18-PI-2620 PET appears to be able to perform Braak tau staging of AD in vivo.

AB  - Neurotrophin receptors regulate neuronal survival and network formation, as well as synaptic plasticity in the brain via interaction with their ligands. Here, we examined early changes in the expression of neurotrophin receptor genes Ntk1 (TrkA), Ntrk2 (TrkB), Ntrk3 (TrkC), Ngfr (p75NTR) and miRNAs that target theses gens in the mouse brain after induction of seizure activity by pentylenetetrazol. We found that expression of Ntrk3 and Ngfr was upregulated in the cortex and the hippocampus 1-3 hours after the seizures, while Ntrk2 expression increased after 3-6 hours in the anterior cortex and after 1 and 6 hours in the hippocampus. At the same time, the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax signaling proteins increased in the anterior and posterior cortex, but not in the hippocampus, suggesting the activation of anti-apoptotic signaling. Expression of miRNA-9 and miRNA-29a, which were predicted to target Ntrk3, was upregulated in the hippocampus 3 hours after pentylenetetrazol injection. Therefore, early cellular response to seizures in the brain includes induction of the Ntrk2, Ntrk3, Ngfr, miRNA-9, and miRNA-29a expression, as well as activation of Bcl-2 and Bax signaling pathways, which may characterize them as important mediators of neuronal adaptation and survival upon induction of the generalized brain activity.

AB  - Hippocampal plasticity has an undisputed role in learning and memory. Despite decades of research focusing on the neurobiological basis of synaptic plasticity, relatively little is known about the metabolic dynamics leading to hippocampal plasticity at the single-cell level. Here we used single-cell mass spectrometry to dissect metabolomic changes of excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs), inhibitory interneurons and astrocytes in hippocampus during long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning-related behaviors in mice. We identified an enhancement of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) biosynthetic pathway in CA1 PNs during LTP. This LTP-sensitive GABA metabolic pathway was mediated through an aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2)-dependent mechanism. Selective deletion of PN ALDH2 blocked the LTP-related GABA enhancement and impaired learning adaptability. Thus, profiling of the single-cell metabolome is established to characterize an activity-dependent GABA pathway and its impact on hippocampal plasticity and learning. This GABA signaling pathway identified in glutamatergic neurons represents a novel target for learning and memory.

AB  - Metabolic reprogramming is often observed in sepsis-associated microglial cells. However, little is known about the aberrant metabolic genes involved in neuroinflammation and lipid accumulation in microglial cells of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Here, we show that hexokinase 2 (HK2) is upregulated and strongly associated with the inflammatory response and lipid metabolism in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV2 cells. Down-regulation of HK2 lowered the activation of NOD-like receptor signaling family pyrin domain containing 3, both in BV2 cells and in the hippocampus of cecal ligation and puncture-induced male septic mice. Moreover, the inhibition of HK2 promoted lipid droplet reduction. Mechanistically, HK2 knockdown in microglial cells reduced the ISGylation of Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) by interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). Notably, siISG15 effectively down-regulated the expression of ACSL4 in lipopolysaccharideinduced BV2 cells. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into HK2 in microglial cells through regulation of ACSL4 ISGylation, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for treating SAE by targeting HK2. Our findings suggest that HK2 modulates ISGylation of ACSL4 in sepsis-induced microglial cells, indicating that therapeutic targeting of HK2 may constitute a promising strategy for SAE.

AB  - Foetal exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) may cause marked neurocognitive impairment, although the mechanisms involved are still unclear. EMF induces region-specific neuronal and astroglial death in the rat hippocampus. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) regulates necrosis, apoptosis and other cellular processes occurring following injury. This study, therefore, investigated whether PARP-1 also regulates neuronal responses in the hippocampus of rats subjected to EMF radiation during different developmental periods. Male and female rats were first allowed to mate in separate cages. Rats identified as pregnant were then divided into four groups. A 900-MHz EMF was applied for 2 h daily on gestational days (GD) 1-7, GD 8-14 and GD 15-21. The female offspring were sacrificed at the end of the 28th postnatal day, and PARP-1 and Caspase-3 expressions in the hippocampus were then evaluated. No special treatment was applied to the control group. In the EMF-exposed group, pyramidal neurons in the cornu ammonis (CA) region appeared normal after exposure on GD 1-7 but were darkly stained and shrunken after exposure on GD 15-21, while the majority of granular cells exhibited a normal appearance during all GDs. The group exposed to EMF on GD 15-21 exhibited strong PARP-1 and Caspase-3 immune reactivity in CA and dentate gyrus (DG) cells. Higher H-scores were also observed in the EMF-exposed group following GD 15-21 irradiation. As a result, a 900-MHz EMF application at GD 15-21, which coincides with hippocampal neurogenesis, triggered hippocampal neuron cell death by activating PARP-1 and Caspase-3.

AB  - Introduction: During the last decade, there has been a significant rise in the use of therapeutic antibodies or passive immunotherapy for treating various conditions like inflammation and cancer. However, these proteins face challenges reaching the brain and often require specialized delivery methods such as single-domain antibodies (sdAbs). Traditional antibodies struggle to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), hindering their effectiveness. Receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) offers a promising pathway for transporting large molecules essential for brain function and treatment across the BBB. Methods: SdAbs and peptide ligands with an affinity for RMT receptors are commonly employed to enhance the transport of biotherapeutics compounds across the BBB. This research used a sdAbs phage-displayed library from 13 camelus dromedarius samples to identify sdABs that specifically bind to and are internalized by human BBB endothelial cells (ECs) through in vivo panning. Results and discussion: One sdAb, defined as FB24, was isolated, sequenced, translated into an open reading frame (ORF), and subjected to three-dimensional (3D) modeling. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out by the HADDOCK web server and GROMACS, respectively, to evaluate the interaction between FB24 and EC receptors in silico. The docking results revealed that FB24 exhibited binding activity against potential EC receptors with -1.7 to -2.7 ranged z score and maintained a stable structure. The docked complex of FB24-RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products, also known as advanced glycation end product receptor [AGER]) showed 18 hydrogen bonds and 213 non-bonded contacts. It was chosen for further analysis by molecular dynamics simulations by GROMACS. This complex showed a stable condition, and its root mean square deviation (RMSD) was 0.218 nm. The results suggest that FB24 could serve as a suitable carrier vector for transporting therapeutic and diagnostic agents across the BBB to the brain through a non-invasive route.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death which is considered an oxidative iron-dependent process. The lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 prevents the iron (Fe2+)-dependent formation of toxic lipid reactive oxygen species. While emerging evidence indicates that inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 as a hallmark of ferroptosis in many cancer cell lines, the involvement of this biochemical pathway in neuronal death remains largely unclear. Here, we investigate, first whether the ferroptosis key players are involved in the neuronal cell death induced by erastin. The second objective was to examine whether there is a cross talk between ferroptosis and autophagy. The third main was to address neuron response to erastin, with a special focus on ferritin and nuclear receptor coactivator 4-mediated ferritinophagy. To test this in neurons, erastin (0.5-8 mu M) was applied to hippocampal HT22 neurons for 16 hours. In addition, cells were cultured with the autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenin (10 mM) and/or ferroptosis inhibitors, ferrostatin 1 (10-20 mu M) or deferoxamine (10-200 mu M) before exposure to erastin. In this study, we demonstrated by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis, that erastin downregulates dramatically the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4, the sodium-independent cystine-glutamate antiporter and nuclear receptor coactivator 4. The protein levels of ferritin and mitochondrial ferritin in HT22 hippocampal neurons did not remarkably change following erastin treatment. In addition, we demonstrated that not only the ferroptosis inhibitor, ferrostatin1/deferoxamine abrogated the ferroptotic cell death induced by erastin in hippocampal HT22 neurons, but also the potent autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenin. We conclude that (1) erastin-induced ferroptosis in hippocampal HT22 neurons, despite reduced nuclear receptor coactivator 4 levels, (2) that either nuclear receptor coactivator 4-mediated ferritinophagy does not occur or is of secondary importance in this model, (3) that ferroptosis seems to share some features of the autophagic cell death process.

AB  - Introduction: The metabolic routes altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are poorly understood. As the metabolic pathways are evolutionarily conserved, the metabolic profiles carried out in animal models of AD could be directly translated into human studies.Methods: We performed untargeted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance metabolomics in hippocampus of McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rats, a model of AD-like cerebral amyloidosis and the translational potential of these findings was assessed by targeted Gas Chromatography-Electron Impact-Mass Spectrometry in plasma of participants in the German longitudinal cohort AgeCoDe.Results: In rat hippocampus 26 metabolites were identified. Of these 26 metabolites, nine showed differences between rat genotypes that were nominally significant. Two of them presented partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) loadings with the larger absolute weights and the highest Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) scores and were specifically assigned to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide (Nam). NAD levels were significantly decreased in Tg rat brains as compared to controls. In agreement with these results, plasma of AD patients showed significantly reduced levels of Nam in respect to cognitively normal participants. In addition, high plasma levels of Nam showed a 27% risk reduction of progressing to AD dementia within the following 2.5 years, this hazard ratio is lost afterwards.Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a decrease of Nam plasma levels is observed couple of years before conversion to AD, thereby suggesting its potential use as biomarker for AD progression.

AB  - Background Drug resistance is a particular problem in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, where seizures originate mainly from the hippocampus. Many of these epilepsies are acquired conditions following an insult to the brain such as a prolonged seizure. Such conditions are characterized by pathophysiological mechanisms including massive oxidative stress that synergistically mediate the secondary brain damage, contributing to the development of epilepsy. The transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) has emerged in recent years as an attractive therapeutic approach targeting to upregulate the antioxidative defenses in the cell, to ameliorate the oxidative stress induced damage. Thus, it is important to understand the characteristics of Nrf2 activation during epileptogenesis and epilepsy. Here, we studied the temporal, regional, and cell-type specific expression of Nrf2 in the brain, in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy.Results Early after status-epilepticus, Nrf2 is mainly activated in the hippocampus and maintained during the whole period of epileptogenesis. Only transient expression of Nrf2 was observed in the cortex. Nevertheless, the expression of several Nrf2 antioxidant target genes was increased within 24 h after status-epilepticus in both the cortex and the hippocampus. We demonstrated that after status-epilepticus in rats, Nrf2 is predominantly expressed in neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, and only astrocytes in the CA1 increase their Nrf2 expression.Conclusions In conclusion, our data identify previously unrecognized spatial and cell-type dependent activation of Nrf2 during epilepsy development, highlighting the need for a time-controlled, and cell-type specific activation of the Nrf2 pathway for mediating anti-oxidant response after brain insult, to modify the development of epilepsy.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis is associated with structural and functional brain alterations leading to cognitive impairments across multiple domains including attention, memory, and the speed of information processing. The hippocampus, which is a brain important structure involved in memory, undergoes microstructural changes in the early stage of multiple sclerosis. In this study, we analyzed hippocampal function and structure in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and explored correlations between the functional connectivity of the hippocampus to the whole brain, changes in local brain function and microstructure, and cognitive function at rest. We retrospectively analyzed data from 20 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients admitted to the Department of Neurology at the China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, China, from April 2015 to November 2019. Sixteen healthy volunteers were recruited as the healthy control group. All participants were evaluated using a scale of extended disability status and the Montreal cognitive assessment within 1 week before and after head diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared with the healthy control group, the patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis had lower Montreal cognitive assessment scores and regions of simultaneously enhanced and attenuated whole-brain functional connectivity and local functional connectivity in the bilateral hippocampus. Hippocampal diffusion tensor imaging data showed that, compared with the healthy control group, patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis had lower hippocampal fractional anisotropy values and higher mean diffusivity values, suggesting abnormal hippocampal structure. The left hippocampus whole-brain functional connectivity was negatively correlated with the Montreal cognitive assessment score (r = -0.698, P = 0.025), and whole-brain functional connectivity of the right hippocampus was negatively correlated with extended disability status scale score (r = -0.649, P = 0.042). The mean diffusivity value of the left hippocampus was negatively correlated with the Montreal cognitive assessment score (r = -0.729, P = 0.017) and positively correlated with the extended disability status scale score (r = 0.653, P = 0.041). The right hippocampal mean diffusivity value was positively correlated with the extended disability status scale score (r = 0.684, P = 0.029). These data suggest that the functional connectivity and presence of structural abnormalities in the hippocampus in patients with relapse-remission multiple sclerosis are correlated with the degree of cognitive function and extent of disability.

AB  - The accurate definition of an epitranscriptome is endangered by artefacts resulting from RNA degradation after cell death, a ubiquitous yet little investigated process. By tracing RNA marker modifications through tissue preparation protocols, we identified a major blind spot from daily lab routine, that has massive impact on modification analysis in small RNAs. In particular, m(6,6)A and Am as co-varying rRNA marker modifications, appeared in small RNA fractions following rRNA degradation in vitro and in cellulo. Analysing mouse tissue at different time points post mortem, we tracked the progress of intracellular RNA degradation after cell death, and found it reflected in RNA modification patterns. Differences were dramatic between liver, where RNA degradation commenced immediately after death, and brain, yielding essentially undamaged RNA. RNA integrity correlated with low amounts of co-varying rRNA markers. Thus validated RNA preparations featured differentially modified tRNA populations whose information content allowed a distinction even among the related brain tissues cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Inversely, advanced cell death correlated with high rRNA marker content, and correspondingly little with the naive state of living tissue. Therefore, unless RNA and tissue preparations are executed with utmost care, interpretation of modification patterns in tRNA and small RNA are prone to artefacts.

AB  - Although antibody immobilization on solid surfaces is extensively used in several applications, including immunoassays, biosensors, and affinity chromatography, some issues are still challenging. Self-assembling protein layers can be used to coat easily different surfaces by direct deposition. A specific biofunctional layer can be formed using genetic engineering techniques to express fused proteins acting as self-immobilizing antibodies. In this study, fusion proteins combining the self-assembling adhesive properties of a fungal hydrophobin and the functionality of the single chain fragment variables (ScFvs) of two antibodies were produced. The chosen ScFvs are able to recognize marine toxins associated with algal blooms, saxitoxin, and domoic acid, which can bioaccumulate in shellfish and herbivorous fish causing food poisoning. ScFvs fused to hydrophobin Vmh2 from Pleurotus ostreatus were produced in Escherichia coli and recovered from the inclusion bodies. The two fusion proteins retained the functionality of both moieties, being able to adhere on magnetic beads and to recognize and bind the two neurotoxins, even with different performances. Our immobilization procedure is innovative and very easy to implement because it allows the direct functionalization of magnetic beads with ScFvs, without any surface modification. Two different detection principles, electrochemical and optical, were adopted, thus achieving a versatile platform suitable for different antigen detection methods. The sensitivity of the saxitoxin optical biosensor [limit of detection (LOD) 1.7 pg/ml] is comparable to the most sensitive saxitoxin immunosensors developed until now.</p>

AB  - Siglec-8, an immune-inhibitory sialoglycan binding lectin (S8), is expressed on the surface of eosinophils and mast cells, which are potent mediators of allergic inflammation. When S8 engages endogenous sialoglycan ligands, eosinophils undergo apoptosis and mast cell mediator release is inhibited. In the human airway, Siglec-8 ligands (S8L) are sialylated keratan sulfate chains carried on isoforms of the protein Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors-1 (DMBT1), an immunoregulatory protein that we recently identified as the endogenous ligand for S8, DMBT1(S8). We herein report that S8L is overexpressed in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), a prevalent eosinophilic laden airway disease. Quantification and comparison of the degree to which DMBT1 carries the S8L by immunoblot analysis and lectin blot overlay, respectively, from nasal lavage showed that the S8L/DMBT1 ratio was significantly increased in CRSwNP vs. control or CRS patients. We identified the histological sites of S8L and DMBT1 expression in fresh surgically resected human nasal polyps. Histochemistry of diseased polyps and adjacent nondiseased middle turbinate (MT) tissue from CRSwNP demonstrated colocalization of S8L and DMBT1 with highest staining in submucosal glands >> epithelium > stoma. S8L expression was specifically elevated in the submucosal glands and epithelium of polyp tissue compared to MT. We hypothesize that expression of the isoform of DMBT1 carrying the Siglec-8 binding sialoglycan, DMBT1(S8), is induced in polyps of CRSwNP specifically at the site of disease, is produced in the submucosal glands of polyps and secreted into the lumen of the sinonasal cavity as a host response to mitigate eosinophil-mediated inflammation.

AB  - Objectives. The aim of our study was to examine the association of Angiomotin (Amot-p130) and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) expressions and their prognostic significance in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Methods. A total of 100 primary EOC samples were obtained for immunohistochemical analysis of Amotp130 and YAP1 expressions. Correlation analysis was performed between Amot-p130 or YAP1 and clinical factors. The overall survival time was calculated. Results. Low Amot-p130 and high YAP1 nuclear expression were identified in 34 and 56 of 100 EOC tissues, respectively. Both low Amot-p130 and high YAP1 nuclear expression were associated with advanced tumor stage, high-grade carcinoma, and non-response to chemotherapy (p<0.05). They were also associated with shorter overall survival time (p<0.05) by log-rank test. A marker of low Amot-p130 and high YAP1 expression was associated with high-grade ovarian carcinoma, late- stage disease, non-response to chemotherapy, and shorter overall survival time (p<0.05). Conclusions. Low Amot-p130 and high YAP1 nuclear expression can provide additional prognostic information for patients with EOC. A marker of low Amot-p130 and high YAP1 expression may be a potent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) expression and function is frequently altered in different cancers but scarcely explored in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This prompted us to investigate the clinical relevance of LOXL2 expression pattern in OSCC and also a possible crosstalk with Hippo/YAP1 pathway signaling. <bold>Methods: </bold>Immunohistochemical analysis of LOXL2 protein expression was performed in 158 OSCC patient samples, together with Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) activation status. Correlations with clinicopathological parameters and patient survival were assessed. <bold>Results: </bold>Tumor cell-intrinsic LOXL2 expression showed two distinct expression patterns: diffuse cytoplasmic staining (64.6%) and heterogeneous perinuclear staining (35.4%). Remarkably, perinuclear LOXL2 staining was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical stage and perineural invasion. Moreover, patients harboring tumors with perinuclear LOXL2 expression exhibited significantly poorer disease-specific survival (DSS) rates, and perinuclear LOXL2 positivity gradually increased in relation to YAP1 activation. Patients harboring tumors with concomitant perinuclear LOXL2 and fully active YAP1 exhibited the worst DSS. Multivariate Cox analysis further revealed combined perinuclear LOXL2 and fully active YAP1 as a significant independent predictor of poor DSS. <bold>Conclusion: </bold>Tumor-intrinsic perinuclear LOXL2 emerges as a clinically and biologically relevant feature associated with advanced disease, tumor aggressiveness, and poor prognosis in OSCC. Moreover, this study unprecedentedly uncovers a functional relationship between perinuclear LOXL2 and YAP1 activation with major prognostic implications. Notably, combined perinuclear LOXL2 and fully active YAP1 was revealed as independent predictor of poor prognosis. These findings encourage targeting oncogenic LOXL2 functions for personalized treatment regimens.

AB  - This study describes the identification and target deconvolution of small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic Yes-associated protein (YAP1)/TAZ activity with potent anti-tumor activity in vivo. . A high-throughput screen (HTS) of 3.8 million compounds was conducted using a cellular YAP1/TAZ reporter assay. Target deconvolution studies identified the geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I) complex as the direct target of YAP1/TAZ pathway inhibitors. The small molecule inhibitors block the activation of Rho-GTPases, leading to subsequent inactivation of YAP1/TAZ and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in vitro. . Multi-parameter optimization resulted in BAY-593, an in vivo probe with favorable PK properties, which demonstrated anti-tumor activity and blockade of YAP1/TAZ signaling in vivo. .

This study aims to analyze the clinical features, potential causes, and therapeutic outcomes of RBM in children. Methods. This article retrospectively reviews the clinical characteristics, etiologies, and treatments in children with RBM hospitalized in Hebei children's hospital from 2012 to 2020. Results. A total of 10 children with RBM, five males and five females, were included in this study. The age of RBM in children spans from the neonatal stage to the childhood stage. The underlying illnesses were identified and classified as cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (1 case), humoral immunodeficiency with Mondini dysplasia (1 case), common cavity deformity with cerebrospinal fluid ear leakage (1 case), Mondini malformations (2 cases), incomplete cochlear separation type I with a vestibular enlargement (2 cases), local inflammation of the sphenoid bone caused by cellulitis (1 case), congenital skull base defects (1 case), and congenital dermal sinus with intraspinal abscess (1 case). 6 patients chose targeted therapy for potential reasons. Conclusions. Congenital abnormalities or acquired injuries lead to intracranial communication with the outside world, which can quickly become a portal for bacterial invasion of the central nervous system, resulting in repeated infections.

AB  - Sleep is essential for life, including daily cognitive processes, yet the amount of sleep required for optimal brain health as we grow older is unclear. Poor memory and increased risk of dementia is associated with the extremes of sleep quantity and disruption of other sleep characteristics. We examined sleep and cognitive data from the UK Biobank (N = 479,420) in middle-to-late life healthy individuals (age 38-73 years) and the relationship with brain structure in a sub-group (N = 37,553). Seven hours of sleep per day was associated with the highest cognitive performance which decreased for every hour below and above this sleep duration. This quadratic relationship remained present in older individuals (>60 years, N = 212,006). Individuals who sleep between six-to-eight hours had significantly greater grey matter volume in 46 of 139 different brain regions including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampi, precentral gyrus, right frontal pole and cerebellar subfields. Several brain regions showed a quadratic relationship between sleep duration and volume while other regions were smaller only in individuals who slept longer. These findings highlight the important relationship between the modifiable lifestyle factor of sleep duration and cognition as well as a widespread association between sleep and structural brain health.
   Tai et al. examine sleep, cognitive and brain imaging data from middle-to-late life healthy individuals from the UK Biobank. They show that between six and eight hours of sleep duration is associated with the highest cognitive performance and larger grey matter volume in several areas of the brain.

AB  - Little is known about human fathers' physiology near infants' births. This may represent a period during which paternal psychobiological axes are sensitive to fathers' new experiences of interacting with their newborns and that can provide insights on how individual differences in fathers' biology relate to post-partum parenting. Drawing on a sample of men in South Bend, IN (U.S.), we report results from a longitudinal study of fathers' oxytocin, cortisol, and testosterone (N = 211) responses to their first holding of their infants on the day of birth and men's reported caregiving and father-infant bonding at 2-4 months post-partum (N = 114). First-time fathers' oxytocin was higher following first holding of their newborns, compared to their pre-holding levels. Contrasting with prior results, fathers' percentage change in oxytocin did not differ based on skin-to-skin or standard holding. Drawing on psychobiological frameworks, we modeled the interactions for oxytocin reactivity with testosterone and cortisol reactivity, respectively, in predicting father-infant outcomes months later. We found significant cross-over interactions for (oxytocin x testosterone) in predicting fathers' later post-partum involvement and bonding. Specifically, we found that fathers whose testosterone declined during holding reported greater post-partum play if their oxytocin increased, compared to fathers who experienced increases in both hormones. We also observed a similar non-significant interaction for (oxytocin x cortisol) in predicting fathers' post-partum play. Fathers whose testosterone declined during holding also reported less involvement in direct caregiving and lower father-infant bonding if their oxytocin decreased but greater direct care and bonding if their testosterone increased and oxytocin decreased. The results inform our understanding of the developmental time course of men's physiological responsiveness to father-infant interaction and its relevance to later fathering behavior and family relationships.

AB  - The incidence of breast cancer is perpetually growing globally, and it remains a major public health problem and the leading cause of mortality in women. Though the aberrant activities of the Hippo pathway have been reported to be associated with cancer, constructive knowledge of the pathway connecting the various elements of breast cancer remains to be elucidated. The Hippo transducers, yesassociated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co -activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ), are reported to be either tumor suppressors, oncogenes, or independent prognostic markers in breast cancer. Thus, there is further need for an explicative evaluation of the dilemma with this molecular contribution of Hippo transducers in modulating breast malignancy. In this review, we summarize the intricate crosstalk of the Hippo pathway in different aspects of breast malignancy, including stem -likeness, cellular signaling, metabolic adaptations, tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. The collective data shows that Hippo transducers play an indispensable role in mammary tumor formation, progression, and dissemination. However, the cellular functions of YAP/TAZ in tumorigenesis might be largely dependent on the mechanical and biophysical cues they interact with, as well as on the cell phenotype. This review provides a glimpse into the plausible biological contributions of the cascade to the inward progression of breast carcinoma and suggests potential therapeutic prospects.

AB  - Analysis of the MAP4K4-STRN3 cooperation in medulloblastoma reveals its opposing regulation of Hippo activation and tissue invasion in cancer.
   MAP4K4 is associated with increased motility and reduced proliferation in tumor cells, but the regulation of this dichotomous functionality remained elusive. We find that MAP4K4 interacts with striatin 3 and 4 (STRN3/4) and that STRN3 and MAP4K4 exert opposing functions in Hippo signaling and clonal growth. However, depletion of either STRN3 or MAP4K4 in medulloblastoma cells reduces invasion, and loss of both proteins abrogates tumor cell growth in the cerebellar tissue. Mechanistically, STRN3 couples MAP4K4 to the protein phosphatase 2A, which inactivates growth repressing activities of MAP4K4. In parallel, STRN3 enables growth factor-induced PKC theta activation and direct phosphorylation of VASP(S157) by MAP4K4, which both are necessary for efficient cell invasion. VASP(S157) directed activity of MAP4K4 and STRN3 requires the CNH domain of MAP4K4, which mediates its interaction with striatins. Thus, STRN3 is a master regulator of MAP4K4 function, and disruption of its cooperation with MAP4K4 reactivates Hippo signaling and represses tissue invasion in medulloblastoma.

AB  - Triterpene saponins exhibit various biological and pharmacological activities. However, the knowledge on saponin biosynthesis in tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) is still limited. In this work, tea flower and seed samples at different developmental stages and leaves were collected and analyzed with UPLC-PDA-MS and RNA sequencing for saponin determination and transcriptome comparison. The saponin content reached around 19% in the freshly mature seeds and 7% in the green flower buds, and decreased with the fruit ripeness and flower blooming. Almost no saponins were detected in leaf samples. PCA and KEGG analysis suggested that the gene expression pattern and secondary metabolism in TF1 and TS2 vs. leaf samples were significantly different. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) uncovered two modules related to saponin content. The mevalonate (MVA) instead of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phospate (MEP) pathway was responsible for saponin accumulation in tea plants, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS), diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MVD) and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI) may be the key enzymes involved in saponin biosynthesis in tea seeds and flowers. Moreover, ten transcription factors (TFs) were predicted to regulate saponin biosynthesis in the tea plant. Taken together, our study provides a global insight into the saponin biosynthesis and accumulation in the tea plant.

AB  - Berberine (BBN) is a naturally occurring alkaloid as a secondary metabolite in many plants and exhibits several benefits including neuroprotective activities. However, data on the neuromodulating potential of nanoformulated BBN are still lacking. In the present study, BBN loaded within iron oxide nanoparticles (BBN-IONP) were prepared and characterized by transmission electron microscopy FTIR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy particle-size distribution, zeta potential, and HPLC. The remyelinating neuroprotective potential of BBN-IONP relative to free BBN was evaluated against cuprizone (CPZ)-induced neurotoxicity (rats administered 0.2% CPZ powder (w/w) for five weeks). CPZ rats were treated with either free BBN or IONP-BBN (50 mg/kg/day, orally) for 14 days. Cognitive function was estimated using Y-maze. Biochemically, total antioxidant capacity lipid peroxides and reduced glutathione in the brain tissue, as well as, serum interferon-gamma levels were estimated. Moreover, the genetic expression contents of myelin basic protein Matrix metallopeptidase-9 Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and S100 beta were measured. The histopathological patterns and immunohistochemical assessment of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus CA1 regions were investigated. CPZ-rats treated with either free BBN or IONP-BBN demonstrated memory restoring, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-astrocytic, and remyelinating activities. Comparing free BBN with IONP-BBN revealed that the latter altered the neuromodulating activities of BBN, showing superior neuroprotective activities of IONP-BBN relative to BBN. In conclusion, both forms of BBN possess neuroprotective potential. However, the use of IONPs for brain delivery and the safety of these nano-based forms need further investigation.

AB  - Since the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 in the Middle East, we have proposed a deterministic theoretical model to understand its transmission between individuals and MERS-CoV reservoirs such as camels. We aim to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) of the model to examine its airborne transmission. By applying stability theory, we can analyze and visualize the local and global features of the model to determine its stability. We also study the sensitivity of R0 to determine the impact of each parameter on the transmission of the disease. Our model is designed with optimal control in mind to minimize the number of infected individuals while keeping intervention costs low. The model includes time -dependent control variables such as supportive care, the use of surgical masks, government campaigns promoting the importance of masks, and treatment. To support our analytical work, we present numerical simulation results for the proposed model.

AB  - The febrile seizure (FS) is a common disease in emergency pediatrics, and about 30% of patients are children aged between 6 months and 5 years. Therefore, we aim to observe the protective impact of liraglutide (LIR) on brain injury in mice with FS and to explore its relevant mechanisms. Male SD mice were selected, and the FS model was established by heat bath method. The behavioral score was performed on mice with Racine grading, and nerve cells in apoptosis in the hippocampus were determined by TUNEL. The content of glutamate was determined by ELISA. mRNA levels and protein expression of GLP-1, GLP-1R, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and cleaved-caspase 3 were examined in mice by q-PCR and WB. Protein expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid was influenced by WB as well. LIR prolonged the seizure latency and seizure duration in mice with FS. The GLP-1 and GLP-1R in the mouse hippocampus with FS expressed highly and also inhibited the number of nerve cells in apoptosis, decreased glutamate content, and increased gamma-aminobutyric acid expression in the mouse hippocampus with FS. In addition, The IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, in the mouse hippocampus with FS expressed to reduce with LIR. LIR is protective against brain injury in mice with FS and protects brain injury by inhibiting inflammatory factors in mice with FS. Our finding provides a reference for mitigating and delaying the development of FS as well as the prevention and treatment of brain injury caused by FS.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) can be caused by multiple etiologies and is characterized by a sudden and severe decrease in kidney function. Understanding the independent risk factors associated with the development of AKI and its early detection can refine the risk management and clinical decision-making of high-risk patients after cardiovascular surgery. A retrospective analysis was performed in a single teaching hospital between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. The diagnostic performance of novel biomarkers was assessed using random forest, support vector machine, and multivariate logistic regression. The nomogram from multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with AKI indicated that only LVEF, red blood cell input, and ICUmvat contribute to AKI differentiation and that the difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05). Seven radiomics biomarkers were found among 65 patients to be highly correlated with AKI-associated delirium. The importance of the variables was determined using the multilayer perceptron model; fivefold cross-validation was applied to determine the most important delirium risk factors in radiomics of the hippocampus. Finally, we established a radiomics-based machine learning framework to predict AKI-induced delirium in patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery.

AB  - In rhinoplasty, it is necessary to consider the correlation between the anthropometric indicators of the nasal bone, so that it prevents surgical complications and enhances the patient's satisfaction. The penetrating form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation is highly impacted on human health, which has often raised concerns of alternative method for facial analysis. The critical stage to assess nasal morphology is the nasal analysis on its anthropology that is highly reliant on the understanding of the structural features of the nasal radix. For example, the shape and size of nasal bone features, skin thickness, and also body factors aggregated from different facial anthropology values. In medical diagnosis, however, the morphology of the nasal bone is determined manually and significantly relies on the clinician's expertise. Furthermore, the evaluation anthropological keypoint of the nasal bone is nonrepeatable and laborious, also finding widely differ and intralaboratory variability in the results because of facial soft tissue and equipment defects. In order to overcome these problems, we propose specialized convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to accurately predict nasal measurement based on digital 2D photogrammetry. To boost performance and efficacy, it is deliberately constructed with many layers and different filter sizes, with less filters and optimizing parameters. Through its result, the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) indicated the correlation between differences in human body factors mentioned are height, weight known as body mass index (BMI), age, gender, and the nasal bone dimension of the participant. With full of parameters could the nasal morphology be diagnostic continuously. The model's performance is evaluated on various newest architecture models such as DenseNet, ConvNet, Inception, VGG, and MobileNet. Experiments were directly conducted on different facials. The results show the proposed architecture worked well in terms of nasal properties achieved which utilize four statistical criteria named mean average precision (mAP), mean absolute error (MAE), R-square (R2), and T-test analyzed. Data has also shown that the nasal shape of Southeast Asians, especially Vietnamese, could be divided into different types in two perspective views. From cadavers for bony datasets, nasal bones can be classified into 2 morphological types in the lateral view which "V " shape was presented by 78.8% and the remains were "S " shape evaluated based on Lazovic (2015). With 2 angular dimension averages are 136.41 & PLUSMN;7.99 and 104.25 & PLUSMN;5.95 represented by the nasofrontal angle (g-n-prn) and the nasomental angle (n-prn-sn), respectively. For frontal view, classified by Hwang, Tae-Sun, et al. (2005), nasal morphology of Vietnamese participants could be divided into three types: type A was present in 57.6% and type B was present in 30.3% of the noses. In particular, types C, D, and E were not a common form of Vietnamese which includes the remaining number of participants. In conclusion, the proposed model performed the potential hybrid of CNN and BPNN with its application to give expected accuracy in terms of keypoint localization and nasal morphology regression. Nasal analysis can replace MRI imaging diagnostics that are reflected by the risk to human body.

AB  - Computational models proposed that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) contributes importantly to error-driven learning, though little direct in-vivo evidence for this hypothesis exists. To test this, we recorded in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HPC) as macaques performed an associative learning task using an error-driven learning strategy, defined as better performance after error relative to correct trials. Error-detection signals were more prominent in the EC relative to HPC. Early in learning hippocampal but not EC neurons signaled error-driven learning by increasing their population stimulus-selectivity following error trials. This same pattern was not seen in another task where error-driven learning was not used. After learning, different populations of cells in both the EC and HPC signaled long-term memory of newly learned associations with enhanced stimulus-selective responses. These results suggest prominent but differential contributions of EC and HPC to learning from errors and a particularly important role of the EC in error-detection.
   Ku et al. recorded in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HPC) of macaques during associative learning tasks in order to test the computational model prediction that they contribute to error-driven learning. They demonstrate that the EC and HPC have prominent but differential contributions to learning from errors, with the EC having a particularly prominent role in error-detection.

AB  - Birds are characterized by evolutionary specializations of both locomotion (e.g., flapping flight) and digestive system (toothless, crop, and gizzard), while the potential selection pressures responsible for these evolutionary specializations remain unclear. Here we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological method to reconstruct the diets of the ancestral archosaur and of the common ancestor of living birds (CALB). Our results suggest a trophic shift from carnivory to herbivory (fruit, seed, and/or nut eater) at the archosaur-to-bird transition. The evolutionary shift of the CALB to herbivory may have essentially made them become a low-level consumer and, consequently, subject to relatively high predation risk from potential predators such as gliding non-avian maniraptorans, from which birds descended. Under the relatively high predation pressure, ancestral birds with gliding capability may have then evolved not only flapping flight as a possible anti-predator strategy against gliding predatory non-avian maniraptorans but also the specialized digestive system as an evolutionary tradeoff of maximizing foraging efficiency and minimizing predation risk. Our results suggest that the powered flight and specialized digestive system of birds may have evolved as a result of their tropic shift-associated predation pressure. Yonghua Wu applies recently developed molecular phyloecological methods to identify a trophic shift from carnivory to herbivory in the earliest birds. Predation pressure from becoming low-level consumers may have stimulated the evolution of powered flight as an anti-predator strategy against gliding predatory non-avian maniraptorans.

TI  - PKA-RIIβ autophosphorylation modulates PKA activity and seizure phenotypes in mice
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common and intractable neurological disorders in adults. Dysfunctional PKA signaling is causally linked to the TLE. However, the mechanism underlying PKA involves in epileptogenesis is still poorly understood. In the present study, we found the autophosphorylation level at serine 114 site (serine 112 site in mice) of PKA-RII beta subunit was robustly decreased in the epileptic foci obtained from both surgical specimens of TLE patients and seizure model mice. The p-RII beta level was negatively correlated with the activities of PKA. Notably, by using a P-site mutant that cannot be autophosphorylated and thus results in the released catalytic subunit to exert persistent phosphorylation, an increase in PKA activities through transduction with AAV-RII beta -S112A in hippocampal DG granule cells decreased mIPSC frequency but not mEPSC, enhanced neuronal intrinsic excitability and seizure susceptibility. In contrast, a reduction of PKA activities by RII beta knockout led to an increased mIPSC frequency, a reduction in neuronal excitability, and mice less prone to experimental seizure onset. Collectively, our data demonstrated that the autophosphorylation of RII beta subunit plays a critical role in controlling neuronal and network excitabilities by regulating the activities of PKA, providing a potential therapeutic target for TLE. Jingliang Zhang et al. examine how dysfunctional PKA signaling impacts neuronal activity and seizure susceptibility in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Their data suggest that autophosphorylation of the RII beta subunit regulates neuronal excitability, and may act as a future therapeutic target.

AB  - Chronic stress, a common risk factor for psychiatric disorders, is also implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provide evidence for chronic restraint stress (CRS), a widely used stress model in rodents, to regulate AD pathology. CRS not only induces prolonged depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits in young adult wild type (WT) mice, but also exacerbates a series of AD-related phenotypes in APP/PS1 mice, including impaired spatial learning and memory, increased beta-amyloid plaques, promoted glial cells (astrocyte and microglial cell) activation and decreased dendritic spines in CA1 neurons. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis in hippocampus shows remarkable transcriptional changes in many cell type(s), and identifies oxidative phosphorylation pathway, a major source for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, is significantly downregulated in CA1 neurons by CRS stimuli. Furthermore, dysfunctional mitochondria and reduced ATP levels are also observed in CA1 neurons of CRS exposed WT and APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, infusion of ATP in CA1 region abolishes the deficits in cognition, dendritic spines and glial activation in CRS exposed APP/PS1 mice. Taken together, these results uncover an unrecognized function of CA1 neurons in regulating CRS induced AD pathologies, and suggest ATP as a promising therapeutic strategy to improve brain health under stress condition.

AB  - Background: The role of meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) in neurodegenerative diseases has been increasingly recognized. However, their involvement in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and associated depression-like behaviors remains poorly understood. Given that impaired clearance of neurotoxic substances can prolong central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, investigating the function of mLVs in this context may offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying acute neuroinflammation and provide potential therapeutic targets.Methods: First, the impact of intracerebral injection of LPS on the function of mLVs was investigated. Subsequently, the MAZ51, a VEGFR3 antagonist, was administered via intraperitoneal injection for 1 month to inhibit the development and function of mLVs, and to evaluate whether the impaired drainage function of mLVs exacerbates inflammation in the CNS caused by LPS. Finally, VEGFR3 ligand VEGF-C was administered preemptively to assess whether enhancing the function of mLVs mitigates LPS-induced inflammation and depression-like behavior.Results: The mice with intracerebral injection of LPS demonstrated a substantial reduction in the transport of OVA-647 to the deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs) and in the coverage of Lyve-1 within the mLVs, suggesting LPS impaired the development and drainage of mLVs. Pretreatment with MAZ51 further damages the drainage function of mLVs and intensify LPS-induced activation of microglia and astrocytes. Additionally, MAZ51 led to a decrease in the protein levels of PSD95 as well in the hippocampus, which was paralleled by an elevation in TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels, and aggravated depression-like behavior. On the contrary, pretreatment with VEGFR3 ligand VEGF-C attenuated LPS-induced neuroinflammation, as indicated by a decrease in TNF-alpha, IL-6, Iba1, and GFAP expression in the hippocampus. VEGF-C treatment also significantly increased the level of PSD95 and improved depression-like behavior.Conclusion: The drainage function of mLVs is pivotal in inflammation of the CNS. Enhancing meningeal lymphatic improves the development of neuroinflammation and inflammation-induced depression-like behaviors. VEGFR3 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for CNS inflammation.

AB  - The positioning and communication between the nucleus and centrosomes are essential in cell division, differentiation and tissue formation. During skeletal myogenesis, the nuclei become evenly spaced with the switch of the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC) from the centrosome to the nuclear envelope (NE). We report that the tail-anchored sarcolemmal membrane associated protein 3 (SLMAP3), a component of the MTOC and NE, is crucial for myogenesis because its deletion in mice leads to a reduction in the NE-MTOC formation, mislocalization of the nuclei, dysregulation of the myogenic programme and abnormal embryonic myofibres. SLMAP3-/- myoblasts also displayed a similar disorganized distribution of nuclei with an aberrant NE-MTOC and defective myofibre formation and differentiation programming. We identified novel interactors of SLMAP3, including pericentrin, PCM1 (pericentriolar material 1), AKAP9 (A-kinase anchoring protein 9), kinesin-1 members Kif5B (kinesin family member 5B), KCL1 (kinesin light chain 1), KLC2 (kinesin light chain 2) and nuclear lamins, and observed that the distribution of centrosomal proteins at the NE together with Nesprin-1 was significantly altered by the loss of SLMAP3 in differentiating myoblasts. SLMAP3 is believed to negatively regulate Hippo signalling, but its loss was without impact on this pathway in developing muscle. These results reveal that SLMAP3 is essential for skeletal myogenesis through unique mechanisms involving the positioning of nuclei, NE-MTOC dynamics and gene programming.

AB  - Introduction: This study aims to test the hypothesis that increased ketone body production resulting from a ketogenic diet (KD) will correlate with reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid subspecies and improved clinical outcomes in adults treated with an adjunctive ketogenic diet for super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE).Methods: Adults (18 years or older) were treated with a 4:1 (fat: carbohydrate and protein) ratio of enteral KD as adjunctive therapy to pharmacologic seizure suppression in SRSE. Blood and urine samples and clinical measurements were collected at baseline (n = 10), after 1 week (n = 8), and after 2 weeks of KD (n = 5). In addition, urine acetoacetate, serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, lipidomics, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6), chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL13), and clinical measurements were obtained at these three time points. Univariate and multivariate data analyses were performed to determine the correlation between ketone body production and circulating lipids, inflammatory biomarkers, and clinical outcomes.Results: Changes in lipids included an increase in ceramides, mono-hexosylceramide, sphingomyelin, phosphocholine, and phosphoserines, and there was a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-6 and CXCL13, seen at 1 and 2 weeks of KD. Higher blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels at baseline correlated with better clinical outcomes; however, ketone body production did not correlate with other variables during treatment. Higher chemokine CCL3 levels following treatment correlated with a longer stay in the intensive care unit and a higher modified Rankin Scale score (worse neurologic disability) at discharge and 6-month follow up.Discussion: Adults receiving an adjunctive enteral ketogenic diet for super-refractory status epilepticus exhibit alterations in select pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid species that may predict their response to treatment.

AB  - Glucosinolates are plant thioglucosides, which act as chemical defenses. Upon tissue damage, their myrosinase-catalyzed hydrolysis yields aglucones that rearrange to toxic isothiocyanates. Specifier proteins such as thiocyanate-forming protein from Thlaspi arvense (TaTFP) are non-heme iron proteins, which capture the aglucone to form alternative products, e.g. nitriles or thiocyanates. To resolve the electronic state of the bound iron cofactor in TaTFP, we applied continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW EPR) spectroscopy at X-and Q-band frequencies (similar to 9.4 and similar to 34 GHz). We found characteristic features of high spin and low spin states of a d(5) electronic configuration and local rhombic symmetry during catalysis. We monitored the oxidation states of bound iron during conversion of allylglucosinolate by myrosinase and TaTFP in presence and absence of supplemented Fe2+. Without added Fe2+, most high spin features of bound Fe3+ were preserved, while different g'-values of the low spin part indicated slight rearrangements in the coordination sphere and/or structural geometry. We also examined involvement of the redox pair Fe3+/Fe-2 in samples with supplemented Fe2+. The absence of any EPR signal related to Fe3+ or Fe2+ using an iron-binding deficient TaTFP variant allowed us to conclude that recorded EPR signals originated from the bound iron cofactor.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that sevoflurane postconditioning can provide neuroprotection after hypoxic-ischemic injury and improve learning and memory function in developing rodent brains. The classical Rice-Vannucci model was used to induce hypoxic-ischemic injury, and newborn (postnatal day 7) rats were treated with 2.4% sevoflurane for 30 minutes after hypoxic-ischemic injury. Our results showed that sevoflurane postconditioning significantly improved the learning and memory function of rats, decreased astrogliosis and glial scar formation, increased numbers of dendritic spines, and protected the histomorphology of the hippocampus. Mechanistically, sevoflurane postconditioning decreased expression of von Hippel-Lindau of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and increased expression of DJ-1. Injection of 1.52 mu g of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha inhibitor YC-1 (Lificiguat) into the left lateral ventricle 30 minutes before hypoxic-ischemic injury reversed the neuroprotection induced by sevoflurane. This finding suggests that sevoflurane can effectively alleviate astrogliosis in the hippocampus and reduce learning and memory impairments caused by glial scar formation after hypoxic-ischemic injury. The underlying mechanism may be related to upregulated DJ-1 expression, reduced ubiquitination of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, and stabilized hypoxiainducible factor-1 alpha expression.

AB  - Epilepsy is a neurological disorder of genetic or environmental origin characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures. A rodent model of temporal lobe epilepsy is induced by a single administration of pilocarpine, a nonselective cholinergic muscarinic receptor agonist. The molecular changes associated with pilocarpine-induced seizures are still poorly described. Epigenetic multiprotein complexes that regulate gene expression by changing the structure of chromatin impose transcriptional memories. Among the epigenetic enzymes relevant to the epileptogenic process is lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, KDM1A), which regulates the expression of genes that control neuronal excitability. LSD1 forms complexes with the CoREST family of transcriptional corepressors, which are molecular bridges that bring HDAC1/2 and LSD1 enzymes to deacetylate and demethylate the tail of nucleosomal histone H3. To test the hypothesis that LSD1-complexes are involved in initial modifications associated with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy, we studied the expression of main components of LSD1-complexes and the associated epigenetic marks on isolated neurons and the hippocampus of pilocarpine-treated mice. Using a single injection of 300 mg/kg of pilocarpine and after 24 h, we found that protein levels of LSD1, CoREST2, and HDAC1/2 increased, while CoREST1 decreased in the hippocampus. In addition, we observed increased histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation (H3K9me2/3) and decreased histone H3 lysine 4 di and trimethylation (H3K4me2/3). Similar findings were observed in cultured hippocampal neurons and HT-22 hippocampal cell line treated with pilocarpine. In conclusion, our data show that muscarinic receptor activation by pilocarpine induces a global repressive state of chromatin and prevalence of LSD1-CoREST2 epigenetic complexes, modifications that could underlie the pathophysiological processes leading to epilepsy.

AB  - Tea oil is an important high-quality edible oil derived from woody plants. Camellia oleifera is the largest and most widely planted oil-producing plant in the Camellia genus in China, and its seeds are the most important source for obtaining tea oil. In current research, improving the yield and quality of tea oil is the main goal of oil tea genetic breeding. The aim of this study was to investigate the degree of genetic variation in an early crossing population of C. oleifera and identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes significantly associated with fruit traits, which can provide a basis for marker-assisted selection and gene editing for achieving trait improvement in the future. In this study, we selected a crossing population of approximately 40-year-old C. oleifera with a total of 330 samples. Then, ddRAD sequencing was used for SNP calling and population genetic analysis, and association analysis was performed on fruit traits measured repeatedly for two consecutive years. The research results indicate that over 8 million high-quality SNPs have been identified, but the vast majority of SNPs occur in intergenic regions. The nucleotide polymorphism of this population is at a low level, and Tajima's D values are mostly greater than 0, indicating that the change in this population was not suitable for the model of central evolution. The population structure analysis shows that the population has seven theoretical sources of genetic material and can be divided into seven groups, and the clustering analysis results support the population structure analysis results. Association analysis identified significant SNPs associated with genes related to the seed number of a single fruit and seed kernel oil content. Our findings provide a basis for molecular breeding and future genetic improvement of cultivated oil tea.

AB  - Metabolic perturbation has been associated with depression. An untargeted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry was employed to detect and measure the rat serum metabolic changes following chronic social isolation (CSIS), an animal model of depression, and effective antidepressant fluoxetine (Flx) treatment. Univariate and multivariate statistics were used for metabolic data analysis and differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) determination. Potential markers and predictive metabolites of CSIS-induced depressive-like behavior and Flx efficacy in CSIS were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as support vector machine with linear kernel (SVM-LK) and random forest (RF). Upregulated choline following CSIS may represent a potential marker of depressive-like behavior. Succinate, stachydrine, guanidinoacetate, kynurenic acid, and 7-methylguanine were revealed as potential markers of effective Flx treatment in CSIS rats. RF yielded better accuracy than SVM-LK (98.50% vs. 85.70%, respectively) in predicting Flx efficacy in CSIS vs. CSIS, however, it performed almost identically in classifying CSIS vs. control (75.83% and 75%, respectively). Obtained DEMs combined with ROC curve and ML algorithms provide a research strategy for assessing potential markers or predictive metabolites for the designation or classification of stress-induced depressive phenotype and mode of drug action.

AB  - The complement system is part of the innate immune system and has been shown to be altered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) is the main genetic cause of ASD and studies suggest a dysregulation in the immune system in patients with the disorder. To assess if an animal model of FXS presents with altered complement signaling, we treated male Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and collected the hippocampus 24 h later. Assessment of the expression of the complement genes C1q, C3, and C4 identified the upregulation of C3 in both wild-type (WT) and knockout mice. Levels of C3 also increased in both genotypes. Analysis of the correlation between the expression of C3 and the cytokines IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha identified a different relationship between the expression of the genes in Fmr1 KO when compared to WT mice. Our findings did not support our initial hypotheses that the lack of the FMR1 gene would alter complement system signaling, and that the induction of the complement system in response to LPS in Fmr1 KO mice differed from wild-type conspecifics.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders are more common in males, and have a substantial genetic component. Chromosomal 16p11.2 deletions in particular carry strong genetic risk for autism, yet their neurobiological impact is poorly characterised, particularly at the integrated systems level. Here we show that mice reproducing this deletion (16p11.2 DEL mice) have reduced GABAergic interneuron gene expression (decreased parvalbumin mRNA in orbitofrontal cortex, and male-specific decreases in Gad67 mRNA in parietal and insular cortex and medial septum). Metabolic activity was increased in medial septum, and in its efferent targets: mammillary body and (males only) subiculum. Functional connectivity was altered between orbitofrontal, insular and auditory cortex, and between septum and hippocampus/subiculum. Consistent with this circuit dysfunction, 16p11.2 DEL mice showed reduced prepulse inhibition, but enhanced performance in the continuous performance test of attentional ability. Level 1 autistic individuals show similarly heightened performance in the equivalent human test, also associated with parietal, insular-orbitofrontal and septo-subicular dysfunction. The data implicate cortical and septal GABAergic dysfunction, and resulting connectivity changes, as the cause of pre-attentional and attentional changes in autism.
   Mice hemizygous for the 16p11.2 deletion exhibit localized functional dysconnectivity and altered GABAergic gene expression, implicating GABAergic dysfunction and resulting connectivity changes in attentional changes in autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - Camellia nitidissima is a woody plant with high ornamental value, and its golden-yellow flowers are rich in a variety of bioactive substances, especially flavonoids, that are beneficial to human health. Chalcone isomerases (CHIs) are key enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway; however, there is a scarcity of information regarding the CHI family genes of C. nitidissima. In this study, seven CHI genes of C. nitidissima were identified and divided into three subfamilies by phylogenetic analysis. The results of multiple sequence alignment revealed that, unlike CnCHI1/5/6/7, CnCHI2/3/4 are bona fide CHIs that contain all the active site and critical catalytic residues. Analysis of the expression patterns of CnCHIs and the total flavonoid content of the flowers at different developmental stages revealed that CnCHI4 might play an essential role in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway of C. nitidissima. CnCHI4 overexpression significantly increased flavonoid production in Nicotiana tabacum and C. nitidissima. The results of the dual-luciferase reporter assay and yeast one-hybrid system revealed that CnMYB7 was the key transcription factor that governed the transcription of CnCHI4. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the CHI family genes of C. nitidissima and performed a preliminary analysis of their functions and regulatory mechanisms.

AB  - The progress in optogenetics largely depends on the development of light-activated proteins as new molecular tools. Using cultured hippocampal neurons, we compared the properties of two light-activated cation channels - classical channelrhodopsin-2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrChR2) and recently described channelrhodopsin isolated from the alga Platymonas subcordiformis (PsChR2). PsChR2 ensured generation of action potentials by neurons when activated by the pulsed light stimulation with the frequencies up to 40-50 Hz, while the upper limit for CrChR2 was 20-30 Hz. An important advantage of PsChR2 compared to classical channelrhodopsin CrChR2 is the blue shift of its excitation spectrum, which opens the possibility for its application in all-optical electrophysiology experiments that require the separation of the maxima of the spectra of channelrhodopsins used for the stimulation of neurons and the maxima of the excitation spectra of various red fluorescent probes. We compared the response (generation of action potentials) of neurons expressing CrChR2 and PsChR2 to light stimuli at 530 and 550 nm commonly used for the excitation of red fluorescent probes. The 530-nm light was significantly (3.7 times) less efficient in the activation of neurons expressing PsChR2 vs. CrChR2-expressing neurons. The light at 550 nm, even at the maximal used intensity, failed to stimulate neurons expressing either of the studied opsins. This indicates that the PsChR2 channelrhodopsin from the alga P. subcordiformis is a promising optogenetic tool, both in terms of its frequency characteristics and possibility of its application for neuronal stimulation with a short-wavelength (blue, 470 nm) light accompanied by simultaneous recording of various physiological processes using fluorescent probes.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a neuropsychiatric illness with an increasing incidence and a shortfall of efficient diagnostic tools. Interview-based diagnostic tools and clinical examination often lead to misdiagnosis and inefficient systematic treatment selection. Diagnostic and treatment monitoring biomarkers are warranted for MDD. Thus, the emerging field of metabolomics is a promising tool capable of portraying the metabolic repertoire of biomolecules from biological samples in a minimally invasive fashion. Herein, we report an untargeted metabolomic profiling performed in plasma samples of 11 MDD patients, at baseline (MDD1) and at 12 weeks following antidepressant therapy with escitalopram (MDD2), and in 11 healthy controls (C), using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-(ESI+)-MS). We found two putative metabolites ((phosphatidylserine PS (16:0/16:1) and phosphatidic acid PA (18:1/18:0)) as having statistically significant increased levels in plasma samples of MDD1 patients compared to healthy subjects. ROC analysis revealed an AUC value of 0.876 for PS (16:0/16:1), suggesting a potential diagnostic biomarker role. In addition, PS (18:3/20:4) was significantly decreased in MDD2 group compared to MDD1, with AUC value of 0.785.

AB  - Breast cancer has the highest diagnosis rate among all cancers. Tumor budding (TB) is recognized as a recent prognostic marker. Identifying genes specific to high-TB samples is crucial for hindering tumor progression and metastasis. In this study, we utilized an RNA sequencing technique, called TempO-Seq, to profile transcriptomic data from breast cancer samples, aiming to identify biomarkers for high-TB cases. Through differential expression analysis and mutual information, we identified seven genes (NOL4, STAR, C8G, NEIL1, SLC46A3, FRMD6, and SCARF2) that are potential biomarkers in breast cancer. To gain more relevant proteins, further investigation based on a protein-protein interaction network and the network diffusion technique revealed enrichment in the Hippo signaling and Wnt signaling pathways, promoting tumor initiation, invasion, and metastasis in several cancer types. In conclusion, these novel genes, recognized as overexpressed in high-TB samples, along with their associated pathways, offer promising therapeutic targets, thus advancing treatment and diagnosis for breast cancer.

AB  - Neuropeptides are the largest group of chemical signals in the brain. More than 100 different neuropeptides modulate various brain functions and their dysregulation has been associated with neurological disorders. Neuropeptides are packed into dense core vesicles (DCVs), which fuse with the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner. Here, we describe a novel high-throughput assay for DCV exocytosis using a chimera of Nanoluc luciferase and the DCV-cargo neuropeptide Y (NPY). The NPY-Nanoluc reporter colocalized with endogenous DCV markers in all neurons with little mislocalization to other cellular compartments. NPY-Nanoluc reported DCV exocytosis in both rodent and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neurons, with similar depolarization, Cat+, RAB3, and STXBP1/MUNC18 dependence as reported modulation of DCV exocytosis by known modulators diacylglycerol analog and Cat+ channel blocker and showed a higher assay sensitivity than a widely used single-cell lowthroughput assay. Lastly, we showed that Nanoluc coupled to other secretory markers reports on constitutive secretion. In conclusion, the NPY-Nanoluc is a sensitive reporter of DCV exocytosis in mammalian neurons, suitable for pharmacological and genomic screening for DCV exocytosis genes and for mechanism-based treatments for central nervous system disorders.

AB  - MiRNAs in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosome (MSCs-exo) play an important role in the treatment of sepsis. We explored the mechanism through which MSCs-exo influences cognitive impairment in sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Here, we show that miR-140-3p targeted Hmgb1. MSCs-exo plus miR-140-3p mimic (Exo) and antibiotic imipenem/cilastatin (ABX) improve survival, weight, and cognitive impairment in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice. Exo and ABX inhibit high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), IBA-1, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, iNOS, TNF-alpha, p65/p-p65, NLRP3, Caspase 1, and GSDMD-N levels. In addition, Exo upregulates S-lactoylglutathione levels in the hippocampus of CLP mice. Our data further demonstrates that Exo and S-lactoylglutathione increase GSH levels in LPS-induced HMC3 cells and decrease LD and GLO2 levels, inhibiting inflammatory responses and pyroptosis. These findings suggest that MSCs-exo-mediated delivery of miR-140-3p ameliorates cognitive impairment in mice with SAE by HMGB1 and S-lactoylglutathione metabolism, providing potential therapeutic targets for the clinical treatment of SAE.

AB  - Recent studies have indicated that dysregulation of the Hippo/Yes-associated protein (YAP) axis is associated with tumor progression and therapy resistance in various cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Understanding the regulation of Hippo signaling in LUAD is of great significance. Elevated levels of TRIB3, a pseudo kinase, have been observed in certain lung malignancies and are associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Our research aims to investigate whether increased TRIB3 levels enhance the malignant characteristics of LUAD cells and tumor progression through its interaction with the Hippo signaling pathway. In this study, we reported a positive correlation between elevated expression of TRIB3 and LUAD progression. Additionally, TRIB3 has the ability to enhance TEAD luciferase function and suppress Hippo pathway activity. Moreover, TRIB3 increases total YAP protein levels and promotes YAP nuclear localization. Mechanistic experiments revealed that TRIB3 directly interacts with large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1), thereby suppressing Hippo signaling. Moreover, the decrease in METTL3-mediated N6-methyladenosine modification of TRIB3 results in a substantial elevation of its expression levels in LUAD cells. Collectively, our research unveils a novel discovery that TRIB3 enhances the growth and invasion of LUAD cells by interacting with LATS1 and inhibiting the Hippo signaling pathway. TRIB3 may serve as a potential biomarker for an unfavorable prognosis and a target for novel treatments in YAP-driven lung cancer.

AB  - Iron is an essential nutrient in the body. However, iron generates oxidative stress and hence needs to be bound to carrier proteins such as the glycoprotein transferrin (Tf) in body fluids. We previously reported that cerebrospinal fluid contains Tf glycan-isoforms that are derived from the brain, but their origins at the cellular level in the brain have not yet been elucidated. In the present report, we described the localization of Tf protein and mRNA in mouse and human brain tissue. In situ hybridization of mouse brain tissue revealed that Tf mRNA is expressed by different cell types such as epithelial cells in the choroid plexus, oligodendrocyte-like cells in the medulla, and neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. In contrast, Tf protein was barely detected by immunohistochemistry in hippocampal and some cortical neurons, but it was detected in other types of cells such as oligodendrocyte-like cells and choroid plexus epithelial cells. The results showed that Tf mRNA is expressed by neural cells, while Tf protein is expressed in different brain regions, though at very low levels in hippocampal neurons. Low Tf level in the hippocampus may increases susceptibility to iron-induced oxidative stress, and account for neuron death in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infections) is an acute onset or exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms following a group A streptococcus (GAS) infection. It is believed to be a result of autoimmune response to streptococcal infection, but there is insufficient evidence to fully support this theory. Although this disease is primarily thought to be a disease of childhood, it is reported to occur also in adults. PANDAS is a well-defined clinical entity, but the neuropathology of this condition is not established yet. We describe the clinical course of a 26-year old female diagnosed with PANDAS. She committed suicide and her brain was bio-banked for further studies. We examined the banked tissue and used special stains, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis to characterize the neuropathology of this condition. Histology of temporal lobes, hippocampus, and basal ganglia shows mild astrogliosis, Alzheimer's type II astrocytes, and acute hypoxic ischemic changes. Immunostaining shows increased parenchymal/perivascular GFAP staining, and many vessels with mild increases in CD3, CD4 and CD25 stained lymphocytes in basal ganglia. The findings suggest that CD4 and CD25 positive T cells might have an important role in understanding the neuroinflammation and pathogenesis of this condition. The case represents the first neuropathological evaluation report for PANDAS.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy tumor worldwide with high incidence and mortality. Accumulating evidence indicated that through an m6A-dependent or m6A-independent mechanism, fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) exhibits the tumor-promoting and suppressive roles of FTO involved in various cancers, including cervical cancer. This study aims to verify the biological function and potential mechanisms of FTO in cervical cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo. Herein, we confirmed that knockdown of FTO inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells in vitro via cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, colony formation assay, and transwell migration and invasion assay. The demethylase activity of FTO is required for cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells in vitro. RNA sequencing, online database analysis, and western blotting revealed that FTO regulated the BMP4/Hippo/YAP1/TAZ pathway. In addition, FTO upregulates the expression of BMP4 in an m6A-dependent manner and binds to the N-terminal of BMP4 to form a dimer at the C-terminal in cervical cancer cells through protein-protein interaction. We further discovered that BMP4 treatment promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells, and rescue experiments validated that BMP4 treatment reversed the inhibition of FTO knockdown on the Hippo/YAP1/TAZ pathway and the progression of cervical cancer cells in vitro. Notably, the knockdown of FTO significantly suppressed xenograft tumor growth and the protein level of BMP4 in vivo. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the FTO promotes cervical cancer progression in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of the BMP4/Hippo/YAP1/TAZ pathway, suggesting that FTO acts as an oncogenic molecule and the FTO/BMP4 Hippo/YAP1/TAZ axis may serve as valuable targets for cervical cancer treatment.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that have major functions in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. The aim of the current research was to assess the role of miR-485-3p and miR-4728-5p in the pathogenesis of CRC. In this study, fresh tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples were obtained from a total of 59 CRC patients, 37 from colon and 22 from rectum. The expression profiles of miR-485-3p and miR-4728-5p were determined using qRT-PCR. miRNA-related transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks were constructed using the TransmiR v2.0, TF-regulated target genes were determined using the Human.mirFFL.DB and TRRUST v2.0, functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DIANA-mirPath v3.0 and -Tarbase v7.0. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of both miR-485-3p and miR-4728-5p were very significantly downregulated in CRC tissues (fold changes = 0.42 +/- 0.70 and 0.59 +/- 1.06, respectively; both p = 0.000). On the other hand, lower expression levels of miR-485-3p were detected in the both rectum and colon. Moreover, the decrease in the expression levels of miR-4728-5p was correlated with increasing age. However, these differences were not statistically significant according to the FDR-related p-values (0.126 and 0.168, respectively). By bioinformatics analyses, miR-485-3p and miR-4728-5p-related TFs were identified. Some of these TFs, namely, AR, CREB1, CEBPB, FOXA1, GTF2I, MAZ, NCOR2, NFIC, NRF1, SIN3A, SREBF1, SREBF2, p53 and YY1, appeared to be associated with CRC and were, therefore, selected to construct miRNA-TF-gene networks of potential targets for the early diagnosis and treatment of CRC. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated Hippo signaling pathway as heavily regulated by miR-485-3p. It seems that the decrease in expression levels of miR-485-3p and miR-4728-5p might be associated with development of colorectal cancer.

AB  - A higher expression level of mitogenic fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) has been reported in human nasal mucus of both chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Meanwhile, we have shown that long pentraxin 3 (PTX3), an essential component of humoral innate immunity that is produced at sites of infection and inflammation, was overproduced in human nasal mucosae and secretions of CRSsNP. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate how FGF-2 regulates PTX3 expression in human CRSsNP nasal mucosa-derived fibroblast cells (hNMDFs). The FGF-2 treatment caused ptx3 mRNA expression and PTX3 protein induction and secretion. In parallel, a differential expression of FGF receptor (FGFR)-1 to FGFR-4 was observed in hNMDFs and human nasal tissues. While conventionally known PI3K/Akt/mTOR and AP-1 pathways following FGFR activation were shown to be involved, the protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were also found to be as critical signaling molecules in FGF-2-induced PTX3 induction. The PKC delta and CREB activation could be detected in total cells and in the cell nucleus. Accordingly, a novel CREB binding sequence was detected in the human ptx3 promoter region and could interact with activated CREB in cells challenged with FGF-2. Surprisingly, the phospholipase D (PLD), but not phosphoinositide- and phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C, was necessarily required for PKC delta and CREB activation. Therefore, we demonstrated here for the first time that FGF-2 mediates PTX3 production not only through PI-3K/Akt/mTOR and AP-1 activation, but also through a novel FGFR-PLD-PKC delta-CREB cellular signaling pathway.

AB  - Within the intestinal epithelium, regulation of intracellular protein and vesicular trafficking is of utmost importance for barrier maintenance, immune responses, and tissue polarity. RAB11A is a small GTPase that mediates the anterograde transport of protein cargos to the plasma membrane. Loss of RAB11A-dependent trafficking in mature intestinal epithelial cells results in increased epithelial proliferation and nuclear accumulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), a key Hippo-signaling transducer that senses cell-cell contacts and regulates tissue growth. However, it is unclear how RAB11A regulates YAP intracellular localizations. In this report, we examined the relationship of RAB11A to epithelial junctional complexes, YAP, and the associated consequences on colonic epithelial tissue repair. We found that RAB11A controls the biochemical associations of YAP with multiple components of adherens and tight junctions, including alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and Merlin, a tumor suppressor. In the absence of RAB11A and Merlin, we observed enhanced YAP-beta-catenin complex formation and nuclear translocation. Upon chemical injury to the intestine, mice deficient in RAB11A were found to have reduced epithelial integrity, decreased YAP localization to adherens and tight junctions, and increased nuclear YAP accumulation in the colon epithelium. Thus, RAB11A-regulated trafficking regulates the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway for rapid reparative response after tissue injury.

AB  - ObjectiveWe evaluated the feasibility of using the high-throughput CometChip to assess DNA damage in non-model species. Specifically, we measured UVA-induced damage in fibroblasts from five turtle and four mammalian species with diverse life histories and cancer rates.ResultsTurtles exhibited significantly higher endogenous DNA damage than mammals but showed lower UVA-induced damage after both 2-min and 5-min exposures. At 5 min, bats exhibited the most DNA damage (21.3%), followed by mice (11.3%). Elephants showed intermediate responses (Asian: 6.49%, African: 3.58%), while all turtles remained below 3%, suggesting resilience to oxidative stress. Despite the assay's ability to detect DNA damage across species, several challenges emerged. Endogenous damage varied widely both within and between species. Differences in culture requirements between turtles and mammals limited experimental standardization. Additionally, characterizing species-specific responses is challenging, as multiple cell lines per species are often unavailable for non-model organisms, making it difficult to account for intraspecific variation. Addressing these limitations will be crucial for conducting robust comparative studies of DNA damage responses in future research.

AB  - The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized compartment at the proximal axon, characterized by condensed localization of specific cytoskeletal proteins, including Ankyrin G (AnkG) and beta IV-spectrin which organize voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs). The location and morphology of the AIS can change in response to neuronal activity; however, the precise mechanisms for the AIS plasticity remain unclear. Previously, we demonstrated that ubiquitin E3 ligase ZNRF1 is localized to presynaptic terminals in cultured hippocampal neurons and may play a role in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Here, we show that using ZNRF1 knockout (ZNRF1 KO) mice, ZNRF1-dependent AKT degradation induces AIS shift and increased cell surface localization of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2. We also found that ZNRF1 KO mice exhibit enhanced short-term fear memory and increased contextual fear memory. These findings suggest that ZNRF1 may serve as a novel regulator of AIS localization.

AB  - Repetitive traumatic brain injury impacts adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, leading to long-term cognitive impairment. However, the mechanism underlying this neurogenesis impairment remains unknown. In this study, we established a male mouse model of repetitive traumatic brain injury and performed long-term evaluation of neurogenesis of the hippocampal dentate gyrus after repetitive traumatic brain injury. Our results showed that repetitive traumatic brain injury inhibited neural stem cell proliferation and development, delayed neuronal maturation, and reduced the complexity of neuronal dendrites and spines. Mice with repetitive traumatic brain injuryalso showed deficits in spatial memory retrieval. Moreover, following repetitive traumatic brain injury, neuroinflammation was enhanced in the neurogenesis microenvironment where C1q levels were increased, C1q binding protein levels were decreased, and canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was downregulated. An inhibitor of C1 reversed the long-term impairment of neurogenesis induced by repetitive traumatic brain injury and improved neurological function. These findings suggest that repetitive traumatic brain injury-induced C1-related inflammation impairs long-term neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and contributes to spatial memory retrieval dysfunction.

TI  - Hypothermia Treatment After Hypoxia-Ischemia in Glutathione Peroxidase-1 Overexpressing Mice

KW  - THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA

KW  - INJURY
KW  - MODELS
AB  - The developing brain is uniquely susceptible to oxidative stress and endogenous antioxidant mechanisms are not sufficient to prevent injury from a hypoxic-ischemic challenge. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) activity reduces hypoxic-ischemic injury. Therapeutic hypothermia also reduces hypoxic-ischemic injury, in the rodent and the human brain, but the benefit is limited. Here, we combined GPX1 overexpression with hypothermia in a P9 mouse model of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) to test the effectiveness of both treatments together. Histological analysis showed that WT mice with hypothermia were less injured than WT with normothermia. In the GPX1-tg mice, however, despite a lower median score in the hypothermia treated mice, there was no significant difference between hypothermia and normothermia. GPX1 protein expression was higher in the cortex of all transgenic groups at 30 min and 24 h, as well as in WT 30 min after HI, with and without hypothermia. GPX1 was higher in the hippocampus of all transgenic groups and WT with HI and normothermia, at 24 h, but not at 30 min. Spectrin 150 was higher in all groups with HI, while spectrin 120 was higher in HI groups only at 24 h. There was reduced ERK1/2 activation in both WT and GPX1-tg HI at 30 min. Thus, with a relatively moderate insult we see a benefit with cooling in the WT, but not the GPX1-tg mouse brain. The fact that we see no benefit with increased GPx1 here in the P9 model (unlike in the P7 model), may indicate that oxidative stress in these older mice is elevated to an extent that increased GPx1 is insufficient for reducing injury. The lack of benefit of overexpressing GPX1 in conjunction with hypothermia after HI indicates that pathways triggered by GPX1 overexpression may interfere with the neuroprotective mechanisms provided by HT.

AB  - The development and inclusion of novel oils derived from genetically modified (GM) oilseeds into aquafeeds, to supplement and supplant current terrestrial oilseeds, as well as fish oils, warrants a more thorough investigation into lipid biochemical alterations within finfish species, such as Atlantic salmon. Five tissues were examined across two harvesting timepoints to establish whether lipid isomeric alterations could be detected between a standard commercial diet versus a diet that incorporated the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), derived from the GM oilseed Camelina sativa. Tissue-dependent trends were detected, indicating that certain organs, such as the brain, have a basal limit to LC-PUFA incorporation, though enrichment of these fatty acids is possible. Lipid acyl alterations, as well as putative stereospecific numbering (sn) isomer alterations, were also detected, providing evidence that GM oils may modify lipid structure, with lipids of interest providing a set of targeted markers by which lipid alterations can be monitored across various novel diets.

AB  - We use a non-invasive MRI proxy of neurovascular function (pnvf) to assess the ability of the vasculature to supply baseline metabolic demand, to compare pediatric and young adult congenital heart disease (CHD) patients to normal referents and relate the proxy to neurocognitive outcomes and nitric oxide bioavailability. In a prospective single-center study, resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI scans were successfully obtained from 24 CHD patients (age = 15.4 +/- 4.06 years) and 63 normal referents (age = 14.1 +/- 3.49) years. Pnvf was computed on a voxelwise basis as the negative of the ratio of functional connectivity strength (FCS) estimated from the resting-state BOLD acquisition to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as estimated from the ASL acquisition. Pnvf was used to predict end-tidal CO2 (P(ET)CO2) levels and compared to those estimated from the BOLD data. Nitric oxide availability was obtained via nasal measurements (nNO). Pnvf was compared on a voxelwise basis between CHD patients and normal referents and correlated with nitric oxide availability and neurocognitive outcomes as assessed via the NIH Toolbox. Pnvf was shown as highly predictive of P(ET)CO2 using theoretical modeling. Pnvf was found to be significantly reduced in CHD patients in default mode network (DMN, comprising the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate/precuneus), salience network (SN, comprising the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate), and central executive network (CEN, comprising posterior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) regions with similar findings noted in single cardiac ventricle patients. Positive correlations of Pnvf in these brain regions, as well as the hippocampus, were found with neurocognitive outcomes. Similarly, positive correlations between Pnvf and nitric oxide availability were found in frontal DMN and CEN regions, with particularly strong correlations in subcortical regions (putamen). Reduced Pnvf in CHD patients was found to be mediated by nNO. Mediation analyses further supported that reduced Pnvf in these regions underlies worse neurocognitive outcome in CHD patients and is associated with nitric oxide bioavailability. Impaired neuro-vascular function, which may be non-invasively estimated via combined arterial-spin label and BOLD MR imaging, is a nitric oxide bioavailability dependent factor implicated in adverse neurocognitive outcomes in pediatric and young adult CHD.

AB  - The human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans is a frequent cause of mucosal infections. Although the ability to transition from the yeast to the hypha morphology is essential for virulence, hypha formation and host cell invasion per se are not sufficient for the induction of epithelial damage. Rather, the hypha-associated peptide toxin, candidalysin, a product of the Ece1 polyprotein, is the critical damaging factor. While synthetic, exogenously added candidalysin is sufficient to damage epithelial cells, the level of damage does not reach the same level as invading C. albicans hyphae. Therefore, we hypothesized that a combination of fungal attributes is required to deliver candidalysin to the invasion pocket to enable the full damaging potential of C. albicans during infection. Utilising a panel of C. albicans mutants with known virulence defects, we demonstrate that the full damage potential of C. albicans requires the coordinated delivery of candidalysin to the invasion pocket. This process requires appropriate epithelial adhesion, hyphal extension and invasion, high levels of ECE1 transcription, proper Ece1 processing and secretion of candidalysin. To confirm candidalysin delivery, we generated camelid V(H)Hs (nanobodies) specific for candidalysin and demonstrate localization and accumulation of the toxin only in C. albicans-induced invasion pockets. In summary, a defined combination of virulence attributes and cellular processes is critical for delivering candidalysin to the invasion pocket to enable the full damage potential of C. albicans during mucosal infection. Take Aways Candidalysin is a peptide toxin secreted by C. albicans causing epithelial damage. Candidalysin delivery to host cell membranes requires specific fungal attributes. Candidalysin accumulates in invasion pockets created by invasive hyphae. Camelid nanobodies enabled visualisation of candidalysin in the invasion pocket.

AB  - Neuronal Ca2+ signals are fundamental for synaptic transmission and activity-dependent changes in gene expression. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors play major roles in mediating external Ca2+ entry during action potential firing and glutamatergic activity. Additionally, the inositol-1,4,5trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) also contribute to the generation of Ca2+ signals in response to neuronal activity. The ER forms a network that pervades the entire neuronal volume, allowing intracellular Ca2+ release in dendrites, soma and presynaptic boutons. Despite its unique morphological features, the contributions of ER structure and of ERshaping proteins such as atlastin - an ER enriched GTPase that mediates homotypic ER tubule fusion - to the generation of Ca2+ signals in dendrites remains unreported. Here, we investigated the contribution of RyRmediated Ca2+ release to IP3-generated Ca2+ signals in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons. We also employed GTPase activity-deficient atlastin-2 (ATL2) mutants to evaluate the potential role of atlastin on Ca2+ signaling and ER-resident Ca2+ channel distribution. We found that pharmacological suppression of RyR channel activity increased the rising time and reduced the magnitude and propagation of IP3-induced Ca2+ signals. Additionally, ATL2 mutants induced specific ER morphological alterations, delayed the onset and increased the rising time of IP3-evoked Ca2+ signals, and caused RyR2 and IP3R1 aggregation and RyR2 redistribution. These results indicate that both RyR and ATL2 activity regulate IP3-induced Ca2+ signal dynamics through RyRmediated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, ER shaping and RyR2 distribution.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) encompasses brain injuries resulting from dysregulated oxygen or blood flow to the brain before, during, or immediately after birth. During the acute phase, neuronal damage is driven by excitotoxicity, with permanent injury manifesting over the subsequent hours. Treatment options have limited efficacy, requiring deeper insights into HIE pathogenesis. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled molecular investigations of diverse diseases. However, the large size of certain cells, such as neurons, has posed challenges in studying conditions where neuronal damage is central. Thus, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to evaluate damages in a mouse model of HIE and found pronounced changes in the hippocampus with significantly reduced neuronal populations. We observed the characteristic activation of hippocampal microglia, confirmed by immunostaining in the HIE model. These alterations were specific to combined hypoxic-ischemic conditions and were not observed with hypoxia or ischemia alone. These findings provide insights into the molecular and anatomical impact of HIE and highlight the hippocampus as a critical focus for understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic development.

AB  - The flower is the reproductive organ of the tea plant, while it is also processed into different kinds of products and thus of great significance to be utilized. In this study, the non-volatile secondary metabolites in the internal and external petals of white, white and pink, and pink tea flowers were studied using a widely targeted metabolomics method with ultra-high liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A total of 429 metabolites were identified, including 195 flavonoids, 121 phenolic acids, 40 alkaloids, 29 lignans and coumarins, 19 tannins, 17 terpenoids, and 8 other metabolites. The metabolites in the internal and external petals of different colored flowers showed great changes in flavonoids. Most flavonoids and all tannins in the internal petals were higher compared with the external petals. Some phenolic acids were more accumulated in the external petals, while others showed opposite trends. The pink tea flower contained more flavonoids, alkaloids, lignans, coumarins, terpenoids, and tannins compared with white tea flowers. In addition, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was more accumulated in the external petals of the pink flower, indicating that anthocyanin may be the main reason for the color difference between the pink and white tea flower. The enriched metabolic pathways of different colored flowers were involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. The findings of this study broaden the current understanding of non-volatile compound changes in tea plants. It is also helpful to lay a theoretical foundation for integrated applications of tea flowers.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a major component of the Hippo pathway involved in development, growth, repair and homeostasis. Nonsense YAP1 mutations in humans result in autosomal dominant coloboma. Here, we generated a conditional knockout mouse model in which Yap1 was specifically deleted in embryonic retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and in mature Muller cells using a Chx10-Cre driver. Our data demonstrated that the conditional ablation of Yap1 in embryonic RPCs does not prevent normal retinal development and caused no gross changes in retinal structure during embryonic and early postnatal life. Nevertheless, Yap1 deficient in retinal Muller cells in adult mice leads to impaired visual responses and extensive late-onset retinal degeneration, characterized by reduced cell number in all retinal layers. Immunofluorescence data further revealed the degeneration and death of rod and cone photoreceptors, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells and ganglion cells to varying degrees in aged knockout mice. Moreover, alteration of glial homeostasis and reactive gliosis were also observed. Finally, cell proliferation and TUNEL assay revealed that the broad retinal degeneration is mainly caused by enhanced apoptosis in late period. Together, this work uncovers that YAP is essential for the normal vision and retinal maintenance, highlighting the crucial role of YAP in retinal function and homeostasis.

AB  - The human amygdala is involved in processing of memory, decision-making, and emotional responses. Previous studies suggested that the amygdala may represent a neurogenic niche in mammals. By combining two distinct methodological approaches, lipofuscin quantification and C-14-based retrospective birth dating of neurons, along with mathematical modelling, we here explored whether postnatal neurogenesis exists in the human amygdala. We investigated post-mortem samples of twelve neurologically healthy subjects. The average rate of lipofuscin-negative neurons was 3.4%, representing a substantial proportion of cells substantially younger than the individual. Mass spectrometry analysis of genomic C-14-concentrations in amygdala neurons compared with atmospheric C-14-levels provided evidence for postnatal neuronal exchange. Mathematical modelling identified a best-fitting scenario comprising of a quiescent and a renewing neuronal population with an overall renewal rate of >2.7% per year. In conclusion, we provide evidence for postnatal neurogenesis in the human amygdala with cell turnover rates comparable to the hippocampus.
   Lipofuscin labeling and (14) C retrospective birth-dating of neurons, along with mathematical modelling, here suggest continued postnatal neurogenesis in the human amygdala, rather than protracted maturation of developmentally generated neurons.

AB  - Thyroid cancer (TC) is one of the widely diagnosed carcinomas in women before the age of 30. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of specific biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of TC. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were important regulators in human cancer progression as previously described. Unfortunately, there is little known on these lncRNAs' functions and molecular mechanisms in TC. In our literature, we found that LOC554202 (MIR31HG) was upregulated in TC samples and correlated with clinicopathological features, including M stage, N stage, and lymph nodes examined status in TC. In addition, we found that LOC554202 overexpression was evidently correlated with high immune infiltrate levels of CD8+ T cells, macrophage, neutrophil, myeloid dendritic cells, and B cells in TC. Knockdown of LOC554202 impeded TC cell proliferation and cycle progression. We found that LOC554202 had an association with metabolic pathways, vesicle-mediated transport, tricarboxylic acid cycle, Hedgehog signaling pathway, and Hippo signaling pathway in TC. Reducing LOC554202 hindered TC cell proliferation and cycle progression. Finally, we found that LOC554202 participated in modulating the expression of the regulators of Hippo signaling and TCA pathway, such as CCND2, CCND3, SDHC, SDHD, SUCLA2, and SUCLG1. We thought that this study would largely enhance our understanding of LOC554202's functional roles in human TC progression and immune response.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a polygenic severe mental illness. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have detected genomic variants associated with this psychiatric disorder and pathway analyses have indicated immune system and dopamine signaling as core components of risk in dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus, but the mechanistic links remain unknown. The RasGRP1 gene, encoding for a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is implicated in dopamine signaling and immune response. RasGRP1 has been identified as a candidate risk gene for SCZ and autoimmune disease, therefore representing a possible point of convergence between mechanisms involving the nervous and the immune system. Here, we investigated RasGRP1 mRNA and protein expression in post-mortem DLPFC and hippocampus of SCZ patients and healthy controls, along with RasGRP1 protein content in the serum of an independent cohort of SCZ patients and control subjects. Differences in RasGRP1 expression between SCZ patients and controls were detected both in DLPFC and peripheral blood of samples analyzed. Our results indicate RasGRP1 may mediate risk for SCZ by involving DLPFC and peripheral blood, thus encouraging further studies to explore its possible role as a biomarker of the disease and/or a target for new medication.

AB  - RTP801/REDD1 is a stress-responsive protein overexpressed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that contributes to cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation. Here, we found that RTP801 interacts with HSPC117, DDX1 and CGI-99, three members of the tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC), which ligates the excised exons of intron-containing tRNAs and the mRNA exons of the transcription factor XBP1 during the unfolded protein response (UPR). We also found that RTP801 modulates the mRNA ligase activity of the complex in vitro since RTP801 knockdown promoted XBP1 splicing and the expression of its transcriptional target, SEC24D. Conversely, RTP801 overexpression inhibited the splicing of XBP1. Similarly, in human AD postmortem hippocampal samples, where RTP801 is upregulated, we found that XBP1 splicing was dramatically decreased. In the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, silencing RTP801 expression in hippocampal neurons promoted Xbp1 splicing and prevented the accumulation of intron-containing pre-tRNAs. Finally, the tRNA-enriched fraction obtained from 5xFAD mice promoted abnormal dendritic arborization in cultured hippocampal neurons, and RTP801 silencing in the source neurons prevented this phenotype. Altogether, these results show that elevated RTP801 impairs RNA processing in vitro and in vivo in the context of AD and suggest that RTP801 inhibition could be a promising therapeutic approach.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by local inflammation of the upper airway and sinus mucosa. T cell-mediated immune responses play irreplaceable roles in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps. CD161+ T cells have been implicated in the pathology of several diseases through cytokine production and cytotoxic activity. However, the immunological characteristics of CD161+ T cells in nasal mucosa are still not well understood, particularly in CRSwNPs. Our research revealed a notable enrichment of CD161+ T cells in nasal tissues compared to peripheral blood, with a significantly more infiltration of CD161+ T cells in CRSwNPs compared to control nasal samples. Phenotypical analysis found that CD161+ T cells predominantly co-expressed tissue-resident memory surface markers CD103, CD69, and CD45RO. CD161+CD103+ T cells demonstrated complicated effector functions, marked by elevated levels of PD-1, CTLA-4, IL-17, and IFN-gamma and diminished expression of FoxP3 and CD25. Interestingly, despite CD161+ T cells was more abundant in polyp tissues compared to normal control tissues, and then further categorizing polyp samples into distinct groups based on clinical characteristics, only the recurrent CRSwNP group showed a significant reduction in CD161+CD8+ T cells compared to the primary CRSwNP group. This finding suggested the necessity for further research to comprehensively understand the underlying mechanisms and the broader significance of CD161+ T cells in the advancement and relapse of CRSwNPs.

AB  - BackgroundGlycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD Ia) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a defect in glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC1) activity, which induces severe hepatomegaly and increases the risk for liver cancer. Hepatic GSD Ia is characterized by constitutive activation of Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (ChREBP), a glucose-sensitive transcription factor. Previously, we showed that ChREBP activation limits non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in hepatic GSD Ia. As ChREBP has been proposed as a pro-oncogenic molecular switch that supports tumour progression, we hypothesized that ChREBP normalization protects against liver disease progression in hepatic GSD Ia.MethodsHepatocyte-specific G6pc knockout (L-G6pc(-/-)) mice were treated with AAV-shChREBP to normalize hepatic ChREBP activity.ResultsHepatic ChREBP normalization in GSD Ia mice induced dysplastic liver growth, massively increased hepatocyte size, and was associated with increased hepatic inflammation. Furthermore, nuclear levels of the oncoprotein Yes Associated Protein (YAP) were increased and its transcriptional targets were induced in ChREBP-normalized GSD Ia mice. Hepatic ChREBP normalization furthermore induced DNA damage and mitotic activity in GSD Ia mice, while gene signatures of chromosomal instability, the cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING pathway, senescence, and hepatocyte dedifferentiation emerged.ConclusionsIn conclusion, our findings indicate that ChREBP activity limits hepatomegaly while decelerating liver disease progression and protecting against chromosomal instability in hepatic GSD Ia. These results disqualify ChREBP as a therapeutic target for treatment of liver disease in GSD Ia. In addition, they underline the importance of establishing the context-specific roles of hepatic ChREBP to define its therapeutic potential to prevent or treat advanced liver disease.

AB  - Cytoskeletal microtubule rearrangement and movement are crucial in the repair of spinal cord injury. Spastin plays an important role in the regulation of microtubule severing. Both spastin and collapsin response mediator proteins can regulate neurite growth and branching; however, whether spastin interacts with collapsin response mediator protein 3 (CRMP3) during this process remains unclear, as is the mechanism by which CRMP3 participates in the repair of spinal cord injury. In this study, we used a proteomics approach to identify key proteins associated with spinal cord injury repair. We then employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify proteins that were able to interact with glutathione S-transferase-spastin. Then, co-immunoprecipitation and staining approaches were used to evaluate potential interactions between spastin and CRMP3. Finally, we co-transfected primary hippocampal neurons with CRMP3 and spastin to evaluate their role in neurite outgrowth. Mass spectrometry identified the role of CRMP3 in the spinal cord injury repair process. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry pulldown assays identified three CRMP3 peptides that were able to interact with spastin. CRMP3 and spastin were co-expressed in the spinal cord and were able to interact with one another in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, CRMP3 overexpression was able to enhance the ability of spastin to promote neurite growth and branching. Therefore, our results confirm that spastin and CRMP3 play roles in spinal cord injury repair by regulating neurite growth and branching. These proteins may therefore be novel targets for spinal cord injury repair. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jinan University, China approved this study (approval No. IACUS-20181008-03) on October 8, 2018.

AB  - RNA methyltransferase NSUN2 is involved in cell proliferation and invasion in a variety of tumors. However, the expression, function, and mechanism of NSUN2 in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) remains unknown. We used a bioinformatics database, polymerase chain reaction, cell culture and transfection, immunohistochemistry, cell proliferation assay, wound healing experiments, transwell assays, western blotting, RNAseq detection, dual-luciferase reporter assay, in vivo experiments, and a dot blot assay to evaluate the role of NSUN2 in HPSCC. NSUN2 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in HPSCC; NSUN2 knockdown in vitro and in vivo decreased cell proliferation and invasion. Studies have shown that TEAD1, a transcription factor, may act downstream of NSUN2 in HPSCC. NSUN2 was found to promote the proliferation and invasion of HPSCC by upregulating TEAD1 in an 5-methylcytosine-dependent manner, thereby representing an oncogene and potential new target for treating HPSCC.

AB  - The deubiquitinating enzyme USP46 (ubiquitin-specific protease 46) is implicated in various cancers. However, its role and regulatory mechanism in HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) are still unknown. In this study, we showed that USP46 is downregulated in HCC tissues and that low USP46 levels are associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In functional experiments, overexpression of USP46 impaired proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells, whereas knockdown of USP46 enhanced cell proliferation and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that USP46 suppresses HCC cell proliferation and metastasis by inhibiting YAP1. Ectopic expression of YAP1 rescued the inhibition of cell proliferation and metastasis caused by USP46 overexpression. Mechanistically, USP46 promotes the degradation of YAP1 by increasing expression of MST1, and the increase in MST1 protein antagonizes YAP1 to suppress HCC progression. Finally, we demonstrated that USP46 stabilizes the MST1 protein by directly binding to it and decreasing its ubiquitination. Taken together, our results demonstrated that USP46 may be a novel tumor suppressor in HCC. Moreover, USP46 acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme of MST1 to potentiate MST1 kinase activity to suppress tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that USP46 activation may represent a potential treatment strategy for HCC.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for resolving cellular states associated with normal and maligned developmental processes. Here, we used scRNA-seq to examine the cell cycle states of expanding human neural stem cells (hNSCs). From these data, we constructed a cell cycle classifier that identifies traditional cell cycle phases and a putative quiescent-like state in neuroepithelial-derived cell types during mammalian neurogenesis and in gliomas. The Neural G0 markers are enriched with quiescent NSC genes and other neurodevelopmental markers found in non-dividing neural progenitors. Putative glioblastoma stem-like cells were significantly enriched in the Neural G0 cell population. Neural G0 cell populations and gene expression are significantly associated with less aggressive tumors and extended patient survival for gliomas. Genetic screens to identify modulators of Neural G0 revealed that knockout of genes associated with the Hippo/Yap and p53 pathways diminished Neural G0 in vitro, resulting in faster G1 transit, down-regulation of quiescence-associated markers, and loss of Neural G0 gene expression. Thus, Neural G0 represents a dynamic quiescent-like state found in neuroepithelial-derived cells and gliomas.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) can generate a number of neurological dysfunctions in infected humans. Here, we tested the potential of human immune cells to protect against ZIKV infection in genetically humanized MISTRG mice. FACS analysis showed robust reconstitution of the mouse spleen with human T cells. Peripheral ZIKV inoculation resulted in infection within the brains of MISTRG mice. Mice that were reconstituted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) showed a more rapid lethal response to ZIKV than the control mice lacking these immune cells. Immunocytochemical analysis of T cell markers CD3, CD45, or CD8 showed strong T cell presence in the brain, together with robust infection by ZIKV particularly in the excitatory pyramidal and granule neurons of the hippocampus. Infection was also found in cortex, striatum, the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra, and other brain loci. Infection was considerably less in other regions such as the septum and hypothalamus. These data support the perspective that, rather than exerting a protective function, T cells may underlie some ZIKV-mediated neuropathology in the brain.

AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi are an important factor in the natural regulation of arthropod populations. Moreover, some can exist as an endophyte in many plant species and establish a mutualistic relationship. In this study, we have investigated the endophytic growth of Beauveriabassiana within different tissues of Phaseolusvulgaris in the presence and absence of Tetranuychusurticae. After the colonization of the B.bassiana within the internal tissues of P.vulgaris. The susceptibility of T.urticae appeared to depend on the life stage where high, moderate, and low mortalities were recorded among adults, nymphs, and eggs, respectively. In addition, this study provided, for the first time, molecular insight into the endophytic growth of B. bassiana by analyzing the expression of several genes involved in the development of the entomopathogenic fungi at 0-, 2-, and 7- days post-inoculation. B.bassiana displayed preferential tissue colonization within P.vulgaris that can be put into the following order based on the detection rate: leaf > stem > root. After analyzing the development-implicated genes (degrading enzymes, sugar transporter, hydrophobins, cell wall synthesis, secondary metabolites, stress management), the most remarkable finding is the detection of behavioral change between parasitic and endophytic Beauveria during post-penetration events. This study elucidates the tri-trophic interaction between fungus-plant-herbivore.

KW  - 3D surface reconstruction
KW  - Graph convolutional neural network
KW  - Topology modification
KW  - End-to-end framework
AB  - Traditional computed tomography (CT) methods for 3D reconstruction face resolution limitations and require time-consuming post-processing workflows. While deep learning techniques improve the accuracy of segmentation, traditional voxel-based segmentation and surface reconstruction pipelines tend to introduce artifacts such as disconnected regions, topological inconsistencies, and stepped distortions. To overcome these challenges, we propose ToPoMesh, an end-to-end 3D mesh reconstruction deep learning framework for direct reconstruction of high-fidelity surface meshes from CT volume data. To address the existing problems, our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) accurate local and global shape modeling by preserving and enhancing local feature information through residual connectivity and self-attention mechanisms in graph convolutional networks; (2) an adaptive variant density (Avd) mesh de-pooling strategy, which dynamically optimizes the vertex distribution; (3) a topology modification module that iteratively prunes the error surfaces and boundary smoothing via variable regularity terms to obtain finer mesh surfaces. Experiments on the LiTS, MSD pancreas tumor, MSD hippocampus, and MSD spleen datasets demonstrate that ToPoMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate a 57.4% reduction in Chamfer distance (liver) and a 0.47% improvement in F-score compared to end-to-end 3D reconstruction methods, while qualitative results confirm enhanced fidelity for thin structures and complex anatomical topologies versus segmentation frameworks. Importantly, our method eliminates the need for manual post-processing, realizes the ability to reconstruct 3D meshes from images, and can provide precise guidance for surgical planning and diagnosis.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is one of the major causative agents of hospital-acquired infections worldwide. Novel antimicrobial strategies efficient against antibiotic-resistant strains are necessary and not only against S. aureus. Among those, strategies that aim at blocking or dismantling proteins involved in the acquisition of essential nutrients, helping the bacteria to colonize the host, are intensively studied. A major route for S. aureus to acquire iron from the host organism is the Isd (iron surface determinant) system. In particular, the hemoglobin receptors IsdH and IsdB located on the surface of the bacterium are necessary to acquire the heme moiety containing iron, making them a plausible antibacterial target. Herein, we obtained an antibody of camelid origin that blocked heme acquisition. We determined that the antibody recognized the heme-binding pocket of both IsdH and IsdB with nanomolar order affinity through its second and third complementary-determining regions. The mechanism explaining the inhibition of acquisition of heme in vitro could be described as a competitive process in which the complementary-determining region 3 from the antibody blocked the acquisition of heme by the bacterial receptor. Moreover, this antibody markedly reduced the growth of three different pathogenic strains of MRSA. Collectively, our results highlight a mechanism for inhibiting nutrient uptake as an antibacterial strategy against MRSA.

AB  - The structurally-unique histone variant, mH2A1, influences learning and memory in mice to a greater extent than a similar variant, mH2A2.
   Histone variants H2A.Z and H3.3 are epigenetic regulators of memory, but roles of other variants are not well characterized. macroH2A (mH2A) is a structurally unique histone that contains a globular macrodomain connected to the histone region by an unstructured linker. Here we assessed if mH2A regulates memory and if this role varies for the two mH2A-encoding genes, H2afy (mH2A1) and H2afy2 (mH2A2). We show that fear memory is impaired in mH2A1, but not in mH2A2-deficient mice, whereas both groups were impaired in a non-aversive spatial memory task. However, impairment was larger for mH2A1- deficient mice, indicating a preferential role for mH2A1 over mH2A2 in memory. Accordingly, mH2A1 depletion in the mouse hippocampus resulted in more extensive transcriptional de-repression compared to mH2A2 depletion. mH2A1-depleted mice failed to induce a normal transcriptional response to fear conditioning, suggesting that mH2A1 depletion impairs memory by altering transcription. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing, we found that both mH2A proteins are enriched on transcriptionally repressed genes, but only mH2A1 occupancy was dynamically modified during learning, displaying reduced occupancy on upregulated genes after training. These data identify mH2A as a regulator of memory and suggest that mH2A1 supports memory by repressing spurious transcription and promoting learning-induced transcriptional activation.

AB  - Hypobaric hypoxia at higher altitudes usually impairs cognitive function. Previous studies suggested that epigenetic modifications are the culprits for this condition. Here, we set out to determine how hypobaric hypoxia mediates epigenetic modifications and how this condition worsens neurodegeneration and memory loss in rats. In the current study, different duration of hypobaric hypoxia exposure showed a discrete pattern of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) gene expression in the hippocampus when compared with control rat brains. The level of acetylation sites in histone H2A, H3 and H4 was significantly decreased under hypobaric hypoxia exposure compared to the control rat's hippocampus. Additionally, inhibiting the HDAC family with sodium butyrate administration (1.2 g/kg body weight) attenuated neurodegeneration and memory loss in hypobaric hypoxia-exposed rats. Moreover, histone acetylation increased at the promoter regions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); thereby its protein expression was enhanced significantly in hypobaric hypoxia exposed rats treated with HDAC inhibitor compared with hypoxic rats. Thus, BDNF expression upregulated cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation by stimulation of PI3K/GSK3 beta/CREB axis, which counteracts hypobaric hypoxia-induced spatial memory impairment. In conclusion, these results suggested that sodium butyrate is a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of spatial memory loss associated with hypobaric hypoxia, and also further studies are warranted to explore specific HDAC inhibitors in this condition.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the fastest-growing neurodevelopmental disease throughout the world. Neuro-immune responses from prenatal to adulthood stages of life induce developmental defects in synaptic signaling, neurotransmitter imbalance, and even structural changes in the brain. In this study, we aimed to focus on the possible role of neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus in development of the autistic-like behaviors following maternal separation (MS) stress in mice. To do this, mice neonates daily separated from their mothers from postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND 14 for 3 h. During PND45-60, behavioral tests related to autistic-like behaviors including three-chamber sociability, Morris water maze (MWM), shuttle box, resident-intruder, and marble burying tests were performed. Then, hippocampi were dissected out, and the gene expression of inflammatory mediators including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, TLR4, HMGB1, and NLRP3 was assessed in the hippocampus using RT-PCR. Results showed that MS mice exerted impaired sociability preference, repetitive behaviors, impaired passive avoidance, and spatial memories. The gene expression of inflammatory mediators significantly increased in the hippocampi of MS mice. We concluded that MS stress probably via activating of the HMGB1/TLR4 signaling cascade in the hippocampus induced autistic-like behaviors in mice.
   Maternal separation (MS), in part at least, through activation of the HMGB1/TLR4 signaling cascade in the hippocampus provokes autistic-like behaviors in mice as impaired sociability preference, repetitive behaviors as well as impaired passive avoidance and spatial memories.

AB  - A role of Yes1-associated transcriptional regulator (YAP) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (TAZ) in vascular and gastrointestinal contractility due to control of myocardin (Myocd) expression, which in turn activates contractile genes, has been demonstrated. Whether this transcriptional hierarchy applies to the urinary bladder is unclear. We found that YAP/TAZ are expressed in human detrusor myocytes and therefore exploited the Itga8-CreER(T2) model for the deletion of YAP/TAZ. Recombination occurred in detrusor, and YAP/TAZ transcripts were reduced by >75%. Bladder weights were increased (by approximate to 22%), but histology demonstrated minimal changes in the detrusor, while arteries in the mucosa were inflamed. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) using the detrusor demonstrated reductions of Myocd (-79 +/- 18%) and serum response factor (Srf) along with contractile genes. In addition, the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 2 (Chrm2) and Chrm3 were suppressed (-80 +/- 23% and -80 +/- 10%), whereas minute increases of Il1b and Il6 were seen. Unlike YAP/TAZ-deficient arteries, SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 (Sox9) did not increase, and no chondrogenic differentiation was apparent. Reductions of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11 (Myh11), myosin light-chain kinase gene (Mylk), and Chrm3 were seen at the protein level. Beyond restraining the smooth muscle cell (SMC) program of gene expression, YAP/TAZ depletion silenced SMC-specific splicing, including exon 2a of Myocd. Reduced contractile differentiation was associated with weaker contraction in response to myosin phosphatase inhibition (-36%) and muscarinic activation (reduced by 53% at 0.3 mu M carbachol). Finally, short-term overexpression of constitutively active YAP in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells increased myocardin (greater than eightfold) along with archetypal target genes, but contractile genes were unaffected or reduced. YAP and TAZ thus regulate myocardin expression in the detrusor, and this is important for SMC differentiation and splicing as well as for contractility.

AB  - The seahorse is a marine teleost fish member of the Syngnathidae family that displays a complex variety of morphological and reproductive behavior innovations and has been recognized for its medicinal importance. In the Brazilian ichthyofauna, the seahorse Hippocampus reidi is among the three fish species most used by the population in traditional medicine. In this study, a protocol was performed based on fast heat inactivation of proteases plus liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to identify native peptides in gills of seahorse H. reidi. The MS/MS spectra obtained from gills allowed the identification of 1080 peptides, of which 1013 peptides were present in all samples and 67 peptide sequences were identified in an additional LC-MS/MS run from an alkylated and reduced pool of samples. The majority of peptides were fragments of the internal region of the amino acid sequence of the precursor proteins (67%), and N- and C-terminal represented 18% and 15%, respectively. Many peptide sequences presented ribosomal proteins, histones and hemoglobin as precursor proteins. In addition, peptide fragments from moronecidin-like protein, described with antimicrobial activity, were found in all gill samples of H. reidi. The identified sequences may reveal new bioactive peptides.

AB  - The aim of our study is to reveal the hub genes related to the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and their association with immune cell infiltration through bioinformatics analysis combined with experimental validation. In this study, through differential gene expression analysis, 1,516 upregulated and 1,307 downregulated DEG were obtained from dataset GSE136825 of the GEO database. We identified 14 co-expressed modules using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), among which the most significant positive and negative correlations were MEgreen and MEturquoise modules, containing 1,540 and 3,710 genes respectively. After the intersection of the two modules and DEG, two gene sets-DEG-MEgreen and DEG-MEturquoise-were obtained, containing 395 and 1,168 genes respectively. Through GO term analysis, it was found that immune response and signal transduction are the most important biological processes. We found, based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, that osteoclast differentiations, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions are the most important in the two gene sets. Through PPI network analysis, we listed the top-ten genes for the concentrated connectivity of the two gene sets. Next, a few genes were verified by qPCR experiments, and FPR2, ITGAM, C3AR1, FCER1G, CYBB in DEG-MEgreen and GNG4, NMUR2, and GNG7 in DEG-MEturquoise were confirmed to be related to the pathogenesis of CRSwNP. NP immune cell infiltration analysis revealed a significant difference in the proportion of immune cells between the NP group and control group. Finally, correlation analysis between target hub genes and immune cells indicated that FPR2 and GNG7 had a positive or negative correlation with some specific immune cells. In summary, the discoveries of these new hub genes and their association with immune cell infiltration are of great significance for uncovering the specific pathogenesis of CRSwNP and searching for disease biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Breast cancer is one of the well-known non-cutaneous cancers among women worldwide. In the present study, we have characterized the anti-cancer activity of Moronecidin-like peptide derived from the Hippocampus comes in comparison with a well-known antimicrobial peptide (AMP), Piscidin. Evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of the peptides against 4T1 cancer cells and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) using MTT assay and flow cytometry demonstrated a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of Moronecidin-like and Piscidin peptides on the viability of 4T1 cells. Among AMPs, Piscidin indicated greater cytotoxicity than Moronecidin-like against 4T1 and BMDCs. Flow cytometry data demonstrated that AMPs induced (particularly Moronecidin-like) higher level of CCR7 and CD86 compared to Non-AMP. Furthermore, the findings demonstrated an inverse relationship between the cytotoxic activity of AMPs against BMDCs and the expression of activation markers (CCR7 and CD86) on BMDCs. Measuring of IFN-gamma CD8 double-positive T-cells response demonstrated a higher frequency of IFN-gamma CD8 double-positive T-cells in mice receiving Moronecidin-like compared to those receiving Piscidin. The tumor volumes and percent survival was determined in mice bearing 4T1 orthotopic breast cancer. A significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in mice receiving AMPs (particularly Moronecidin-like) compared to those receiving PBS. Furthermore, higher percent survival was observed in mice receiving Moronecidin-like compared to the other groups. The current study suggested synthetic Moronecidin-like as an efficacious dual-functional agent that possess direct (through inducing apoptosis) and indirect (priming anticancer immune response) anticancer activity against breast cancer in mice.

TI  - Multimodal communication and audience directedness in the greeting behaviour of semi-captive African savannah elephants
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY

AB  - Many species communicate by combining signals into multimodal combinations. Elephants live in multi-level societies where individuals regularly separate and reunite. Upon reunion, elephants often engage in elaborate greeting rituals, where they use vocalisations and body acts produced with different body parts and of various sensory modalities (e.g., audible, tactile). However, whether these body acts represent communicative gestures and whether elephants combine vocalisations and gestures during greeting is still unknown. Here we use separation-reunion events to explore the greeting behaviour of semi-captive elephants (Loxodonta africana). We investigate whether elephants use silent-visual, audible, and tactile gestures directing them at their audience based on their state of visual attention and how they combine these gestures with vocalisations during greeting. We show that elephants select gesture modality appropriately according to their audience's visual attention, suggesting evidence of first-order intentional communicative use. We further show that elephants integrate vocalisations and gestures into different combinations and orders. The most frequent combination consists of rumble vocalisations with ear-flapping gestures, used most often between females. By showing that a species evolutionarily distant to our own primate lineage shows sensitivity to their audience's visual attention in their gesturing and combines gestures with vocalisations, our study advances our understanding of the emergence of first-order intentionality and multimodal communication across taxa.
   The article describes the greeting behaviour of elephants and provides an account of first-order intentionality and multicomponent signalling in an animal group other than primates, contributing to our understanding of social signalling in mammals.

AB  - Pleckstrin homology domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) knockout mice have improved outcomes after a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and decreased maladaptive vascular remodeling following vascular injury. Thus, small-molecule PHLPP inhibitors have the potential to improve neurological outcomes in a variety of conditions. There is a paucity of data on the efficacy of the known experimental PHLPP inhibitors, and not all may be suited for targeting acute brain injury. Here, we assessed several PHLPP inhibitors not previously explored for neuroprotection (NSC13378, NSC25247, and NSC74429) that had favorable predicted chemistries for targeting the central nervous system (CNS). Neuronal culture studies in staurosporine (apoptosis), glutamate (excitotoxicity), and hydrogen peroxide (necrosis/oxidative stress) revealed that NSC74429 at micromolar concentrations was the most neuroprotective. Subsequent testing in a rat model of asphyxial cardiac arrest, and in a mouse model of severe TBI, showed that serial dosing of 1 mg/kg of NSC74429 over 3 days improved hippocampal survival in both models. Taken together, NSC74429 is neuroprotective across multiple insult mechanisms. Future pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies are warranted to optimize dosing, and mechanistic studies are needed to determine the percentage of neuroprotection mediated by PHLPP1/2 inhibition, or potentially from the modulation of PHLPP-independent targets.

AB  - The developmental regulation of flower organs involves the spatio-temporal regulation of floral homeotic genes. BASIC PENTACYSTEINE genes are plant-specific transcription factors that is involved in many aspects of plant development through gene transcriptional regulation. Although studies have shown that the BPC genes are involved in the developmental regulation of flower organs, little is known about their role in the formation of double-flower due. Here we characterized a Class I BPC gene (CjBPC1) from an ornamental flower-Camellia japonica. We showed that CjBPC1 is highly expressed in the central whorls of flowers in both single and doubled varieties. Overexpression of CjBPC1 in Arabidopsis thaliana caused severe defects in siliques and seeds. We found that genes involved in ovule and seed development, including SEEDSTICK, LEAFY COTYLEDON2, ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 and FUSCA3, were significantly down-regulated in transgenic lines. We showed that the histone 3 lysine 27 methylation levels of these downstream genes were enhanced in the transgenic plants, indicating conserved roles of CjBPC1 in recruiting the Polycomb Repression Complex for gene suppression.

AB  - Introduction: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is an acute brain dysfunction secondary to systemic infection, occurring without direct central nervous system involvement. Despite its clinical relevance, reliable biomarkers for diagnosing SAE and assessing its severity remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI as a non-invasive molecular imaging technique for detecting metabolic alterations related to neuroinflammation in SAE. Using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat model, we focused on hippocampal changes associated with neuronal inflammation. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old, male) were divided into three groups: control (CTRL, n = 7), LPS-induced sepsis at 5 mg/kg (LPS05, n = 7), and 10 mg/kg (LPS10, n = 7). Sepsis was induced via a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS. APTw imaging was performed using a 7 T preclinical MRI system, and signal quantification in the hippocampus was conducted using the magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry analysis. Results and Discussion: APTw imaging at 7 T demonstrated significantly elevated hippocampal APTw signals in SAE model rats (LPS05 and LPS10) compared to the control (CTRL) group: CTRL (-1.940 +/- 0.207%) vs. LPS05 (-0.472 +/- 0.485%) (p < 0.001) and CTRL vs. LPS10 (-0.491 +/- 0.279%) (p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference was observed between the LPS05 and LPS10 groups (p = 0.994). These results suggest that APTw imaging can effectively detect neuroinflammation-related metabolic alterations in the hippocampus. Conclusion: Our findings support the feasibility of APTw CEST imaging as a non-invasive molecular MRI technique for SAE, with potential applications in diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic evaluation.

AB  - Myocardial infarction and reperfusion constitute a complex injury consisting of many distinct molecular stress patterns that influence cardiomyocyte survival and adaptation. Cell signalling, which is essential to cardiac development, also presents potential disease-modifying opportunities to recover and limit myocardial injury or maladaptive remodelling. Here, we hypothesized that Yap signalling could be sensitive to one or more molecular stress patterns associated with early acute ischemia. We found that Yap, and not Taz, expression patterns differed in a post-myocardial infarct compared to a peri-infarct region of rat hearts post-myocardial infarction, suggesting cell specificity that would be challenging to resolve for causation in vivo. Using H9c2 ventricular myotubes in vitro as a model, Yap levels were determined to be more sensitive to nutrient deprivation than other stress patterns typified by ischemia within the first hour of stress. Moreover, this is mediated by amino acid availability, predominantly L-isoleucine, and influences the expression of connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf)-a major determinant of myocardial adaptation after injury. These findings present novel opportunities for future therapeutic development and risk assessment for myocardial injury and adaptation.

AB  - Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (ECRSwNP) is a subtype of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) that is associated with the nasal cavity and sinus polyps, elevated levels of eosinophils, and dysregulated immune responses to environmental triggers. The underlying cause of ECRSwNP is not well understood, and few studies have focused on the unique features of this subtype of CRS. Our study integrated proteomic and transcriptomic data with multi-omic bioinformatics analyses. We collected nasal polyps from three ECRSwNP patients and three control patients and identified 360 differentially expressed (DE) proteins, including 119 upregulated and 241 downregulated proteins. Functional analyses revealed several significant associations with ECRSwNP, including focal adhesion, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions. Additionally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed seven hub proteins that may play crucial roles in the development of ECRSwNP. We also compared the proteomic data with publicly available transcriptomic data and identified a total of 1077 DE genes. Pathways enriched by the DE genes involved angiogenesis, positive regulation of cell motility, and immune responses. Furthermore, we investigated immune cell infiltration and identified biomarkers associated with eosinophil and M2 macrophage infiltration using CIBERSORT and Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA). Our results provide a more complete picture of the immune-related mechanisms underlying ECRSwNP, which could contribute to the development of more precise treatment strategies for this condition.

AB  - BackgroundWhere the gene is expressed determines the function of the gene. Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) encodes a tropic factor and is genetically linked with several neuropsychiatry diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. Nrg1 has broad functions ranging from regulating neurodevelopment to neurotransmission in the nervous system. However, the expression pattern of Nrg1 at the cellular and circuit levels in rodent brain is not full addressed.MethodsHere we used CRISPR/Cas9 techniques to generate a knockin mouse line (Nrg1(Cre/+)) that expresses a P2A-Cre cassette right before the stop codon of Nrg1 gene. Since Cre recombinase and Nrg1 are expressed in the same types of cells in Nrg1(Cre/+) mice, the Nrg1 expression pattern can be revealed through the Cre-reporting mice or adeno-associated virus (AAV) that express fluorescent proteins in a Cre-dependent way. Using unbiased stereology and fluorescence imaging, the cellular expression pattern of Nrg1 and axon projections of Nrg1-positive neurons were investigated.ResultsIn the olfactory bulb (OB), Nrg1 is expressed in GABAergic interneurons including periglomerular (PG) and granule cells. In the cerebral cortex, Nrg1 is mainly expressed in the pyramidal neurons of superficial layers that mediate intercortical communications. In the striatum, Nrg1 is highly expressed in the Drd1-positive medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the shell of nucleus accumbens (NAc) that project to substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). In the hippocampus, Nrg1 is mainly expressed in granule neurons in the dentate gyrus and pyramidal neurons in the subiculum. The Nrg1-expressing neurons in the subiculum project to retrosplenial granular cortex (RSG) and mammillary nucleus (MM). Nrg1 is highly expressed in the median eminence (ME) of hypothalamus and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.ConclusionsNrg1 is broadly expressed in mouse brain, mainly in neurons, but has unique expression patterns in different brain regions.

AB  - Background Corpora amylacea of human brain, recently renamed as wasteosomes, are granular structures that appear during aging and also accumulate in specific areas of the brain in neurodegenerative conditions. Acting as waste containers, wasteosomes are formed by polyglucosan aggregates that entrap and isolate toxic and waste substances of different origins. They are expelled from the brain to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and can be phagocytosed by macrophages. In the present study, we analyze the phagocytosis of wasteosomes and the mechanisms involved in this process. Accordingly, we purified wasteosomes from post-mortem extracted human CSF and incubated them with THP-1 macrophages. Immunofluorescence staining and time-lapse recording techniques were performed to evaluate the phagocytosis. We also immunostained human hippocampal sections to study possible interactions between wasteosomes and macrophages at central nervous system interfaces. Results We observed that the wasteosomes obtained from post-mortem extracted CSF are opsonized by MBL and the C3b complement protein. Moreover, we observed that CD206 and CD35 receptors may be involved in the phagocytosis of these wasteosomes by THP-1 macrophages. Once phagocytosed, wasteosomes become degraded and some of the resulting fractions can be exposed on the surface of macrophages and interchanged between different macrophages. However, brain tissue studies show that, in physiological conditions, CD206 but not CD35 receptors may be involved in the phagocytosis of wasteosomes. Conclusions The present study indicates that macrophages have the machinery required to process and degrade wasteosomes, and that macrophages can interact in different ways with wasteosomes. In physiological conditions, the main mechanism involve CD206 receptors and M2 macrophages, which trigger the phagocytosis of wasteosomes without inducing inflammatory responses, thus avoiding tissue damage. However, altered wasteosomes like those obtained from post-mortem extracted CSF, which may exhibit waste elements, become opsonized by MBL and C3b, and so CD35 receptors constitute another possible mechanism of phagocytosis, leading in this case to inflammatory responses.

AB  - To investigate the molecular mechanism of communication network factor 1 (CCN1) regulating pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced epileptogenesis, deepen the understanding of epilepsy seizure pathogenesis, and provide new drug action targets for its clinical prevention and treatment. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on microarrays GSE47516 and GSE88992 were analyzed online using GEO2R. Pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analysis of DEGs were carried out using Metascape. Brain tissue samples of severe traumatic brain injury patients (named Healthy group) and refractory epilepsy patients (named Epilepsy group) were obtained and analyzed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. A PTZ-induced epilepsy mouse model was established and verified. Morphological changes of neurons in mouse brain tissue were detected using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. qRT-PCR was conducted to detect the mRNA expressions of apoptosis-associated proteins Bax, Caspase-3 and bcl2. TUNEL staining was performed to detect brain neuron apoptosis. The levels of myocardial enzymology, GSH, MDA and ROS in blood of mouse were detected by biochemical assay. CCN1 expression was increased in epilepsy brain tissue samples. CCN1 decreasing effectively prolongs seizure incubation period and decreases seizure duration. Silencing of CCN1 also reduces neuronal damage and apoptosis, decreases mRNA and protein expression of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase-3, increases mRNA expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl2. Moreover, decrease of CCN1 decreases myocardial enzymatic indexes CK and CK-MB levels, reduces myocardial tissue hemorrhage, and relieves oxidative stress response in hippocampal and myocardial tissue. CCN1 expression is increased in epileptic samples. CCN1 decreasing protects brain tissue by attenuating oxidative stress and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis triggered by PTZ injection, which probably by regulating Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive deficits in an individual. Ang(1-7) exhibits neuroprotection against amyloid beta (A beta)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity in experimental conditions. Further, Ang(1-7) also exhibits nrf2-mediated antioxidant activity in experimental conditions. However, its therapeutic role on nrf2-mediated mitochondrial function is yet to be established in the A beta-induced neurotoxicity. The experimental dementia was induced in the male rats by intracerebroventricular administration of A beta((1-42)) on day-1 (D-1) of the experimental schedule of 14 days. Ang(1-7) was administered once daily from D-1 toD-14 to the A beta-challenged rodents. Ang(1-7) attenuated A beta-induced increase in escape latency and decrease in the time spent in the target quadrant during Morris water maze and percentage of spontaneous alteration behavior during Y-maze tests in the rats. Further, Ang(1-7) attenuated A beta-induced cholinergic dysfunction in terms of decrease in the level of acetylcholine and activity of choline acetyltransferase, and increase in the activity of acetylcholinesterase, and increase in the level of A beta in rat hippocampus, pre-frontal cortex and amygdala. Furthermore, Ang(1-7) reversed A beta-induced decrease in the mitochondrial function, integrity and bioenergetics in all brain regions. Additionally, Ang(1-7) attenuated A beta-induced increase in the extent of apoptosis and decrease in the level of heme oxygenase-1 in all selected brain regions. Trigonelline significantly abolished the therapeutic effectiveness of Ang(1-7) on A beta-induced alterations in the behavioral, neurochemicals and molecular observations in the animals. Ang(1-7) may exhibit nrf2-mediated neuroprotection in these rodents. Hence, Ang(1-7) could be a potential therapeutic option in the pharmacotherapy of AD.

AB  - The present study investigated metaplasticity-related mRNA expressions in valproic acid (VPA)-rats, focusing on the PI3K/AKT pathway. Wistar dams were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of 600 mg/kg VPA or saline on embryonic day E12.5 or an equal volume of saline solution. Three behavioral tests were conducted on these males' offspring: grid-walking test, negative geotaxis test, and three-chamber social interaction test. Metaplasticity was induced in 60-day-old male progeny by giving high-frequency stimulation for 5 minutes following low-frequency stimulation to the perforant pathway. For the baseline stimulation protocol (n = 6), stimulation was delivered to the dentate gyrus at the previously determined stimulation intensity (0.33 Hz 0.175 msec 30 s) for 75 min. The percent change of slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) and amplitude of population spike were calculated 55-60 min after induction protocol. The mRNA levels of PI3K, PTEN, AKT, GSK-3 beta, and MAPT were measured in the hippocampus by using quantitative rt-PCR. We found that offspring of VPA-treated rats showed significantly impaired sensorimotor coordination, decreased sociability, impaired preference for social novelty, and reduced input-output curve of fEPSP slope, compared to control animals. Despite a similar metaplastic response, mRNA levels of genes of interest were similar but considerably down-regulated after induction in offspring of VPA-treated dams. Our study provides evidence that the induced expression of autism-related genes has evolved to enable an adaptation mechanism during metaplastic control of long-term potentiation.

AB  - The neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) and its precursor proNGF are both bioactive and exert similar or opposite actions depending on the cell target and its milieu. The balance between NGF and proNGF is crucial for cell and tissue homeostasis and it is considered an indicator of pathological conditions. Proteolytical cleavage of proNGF to the mature form results in different fragments, whose function and/or bioactivity is still unclear. The present study was conducted to investigate the distribution of proNGF fragments derived from endogenous cleavage in brain and peripheral tissues of adult rats in the healthy condition and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Different anti-proNGF antibodies were tested and the presence of short peptides corresponding to the prodomain sequence (pdNGFpep) was identified. Processing of proNGF was found to be tissue-specific and accumulation of pdNGFpeps was found in inflamed tissues, mainly in testis, intestine and heart, suggesting a possible correlation between organ functions and a response to insults and/or injury. The bioactivity of pdNGFpep was also demonstrated in vitro by using primary hippocampal neurons. Our study supports a biological function for the NGF precursor prodomain and indicates that short peptides from residues 1-60, differing from the 70-110 sequence, induce apoptosis, thereby opening the way for identification of new molecular targets to study pathological conditions.

AB  - (1) Background: Eosinophilia has traditionally been linked to eosinophilic asthma, for which it is the gold-standard prognostic biomarker. However, the association between eosinophilia and the presence of other diseases and comorbidities is yet unclear. (2) Methods: For this retrospective study, we reviewed the electronic medical records of 49,909 subjects with blood eosinophilia to gather data on the presence of asthma, COPD, sleep apnea, tuberculosis, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases and severe CRSwNP among these subjects. Demographic features including age, sex, and smoking habits were collected, as well as the number of hospitalizations and emergency department visits. T-tests, ANOVA, Fisher test, and logistic regression models were used. (3) Results: For all age groups studied, eosinophilia was significantly more prevalent among asthmatic subjects than nonasthmatics, especially in patients also presenting CRSwNP, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The likelihood of developing asthma, COPD, and CRSwNP, and hospitalization, was increased when BEC was above 600 eosinophils/mu L. The association between asthma, CRSwNP, and BEC was corroborated by multiple logistic regressions models. (4) Conclusions: We demonstrated the association of having over 600 blood eosinophils/mu L with a higher number of hospitalizations and comorbidities (CRSwNP and COPD), which proves that BEC is a highly useful parameter to consider in subjects who present blood eosinophilia.

AB  - Background Rhinogobio nasutus, an endemic species from the Yellow River, is listed under the second class of the National Key Protected Wildlife List in China due to its dramatically decreased population. Despite its important status, the mitochondrial genes and phylogenetic relationships of R. nasutus are unknown.Methods and Results The complete mitochondrial genome of R. nasutus was sequenced, assembled, and annotated for the first time. The mitochondrial genome was 16,609 bp in length, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and 1 non-coding control region. The gene order in the mitochondrial genome of R. nasutus was identical to that of other Rhinogobios species. Analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions showed that the Ka/Ks ratio in all tested protein-coding genes was less than 1, indicating that these genes were evolving under purifying selection. Further phylogenetic analysis showed that R. nasutus was first clustered with R. typus, then grouped with the other two Rhinogobio species, indicating the phylogenetically close relationship between R. nasutus and R. typus.Conclusions This was the first genomic resource developed for R. nasutus, which could not only improve our understanding of its phylogenetic status, but also serve as a genomic tool for the development of genetic markers that will be used in conservation and evolutionary genetics studies.

AB  - The aim of this research was to study behavioral reactions and morphological changes in the brain of adult female Sprague Dawley rats after exposure to 170 MeV and 70 MeV protons and gamma radiation (60Co) at a dose of 1 Gy. The analysis of the behavioral reactions in the T-maze showed that exposure to ionizing radiation with different LETs led to an increase in number of repeated entries into the arms of the maze in the spontaneous alternation test. In the Open Field test a decrease in overall motor activity in the group of irradiated animals (70 MeV protons at the Bragg peak) was observed. A decrease in the number of standing positions was seen in all groups of irradiated animals. Morphological analysis showed the development of early amyloidosis, autolysis of the ependymal layer, an increase in the number of neurodegenerative changes in various structures of the brain, and the development of neuronal hypertrophy on the 30th day after irradiation in the cerebellum and hippocampal hilus. Exposure to protons at a dose of 1 Gy leads to the development of structural and functional disorders of the central nervous system of animals on the 30th day after irradiation. These data indicate a damage of short-term memory, a decrease in motor activity and exploratory behavior of animals. With an increase in LET, there is an increase in the number of amyloid plaques in the forebrain of rats, autolysis of the ependymal layer of the ventricles, and the development of dystrophic changes.

AB  - Thirst is an important interoceptive response and drives water consumption. The hippocampus actively modulates food intake and energy metabolism, but direct evidence for the exact role of the hippocampus in modulating drinking behaviors is lacking. We observed decreased number of c-Fos-positive neurons in the ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) after water restriction or hypertonic saline injection in rats. Suppressed vCA1 neuronal activities under the hypertonic state were further confirmed with in vivo electrophysiological recording, and the level of suppression paralleled both the duration and the total amount of water consumption. Chemogenetic inhibition of vCA1 pyramidal neurons increased water consumption in rats injected with both normal and hypertonic saline. These findings suggest that suppression of vCA1 pyramidal neuronal activities enhances water intake.

AB  - Objectives: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that are involved in regulating gene expression and have an important role in biological pathways such as differentiation, migration, cell proliferation, and other cellular processes. Previous studies have shown that miR-564 and miR-718 are either downregulated or upregulated in various cancers. The purpose of this study was to examine the levels of expression of miR-564 and miR-718 in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients' tumor and non-tumor tissues.Methods: The study group consisted of tumor and non-tumor tissues obtained from a total of 80 CRC patients. The expression levels of miRNAs were determined using quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, using bioinformatics analysis, the transcription factors (TFs) that are associated with miR-564 and miR-718 were identified as well as the GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment pathway analysis of these miRNAs.Results: According to the findings of RT-qPCR, both miR-564 and miR-718 expression levels were significantly downregulated in CRC (p<0.001). There was a statistically significant correlation between the expression levels of miR-564 and miR-718 (p=0.006). Both miR-564 and miR-718 regulated TFs including E2F1, HIFIA, BRD4, KDM2B, ESR1, MYC, PHF8, RUNX1, TCF12 and YY1. According to KEGG analysis, miR-564 and miR-718 were associated with Hippo and FoxO signaling pathways, respectively (p<0.05).Conclusions: miR-564 and miR-718 may have function as tumor suppressors and may be biomarkers for the diagnosis of CRC.

AB  - Introduction: Electrical stimulation, the application of an electric field to cells and tissues grown in culture to accelerate growth and tight junction formation among endothelial cells, could be impactful in cardiovascular tissue engineering, allotransplantation, and wound healing.Methods: Using Electrical Cell Stimulation And Recording Apparatus (ECSARA), the exploration of the stimulatory influences of electric fields of different magnitude and frequencies on growth and proliferation, trans endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and gene expression of human endothelia cells (HUVECs) were explored.Results: Within the range of endogenous electrical pulses studied, frequency was found to be more significant (p = 0.05) than voltage in influencing HUVEC gene expression. Localization of Yes Associated Protein (YAP) and expression of CD-144 are shown to be consistent with temporal manifestations of TEER.Discussion: This work introduces the field of electromics, the study of cellular gene expression profiles and their implications under the influence of exogenously applied electric fields. Homology of electrobiology and mechanobiology suggests use of such exogenous cues in tissue and regenerative engineering.

AB  - YAP protein is a critical regulator of mammalian embryonic development. By generating a near-infrared fusion YAP reporter mouse line, we have achieved high-resolution live imaging of YAP localization during mouse embryonic development. We have validated the reporter by demonstrating its predicted responses to blocking LATS kinase activity or blocking cell polarity. By time lapse imaging preimplantation embryos, we revealed a mitotic reset behaviour of YAP nuclear localization. We also demonstrated deep tissue live imaging in post-implantation embryos and revealed an intriguing nuclear YAP pattern in migrating cells.

AB  - miRNAs are non-coding, single-stranded RNAs and are known to regulate the expression of genes during the post-transcription process. Seabuckthorn (Hippophae sp.; Elaeagnaceae) plant grows in different regions in harsh environmental conditions and is tolerant to various abiotic stress prevailing in the Indian Himalayas. Therefore, it is of interest to document the functional assignment of miRNA target genes to abiotic stress in Hippophae salicifolia using available bioinformatics tools. We identified eleven miRNA target genes in the seabuckthorn transcriptome. The expression analysis of these miRNA target genes provides important information about the regulation of stress-responsive defense mechanisms in seabuckthorn. Understanding of the role of these putative miRNAs and their target genes in cold and heat tolerance provides insights to determine the potential targets for the exploitation towards the development of stress-tolerant crop plants

AB  - Sialidases catalyze the removal of sialic acid residues from glycoproteins, oligosaccharides, and sialylated glycolipids. Sialidase Neu4 is in the lysosome and has broad substrate specificity. Previously generated Neu4-/- mice were viable, fertile and lacked gross morphological abnormalities, but displayed a marked vacuolization and lysosomal storage in lung and spleen cells. In addition, we showed that there is an increased level of GD1a ganglioside and a markedly decreased level of GM1 ganglioside in the brain of Neu4-/- mice. In this study, we further explored whether sialidase Neu4 deficiency causes neuroinflammation. We demostrated that elevated level of GD1a and GT1b is associated with an increased level of LAMP1-positive lysosomal vesicles and Tunel-positive neurons correlated with alterations in the expression of cytokines and chemokines in adult Neu4-/- mice. Astrogliosis and microgliosis were also significantly enhanced in the hippocampus, and cerebellum. These changes in brain immunity were accompanied by motor impairment in these mice. Our results indicate that sialidase Neu4 is a novel mediator of an inflammatory response in the mouse brain due to the altered catabolism of gangliosides.

AB  - The primate including the human hippocampus implicated in episodic memory and navigation represents a spatial view, very different from the place representations in rodents. To understand this system in humans, and the computations performed, the pathway for this spatial view information to reach the hippocampus was analysed in humans. Whole-brain effective connectivity was measured with magnetoencephalography between 30 visual cortical regions and 150 other cortical regions using the HCP-MMP1 atlas in 21 participants while performing a 0-back scene memory task. In a ventromedial visual stream, V1-V4 connect to the ProStriate region where the retrosplenial scene area is located. The ProStriate region has connectivity to ventromedial visual regions VMV1-3 and VVC. These ventromedial regions connect to the medial parahippocampal region PHA1-3, which, with the VMV regions, include the parahippocampal scene area. The medial parahippocampal regions have effective connectivity to the entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and hippocampus. In contrast, when viewing faces, the effective connectivity was more through a ventrolateral visual cortical stream via the fusiform face cortex to the inferior temporal visual cortex regions TE2p and TE2a. A ventromedial visual cortical 'Where' stream to the hippocampus for spatial scenes was supported by diffusion topography in 171 HCP participants at 7 T.
   A ventromedial cortical 'Where' visual pathway in humans for spatial scenes is revealed with MEG. It is fundamental to episodic memory and navigation.

AB  - BackgroundRasal1 is a Ras GTPase-activating protein which contains C2 domains necessary for dynamic membrane association following intracellular calcium elevation. Membrane-bound Rasal1 inactivates Ras signaling through its RasGAP activity, and through such mechanisms has been implicated in regulating various cellular functions in the context of tumors. Although highly expressed in the brain, the contribution of Rasal1 to neuronal development and function has yet to be explored.ResultsWe examined the contributions of Rasal1 to neuronal development in primary culture of hippocampal neurons through modulation of Rasal1 expression using molecular tools. Fixed and live cell imaging demonstrate diffuse expression of Rasal1 throughout the cell soma, dendrites and axon which localizes to the neuronal plasma membrane in response to intracellular calcium fluctuation. Pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrate direct interaction of Rasal1 with PKC, tubulin, and CaMKII. Consequently, Rasal1 is found to stabilize microtubules, through post-translational modification of tubulin, and accordingly inhibit dendritic outgrowth and branching. Through imaging, molecular, and electrophysiological techniques Rasal1 is shown to promote NMDA-mediated synaptic activity and CaMKII phosphorylation.ConclusionsRasal1 functions in two separate roles in neuronal development; calcium regulated neurite outgrowth and the promotion of NMDA receptor-mediated postsynaptic events which may be mediated both by interaction with direct binding partners or calcium-dependent regulation of down-stream pathways. Importantly, the outlined molecular mechanisms of Rasal1 may contribute notably to normal neuronal development and synapse formation.

AB  - Rhinosporidium seeberi belongs to the eukaryotic class Mesomycetozoea and causes chronic granulomatous lesions known as rhinosporidiosis. Rhinosporidiosis frequently involves the nasal cavity and nasopharynx through transepithelial invasion. Atypical presentations of this disease at other body sites have been reported, including the subcutis, visceral organs, bones, and genitals. Only a few cases of cutaneous and subcutaneous involvement have been reported to date. This chronic granulomatous condition is known for its recurrence following autoinoculation unless the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment are given. We describe a case of an immunocompetent adult who had undergone fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of mass-like swellings in the right thigh and right calf at another healthcare centre and had been diagnosed with a small round blue cell tumour. FNAC at our centre confirmed a rare case of rhinosporidiosis that was clinically mimicking a soft tissue neoplasm of the lower extremity, and the erroneous interpretation of the prior cytology studies had resulted in misinterpretation of the individually dispersed pathogenic organisms as individual malignant cells. FNAC of rhinosporidiosis can lead to early diagnosis and prompt treatment of this pathogen when it presents at unanticipated body sites.

AB  - A population of neutrophils recruited into cystic fibrosis (CF) airways is associated with proteolytic lung damage, exhibiting high expression of primary granule exocytosis marker CD63 and reduced phagocytic receptor CD16. Causative factors for this population are unknown, limiting intervention. Here we present a laboratory model to characterize responses of differentiated airway epithelium and neutrophils following respiratory infection. Pediatric primary airway epithelial cells were cultured at the air-liquid interface, challenged individually or in combination with rhinovirus (RV) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, then apically washed with medical saline to sample epithelial infection milieus. Cytokine multiplex analysis revealed epithelial antiviral signals, including IP-10 and RANTES, increased with exclusive RV infection but were diminished if P. aeruginosa was also present. Proinflammatory signals interleukin-1 alpha and beta were dominant in P. aeruginosa infection milieus. Infection washes were also applied to a published model of neutrophil transmigration into the airways. Neutrophils migrating into bacterial and viral-bacterial co-infection milieus exhibited the in vivo CF phenotype of increased CD63 expression and reduced CD16 expression, while neutrophils migrating into milieus of RV-infected or uninfected cultures did not. Individually, bacterial products lipopolysaccharide and N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and isolated cytokine signals only partially activated this phenotype, suggesting that additional soluble factors in the infection microenvironment trigger primary granule release. Findings identify P. aeruginosa as a trigger of acute airway inflammation and neutrophil primary granule exocytosis, underscoring potential roles of airway microbes in prompting this neutrophil subset. Further studies are required to characterize microbes implicated in primary granule release, and identify potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - After synaptic transmission, fused synaptic vesicles are recycled, enabling the synapse to recover its capacity for renewed release. The recovery steps, which range from endocytosis to vesicle docking and priming, have been studied individually, but it is not clear what their impact on the overall dynamics of synaptic recycling is, and how they influence signal transmission. Here we model the dynamics of vesicle recycling and find that the multiple timescales of the recycling steps are reflected in synaptic recovery. This leads to multi-timescale synapse dynamics, which can be described by a simplified synaptic model with 'power-law' adaptation. Using cultured hippocampal neurons, we test this model experimentally, and show that the duration of synaptic exhaustion changes the effective synaptic recovery timescale, as predicted by the model. Finally, we show that this adaptation could implement a specific function in the hippocampus, namely enabling efficient communication between neurons through the temporal whitening of hippocampal spike trains.

AB  - Our previous studies have reported that activation of the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3)-inflammasome complex in ethanol-treated astrocytes and chronic alcohol-fed mice could be associated with neuroinflammation and brain damage. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have been shown to restore the neuroinflammatory response, along with myelin and synaptic structural alterations in the prefrontal cortex, and alleviate cognitive and memory dysfunctions induced by binge-like ethanol treatment in adolescent mice. Considering the therapeutic role of the molecules contained in mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, the present study analyzed whether the administration of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles isolated from adipose tissue, which inhibited the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, was capable of reducing hippocampal neuroinflammation in adolescent mice treated with binge drinking. We demonstrated that the administration of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles ameliorated the activation of the hippocampal NLRP3 inflammasome complex and other NLRs inflammasomes (e.g., pyrin domain-containing 1, caspase recruitment domain-containing 4, and absent in melanoma 2, as well as the alterations in inflammatory genes (interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-18, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kappa B, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1) and miRNAs (miR-21a-5p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-141-5p) induced by binge-like ethanol treatment in adolescent mice. Bioinformatic analysis further revealed the involvement of miR-21a-5p and miR-146a-5p with inflammatory target genes and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence of the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived EVs to ameliorate the hippocampal neuroinflammatory response associated with NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by binge drinking in adolescence.

AB  - Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection, often leading to severe vascular dysfunction and high mortality. One of the hallmarks of vascular dysfunction in sepsis is increased vascular permeability and the loss of pericytes, which are essential for maintaining vascular integrity. Despite the significance of pericyte loss in sepsis, the primary type of cell death responsible and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study aims to elucidate these mechanisms by focusing on ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, and its regulation through the Hippo/ACSL4 axis. Our research confirmed significant pericyte loss in patients with sepsis. Through advanced single-cell analysis and proteomics, ferroptosis was identified as a key differentiating cell death type between sepsis and sham samples. Further metabolomics analysis revealed that Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) plays a pivotal role in the ferroptosis of pericytes during sepsis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that downregulation of ACSL4 effectively reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lipid peroxidation, restored pericyte viability, and improved endothelial permeability. In vivo studies with pericyte-specific ACSL4 knockout mice showed a marked decrease in pericyte loss and enhanced vascular barrier function following sepsis induction. To translate these findings into potential therapeutic strategies, we developed pericyte-targeting liposomes encapsulating ACSL4 shRNA adenovirus. These liposomes successfully restored pulmonary vascular barrier function and significantly reduced pericyte loss in septic conditions. The results of this study underscore the crucial role of ACSL4 in mediating ferroptosis in pericytes and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting ACSL4 to mitigate vascular dysfunction in sepsis.

AB  - Bromodomain and plant homeodomain (PHD) finger containing protein 1 (Brpf1) is an activator and scaffold protein of a multiunit complex that includes other components involving lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) 6A/6B/7. Brpf1, KAT6A, and KAT6B mutations were identified as the causal genes of neurodevelopmental disorders leading to intellectual disability. Our previous work revealed strong and specific expression of Brpf1 in both the postnatal and adult forebrain, especially the hippocampus, which has essential roles in learning and memory. Here, we hypothesized that Brpf1 plays critical roles in the function of forebrain excitatory neurons, and that its deficiency leads to learning and memory deficits. To test this, we knocked out Brpf1 in forebrain excitatory neurons using CaMKIIa-Cre. We found that Brpf1 deficiency reduced the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and downregulated the expression of genes Pcdhgb1, Slc16a7, Robo3, and Rho, which are related to neural development, synapse function, and memory, thereby damaging spatial and fear memory in mice. These findings help explain the mechanisms of intellectual impairment in patients with BRPF1 mutation.

AB  - ObjectiveThe treatment of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (E-CRSwNP) remains a challenge due to its complex pathogenesis. Inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type IA (INPP4A), a lipid phosphatase, has been implicated in allergic asthma. However, the expression and function of INPP4A in E-CRSwNP remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of INPP4A in macrophages in E-CRSwNP.MethodsWe assessed the expression of INPP4A in human and mouse nasal mucosal tissues via immunofluorescence staining. THP-1 cells were cultured and exposed to various cytokines to investigate the regulation of INPP4A expression and its functional role. Additionally, we established a murine nasal polyp (NP) model and administrated an INPP4A-overexpressing lentivirus evaluate its impact on NP.ResultsThe percentage of INPP4A + CD68 + macrophages among total macrophages decreased in the E-CRSwNP group compared to the control and the non-eosinophilic CRSwNP (NE-CRSwNP) groups, exhibiting an inverse correlation with an increased percentage of CD206 + CD68 + M2 macrophages among total macrophages. Overexpression of INPP4A led to a reduced percentage of THP-1 cells polarizing towards the M2 phenotype, accompanied by decreased levels of associated chemotactic factors including CCL18, CCL22, CCL24, and CCL26. We also validated the involvement of the PI3K-AKT pathway in the function of INPP4A in vitro. Furthermore, INPP4A overexpression in the murine NP model resulted in the attenuation of eosinophilic inflammation in the nasal mucosa.ConclusionsINPP4A deficiency promotes macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, leading to the secretion of chemokines that recruit eosinophils and Th2 cells, thereby amplifying eosinophilic inflammation in E-CRSwNP. INPP4A may exert a suppressive role in eosinophilic inflammation and could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic strategy.

AB  - The pathological consequences of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) also involve the central nervous system; indeed, T2DM patients suffer from learning and memory disabilities with a higher risk of developing dementia. Although several factors have been proposed as possible contributors, how neuroactive steroids and the gut microbiome impact brain pathophysiology in T2DM remain unexplored. On this basis, in male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, we studied whether T2DM alters memory abilities using the novel object recognition test, neuroactive steroid levels by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, hippocampal parameters using molecular assessments, and gut microbiome composition using 16S next-generation sequencing. Results obtained reveal that T2DM worsens memory abilities and that these are correlated with increased levels of corticosterone in plasma and with a decrease in allopregnanolone in the hippocampus, where neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction were reported. Interestingly, our analysis highlighted a small group of taxa strictly related to both memory impairment and neuroactive steroid levels. Overall, the data underline an interesting role for allopregnanolone and microbiota that may represent candidates for the development of therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Gelsemium is a medicinal plant that has been used to treat various diseases, but it is also well-known for its high toxicity. Complex alkaloids are considered the main poisonous components in Gelsemium. However, the toxic mechanism of Gelsemium remains ambiguous. In this work, network pharmacology and experimental verification were combined to systematically explore the specific mechanism of Gelsemium toxicity. The alkaloid compounds and candidate targets of Gelsemium, as well as related targets of excitotoxicity, were collected from public databases. The crucial targets were determined by constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to explore the bioprocesses and signaling pathways involved in the excitotoxicity corresponding to alkaloids in Gelsemium. Then, the binding affinity between the main poisonous alkaloids and key targets was verified by molecular docking. Finally, animal experiments were conducted to further evaluate the potential mechanisms of Gelsemium toxicity. A total of 85 alkaloids in Gelsemium associated with 214 excitotoxicity-related targets were predicted by network pharmacology. Functional analysis showed that the toxicity of Gelsemium was mainly related to the protein phosphorylation reaction and plasma membrane function. There were also 164 pathways involved in the toxic mechanism, such as the calcium signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. Molecular docking showed that alkaloids have high affinity with core targets, including MAPK3, SRC, MAPK1, NMDAR(2B) and NMDAR(2A). In addition, the difference of binding affinity may be the basis of toxicity differences among different alkaloids. Humantenirine showed significant sex differences, and the LD50 values of female and male mice were 0.071 mg center dot kg(-1) and 0.149 mg center dot kg(-1), respectively. Furthermore, we found that N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), a specific NMDA receptor agonist, could significantly increase the survival rate of acute humantenirine-poisoned mice. The results also show that humantenirine could upregulate the phosphorylation level of MAPK3/1 and decrease ATP content and mitochondrial membrane potential in hippocampal tissue, while NMDA could rescue humantenirine-induced excitotoxicity by restoring the function of mitochondria. This study revealed the toxic components and potential toxic mechanism of Gelsemium. These findings provide a theoretical basis for further study of the toxic mechanism of Gelsemium and potential therapeutic strategies for Gelsemium poisoning.

AB  - An optogenetic, spatial self-stimulation task in mice reveals how information carried by distinct inputs to the nucleus accumbens shell is potentially integrated to drive behavioural responses.
   The nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) is critically important for reward valuations, yet it remains unclear how valuation information is integrated in this region to drive behaviour during reinforcement learning. Using an optogenetic spatial self-stimulation task in mice, here we show that contingent activation of different excitatory inputs to the NAcSh change expression of different reward-related behaviours. Our data indicate that medial prefrontal inputs support place preference via repeated actions, ventral hippocampal inputs consistently promote place preferences, basolateral amygdala inputs produce modest place preferences but as a byproduct of increased sensitivity to time investments, and paraventricular inputs reduce place preferences yet do not produce full avoidance behaviour. These findings suggest that each excitatory input provides distinct information to the NAcSh, and we propose that this reflects the reinforcement of different credit assignment functions. Our finding of a quadruple dissociation of NAcSh input-specific behaviours provides insights into how types of information carried by distinct inputs to the NAcSh could be integrated to help drive reinforcement learning and situationally appropriate behavioural responses.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies and antibody-derived biologics are essential tools for cancer research and therapy. The development of monoclonal antibody treatments for successful tumor-targeted therapies took several decades. A nanobody constructed by molecular engineering of heavy-chain-only antibody, which is unique in camel or alpaca, is a burgeoning tools of diagnostic and therapeutic in clinic. In this study, we immunized a 4-year-old female alpaca with TIM-3 antigen. Then, a VHH phage was synthesized from the transcriptome of its B cells by nested PCR as an intermediate library; the library selection for Tim-3 antigen is carried out in three rounds of translation. The most reactive colonies were selected by periplasmic extract monoclonal ELISA. The nanobody was immobilized by metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification with the use of a Ni-NTA column, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. Finally, the affinity of TIM3-specific nanobody was determined by ELISA. As results, specific 15 kD bands representing nanomaterials were observed on the gel and confirmed by Western blotting. The nanobody showed obvious specific immune response to Tim-3 and had high binding affinity. We have successfully prepared a functional anti-human Tim-3 nanobody with high affinity in vitro.

AB  - RTP801/REDD1 is a stress-regulated protein whose levels are increased in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases (HD). RTP801 downregulation ameliorates behavioral abnormalities in several mouse models of these disorders. In HD, RTP801 mediates mutant huntingtin (mhtt) toxicity in in vitro models and its levels are increased in human iPSCs, human postmortem putamen samples, and in striatal synaptosomes from mouse models of the disease. Here, we investigated the role of RTP801 in the hippocampal pathophysiology of HD. We found that RTP801 levels are increased in the hippocampus of HD patients in correlation with gliosis markers. Although RTP801 expression is not altered in the hippocampus of the R6/1 mouse model of HD, neuronal RTP801 silencing in the dorsal hippocampus with shRNA containing AAV particles ameliorates cognitive alterations. This recovery is associated with a partial rescue of synaptic markers and with a reduction in inflammatory events, especially microgliosis. Altogether, our results indicate that RTP801 could be a marker of hippocampal neuroinflammation in HD patients and a promising therapeutic target of the disease.

AB  - Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) localize to airway motile cilia and initiate innate immune responses in retaliation to bacterial quorum sensing molecules. Activation of cilia T2Rs leads to calcium-driven NO production that increases cilia beating and directly kills bacteria. Several diseases, including chronic rhinosinusitis, COPD, and cystic fibrosis, are characterized by loss of motile cilia and/or squamous metaplasia. To understand T2R function within the altered landscape of airway disease, we studied T2Rs in non-ciliated airway cell lines and primary cells. Several T2Rs localize to the nucleus in de-differentiated cells that typically localize to cilia in differentiated cells. As cilia and nuclear import utilize shared proteins, some T2Rs may target to the nucleus in the absence of motile cilia. T2R agonists selectively elevated nuclear and mitochondrial calcium through a G-protein-coupled receptor phospholipase C mechanism. Additionally, T2R agonists decreased nuclear cAMP, increased nitric oxide, and increased cGMP, consistent with T2R signaling. Furthermore, exposure to T2R agonists led to nuclear calcium-induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation. T2R agonists induced apoptosis in primary bronchial and nasal cells differentiated at air-liquid interface but then induced to a squamous phenotype by apical submersion. Air-exposed well-differentiated cells did not die. This may be a last-resort defense against bacterial infection. However, it may also increase susceptibility of de-differentiated or remodeled epithelia to damage by bacterial metabolites. Moreover, the T2R-activated apoptosis pathway occurs in airway cancer cells. T2Rs may thus contribute to microbiome-tumor cell crosstalk in airway cancers. Targeting T2Rs may be useful for activating cancer cell apoptosis while sparing surrounding tissue.

AB  - With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) have become a global health challenge, significantly impacting patients' quality of life and placing a substantial burden on healthcare systems. Among various immune cell subsets, M2-polarized macrophages play a pivotal role in tissue repair and inflammation resolution. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing to comprehensively investigate the role of the TFAP2A-LIFR-Hippo-YAP signaling axis in regulating macrophage M2 polarization and its critical function in DFU wound healing. Through scRNA-seq analysis, we identified nine major immune cell subsets in DFU samples, with macrophages emerging as key regulatory cells. In vitro experiments further confirmed that TFAP2A promotes macrophage M2 polarization (evidenced by increased expression of the M2 marker ARG1) and ameliorates endothelial dysfunction by enhancing tube formation, improving migration capacity, and upregulating relevant proteins such as VCAM-1. Moreover, TFAP2A serves as a central regulatory gene for macrophage function in DFU by upregulating LIFR expression and activating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, thereby inducing M2 polarization and mitigating endothelial dysfunction. Mouse model experiments further demonstrated that the TFAP2A-LIFR-Hippo-YAP signaling axis accelerates DFU wound healing through the induction of macrophage M2 polarization. This study unveils a novel immunoregulatory role of TFAP2A in DFU and provides a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic diabetic wounds.

AB  - Chromosomal instability in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurons has been previously reported. This pilot study aimed to establish a quantitative technique for assessing X chromosome centromere signals using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Hippocampal brain tissue was collected at autopsy from sporadic AD patients and age- and gender-matched controls. FISH was utilized to detect and measure the intensity of hybridization signals for X chromosome centromeres in the interphase nuclei of hippocampal brain cells. The premature centromere division (PCD) phenomenon, marked by a close bipartite signal appearing as two separated FISH spots, was examined to see if the hybridized DNA amount in each spot matched the expected centromere DNA amount. The technique effectively distinguished between PCD+ and PCD- signals. The average PCD frequency of the X chromosome in the AD group was 7 +/- 1%, compared with 3.2 +/- 0.84% in the controls. This quantitative approach supports qualitative analyses of FISH centromere spots, reinforcing findings of chromosomal instability in AD. The presence of a double signal at the centromere of a single X chromosome indicates re-entered cell cycles, DNA replication, and PCD in hippocampal neurons. This technique provides a reliable method for identifying PCD + signals and contributes to understanding chromosomal instability in AD.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by deficits in social functioning, stereotyped patterns of behaviors, narrowed interests, and elevated anxiety. Certain ASD symptoms can persist, whereas others may improve throughout the lifespan, but the specific patterns of changes have not been clearly delineated. Using a valproic acid (VPA) rat model of ASD, the present study took a developmental approach and examined how autistic-like behaviors, including anxiety-like behavior, object obsession, and social functioning deficits, manifested differently in three critical periods representing preadolescent (postnatal day [PND] 25), adolescent (PND 45), and adulthood life stage (PND 75) in a sex-dependent manner. Starting on PNDs 25, 45, and 75, VPA- or saline-exposed male and female offspring were tested in an elevated plus maze (EPM) and a newly validated composite social and object interaction and a triple recognition test (object, spatial, and social recognition). Across the three age groups, VPA-exposed offspring did not exhibit enhanced anxiety-like behavior in the EPM nor enhanced object interaction ("object obsession") in the triple recognition test. However, both male and female preadolescent (PND 25) VPA-exposed offspring showed a significantly increased latency to initiate social contact than the saline-exposed controls, although their latencies to contact novel objects were comparable to those of the controls. Male preadolescent and adolescent VPA-exposed offspring, to a lesser extent the female preadolescent offspring, exhibited significantly lower levels of social interaction. These social functioning deficits were absent in adult VPA offspring. Additionally, prenatal VPA exposure did not cause an impairment of object recognition, spatial recognition, or social recognition of a familiar conspecific. Unexpectedly, it enhanced social recognition of a novel conspecific, but only in adolescent female offspring. These findings suggest that this rat model based on prenatal VPA exposure is valid in capturing early social motivational and functioning deficits but is limited in its capacity to model increased object obsession and enhanced anxiety as seen in ASD, as well as the developmental trajectory of non-social ASD symptoms. Recognizing these limitations is important as it informs us how to properly use this model to investigate the neurobiology of ASD and incentivizes us to develop better rodent models.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to explore the impact and mechanism of Scutellariae radix (SR), dried root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi of Labiatae, on prenatal stress (PS)-induced anxiety-like and depression-like behavior in the offspring in a mouse prenatal stress model. Methods: The open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were utilized to assess the behavior of the offspring. Histological changes were evaluated using HE staining and Nissl staining. ELISA was employed to detect the levels of related factors in the serum and fetal brains of offspring mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expressions of doublecortin and neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus, and RT-PCR reflected the expression of factors in the hippocampus and placenta of offspring mice. These various techniques collectively provided insight into the neurodevelopmental status by detecting indicators related to neurodevelopmental status. LC-MS/MS and molecular docking were used to clarify the chemical constituents and the pharmacodynamic components in S. radix. Results:S. radix ameliorated prenatal stress-induced anxiety-like and depression-like behavior in the offspring. It also alleviated hippocampal neurogenesis impairment caused by prenatal stress and restored abnormal expression of hippocampal glutamate (Glu) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the offspring. Additionally, S. radix maintained normal 11 beta-HSD1 expression in the placenta of prenatal stress mice, ensuring a normal level of glucocorticoids (GCs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the fetus. Furthermore, S. radix increased the mRNA expression of GR and 11 beta-HSD2 while decreasing the mRNA expression of 11 beta-HSD1, thereby normalizing levels of serum CRH, ACTH, and GC in the offspring. Finally, docking results indicated that baicalein, wogonin, wogonoside, and baicalin exhibited stronger binding ability with the target. Conclusion: The results of our study indicate that S. radix may have the potential to alleviate prenatal stress-induced anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in offspring, at least partially through protecting placental barrier function, reversing HPA axis hyperfunction, and ameliorating neurodevelopmental dysfunction.

AB  - Background Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is associated with the progression of human cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). The function of lncRNA DLGAP1-AS2, as a promising oncogene, has been identified in several human cancers. Therefore, this study was aimed to explore the association of DLGAP1-AS2 with gastric tumorigenesis, as well. Methods and results The expression level of DLGAP1-AS2 was initially pre-evaluated in GC datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Moreover, qRT-PCR experiment was performed on 25 GC and 25 adjacent normal tissue samples. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were also analyzed for further validation. Consistent with data obtained from GEO datasets, qRT-PCR results revealed that DLGAP1-AS2 was significantly (p < 0.0032) upregulated in GC specimens compared to normal samples, which was additionally confirmed using TCGA analysis (p < 0.0001). DLGAP1-AS2 expression level was also correlated with age (p = 0.0008), lymphatic and vascular invasion (p = 0.0415) in internal samples as well as poor survival of GC patients (p = 0.00074) in GEO datasets. Also, Gene Ontology analysis illustrated that DLGAP1-AS2 may be involved in the cellular process, including hippo signaling, regulated by YAP1, as its valid downstream target, in GC samples. Moreover, ROC curve analysis showed the high accuracy of the DLGAP1-AS2 expression pattern as a diagnostic biomarker for GC. Conclusion Our findings indicated that DLGAP1-AS2 might display oncogenic properties through gastric tumorigenesis and could be suggested as a therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic target.

TI  - Cross-talk between YAP and RAR-RXR Drives Expression of Sternness Genes to Promote 5-FU Resistance and Self-Renewal in Colorectal Cancer Cells
T2  - MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - The mechanisms whereby the Hippo pathway effector YAP regulates cancer cell sternness, plasticity, and chemoresistance are not fully understood. We previously showed that in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant colorectal cancer cells, the transcriptional coactivator YAP is differentially regulated at critical transitions connected with reversible quiescence/dormancy to promote metastasis. Here, we found that experimental YAP activation in 5-FU-sensitive and 5-FU-resistant HT29 colorectal cancer cells enhanced nuclear YAP localization and the transcript levels of the retinoic acid (RA) receptors RAR alpha/gamma and RAR target genes CYP26A1, ALDH1A3, and LGR5 through RA Response Elements (RARE). In these two cell models, constitutive YAP activation reinforced the expression of the sternness biomarkers and regulators ALDH1A3, LGR5, and OCT4. Conversely, YAP silencing, RAR/RXR inhibition by the pan-RAR antagonist BMS493, and vitamin A depletion downregulatcd sternness traits and self-renewal. Regarding the mechanisms engaged, proximity-dependent labeling, nuclear YAP pulldown coupled with mass spectrometry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)/re-ChIP experiments revealed: (i) the nuclear colocalization/interaction of YAP with RAR gamma and RXRs; and (ii) combined genomic cooccupancy of YAP, RAR alpha/gamma, and RXR alpha interactomes at proximal RAREs of LGR5 and ALDHIA3 promoters. Moreover, activation of the YAP/RAR-RXR cross-talk in colorectal cancer cells promoted RAR self-activation loops via vitamin A metabolism, RA, and active RAR ligands generated by ALDH1A3. Together, our data identify YAP as a bona fide RAR-RXR transcriptional coactivator that acts through RARE-activated sternness genes.

KW  - ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIORS

AB  - The gut microbiome has emerged as a growing focus of research and public health interest, leading to the frequent exploration of probiotic dietary supplements as potential treatments for various disorders, such as anxiety and depression. In the present report, changes in inflammation and microbiome composition were assessed in model mice exhibiting depressive-like behaviors that were exposed to the probiotic Lactobacillus zhachilii HBUAS52074T. It was found that L. zhachilii HBUAS52074T alleviated the severity of depressive-like behaviors while increasing serum 5-HT concentrations. Moreover, L. zhachilii HBUAS52074T modulated the composition of the gut microbiota, resulting in a decrease in the abundance of Prevotella and an increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus. Additionally, supplementation with L. zhachilii HBUAS52074T enhanced intestinal barrier function and reduced inflammation in peripheral blood, as well as in the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical tissues. Correlational analyses indicated that the abundance of Lactobacillus was positively correlated with the social interaction ratio, time spent in the center, entries into the center, as well as serum 5-HT and serum IL-10 levels but negatively correlated with immobility time. Overall, chronic social defeat stress was found to be associated with inflammation and the exacerbation of depressive-like behaviors. The above findings suggested that L. zhachilii HBUAS52074T supplementation was sufficient to alter the parameters. Collectively, these data suggest that L. zhachilii HBUAS52074T, derived from naturally fermented foods, may possess therapeutic potential for the treatment of depression.

AB  - Diabetes-associated cognitive decline (DACD) is defined as an impairment of cognitive functions, including memory, attention and executive functions, attributed to chronic hyperglycemia and metabolic dysregulation associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death that is dependent on iron and is primarily characterized by the excessive accumulation of lipid peroxides within cellular membranes, and also plays a critical role by exacerbating neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction. The present study aims to use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology to investigate the role of ferroptosis in microglia and oligodendrocytes in DACD, thereby elucidating the pathogenesis of DACD. scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq datasets were analyzed for differential gene expression in hippocampus samples of T2DM and control mice, with an emphasis on oligodendrocytes and microglia cell types. We further constructed a T2DM model in mice and conducted behavioral analyses to evaluate cognitive functions. Additionally, we explored the role of ferroptosis in the progression of DACD disease by knocking down transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1) using small interfering RNA and utilizing the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1. The study identified significant alterations in the expression of ferroptosis-related genes Fth1, Slc40a1, Slc3a2, Trf, Tfrc and Sat1 in T2DM mice, suggesting the possible involvement of ferroptosis in DACD. Knocking down Tfr1 and inhibiting ferroptosis could significantly alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress damage in oligodendrocytes. This research provides new perspectives into the pathophysiology of DACD, emphasizing the critical role of ferroptosis and offering a potential therapeutic target to mitigate neurological damage and cognitive impairment associated with T2DM.

AB  - Trichomes are specialized epidermal outgrowths serving as protective barriers for plants against various stresses such as herbivore attacks. MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex is of great significance for unicellular trichome formation in Arabidopsis, whereas its role in the formation of multicellular trichomes in tomatoes remains largely unknown. In the present study, we identified that the R2R3-type MYB transcription factor SlMYB72 promotes the formation of type II, V, and VI trichomes by inhibiting the expression of SZCycB2, a repressor of trichome initiation. SlMYB75 is a negative regulator of trichome formation and positively regulates SZCycB2 expression. Interaction analyses showed that SlMYB72 and SlMYB75 can form MYB-bHLH-WD40 complexes with SlbHLH150 and SlTTG1, respectively, through mutual interactions. The dualluciferase assay demonstrated that the regulatory functions of SlMYB72 and SlMYB75 in SZCycB2 expression can be enhanced by their corresponding MYB-bHLH-WD40 complexes. Interestingly, yeast-three-hybrid assay indicated that SlMYB75 competes with SlMYB72 for SlbHLH150 and SlTTG1, and counterbalances the down-regulation of SZCycB2 expression controlled by SlMYB72 alone, which is further confirmed by genetic hybrid experiments. These results reveal that SlMYB72 and SlMYB75 antagonistically regulate trichome formation and SZCycB2 expression through MYB-bHLH-WD40 complexes. These findings provide a novel perspective and theoretical basis for the formation of multicellular trichomes in tomatoes and the development of highly resistant plants.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a key contributor to AD pathology. However, the earliest role of pre-plaque neuronal oxidative stress, remains elusive. Using laser microdissected hippocampal neurons extracted from McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rats we found that intraneuronal amyloid beta (iA beta)-burdened neurons had increased expression of genes related to oxidative stress and DNA damage responses including Ercc2, Fancc, Sod2, Gsr, and Idh1. DNA damage was further evidenced by increased neuronal levels of XPD (Ercc2) and gamma H2AX foci, indicative of DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs), and by increased expression of Ercc6, Rad51, and Fen1, and decreased Sirt6 in hippocampal homogenates. We also found increased expression of synaptic plasticity genes (Grin2b (NR2B), CamkII alpha, Bdnf, c-fos, and Homer1A) and increased protein levels of TOP2 beta. Our findings indicate that early accumulation of iA beta, prior to A beta plaques, is accompanied by incipient oxidative stress and DSBs that may arise directly from oxidative stress or from maladaptive synaptic plasticity.
   Microdissected amyloid-burdened hippocampal neurons of an Alzheimer-like transgenic rat displayed increased expression of oxidative stress-related genes and DNA damage, which occurred prior to amyloid plaque formation.

AB  - How does the human brain construct cognitive maps for decision-making and inference? Here, we conduct an fMRI study on a navigation task in multidimensional abstract spaces. Using a deep neural network model, we assess learning levels and categorized paths into exploration and exploitation stages. Univariate analyses show higher activation in the bilateral hippocampus and lateral prefrontal cortex during exploration, positively associated with learning level and response accuracy. Conversely, the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and retrosplenial cortex show higher activation during exploitation, negatively associated with learning level and response accuracy. Representational similarity analysis show that the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and OFC more accurately represent destinations in exploitation than exploration stages. These findings highlight the collaboration between the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex in learning abstract space structures. The hippocampus may be involved in spatial memory formation and representation, while the OFC integrates sensory information for decision-making in multidimensional abstract spaces.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) gives rise to new neurons throughout life. This phenomenon takes place in more than 120 mammalian species, including humans, yet its occurrence in the latter was questioned after one study proposed the putative absence of neurogenesis markers in the adult human hippocampus. In this regard, we showed that prolonged fixation impedes the visualization of Doublecortin+ immature neurons in this structure, whereas other authors have suggested that a dilated post-mortem delay (PMD) underlies these discrepancies. Nevertheless, the individual and/or additive contribution of fixation and the PMD to the detection (or lack thereof) of other AHN markers has not been studied to date. To address this pivotal question, we used a tightly controlled experimental design in mice, which allowed the dissection of the relative contribution of the aforementioned factors to the visualization of markers of individual AHN stages. Fixation time emerged as the most prominent factor globally impeding the study of this process in mice. Moreover, the visualization of other particularly sensitive epitopes was further prevented by prolonged PMD. These results are crucial to disambiguate current controversies related to the occurrence of AHN not only in humans but also in other mammalian species.

AB  - Glutamate-weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) is a useful imaging tool to detect glutamate signal alterations caused by neuroinflammation. This study aimed to visualize and quantitatively evaluate hippocampal glutamate alterations in a rat model of sepsis-induced brain injury using GluCEST and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS). Twenty-one Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups (sepsis-induced groups (SEP05, n = 7 and SEP10, n = 7) and controls (n = 7)). Sepsis was induced through a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 5 mg/kg (SEP05) or 10 mg/kg (SEP10). GluCEST values and H-1-MRS concentrations in the hippocampal region were quantified using conventional magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry and a water scaling method, respectively. In addition, we examined immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining to observe the immune response and activity in the hippocampal region after LPS exposure. The GluCEST and H-1-MRS results showed that GluCEST values and glutamate concentrations were significantly higher in sepsis-induced rats than those in controls as the LPS dose increased. GluCEST imaging may be a helpful technique for defining biomarkers to estimate glutamate-related metabolism in sepsis-associated diseases.

AB  - (1) Background: C. vietnamensis is very suitable for growth in the low hilly areas of southern subtropical regions. Under appropriate conditions, the oil yield of C. vietnamensis can reach 1125 kg/ha (the existing varieties can reach 750 kg/ha). Moreover, the fruit of C. vietnamensis is large and the pericarp is thick (>5 cm). Therefore, a high seed ratio has become the main target economic trait for the breeding of C. vietnamensis. (2) Methods: A half-sibling population of C. vietnamensis plants with a combination of high and low seed ratios was constructed by crossing a C. vietnamensis female parent. Bulked segregant RNA analysis and full-length transcriptome sequencing were performed to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying a high seed ratio. (3) Results: Seed ratio is a complex quantitative trait with a normal distribution, which is significantly associated with four other traits of fruit (seed weight, seed number, fruit diameter, and pericarp thickness). Two candidate regions related to high seed ratio (HSR) were predicted. One spanned 140.8-148.4 Mb of chromosome 2 and was associated with 97 seed-yield-related candidate genes ranging in length from 278 to 16,628 bp. The other spanned 35.3-37.3 Mb on chromosome 15 and was associated with 38 genes ranging in length from 221 to 16,928 bp. Using the full-length transcript as a template, a total of 115 candidate transcripts were obtained, and 78 transcripts were predicted to be functionally annotated. The DEGs from two set pairs of cDNA sequencing bulks were enriched to cytochrome p450 CYP76F14 (KOG0156; GO:0055114, HSR4, HSR7), the gibberellin phytohormone pathway (GO:0016787, HSR5), the calcium signaling pathway (GO:0005509, HSR6), the polyubiquitin-PPAR signaling pathway (GO:0005515, HSR2, HSR3), and several main transcription factors (bZIP transcription factor, HSR1) in C. vietnamensis.

AB  - Oncogenic activation of the RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway occurs in approximately 25% of all human cancers, yet activated RAS, BRAF, or MEK expression in primary cells leads to a prolonged and predominantly irreversible cell-cycle arrest termed oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). OIS acts as an intrinsic tumor suppressor mechanism, serving as a barrier to tumor progression. Screening a library of activated kinases and kinase-regulatory proteins we identified MOB3A, a Mps-one binder coactivator (MOB) protein family member, whose constitutive expression permits proliferation and suppresses senescence in response to oncogenic RAS and BRAF signals. MOB3A is one of seven human MOB genes, which are highly conserved from yeast to human and that function to activate the Hippo pathway kinases (MST/LATS) or NDR kinases through direct association. Here we show that within the MOB family of genes MOB3A and C are unique in their ability to allow primary cell proliferation in the face of sustained oncogene signaling. Unlike the canonical MOB1A/B proteins, MOB3A inhibits Hippo/MST/LATS signaling and constitutive MOB3A membrane localization phenocopies OIS bypass seen with elevated YAP expression. Moreover, inhibition of MOB3 family member expression results in decreased proliferation and tumor growth of cancer cell lines. Together these data identify MOB3A's role in bypass of oncogene induced senescence and its role as a Hippo pathway inhibitor.

AB  - Cognitive reserve is the ability to actively cope with brain deterioration and delay cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases. It operates by optimizing performance through differential recruitment of brain networks or alternative cognitive strategies. We investigated cognitive reserve using Huntington's disease (HD) as a genetic model of neurodegeneration to compare premanifest HD, manifest HD, and controls. Contrary to manifest HD, premanifest HD behave as controls despite neurodegeneration. By decomposing the cognitive processes underlying decision making, drift diffusion models revealed a response profile that differs progressively from controls to premanifest and manifest HD. Here, we show that cognitive reserve in premanifest HD is supported by an increased rate of evidence accumulation compensating for the abnormal increase in the amount of evidence needed to make a decision. This higher rate is associated with left superior parietal and hippocampal hypertrophy, and exhibits a bell shape over the course of disease progression, characteristic of compensation.
   A study of cognitive reserve in neurodegenerative disease combining drift diffusion models with MRI highlights a reorganization of decision-making processes correlated to left parietal and hippocampal hypertrophy.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of mortality, disability, and long-term care burden in the United States, with women comprising the majority of AD diagnoses. While AD-related dementia is associated with tau and amyloid beta accumulation, concurrent derangements in cerebral blood flow have been observed alongside these proteinopathies in humans and rodent models. The homeostatic production of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) becomes uncoupled in AD which leads to decreased NO-mediated vasodilation and oxidative stress via the production of peroxynitrite (ONOO-center dot) superoxide species. Here, we investigate the role of the novel protein arginine methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4) enzyme function and its downstream product asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) as it relates to NOS dysregulation and cerebral blood flow in AD. ADMA (type-1 PRMT product) has been shown to bind NOS as a noncanonic ligand causing enzymatic dysfunction. Our results from RT-qPCR and protein analyses suggest that aged (9-12 months) female mice bearing tau- and amyloid beta-producing transgenic mutations (3xTg-AD) express higher levels of PRMT4 in the hippocampus when compared to age- and sex-matched C57BL6/J mice. In addition, we performed studies to quantify the expression and activity of different NOS isoforms. Furthermore, laser speckle contrast imaging analysis was indicative that 3xTg-AD mice have dysfunctional NOS activity, resulting in reduced production of NO metabolites, enhanced production of free-radical ONOO-, and decreased cerebral blood flow. Notably, the aforementioned phenomena can be reversed via pharmacologic PRMT4 inhibition. Together, these findings implicate the potential importance of PRMT4 signaling in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's-related cerebrovascular derangement.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and repetitive behaviours. The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder, and its modulation represents a promising therapeutic strategy to alleviate autism-like behaviours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Acer truncatum oil (ASO) on autism-like behaviours in an autistic mouse model, BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, and to assess the related molecular mechanisms. The juvenile BTBR mice were administered with ASO for 36 consecutive days by gavage. Behaviour tests showed that ASO remarkably alleviated the autism-like behaviours of BTBR mice. In addition, the supplementation with ASO promoted the maturation of oligodendrocytes and suppressed microglial over-activation, and reduced the IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus of the BTBR mice. Oral ASO administration also improved gut microbiota imbalances in BTBR mice by reducing the abundance of the harmful bacterium Mycoplasma and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. Additionally, ASO decreased the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and increased the levels of ZO-1, claudin-1 and occludin in the intestine, thereby reducing intestinal inflammation and repairing intestinal barrier damage. Our results indicate that ASO has great potential in the treatment of autism, providing theoretical basis for the development of autism drugs.

AB  - Cyclic Guanosine-Monophosphate (cGMP) is implicated as second messenger in a plethora of pathways and its effects are executed mainly by cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG). It is involved in both peripheral (cardiovascular regulation, intestinal secretion, phototransduction, etc.) and brain (hippocampal synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, cognitive function, etc.) processes. Stimulation of hippocampal cGMP signaling have been proved to be beneficial in animal models of aging, Alzheimer's disease or hepatic encepha lopathy, restoring different cognitive functions such as passive avoidance, object recognition or spatial memory. However, even when some inhibitors of cGMP-degrading enzymes (PDEs) are already used against peripheral pathologies, their utility as neurological treatments is still under clinical investigation. Additionally, it has been demonstrated a list of cGMP roles as not second but first messenger. The role of extracellular cGMP has been specially studied in hippocampal function and cognitive impairment in animal models and it has emerged as an important modulator of neuroinflammation-mediated cognitive alterations and hippocampal synaptic plasticity malfunction. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that extracellular cGMP decreases hippocampal IL-1 beta levels restoring membrane expression of glutamate receptors in the hippocampus and cognitive function in hyperammonemic rats. The mechanisms implicated are still unclear and might involve complex interactions between hippocampal neurons, astrocytes and microglia. Membrane targets for extracellular cGMP are still poorly understood and must be addressed in future studies.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic disease of brain dysfunction, which arises from imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory activities in neural circuits. Previously, we reported that peptide Martentoxin (MarTX), from scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch, displayed antiseizure activities by specifically inhibiting BK(alpha + beta 4) channel currents. Injection of MarTX into the hippocampal region of mice significantly alleviated convulsive seizures. However, intravenous injection of MarTX had no antiepileptic efficacy due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To address this, here, we designed cell-penetrating peptide TAT-modified MarTX, in which the linker containing three glycines was put between TAT and the N-terminus of MarTX (forming MTX-N-TAT) or between TAT and the C-terminus of MarTX (forming MTX-C-TAT), respectively. We prepared them in a large amount through Escherichia coli overexpression system and then probed their antiseizure activities. Our results indicated that intravenous injection of MTX-C-TAT showed significant therapeutic efficacy of antiseizure. It increased seizure latency, reduced the total seizure duration and the number of seizures at stages 3, 4, and 5, inhibited hippocampal neuronal hyperexcitability, and exhibited neuroprotective effects on hippocampal neurons. These studies implied that MTX-C-TAT displayed intravenous antiseizure activities properly through crossing BBB and would be a potential antiepileptic drug in the future.

AB  - The present challenge in neuroscience is to non-invasively exercise low-power and high-fidelity control of neurons situated deep inside the brain. Although, two-photon optogenetic excitation can activate neurons to millimeter depth with sub-cellular specificity and millisecond temporal resolution, it can also cause heating of the targeted tissue. On the other hand, sonogenetics can non-invasively modulate the cellular activity of neurons expressed with mechano-sensitive proteins in deeper areas of the brain with less spatial selectivity. We present a theoretical analysis of a synergistic sono-optogenetic method to overcome these limitations by co-expressing a mechano-sensitive (MscL-I92L) ion-channel with a light-sensitive (CoChR/ChroME2s/ChRmine) ion-channel in hippocampal neurons. It is shown that in the presence of low-amplitude subthreshold ultrasound pulses, the two-photon excitation threshold for neural spiking reduces drastically by 73% with MscL-I92L-CoChR (0.021 mW/mu m2), 66% with MscL-I92L-ChroME2s (0.029 mW/mu m2), and 64% with MscL-I92L-ChRmine (0.013 mW/mu m2) at 5 Hz. It allows deeper excitation of up to 1.2 cm with MscL-I92L-ChRmine combination. The method is useful to design new experiments for low-power deep excitation of neurons and multimodal neuroprosthetic devices and circuits.

TI  - The 9-1-1 DNA clamp subunit RAD1 forms specific interactions with clamp loader RAD17, revealing functional implications for binding-protein RHINO
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

KW  - DAMAGE
KW  - PCNA
AB  - The RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 complex (9-1-1) is a eukaryotic DNA clamp with a crucial role at checkpoints for DNA damage. The ring-like structure of 9-1-1 is opened for loading onto 50 recessed DNA by the clamp loader RAD17 RFC-like complex (RAD17-RLC), in which the RAD17 subunit is responsible for specificity to 9-1-1. Loading of 9-1-1 is required for activation of the ATR-CHK1 checkpoint pathway and the activation is stimulated by a 9-1-1 interacting protein, RHINO, which in-teracts with 9-1-1 via a recently identified RAD1-binding motif. This discovery led to the hypothesis that other inter-acting proteins may contain a RAD1-binding motif as well. Here, we show that vertebrate RAD17 proteins also have a putative RAD1-binding motif in their N-terminal regions, and we report the crystal structure of human 9-1-1 bound to a human RAD17 peptide incorporating the motif at 2.1 angstrom reso-lution. Our structure confirms that the N-terminal region of RAD17 binds to the RAD1 subunit of 9-1-1 via specific in-teractions. Furthermore, we show that the RAD1-binding motif of RHINO disturbs the interaction of the N-terminal region of RAD17 with 9-1-1. Our results provide deeper understanding of how RAD17-RLC specifically recognizes 9-1-1 and imply that RHINO has a functional role in 9-1-1 loading/unloading and checkpoint activation.

AB  - BackgroundThe Brazilian cownose ray, Rhinoptera brasiliensis has undergone a global population reduction and is currently classified by IUCN as Vulnerable. This species is sometimes confused with Rhinoptera bonasus, the only external diagnostic characteristic to distinguish between both species is the number of rows of tooth plates. Both cownose rays overlap geographically from Rio de Janeiro to the western North Atlantic. This calls for a more comprehensive phylogenetic assessment using mitochondria DNA genomes to better understand the relationships and delimitation of these two species.Methods and resultsThe mitochondrial genome sequences of R. brasiliensis was obtained by next-generation sequencing. The length of the mitochondrial genome was 17,759 bp containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and a non-coding control region (D-loop). Each PCG was initiated by an authoritative ATG codon, except for COX1 initiated by a GTG codon. Most of the PCGs were terminated by a complete codon (TAA/TAG), while an incomplete termination codon (TA/T) was found in five out of the 13 PCGs. The phylogenetic analysis showed that R. brasiliensis was closely related to R. steindachneri whereas the reported mitogenome as R. steindachneri (GenBank accession number KM364982), differs from multiple mitocondrial DNA sequences of R. steindachneri and is nearly identical to that of R. javanica.ConclusionThe new mitogenome determined in this study provides new insight into the phylogenetic relationships in Rhinoptera, while providing new molecular data that can be applied to population genetic studies.

AB  - Background Interneural gap junctional coupling represents neural development that decreases during the postnatal period. The decrease of gap junction function coincides with the main period of chemical synapse creation and increment of synaptic activity during postnatal weeks 1 to 3. Methods Here, we have assessed the role of chemical synapses on connexin (Cx) expression in neurons and glial cells of hippocampal and cortical neurons. We characterized the impact of NMDA receptors blockade on the expression of Cx36 and Cx43 proteins by western blot analysis in postnatal day (PND)14 and PND28. MK801 was injected subcutaneously from the first day of birth until 14 or 28 days, depending on the experimental groups. Saline was injected in the same volumes in the control group. Results Early postnatal blockade of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors by the non-competitive antagonist dizocilpine maleate (MK801) arrested the developmental reduction in gap junctions during the initial postnatal weeks. Expression of Cx43 declined in PND28 compared to PND14 in visual cortex (VC) neurons. Also, we found that the expression of Cx36 and Cx43 augmented in the rats' VC in PND28 following the blockade of NMDA receptors. Expression of Cx36 declined in PND28 compared to PND14 in hippocampal neurons. Also, we found that the expression of Cx36 augmented in the rats' hippocampal neurons in PND14 and PND28 following a blockade of NMDA receptors. Conclusion These results suggest that the postnatal enhancement in glutamatergic synaptic activity is associated with the loss of gap junctional connections and downregulation of Cx36 and Cx43 between developing neurons and glial cells.

AB  - Background Repeated neonatal exposure to anesthetics may disturb neurodevelopment and cause neuropsychological disorders. The m6A modification participates in the gene regulation of neurodevelopment in mouse fetuses exposed to anesthetics. This study aims to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity after early-life anesthesia exposure.
   Methods Mice were exposed to isoflurane (1.5%) or sevoflurane (2.3%) for 2 h daily during postnatal days (PND) 7-9. Sociability, spatial working memory, and anxiety-like behavior were assessed on PND 30-35. Synaptogenesis, epitranscriptome m6A, and the proteome of brain regions were evaluated on PND 21.
   Results Both isoflurane and sevoflurane produced abnormal social behaviors at the juvenile age, with different sociality patterns in each group. Synaptogenesis in the hippocampal area CA3 was increased in the sevoflurane-exposed mice. Both anesthetics led to numerous persistent m6A-induced alterations in the brain, associated with critical metabolic, developmental, and immune functions. The proteins altered by isoflurane exposure were mainly associated with epilepsy, ataxia, and brain development. As for sevoflurane, the altered proteins were involved in social behavior.
   Conclusions Social interaction, the modulation patterns of the m6A modification, and protein expression were altered in an isoflurane or sevoflurane-specific way. Possible molecular pathways involved in brain impairment were revealed, as well as the mechanism underlying behavioral deficits following repeated exposure to anesthetics in newborns.

AB  - Faces are salient social stimuli that attract a stereotypical pattern of eye movement. The human amygdala and hippocampus are involved in various aspects of face processing; however, it remains unclear how they encode the content of fixations when viewing faces. To answer this question, we employed single-neuron recordings with simultaneous eye tracking when participants viewed natural face stimuli. We found a class of neurons in the human amygdala and hippocampus that encoded salient facial features such as the eyes and mouth. With a control experiment using non-face stimuli, we further showed that feature selectivity was specific to faces. We also found another population of neurons that differentiated saccades to the eyes vs. the mouth. Population decoding confirmed our results and further revealed the temporal dynamics of face feature coding. Interestingly, we found that the amygdala and hippocampus played different roles in encoding facial features. Lastly, we revealed two functional roles of feature-selective neurons: 1) they encoded the salient region for face recognition, and 2) they were related to perceived social trait judgments. Together, our results link eye movement with neural face processing and provide important mechanistic insights for human face perception.

AB  - Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is an essential trace nutrient required for the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA). It has previously been shown that pantothenic acid is significantly decreased in multiple brain regions in both Alzheimer's disease (ADD) and Huntington's disease (HD). The current investigation aimed to determine whether similar changes are also present in cases of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), another age-related neurodegenerative condition, and whether such perturbations might occur in similar regions in these apparently different diseases. Brain tissue was obtained from nine confirmed cases of PDD and nine controls with a post-mortem delay of 26 h or less. Tissues were acquired from nine regions that show high, moderate, or low levels of neurodegeneration in PDD: the cerebellum, motor cortex, primary visual cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, middle temporal gyrus, medulla oblongata, cingulate gyrus, and pons. A targeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) approach was used to quantify pantothenic acid in these tissues. Pantothenic acid was significantly decreased in the cerebellum (p = 0.008), substantia nigra (p = 0.02), and medulla (p = 0.008) of PDD cases. These findings mirror the significant decreases in the cerebellum of both ADD and HD cases, as well as the substantia nigra, putamen, middle frontal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex of HD cases, and motor cortex, primary visual cortex, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and entorhinal cortex of ADD cases. Taken together, these observations indicate a common but regionally selective disruption of pantothenic acid levels across PDD, ADD, and HD.

AB  - The study of an organism's response to ischemia at different levels is essential to understand the mechanism of the injury as well as protection. We used the occlusion of four vessels as an animal model of global cerebral ischemia to investigate metabolic alterations in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, blood plasma, as well as in a remote organ, the heart, in rats undergoing 24 h postischemic reperfusion. By inducing sublethal ischemic stimuli, we focused on endogenous phenomena known as ischemic tolerance that is currently the best known and most effective way of protecting against ischemic injury. NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze relative metabolite levels in homogenates from rats' cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and heart together with deproteinized blood plasma. In individual animals subjected to global cerebral ischemia, relative concentrations of the essential amino acids isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine in cerebral cortex correlated with those in blood plasma (p < 0.05, or boundary significant p < 0.09). This did not apply for the hippocampus, suggesting a closer relation between ischemic cortex and metabolomic blood components. Hippocampal non-participation on correlation with blood components may emphasize the observed partial or full normalization the post-ischemically altered levels of a number of metabolites in the preconditioned animals. Remarkably, that was observed for cortex to a lesser extent. As a response to the global cerebral ischemia in heart tissue, we observed decreased glutamate and increased 3-hydroxybutyrate. Ischemically induced semi-ketotic state and other changes found in blood plasma partially normalized when ischemic preconditioning was introduced. Some metabolomic changes were so strong that even individual metabolites were able to differentiate between ischemic, ischemically preconditioned, and control brain tissues.

AB  - Memory impairment and emotional disorder are two common clinical comorbidities in patients with epilepsy. It is imperative to develop a novel therapeutic agent or a strategy. 6 Chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-(3-methylphenyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SKF83959) is a dopamine-1 receptor agonist and sigma-1 receptor allosteric modulator, which displays the neuron-protective and anti-neuroinflammation activity. We examined the effect of SKF83959 on the memory impairment and emotional disorder in the latent period of epilepsy using the mice post-status epilepticus model. We found that SKF83959 ameliorated memory impairment and depressive-like mood, alleviated the neuron damage and the formation of gliosis in hippocampus, suppressed the rise of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor -a and interleukin-1fi, and induced nitric oxide synthase in the latent period of epilepsy. Additionally, SKF83959 significantly inhibited the activity of calcineurin and glycogen synthase kinase-3fi. All of these protective actions were reversed by BD1047 (a sigma-1 receptor antagonist). In addition, the intra-hippocampus injection of ketoconazole (a dehydroepiandrosterone synthesis inhibitor) also reversed the protective activity of SKF83959. Thus, we concluded that SKF83959 ameliorated the memory impairment and depressive-like mood in epilepsy via allosterically activating the sigma-1 receptor and subsequently inhibiting the calcineurin/glycogen synthase kinase-3fi pathway.

AB  - Risk avoidance behaviors are essential for survival. "Uncontrollable" risk-taking behaviors in animals or humans may have severe adverse consequences. In humans, a large proportion of psychiatric disorders are accompanied by impairments in risk avoidance. Obesity is associated with psychiatric disorders. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor & alpha; (PPAR & alpha;) takes part in regulating lipid metabolism and neuronal function. Here, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity on risk avoidance and the role of PPAR & alpha; in this behavior. Male PPAR & alpha;-null (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice were assigned to four different groups: WT-CON and KO-CON (normal diet); WT-HFD and KO-HFD (high fat diet). The HFD began at week 6 and was continued until sampling. A series of behavioral tests were performed at week 11. We found that WT but not KO mice fed with a HFD exhibited weight gain and risk avoidance impairment, compared with the mice fed with a normal diet. The staining of c-Fos revealed that the hippocampus was the main brain region involved in risk avoidance behavior. Moreover, biochemical analysis suggested that the decreased levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus might contribute to risk avoidance impairment induced by a HFD. These results indicated that PPAR & alpha; is involved in HFD-induced risk avoidance impairment via the regulation of hippocampal BDNF.

AB  - Tea is a worldwide consumed herbal beverage and it was aimed in this study to reveal the major fractions of green and black tea in order to enlighten the in vitro inhibition potency on the well-known drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6 activity. Methylxanthine fractions were extracted from green and black tea and a yield of 0.265 g (1.06%) for 25 g of dried black tea and 0.302 g (1.2%) for 25 g of green tea was calculated. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis represented that the major components of the methylxanthine fractions were caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. Methylxanthine content of black tea was 368.25 +/- 4.6 mu g/ml caffeine, 89.30 +/- 2.3 mu g/ml theobromine, and 3.40 +/- 0.5 mu g/ml theophylline, whereas that of green tea was 176.50 +/- 3.7 mu g/ml caffeine, 53.85 +/- 1.4 mu g/ml theobromine, and 2.06 +/- 0.7 mu g/ml theophylline. The results of concentration-dependent inhibition studies were 76% green tea, 75% black tea, and 55% caffeine at concentration of 10 mg/ml. The inhibition rates of green and black tea on CYP2D6 activity were 76% and 75%, respectively, where that of quinidine, the well-known inhibitor of CYP2D6, was 82%. Our results indicate that green and black tea is very likely to modify the CYP2D6 enzyme activity.

AB  - Pattern separation is a valuable computational function performed by neuronal circuits, such as the dentate gyrus, where dissimilarity between inputs is increased, reducing noise and increasing the storage capacity of downstream networks. Pattern separation is studied from both in vivo experimental and computational perspectives and, a number of different measures (such as orthogonalisation, decorrelation, or spike train distance) have been applied to quantify the process of pattern separation. However, these are known to give conclusions that can differ qualitatively depending on the choice of measure and the parameters used to calculate it. We here demonstrate that arbitrarily increasing sparsity, a noticeable feature of dentate granule cell firing and one that is believed to be key to pattern separation, typically leads to improved classical measures for pattern separation even, inappropriately, up to the point where almost all information about the inputs is lost. Standard measures therefore both cannot differentiate between pattern separation and pattern destruction, and give results that may depend on arbitrary parameter choices. We propose that techniques from information theory, in particular mutual information, transfer entropy, and redundancy, should be applied to penalise the potential for lost information (often due to increased sparsity) that is neglected by existing measures. We compare five commonly-used measures of pattern separation with three novel techniques based on information theory, showing that the latter can be applied in a principled way and provide a robust and reliable measure for comparing the pattern separation performance of different neurons and networks. We demonstrate our new measures on detailed compartmental models of individual dentate granule cells and a dentate microcircuit, and show how structural changes associated with epilepsy affect pattern separation performance. We also demonstrate how our measures of pattern separation can predict pattern completion accuracy. Overall, our measures solve a widely acknowledged problem in assessing the pattern separation of neural circuits such as the dentate gyrus, as well as the cerebellum and mushroom body. Finally we provide a publicly available toolbox allowing for easy analysis of pattern separation in spike train ensembles.
   The hippocampus is a region of the brain strongly associated with spatial navigation and encoding of episodic memories. To perform these functions effectively it makes use of circuits that perform pattern separation, where redundant structure is removed from neural representations leaving only the most salient information. Pattern separation allows downstream pattern completion networks to better distinguish between similar situations. Pathological changes, caused by Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, or epilepsy, to the circuits that perform pattern separation are associated with reduced discriminative ability in both animal models and humans. Traditionally, pattern separation has been described alongside the complementary process of pattern completion, but more recent studies have focussed on the detailed neuronal and circuit features that contribute to pattern separation alone. We here show that traditional measures of pattern separation are inappropriate in this case, as they do not give consistent conclusions when parameters are changed and can confound pattern separation with the loss of important information. We show that directly accounting for the information throughput of a pattern separation circuit can provide new measures of pattern separation that are robust and consistent, and allow for nuanced analysis of the structure-function relationship of such circuits and how this may be perturbed by pathology.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) manifests as poor attention, hyperactivity, as well as impulsive behaviors. Hesperetin (HSP) is a citrus flavanone with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study aimed to test hesperetin efficacy in alleviating experimental ADHD in mice and its influence on hippocampal neuron integrity and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling. An in silico study was performed to test the related proteins. Groups of mice were assigned as control, ADHD model, ADHD/HSP (25 mg/kg), and ADHD/HSP (50 mg/kg). ADHD was induced by feeding with monosodium glutamate (0.4 g/kg, for 8 weeks) and assessed by measuring the motor and attentive behaviors (open filed test, Y-maze test, and marble burying test), histopathological examination of the whole brain tissues, and estimation of inflammatory markers. The in-silico results indicated the putative effects of hesperetin on ADHD by allowing the integration and analysis of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. The in vivo results showed that ADHD model mice displayed motor hyperactivity and poor attention in the behavioral tasks and shrank neurons at various hippocampal regions. Further, there was a decline in the mRNA expression and protein levels for SIRT1, the erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), kelch like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) and hemeoxygenase-1 (OH-1) proteins. Treatment with HSP normalized the motor and attentive behaviors, prevented hippocampal neuron shrinkage, and upregulated SIRT1/Nrf2/Keap1/OH-1 proteins. Taken together, HSP mainly acts by its antioxidant potential. However, therapeutic interventions with hesperetin or a hesperetin-rich diet can be suggested as a complementary treatment in ADHD patients but cannot be suggested as an ADHD treatment per se as it is a heterogeneous and complex disease.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to study the neuroprotective role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram, against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple SSRIs, including citalopram, are reported to treat patients with depression, anxiety and AD. However, their protective cellular mechanisms have not been studied completely. In the current study, we investigated the protective role of citalopram against impaired mitochondrial dynamics, defective mitochondrial biogenesis, defective mitophagy and synaptic dysfunction in immortalized mouse primary hippocampal cells (HT22) expressing mutant APP (SWI/IND) mutations. Using quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, biochemical methods and transmission electron microscopy methods, we assessed mutant full-length APP/C-terminal fragments and Po levels and mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, mitophagy and synaptic genes in mAPP-HT22 cells and mAPP-HT22 cells treated with citalopram. Increased levels of mRNA levels of mitochondrial fission genes, decreased levels of fusion biogenesis, autophagy, mitophagy and synaptic genes were found in mAPP-HT22 cells relative to WT-HT22 cells. However, mAPP-HT22 cells treated with citalopram compared to mAPP-HT22 cells revealed reduced levels of the mitochondrial fission genes, increased fusion, biogenesis, autophagy, mitophagy and synaptic genes. Our protein data agree with mRNA levels. Transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly increased mitochondrial numbers and reduced mitochondrial length in mAPP-HT22 cells; these were reversed in citalopram-treated mAPP-HT22 cells. Cell survival rates were increased in citalopram-treated mAPP-HT22 relative to citalopram-untreated mAPP-HT22. Further, mAPP and C-terminal fragments were also reduced in citalopram-treated cells. These findings suggest that citalopram reduces mutant APP and A beta and mitochondrial toxicities and may have a protective role of mutant APP and A beta-induced injuries in patients with depression, anxiety and AD.

AB  - Aims: Rhodiola sacra is a widely used pharmaceutical component with multiple functions, including anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation. However, the exact mechanisms involved in neuroprotection against transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) remain to be elucidated. Herein, we aim at closing the gap in understanding on whether rhodiola sacra reduces neuronal death in hippocampal CA1 and at demonstrating how rhodiola sacra offers neuroprotection after tGCI.Results: The results show that rhodiola sacra (2.4 g/kg/d by feeding) pretreatment or/and postreatment significantly alleviated neuronal injury, inhibited glial activation, and improved cognitive function in male rats subjected to tGCI. The neuroprotection of prophylaxis with rhodiola sacra is equivalent to that of therapeutics. The binding mode of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha 2-subunit with rhodiola sacra was predicted by molecular docking. Further, rhodiola sacra upregulates phosphorylated AMPK and promotes nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). In addition, rhodiola sacra increases heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and activity and reduces malondialdehyde (MDA) content in CA1 after tGCI. However, the neuroprotection of rhodiola sacra is abolished by Nrf2 knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) after tGCI. Similarly, the inhibition of AMPK with Compound C or siRNA against AMPK alpha 2 aggravates neuronal death after tGCI through decreasing nuclear Nrf2 and the expression and activity of HO-1, and by increasing the release of MDA.Innovation and Conclusion: For the first time, this study demonstrates that as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent rhodiola sacra prevents oxidant stress, protects neurons, and improves cognitive function through activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway in tGCI rats.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the immuntoxic effects of arsenic in the nervous system. Our results showed that arsenic increased corticocerebral and hippocampal weights (p < 0.05). Morris water maze tests revealed that arsenic significantly increased the time spent in latency to platform on the fourth day in 50 mg/L arsenic exposure and the fifth day in 25 and 50 mg/L arsenic exposure, as well as reduced the path length in target quadrant, time spent in target quadrant, and crossing times of the platform (p < 0.05). Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that the vacuolated degeneration and pyknosis was found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of arsenic-treated mice. The mRNA levels of corticocerebral and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were decreased in the 50 mg/L arsenic-treated group (p < 0.05). In addition, immunofluorescence staining showed that 25 and 50 mg/L arsenic all increased the expression of CD11b and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (p < 0.05). Arsenic markedly raised antigen-presenting molecule MHCII and CD40 mRNA levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and upregulated the cell chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CCR7 mRNA levels in the cerebral cortex at the 50 mg/L arsenic group, and increased the CCR7 mRNA levels in the hippocampus at the 25 and 50 mg/L arsenic groups (p < 0.05). Arsenic activated the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and enhanced its upstream promoter NF-kappa B protein level and downstream regulators IL-18 mRNA levels. Collectively, these results provide new evidences for the neuro-immune toxicity of arsenic.

AB  - N-Ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone-substituted flavanols (EPSF) are marker compounds for long-term stored white teas. However, due to their low contents and diasteromeric configuration, EPSF compounds are challenging to isolate. In this study, two representative epimeric EPSF compounds, 5 & PRIME;& PRIME;& PRIME;R- and 5 & PRIME;& PRIME;& PRIME;S-epigallocatechin gallate-8-C N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone (R-EGCG-cThea and S-EGCG-cThea), were isolated from white tea using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). Two different biphasic solvent systems composed of 1. N-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:5:1:5, v/v/v/v) and 2. N-hexane-ethyl acetate-acetonitrile-water (0.7:3.0:1.3:5.0, v/v/v/v) were used for independent pre-fractionation experiments; 500 mg in each separation of white tea ethyl acetate partition were fractionated. The suitability of the two solvent systems was pre-evaluated by electrospray mass-spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis for metabolite distribution and compared to the results of the CPC experimental data using specific metabolite partition ratio K-D values, selectivity factors alpha, and resolution factors R-S. After size-exclusion and semi-preparative reversed-phase liquid chromatography, 6.4 mg of R-EGCG-cThea and 2.9 mg of S-EGCG-cThea were recovered with purities over 95%. Further bioactivity evaluation showed that R- and S-EGCG-cThea possessed in vitro inhibition effects on alpha-glucosidase with IC50 of 70.3 and 161.7 mu M, respectively.

AB  - The aim of this study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Galanin receptors type 2(GALR2) which involved in regulation of oxidative stress in the hippocampus. We used real-time PCR technique to investigate the change of GALR2 expression in hippocampus of piglets and hippocampal neurons of rats, based on the successfully constructed oxidative stress model. Real-time PCR, Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy were used to further explore the relationship between the signal pathway mediated by GALR2 and autophagy. The results showed that the transcription levels of GALR2 were up-regulated in the hippocampus of oxidative stressed piglets and rat hippocampal neurons compared with the control group (P<0.01; P<0.05). At the same time, the transcription levels of LC3, ATG5 and Beclin-1 in oxidative stressed neurons were up-regulated (P <0.05; P<0.05; P<0.01). Correlation analysis showed that GALR2 was positively correlated with LC3, ATG5 and Beclin-1 (P<0,05; P<0.05; P<0.01). The treatment with M871, a specific inhibitor of GALR2, decreased the activity of hippocampal neurons under oxidative stress (P<0.01), increased the number of autophagosomes (P< 0.01) and transcription levels of LC3, Beclin-1 and ATG5(P<0.01) and increased the ratio of LC3-II/actin and P62 protein level (P<0.05), showing that the autophagy of hippocampal neurons, which was up-regulated by oxidative stress, was inhibited with the inhibition of GALR2 expression, thus weakening the resistance to oxidative damage and decreasing the viability of neurons. Simultaneously, M871 treatment also decreased the up regulated protein level (P<0.01) and the phosphorylation level of JNK (P<0.05) in oxidative stressed neurons, indicating that JNK is the downstream target enzyme of GALR2 in hippocampal neurons under oxidative stress. However, treatment with JNK specific inhibitor SP600125 lowered the ratio of LC3-II/actin, which was up regulated by oxidative stress (P<0.01), showing the inhibition of JNK blocks the activation of the autophagic pathway by an up-regulated GALR2 in neurons. To sum up: under oxidative stress, the up-regulated GALR2 in hippocampal neurons can activate the autophagy pathway by up-regulating INK signal pathway, thus attenuate oxidative stress injury and protect neurons.

AB  - It is difficult to evaluate the pre-symptomatic state of mental disorders and prevent its onset. Since stress could be a trigger of mental disorders, it may be helpful to identify stress-responsive biomarkers (stress markers) for the evaluation of stress levels. We have so far performed omics analyses of the rat brain and peripheral blood after various kinds of stress and have found numerous factors that respond to stress. In this study, we investigated the effects of relatively moderate stress on these factors in the rat to identify stress marker candidates. Adult male Wistar rats underwent water immersion stress for 12 h, 24 h, or 48 h. Stress caused weight loss and elevated serum corticosterone levels, and alterations regarded as anxiety and/or fear-like behaviors. Reverse-transcription PCR and Western blot analyses revealed significant alterations in the expressions of hippocampal genes and proteins by the stress for no longer than 24 h, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD), small ubiquitin-like modifier proteins 1/sentrin-specific peptidase 5 (SENP5), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), and MKP-1, MMP-8, nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). Similar alterations were observed in three genes (MKP-1, CEBPD, MMP-8) in the peripheral blood. The present results strongly suggest that these factors may serve as stress markers. The correlation of these factors in the blood and brain may enable the evaluation of stress-induced changes in the brain by blood analysis, which will contribute to preventing the onset of mental disorders.

AB  - In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of post-ischemic treatment with oxcarbazepine (OXC; an anticonvulsant compound) against ischemic injury induced by transient forebrain ischemia and its mechanisms in gerbils. Transient ischemia was induced in the forebrain by occlusion of both common carotid arteries for 5 min under normothermic conditions (37 +/- 0.2 degrees C). The ischemic gerbils were treated with vehicle, hypothermia (whole-body cooling; 33.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C), or 200 mg/kg OXC. Post-ischemic treatments with vehicle and hypothermia failed to attenuate and improve, respectively, ischemia-induced hyperactivity and cognitive impairment (decline in spatial and short-term memory). However, post-ischemic treatment with OXC significantly attenuated the hyperactivity and the cognitive impairment, showing that OXC treatment significantly reduced body temperature (to about 33 degrees C). When the hippocampus was histopathologically examined, pyramidal cells (principal neurons) were dead (lost) in the subfield Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) of the gerbils treated with vehicle and hypothermia on Day 4 after ischemia, but these cells were saved in the gerbils treated with OXC. In the gerbils treated with OXC after ischemia, the expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1; one of the transient receptor potential cation channels) was significantly increased in the CA1 region compared with that in the gerbils treated with vehicle and hypothermia. In brief, our results showed that OXC-induced hypothermia after transient forebrain ischemia effectively protected against ischemia-reperfusion injury through an increase in TRPV1 expression in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region, indicating that TRPV1 is involved in OXC-induced hypothermia.

AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and its gingipain proteases contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis through yet unclear mechanisms. Cellular secretion of small extracellular vesicles or exosomes (EXO) increases with aging as part of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We have shown that EXO isolated from Pg-infected dendritic cells contain gingipains and other Pg antigens and transmit senescence to bystander gingival cells, inducing alveolar bone loss in mice in vivo. Here, EXO were isolated from the gingiva of mice and humans with/without periodontitis (PD) to determine their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro and in vivo. PD was induced by Pg oral gavage for 6 weeks in C57B6 mice. EXO isolated from the gingiva or brain of donor Pg-infected (PD EXO) or control animals (Con EXO) were characterized by NTA, Western blot, and TEM. Gingival PD EXO or Con EXO were labeled and injected into the gingiva of uninfected WT mouse model. EXO biodistribution in brains was tracked by an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) and confocal microscopy. The effect of human PD EXO on BBB integrity and permeability was examined using TEER and FITC dextran assays in a human in vitro 3D model of the BBB. Pg antigens (RGP and Mfa-1) were detected in EXO derived from gingival and brain tissues of donor Pg-infected mice. Orally injected PD EXO from donor mice penetrated the brains of recipient uninfected mice and colocalized with hippocampal microglial cells. IL-1 beta and IL-6 were expressed in human PD EXO and not in Con EXO. Human PD EXO promoted BBB permeability and penetrated the BBB in vitro. This is the first demonstration that microbial-induced EXO in the oral cavity can disseminate, cross the BBB, and may contribute to AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: Aluminum exerts neurotoxic effects through various mechanisms, mainly manifested as impaired learning and memory function. Methods: Forty SD rats were divided into 0, 10, 20, and 40 mM maltol aluminum [Al(mal)3] groups. Cell experiments are divided into 0, 100, 200, and 400 mu M Al(mal)3 dose group and control, Al(mal)3, Al (mal)3+inhibitor NC, Al(mal)3+miR-665 inhibitor intervention group. Water maze was used to detect the learning and memory function of rats, HE staining was used to observe the morphology and number of neurons in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus, Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of PC12 cells, PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of Caspase3, miR-665 and GNB3/PI3K/AKT proteins. The target binding relationship between miR-665 and GNB3 was verified by double luciferase reporter gene experiment. Results: In vivo experimental results showed that with the increase of Al(mal)3 concentration, the escape latency of rats was prolonged, the target quadrant dwell time was shortened, and the number of crossing platform was reduced. Moreover, the arrangement of neurons was loose and the number decreased; the expression of Caspase3 and miR-665 increased, while the expression of GNB3/PI3K/AKT proteins decreased. In vitro experiments, with the increase of Al(mal)3 concentration, apoptosis rate of PC12 cells increased, the expression of Caspase3, miR665 and GNB3/PI3K/AKT proteins were consistent with rat results. After inhibiting miR-665 in the intervention group experiment, apoptosis rate of PC12 cells in the aluminum exposure group decreased, the expression of Caspase3 and miR-665 decreased, and the expression of GNB3/PI3K/AKT proteins increased. Conclusion: MiR-665 plays an important role in aluminum induced neuronal apoptosis by targeting GNB3 and regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway.

AB  - Abnormal depolarization of neuronal membranes called paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS) represents a cellular correlate of interictal spikes. The mechanisms underlying the generation of PDSs or PDS clusters remain obscure. This study aimed to investigate the role of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) in the generation of PDS and dependence of the PDS pattern on neuronal membrane potential. We have shown that significant depolarization or hyperpolarization (by more than & PLUSMN;50 mV) of a single neuron does not change the number of individual PDSs in the cluster, indicating the involvement of an external stimulus in PDS induction. Based on this data, we have suggested reliable protocols for stimulating single PDS or PDS clusters. Furthermore, we have found that AMPA (& alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors are necessary for PDS generation since AMPAR antagonist NBQX completely suppresses bicuculline-induced paroxysmal activity. In turn, antagonists of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and kainate receptors (D-AP5 and UBP310, respectively) caused a decrease in the amplitude of the first action potential in PDSs and in the amplitude of the oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration occurring alongside the PDS cluster generation. The effects of the NMDAR (NMDA receptor) and KAR (kainate receptor) antagonists indicate that these receptors are involved only in the modulation of paroxysmal activity. We have also shown that agonists of some G(i)-coupled receptors, such as A(1) adenosine (A(1)Rs) or cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) (N-6-cyclohexyladenosine and WIN 55,212-2, respectively), completely suppressed PDS generation, while the A(1)R agonist even prevented it. We hypothesized that the dynamics of extracellular glutamate concentration govern paroxysmal activity. Fine-tuning of neuronal activity via action on G(i)-coupled receptors or iGluRs paves the way for the development of new approaches for epilepsy pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Saiga antelope horn (SAH), a rare traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits activities of anti-feverish convulsions and anti-inflammation, whereas its underlying mechanism and specific pharmacological components are still unclear. In the present study, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a major transient receptor potential cation channel was used as a target protein to identified TRPA1 high-affinity peptides (THPs) from SAH digests. Firstly, the SAH was digested under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions. With the method of affinity ultrafiltration and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (AUF-LC/MS), about 200 peptides that have a high-affinity interaction with the TRPA1 protein were screened from SAH digests. Subsequently, bioactivity databases and molecular docking were further exploited to identified three THPs, including RCWPDCR, FGFDGDF, and WFCEGSF. Furthermore, RIN-14B cells, characterized by the high expression of TRPA1 on cell surfaces, were used as the cell model to investigate the biological effect of THPs. Immunofluorescence and ELISA were conducted and showed that THPs can increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and serotonin (5-HT) secretion in RIN-14B cells by activating TRPA1, which is evidenced by impaired upregulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels and 5-HT secretion after pretreatment with the TRPA1 inhibitor (HC-030031). Moreover, an analysis of Western blots displayed that THPs up-regulated the expression levels of the 5-HT synthesis rate-limiting enzyme (TPH1) and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase (Ddc), while serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) levels were down-regulated, suggesting that THPs enhance 5-HT secretion by regulating the 5-HT synthesis pathway. In summary, our findings demonstrate that THPs, which were identified from SAH digest via TRPA1-targeted affinity panning, exhibited the activation of the TRPA1 channel and enhanced 5-HT release in RIN-14B cells.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess whether acute green tea (GT) supplementation attenuates inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers induced by high-fat, high-saturated (HFHS) meals in obese women, and to assess its ability to modulate circulating microRNA (miRNA) expression. This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. The study included obese women over 18 years old who had no comorbidities. In the first moment, patients were instructed to take 2 capsules of placebo or GT (738 mg) at 10:00 p.m. and to fast overnight. The next morning, a blood sample was collected, and an HFHS meal was offered to the patients. Another blood sample was collected 5 hours after the meal. In the second moment, patients who received placebo in the first moment now received the GT and vice-versa. Serum inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured, and circulating levels of miRNA were evaluated. Fifteen women with mean age of 35.5 +/- 9.9 years were included in the final analysis. There was no difference regarding inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers. However, patients who consumed GT had lower circulating expression of 62 miRNAs compared with patients who did not consume GT. Predictive analysis of target genes showed 1,757 targets regulated by the 62 miRNAs. Notably, 5 miRNAs (miR-1297, miR-192-5p, miR-373-3p, miR-595 and miR-1266-5p) regulate genes associated with TGF-beta, CARM1, RSK, and BMP pathways. Our study showed that GT inhibited the expression of miRNAs induced by HFHS meal intake. These results shed light on the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of GT ingestion.

AB  - Background Social recognition memory (SRM) is the ability to distinguish familiar from novel conspecifics and is crucial for survival and reproductive success across social species. We previously reported that oxytocin (OXT) receptor (OXTR) signaling in the CA2/CA3a of dorsal hippocampus is essential to promote the persistence of long-term SRM, yet how the endogenous OXT system influences CA2 outputs to regulate long-term SRM formation remains unclear. Methods To achieve a selective deletion of CA2 OXTRs, we crossed Amigo2-Cre mice with Oxtr-floxed mice to generate CA2-specific Oxtr conditional knockout (Oxtr(-/-)) mice. A three-chamber paradigm test was used for studying SRM in mice. Chemogenetic and optogenetic targeting strategies were employed to manipulate neuronal activity. Results We show that selective ablation of Oxtr in the CA2 suffices to impair the persistence of long-term SRM but has no effect on sociability and social novelty preference in the three-chamber paradigm test. We find that cell-type specific activation of OXT neurons within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus enhances long-term SRM and this enhancement is blocked by local application of OXTR antagonist L-368,899 into dorsal hippocampal CA2 (dCA2) region. In addition, chemogenetic neuronal silencing in dCA2 demonstrated that neuronal activity is essential for forming long-term SRM. Moreover, chemogenetic terminal-specific inactivation reveals a crucial role for dCA2 outputs to ventral CA1 (vCA1), but not dorsal lateral septum, in long-term SRM. Finally, targeted activation of the dCA2-to-vCA1 circuit effectively ameliorates long-term SRM deficit observed in Oxtr(-/-) mice. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of hippocampal CA2 OXTR signaling in governing the persistence of long-term SRM and identify a hippocampal circuit linking dCA2 to vCA1 necessary for controlling long-term SRM formation.

AB  - Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is an inflammatory protein with diverse functions in the brain. Although many studies have investigated the mechanism of LCN2 in brain injuries, the effect of LCN2 on amyloid-toxicity-related memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been less studied. We investigated the role of LCN2 in human AD patients using a mouse model of AD. We created an AD mouse model by injecting amyloid-beta oligomer (A beta O) into the hippocampus. In this model, animals exhibited impaired learning and memory. We found LCN2 upregulation in the human brain frontal lobe, as well as a positive correlation between white matter ischemic changes and serum LCN2. We also found increased astrocytic LCN2, microglia activation, iron accumulation, and blood-brain barrier disruption in A beta O-treated hippocampi. These findings suggest that LCN2 is involved in a variety of amyloid toxicity mechanisms, especially neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.

AB  - Chronic hypoxia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau is one of the two major pathological changes in AD. However, the effect of chronic hypoxia on tau phosphorylation and its mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of HIF-1 alpha (the functional subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor 1) in tau pathology. It was found that in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, global hypoxia (10% O-2, 6 h per day) for one month induced cognitive impairments. Meanwhile it induced HIF-1 alpha increase, tau hyperphosphorylation, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) deficiency with leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1(LCMT1, increasing PP2A activity) decrease in the rats' hippocampus. The results were replicated by hypoxic treatment in primary hippocampal neurons and C6/tau cells (rat C6 glioma cells stably expressing human full-length tau441). Conversely, HIF-1 alpha silencing impeded the changes induced by hypoxia, both in primary neurons and SD rats. The result of dual luciferase assay proved that HIF-1 alpha acted as a transcription factor of LCMT1. Unexpectedly, HIF-1 alpha decreased the protein level of LCMT1. Further study uncovered that both overexpression of HIF-1 alpha and hypoxia treatment resulted in a sizable degradation of LCMT1 via the autophagy--lysosomal pathway. Together, our data strongly indicated that chronic hypoxia upregulates HIF-1 alpha, which obviously accelerated LCMT1 degradation, thus counteracting its transcriptional expression. The increase in HIF-1 alpha decreases PP2A activity, finally resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive dysfunction. Lowering HIF-1 alpha in chronic hypoxia conditions may be useful in AD prevention.

AB  - Aims: Iron metabolism is involved in many biological processes in the brain. Alterations in iron homeostasis have been associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. Instead of stroke and ischemic heart disease, dementia has become the second leading cause of mortality among the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population. Therefore, we attempted to investigate the role of ferroptosis in diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DACD).
   Results: We evaluated ferroptosis hallmarks in the hippocampus of T2DM (high-fat diet/streptozotocin, HFD/STZ) mice, primary hippocampal neurons, as well as in the blood of patients. The results of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed significantly differentially expressed genes related to ferroptosis-related pathways between normal control (db/m) and leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice. Here, ferroptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment were revealed, and caveolin-1 (cav-1) was significantly downregulated in the hippocampus of T2DM (HFD/STZ) mice. In addition, ferrostatin-1 and cav-1 restoration neutralized ferroptosis-related symbolic changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and improved cognitive dysfunction. Notably, the plasma levels of Fe2+ and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in T2DM patients showed a tendency to increase compared with those in nondiabetic subjects, and the Fe2+ level was negatively correlated with the cognitive ability in T2DM subjects.
   Innovation: For the first time, this study suggested that ferroptosis promoted the progression of DACD induced by T2DM both in vivo and in vitro, and supported the clinical evidence for the correlation between ferroptosis and T2DM-related DACD, which provided new insights into the potential antioxidant effects of ferroptosis inhibitors and cav-1 on DACD.
   Conclusions: The overexpression of cav-1 may attenuate DACD by modulating neuronal ferroptosis-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis. We put cav-1 on the spotlight as a promising candidate to prevent DACD.

AB  - Iron is the dominant metal in the brain and is distributed widely. However, it can lead to various neuropathological and neurobehavioral abnormalities as well as oxidative stress. On the other hand, melatonin, a pineal hormone, is known for its neuroprotective properties, as well as its ability to act as a natural chelator against oxidative stress. It has also been used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic. The study investigated the potential of melatonin and EDTA treatment to prevent anxiety, depressive behavior, and memory impairment in male rats induced by chronic iron administration, and its connection to oxidative stress regulation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The rats were divided into six groups and intraperitoneally injected for 8 weeks with NaCl solution (control), iron sulfate (1 mg/kg), melatonin (4 mg/kg), EDTA (4 mg/kg), 1 mg/kg of iron + 4 mg/kg of melatonin, or 1 mg/kg of iron + 4 mg/kg of EDTA. In this study, we performed a neurobehavioral assessment and biochemical determinations of oxidative stress levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of each animal. The results indicate that chronic exposure to iron sulfate induced anxiety-like depressive behavior, and cognitive impairment also increased the levels of lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide, and reduced the activity of catalase in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in male Wistar rats, suggesting the induction of oxidative stress. In contrast, these alterations were reversed by melatonin better than EDTA. The results of this study show that melatonin protects against the neurobehavioral changes caused by iron, which may be associated with decreasing oxidative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

AB  - The quinoa protein is gaining global attraction due to high content of gluten-free protein. It is a rich source of high-quality protein with all essential amino acids. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant activity and alpha-glucosidase inhibition effect of bioactive peptides obtained from quinoa protein hydrolyzed by alcalase and trypsin. Peptides were fractionated using ultrafiltration with MW cut-off = 3, 10 kDa. The peptide concentration was evaluated using OPA solution and peptide bonds were studied by SDS-PAGE. The highest antioxidant activity obtained from quinoa bioactive peptides by alcalase and trypsin was observed after 0.5 h (10 kDa <=) and 4 h (3 kDa>), respectively. The highest alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity was observed in peptides with MW 3 kDa > when hydrolyzed by trypsin. The amino acid composition of the most effective samples has been determined. Comparing the results showed that MW and the composition of peptides influenced the studied traits. From the result of this study, it concluded that bioactive peptides obtained from quinoa protein could be used in functional food and supplements formulation.

AB  - 'Chungui' is a newly promoted tea cultivar in China, renowned for producing oolong tea with a distinctive jasmine-like aroma. However, the genetic basis of this unique aroma remains unclear. In this study, the 'Chungui' genome, one of the most complete and well-annotated tea genomes, was assembled using PacBio HiFi reads and Hi-C sequencing. Through comparative analysis with typical jasmine flower volatiles, eight core compounds responsible for this aroma were identified. Further research revealed that the jasmine-like aroma in 'Chungui' is regulated by a coordinated mechanism involving a significant increase in chromatin accessibility and the demethylation of CHH and CHG in the promoter regions of key aroma-related genes during oolong tea processing. The study proposes that the formation of this unique aroma is driven by the synergistic effect of enhanced chromatin accessibility and reduced methylation, which together lead to the robust upregulation of genes involved in the biosynthesis of these core aroma components. These results provide a molecular foundation for understanding the unique jasmine-like aroma of 'Chungui' tea and sets the stage for future studies to explore the roles of these regulatory mechanisms in aroma formation.

AB  - In the present study, a purified polysaccharide (named SCP-1, Mw 1.368 x 10(4) Da) was isolated from Sparassis crispa, and its biological activity was evaluated in an oxidative stress model caused by H2O2 in hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells. SCP-1 was a heteropolysaccharide mainly comprising glucose, galactose, fucose, and mannose in a molar ratio of 52.10: 31.10: 15.04: 1.76. The main backbone of SCP-1 was predominantly composed of (1 -> 6)-alpha-(D)-Galp, (1 -> 6)-beta-D-Glcp, (1 -> 3)-beta-D-Glcp, (1 -> 2,6)-alpha-D-Galp and (1 3,6)-beta-D-Glcp. The branches, substituted at the O-2 of Gal and O-3 of Glc, contained (1 -> 6)-2-OMe-alpha-D-Galp, (1 -> 4)-beta-D-Glcp, (1 -> 3)-beta-D-Glcp, and terminated by T-alpha-L-Fucp and T-beta-D-Glcp. Besides, SCP-1 could effectively protect the HT22 cells against H2O2-induced oxidative injury via decreasing the intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, modulating antioxidant enzymes, and reducing cell apoptosis. The findings suggested that SCP-1 holds a potential to be a natural antioxidant or as a neuroprotective agent.

AB  - This study explored the neuroprotective effects of honokiol against oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta 1) pathways in kainic acid (KA)-induced neurodegeneration in rats. The animals were divided into: control [Honokiol solvent (dimethyl sulphoxide), intraperitoneal for 7 days]; sham [single-dose KA solvent (saline, intracerebroventricular)]; KA (0,5 mu g/mu l, single-dose, intracerebroventricular); Honokiol [5 mg/kg-intraperitoneal) for 7 days]; and KA+Honokiol [KA single dose and Honokiol (for 7 days)]. Cerebral cortex and hippocampus tissues of the right hemispheres of rat brains were removed and examined biochemically and histopathologically. KA administration caused an increase in malondialdehyde levels and a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. In addition, interleukin-1 beta levels and TGF-beta 1 expression were increased. Honokiol treatment decreased malondialdehyde levels, increased SOD and GSH levels, increased interleukin-1 beta levels and improved TGF-beta 1 expression in rats. Our data showed Honokiol has a protective potential against kainic acid-induced neurodegeneration by suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation and TGF-beta 1 expression.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants leading to functional impairment of the MeCP2 protein. Here, we used purified recombinant MeCP2e1 and MeCP2e2 protein variants fused to a TAT protein transduction domain (PTD) to evaluate their transduction ability into RTT patient-derived fibroblasts and the ability to carry out their cellular function. We then assessed their transduction ability and therapeutic effects in a RTT mouse model. In vitro, TAT-MeCP2e2-eGFP reversed the pathological hyperacetylation of histones H3K9 and H4K16, a hallmark of abolition of MeCP2 function. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of TAT-MeCP2e1 and TAT-MeCP2e2 extended the lifespan of Mecp2-/y mice by > 50%. This was accompanied by rescue of hippocampal CA2 neuron size in animals treated with TAT-MeCP2e1. Taken together, these findings provide a strong indication that recombinant TAT-MeCP2 can reach mouse brains following peripheral injection and can ameliorate the phenotype of RTT mouse models. Thus, our study serves as a first step in the development of a potentially novel RTT therapy.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by hyperphosphorylation of tau, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-beta (A(3) plaques. Lead (Pb) exposure has been linked to an increased risk of AD and neuroinflammation. The purpose of this study is to determine if black soybean peptide (BSP1) may reduce neuroinflammation caused by Pb and associated AD-like pathology. Pb exposure was given to mouse hippocampus HT22 cells in the presence or absence of BSP1, positive control resveratrol (Rsv), or the SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527. Our findings suggest that BSP1 downregulates the expression of beta-secretase (BACE1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), inhibits tau phosphorylation, and reduces A(31-42 deposition. In addition, BSP1 effectively alleviated Pb-induced neuroinflammation by reducing the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1(3, TNF-alpha, NLRP3, and IL-18). BSP1 provides neuroprotective effect via phosphorylating LKB1 and AMPK, inhibiting mTOR signaling, and activating the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. These results suggest that BSP1 may be therapeutically beneficial for preventing or treating AD by reducing Pbinduced neuroinflammation.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION Which processes and transcription factors specify the first and second lineage segregation events during human preimplantation development? SUMMARY ANSWER Differentiation into trophectoderm (TE) cells can be initiated independently of polarity; moreover, TEAD1 and YAP1 co-localize in (precursor) TE and primitive endoderm (PrE) cells, suggesting a role in both the first and the second lineage segregation events. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY We know that polarity, YAP1/GATA3 signalling and phospholipase C signalling play a key role in TE initiation in compacted human embryos, however, little is known about the TEAD family of transcription factors that become activated by YAP1 and, especially, whether they play a role during epiblast (EPI) and PrE formation. In mouse embryos, polarized outer cells show nuclear TEAD4/YAP1 activity that upregulates Cdx2 and Gata3 expression while inner cells exclude YAP1 which upregulates Sox2 expression. The second lineage segregation event in mouse embryos is orchestrated by FGF4/FGFR2 signalling which could not be confirmed in human embryos; TEAD1/YAP1 signalling also plays a role during the establishment of mouse EPI cells. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Based on morphology, we set up a development timeline of 188 human preimplantation embryos between Day 4 and 6 post-fertilization (dpf). The compaction process was divided into three subgroups: embryos at the start (C0), during (C1), and at the end (C2) of, compaction. Inner cells were identified as cells that were entirely separated from the perivitelline space and enclosed by cellular contacts on all sides. The blastulation process was divided into six subgroups, starting with early blastocysts with sickle-cell shaped outer cells (B0) and further on, blastocysts with a cavity (B1). Full blastocysts (B2) showed a visible ICM and outer cells referred to as TE. Further expanded blastocysts (B3) had accumulated fluid and started to expand due to TE cell proliferation and zona pellucida (ZP) thinning. The blastocysts then significantly expanded further (B4) and started to hatch out of the ZP (B5) until they were fully hatched (B6). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS After informed consent and the expiration of the 5-year cryopreservation duration, 188 vitrified high quality eight-cell stage human embryos (3 dpf) were warmed and cultured until the required stages were reached. We also cultured 14 embryos that were created for research until the four- and eight-cell stage. The embryos were scored according to their developmental stage (C0-B6) displaying morphological key differences, rather than defining them according to their chronological age. They were fixed and immunostained for different combinations of cytoskeleton (F-actin), polarization (p-ERM), TE (GATA3), EPI (NANOG), PrE (GATA4 and SOX17), and members of the Hippo signalling pathway (YAP1, TEAD1 and TEAD4). We choose these markers based on previous observations in mouse embryos and single cell RNA-sequencing data of human embryos. After confocal imaging (LSM800, Zeiss), we analysed cell numbers within each lineage, different co-localization patterns and nuclear enrichment. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE We found that in human preimplantation embryos compaction is a heterogeneous process that takes place between the eight-cell to the 16-cell stages. Inner and outer cells are established at the end of the compaction process (C2) when the embryos contain up to six inner cells. Full apical p-ERM polarity is present in all outer cells of compacted C2 embryos.
   Co-localization of p-ERM and F-actin increases steadily from 42.2% to 100% of the outer cells, between C2 and B1 stages, while p-ERM polarizes before F-actin (P < 0.00001). Next, we sought to determine which factors specify the first lineage segregation event. We found that 19.5% of the nuclei stain positive for YAP1 at the start of compaction (C0) which increases to 56.1% during compaction (C1). At the C2 stage, 84.6% of polarized outer cells display high levels of nuclear YAP1 while it is absent in 75% of non-polarized inner cells. In general, throughout the B0-B3 blastocyst stages, polarized outer/TE cells are mainly positive for YAP1 and non-polarized inner/ICM cells are negative for YAP1. From the C1 stage onwards, before polarity is established, the TE marker GATA3 is detectable in YAP1 positive cells (11.6%), indicating that differentiation into TE cells can be initiated independently of polarity. Co-localization of YAP1 and GATA3 increases steadily in outer/TE cells (21.8% in C2 up to 97.3% in B3). Transcription factor TEAD4 is ubiquitously present throughout preimplantation development from the compacted stage onwards (C2-B6). TEAD1 displays a distinct pattern that coincides with YAP1/GATA3 co-localization in the outer cells. Most outer/TE cells throughout the B0-B3 blastocyst stages are positive for TEAD1 and YAP1. However, TEAD1 proteins are also detected in most nuclei of the inner/ICM cells of the blastocysts from cavitation onwards, but at visibly lower levels as compared to that in TE cells. In the ICM of B3 blastocysts, we found one main population of cells with NANOG+/SOX17-/GATA4- nuclei (89.1%), but exceptionally we found NANOG+/SOX17+/GATA4+ cells (0.8%). In seven out of nine B3 blastocysts, nuclear NANOG was found in all the ICM cells, supporting the previously reported hypothesis that PrE cells arise from EPI cells. Finally, to determine which factors specify the second lineage segregation event, we co-stained for TEAD1, YAP1, and GATA4. We identified two main ICM cell populations in B4-6 blastocysts: the EPI (negative for the three markers, 46.5%) and the PrE (positive for the three markers, 28.1%) cells. We conclude that TEAD1 and YAP1 co-localise in (precursor) TE and PrE cells, indicating that TEAD1/YAP1 signalling plays a role in the first and the second lineage segregation events. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION In this descriptive study, we did not perform functional studies to investigate the role of TEAD1/YAP1 signalling during the first and second lineage segregation events. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Our detailed roadmap on polarization, compaction, position and lineage segregation events during human preimplantation development paves the way for further functional studies. Understanding the gene regulatory networks and signalling pathways involved in early embryogenesis could ultimately provide insights into why embryonic development is sometimes impaired and facilitate the establishment of guidelines for good practice in the IVF lab.

AB  - Abnormal assembly of amyloid beta (A beta) in the brain is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with cognitive impairments. Since A beta accumulation occurs in advance of the onset of clinical symptoms, identifying preventable drug candidates regulating A beta accumulation is regarded as a promising approach in AD therapeutic. Herein, we synthesized eight Yonsei Institute of pharmaceutical sciences Alzheimer's Drug (YIAD) compounds based on 5- benzyl-6-phenylbenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrrolo[ 2,1-c]pyrazine structures. Subsequently, YIAD-0203 and YIAD-0205 were selected as effective candidates via thioflavin T assays and gel electrophoresis. The potential therapeutic effect of YIAD-0203 and YIAD-0205 on A beta aggregates was investigated through an AD transgenic mouse model with five familial AD mutations (5XFAD) by oral gavage. Significant amounts of A beta plaque and oligomer reduction were observed in the hippocampus region of both 4.3-month-old (early stage of AD) and 6.0-month-old (mid stage of AD) YIAD-0205-treated 5XFAD mice brains when compared to the nontreated brains. The ability of YIAD-0205 to ameliorate A beta aggregates in the early and mid stages of AD progression supports the notion that YIAD-0205 could be utilized as a reliable scaffold for the development of preventive AD drug candidates.

AB  - Over the past few decades, osteoarthritis (OA) has been a major health problem worldwide. It is urgent to develop new, effective, and safe drugs to treat OA. There are many pentacyclic triterpenoids in nature that are safe and have health benefits. Oleanolic acid (OLA), one of the pentacyclic triterpenoids, is a potential novel compound for treating OA; however, its mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, the mechanism of resistance to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation of OLA and its protective role in the amelioration of OA were investigated by in vivo and in vitro experiments. We found that OLA promoted interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)-induced production of type II collagen (collagen II) in rat chondrocytes, decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-13, and inhibited inflammatory cytokine (IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha) and cartilage marker (CTX-II and COMP) levels, thereby hindering the pathological process of cartilage. Mechanistically, OLA inhibited the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, activated the Hippo/YAP pathway, and hampered the ECM degradation process by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and YAP. When we knocked down beta-catenin, OLA lost its stimulatory effect on the Hippo pathway. These findings confirm that OLA plays an anti-ECM degradation role by regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways. Overall, this study provides a theoretical basis for developing highly effective and low-toxic natural products for the prevention and treatment of OA.

TI  - MeCP2 inhibits ischemic neuronal injury by enhancing methylation of the FOXO3a promoter to repress the SPRY2-ZEB1 axis
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MEDICINE

KW  - BRAIN
KW  - STROKE
AB  - Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is involved in nerve regeneration following ischemic stroke, but the related mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found low MeCP2 expression in hippocampal tissues. Using functional analysis, we demonstrated that MeCP2 accelerated FOXO3a methylation and subsequently inhibited its expression, thus repressing the apoptosis of neuronal cells. Mechanistically, FOXO3a could bind to the promoter region of SPRY2, consequently inducing its transcription and promoting the expression of the downstream target gene ZEB1. Altogether, our study revealed that overexpression of MeCP2 can protect mice against ischemic brain injury via disruption of the FOXO3a/SPRY2/ZEB1 signaling axis. Our results identify ectopic expression of MeCP2 as a therapeutic target in ischemic stroke.
   Stroke: Preventing nerve cell damage The finding that an essential DNA-binding protein is present at reduced levels in the nerve cells of mice that have suffered ischemic strokes (IS), strokes caused by blockages in the blood supply to brain tissues, suggests new possibilities for treatment. Guangyu Zhao and colleagues at Shandong First Medical University in Jinan, China, propose that finding ways to stimulate increased production of the protein, called MeCP2, might help protect against and repair the nerve cell damage associated with IS. The authors suggest that MECP2's nerve-regenerating effects involve enhanced addition of methyl groups (CH3) to a specific gene-regulating site on DNA. This represses a well-known molecular signaling pathway called the FOXO3a/SPRY2/ZEB1 axis. Further investigating these mechanisms and learning how to influence them should help clarify the possible clinical significance of these findings.

AB  - Epidemiologic study suggests that nicotine reduces the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) and thus could serve as a potential treatment. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of nicotine on the behavioral phenotypes and pathological characteristics of mice induced by human alpha-synuclein preformed fibers (alpha-syn-PFF). Mice were injected with 5 mu g of human alpha-syn-PFF in the hippocampus while administering nicotine-containing drinking water (200 mu g/mL). After 1 month, the motor ability, mood, spatial learning, and memory ability of the PD phenotype-like model mice were detected using open field, rotarod, Y maze, and O maze tests. The expression of pathological alpha-syn and apoptotic proteins, as well as the number of glial and neural stem cells in the hippocampus of mice, was detected using western blot and immunofluorescence. The results demonstrated that nicotine significantly reduced pathological alpha-syn accumulation, alpha-syn serine 129 phosphorylation, and apoptosis induced by alpha-syn-PFF injection in the hippocampus of mice. Nicotine also inhibited the increase in the number of glia, microglia, and neuronal apoptotic cells, and it decreased the expression of PI3K and Akt while also exhibiting significant memory impairment, motor deficits, and anxiety-like behavior. In conclusion, our findings suggest that nicotine ameliorates behavioral deficits and pathological changes in mice by inhibiting human alpha-syn-PFF-induced neuroinflammation and apoptosis.

AB  - Multivariable cis-Mendelian randomization (cis-MVMR) has become an effective approach for identifying therapeutic targets that influence disease susceptibility. However, biases from invalid instruments, such as weak instruments and horizontal pleiotropy, remain unsolved. In this paper, we propose a new method called the cis-Mendelian randomization bias correction estimating equation (cis-MRBEE), which mitigates weak instrument bias by leveraging a local sparse genetic architecture: most variants within a genomic region are associated with a trait through linkage disequilibrium with a few causal variants. Cis-MRBEE identifies causal variants or proxies of exposures via fine-mapping, re-estimates genetic associations using the identified variants, and applies a double-penalized minimization to estimate causal exposures and account for horizontal pleiotropic effects. Simulations showed that in the presence of weak instruments and horizontal pleiotropy, directly adapting standard MVMR methods to cis-MVMR was infeasible, and existing cis-MVMR methods failed to control type I errors. In contrast, cis-MRBEE exhibited robustness to these sources of bias. We applied cis-MRBEE to the ANGPTL3 locus and identified a credible set comprising APOA1, APOC1, and PCSK9 as likely causal proteins for LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG. The subsequent analysis revealed a complex protein regulation network that influenced lipid traits. Furthermore, we used cis-MRBEE to discover that the expressions of CR1 in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and oligodendrocytes were potentially causal for Alzheimer's disease and its biomarkers, A$\beta $42 and pTau, in cerebrospinal fluid.

AB  - Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced injury is a common phenomenon of stroke. The pathogenesis and effective treatment of I/R-induced brain tissue damage is limited. In this study, the rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and the cell model of oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) were applied to investigate the possible role of the microRNA in ischemic stroke. MCAO/R and OGD/R caused the downregulation of miR-203a-3p and miR-153-3p, the upregulation of SRC. SRC was identified to be a common target for miR-203a-3p and miR-153-3p. Both miR203a-3p and miR-153-3p inhibited SRC expression at the mRNA and protein levels. miR-203a-3p and miR-1533p improved the cognitive deficits through targeting SRC. Moreover, miR-203a-3p and miR-153-3p relieved the apoptosis, decreases NLRP3 inflammasome activity, decreases oxidative stress and inflammation in hippocampal neuron through targeting SRC. Moreover, the MAPK signaling pathway was confirmed to be the downstream for miR-203a-3p and miR-153-3p in vivo and in vitro. Thus, miR-203a-3p and miR-153-3p confers neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke via attenuation of apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways through inhibiting SRC-dependent MAPK signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro, suggesting new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of stroke.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CI/R) injury is a serious central nervous system disease. Propofol (PPF) exerts a neuroprotective effect in CI/R injury; the underlying cause is still unclear. Here, we cultured mouse hippocampal neuron (HT22 cells) in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) conditions to mimic CI/R injury in vitro. PPF treatment promoted cell viability and reduced apoptotic cells in the OGD/R-treated HT22 cells, which was effectively abrogated by SNHG14 overexpression. Moreover, we constructed a CI/R injury mouse model on CS7BL/6J mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R), followed by administration of PPF. PPF reduced neuronal damage and loss, enhanced glial cell hyperplasia, and ameliorated cerebral cortex tissue damage and brain infarct in MCAO/R-induced mice. SNHG14 overexpression aggravated MCAO/R-induced CI/R injury in mice. Furthermore, SNHG14 promoted the expression of AtgS and Beclin 1 via competitively binding miR-30b-5p, which contributed to activate autophagy and apoptosis in HT22 cells. In addition, the levels of p-p38 and p-SP1 were reduced in the OGD/R-treated HT22 cells in the presence of PPF. SP1 interacted with the promoter of SNHG14 and elevated the expression of SNHG14. PPF treatment inhibited the SP1- mediated up-regulation of SNHG14. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that PPF inhibits SNHG14 expression though the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. SNHG14 promotes AtgS and Beclin 1 expression by sponging miR-30b-Sp and thus activates autophagy and aggravates Cl/R injury.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the anti-amnesic effect of the aqueous extract of powdered green tea (matcha) (EM) in particulate matter (PM)(2.5)-induced systemic inflammation in BALB/c mice. EM ameliorated spatial learning and memory function, short-term memory function, and long-term learning and memory function in PM2.5-induced mice. EM protected against antioxidant deficit in pulmonary, dermal, and cerebral tissues. In addition, EM improved the cholinergic system through the regulation of acetylcholine (ACh) levels and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain tissue, and it protected mitochondrial dysfunction by regulating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP contents in brain tissue. EM attenuated systemic inflammation and apoptotic signaling in pulmonary, dermal, olfactory bulb, and hippocampal tissues. Moreover, EM suppressed neuronal cytotoxicity and cholinergic dysfunction in hippocampal tissue. This study suggests that EM might be a potential substance to improve PM2.5-induced cognitive dysfunction via the regulation of systemic inflammation.

AB  - Microcapsules laden with camellia oil (CO), utilizing rice porous starch (PS) as the core material carrier, were successfully prepared through spray drying, employing whey protein isolate (WPI) and maltodextrin (MD) as composite wall materials. This study delved into the rheological characteristics, zeta potential, and physical stability of the CO emulsions. The results indicated a notable reduction in the apparent viscosity of the CO emulsions upon the incorporation of MD. During the WPI and MD compounding process, the W7M3 emulsions system exhibited optimal particle interactions, deformation resistance, and physical stability. Furthermore, the formation process, structural properties, and in vitro simulated digestion and release behaviors of various PS- based CO microcapsules were characterized. The encapsulation efficacy and physicochemical attributes of CO were closely associated with the characteristics of the PS carriers. FT-IR analyses confirmed the encapsulation of the essential oil in microcapsule form. PS-based microcapsules possessed a higher thermal stability. During the in vitro simulated digestion and release process, the gastric release of PS-based CO microcapsules was delayed, while the intestinal release was relatively gradual, exhibiting a superior sustained release effect. The final release amount of CO ranged between 82.60 % and 91.18 %.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one endogenous metabolic molecule that functions as a regulator in glucose and lipid homeostasis. However, the effect of FGF21 on L-lactate homeostasis and its mechanism remains unclear until now. Forty-five Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: control, L-lactate, and FGF21 (1.5 mg/kg) groups. At the end of the treatment, nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics, and key proteins related to L-lactate homeostasis were determined respectively to evaluate the efficacy of FGF21 and its mechanisms. The results showed that, compared to the vehicle group, the L-lactate-treated mice displayed learning and memory performance impairments, as well as reduced hippocampal ATP and NADH levels, but increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, which suggesting inhibited L-lactate-pyruvate conversion in the brain. Conversely, FGF21 treatment ameliorated the L-lactate accumulation state, accompanied by restoration of the learning and memory defects, indicating enhanced L-lactate uptake and utilization in hippocampal neurons. We demonstrated that maintaining constant L-lactate-pyruvate flux is essential for preserving neuronal bioenergetic and redox levels. FGF21 contributed to preparing the brain for situations of high availability of L-lactate, thus preventing neuronal vulnerability in metabolic reprogramming.

AB  - Peperomia campylotropa (Piperaceae) is a species with a traditional Mexican gastroprotective use that has never-before been studied using metabolomics. This study explores the ethnobotanical use of the species, aiming to define the gastroprotective effect of the aqueous extract and characterize its secondary metabolites by UHPLC-MS analysis. To validate its use, we botanically identified the species re-collected in the Municipality of Buenavista de Cu & eacute;llar, Guerrero, Mexico. We conducted interviews to provide evidence of the traditional details of its consumption and knowledge. Subsequently, qualitative phytochemical tests were performed to elucidate the possible secondary metabolites, which were also characterized under UHPLC-MS analysis and analyzed according to their primary type and retention times. Indomethacin (IND)- and ethanol (EtOH)-induced gastric damage models in Wistar rats were used for pharmacological evaluation, considering the ulceration index and gastroprotection percentage. Along with the participation in the mechanism of action of nitric oxide (NO), sulfhydryl (-SH) groups and prostaglandins (PG) were elucidated by Wistar rats pretreated with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), and IND, respectively. Acute intragastric toxicity was also estimated in NIH female mice. Ninety people were interviewed, revealing the traditional knowledge of P. campylotropa as food and medicine for stomach diseases, including irritation and indigestion. The presence of phenolic compounds (48%), N-containing compounds (22%), glycosides (21%), terpenoids (7%), and lactones (4%) were verified by preliminary phytochemical analysis and by UHPLC-MS in which 162 secondary metabolites were characterized. Besides that, the aqueous extract at 62.5, 125, and 250 mg/kg of body weight (b.w.) decreased the ulcerative index, showing gastroprotection percentages between 60 and 80%, similar to that of omeprazole. Furthermore, -SH group participation in its activity was established. All this evidence supports the gastroprotective activity of P. campylotropa for the first time and contributes to understanding its secondary metabolite content.

AB  - In this study, two acidic Biluochun Tea polysaccharides (BTP-A11 and BTP-A12) were investigated comparatively, which mainly consisted of Rha, Ara, Gal and GalA, possibly suggesting their pectic nature. Structurally, their galacturonan backbones composed of -> 4)-alpha-D-GalpA-(1 -> and -> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -> were revealed similar, while Ara-and Gal-based branches attached to the O-2 of -> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -> were in distinctive types, proportions, extensibilities and branching degrees. This could lead to their different macromolecular characteristics, where BTP-A(11) with higher M-w presented a more hyper-branched chain conformation and relatively higher structural flexibility/compactness, thereby resulting in a lower exclusion effect and an insufficient hydrodynamic volume. Besides, better radical scavenging activities in vitro were also determined for Gal-enriched BTP-A(11), where a larger surface area containing more H-donating groups were related to its higher Mw, more hyper-branched conformation, lower DM and higher DA. Therefore, the understanding of structure-property-activity relationships was improved to some degrees for acidic Biluochun Tea polysaccharides, which could be potentially required for more applications in food, medical and cosmetic fields.

AB  - Diabetic skin disorders are lingering and refractory clinical diseases. In this study, a genipin-crosslinked porous chitosan fiber (CSF) hydrogel was fabricated to achieve rapid wound healing. By embedding clemastine fumarate (CF) in the CSF hydrogel pores, we synthesised a CSF/CF hydrogel for the treatment of diabetic wounds. The microstructure, chemical elements, spectral variation, mechanical properties, swelling ratios, degradability, and toxicity of the CSF/CF hydrogels were studied. Compared with the typical CS power hydrogel, the porous CSF hydrogel crosslinked with genipin possesses a stable structure and improved physicochemical properties. Moreover, CF was slowly released from the CSF hydrogel. Molecular simulation also showed that CF was evenly embedded inside the cavity formed by the novel CSF hydrogel. The results suggested that CF can resist damage from high glucose levels and promote proliferation, tube formation, and migration of endothelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts. The CSF/CF hydrogel promoted wound healing in a rat model. Mechanistically, the beneficial effect of CF on wound healing may be related to activation of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways. In conclusion, genipin-crosslinked CSF/CF hydrogel can accelerate wound healing and may be an effective thera-peutic method for treating diabetic skin lesions.

AB  - BackgroundPrevious studies have implicated hippocampal abnormalities in the neuropathology of psychosis spectrum disorders. Reduced hippocampal volume has been reported across all illness stages, and this atrophy has been hypothesized to be the result of glutamatergic excess. To test this hypothesis, we measured hippocampal subfield volumes and hippocampal glutamate levels in antipsychotic na & iuml;ve first episode psychosis patients (FEP) and the progression of volume decline and changes in glutamate levels over a 16-week antipsychotic drug (APD) trial. We aimed to determine if subfield volumes at baseline were associated with glutamate levels, and if baseline glutamate levels were predictive of change in subfield volumes over time.MethodsWe enrolled ninety-three medication-na & iuml;ve FEP participants and 80 matched healthy controls (HC). T1 and T2 weighted images and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data from a voxel prescribed in the left hippocampus were collected from participants at baseline and after 6 and 16 weeks of APD treatment. Hippocampal subfield volumes were assessed using FreeSurfer 7.1.1., while glutamate levels were quantified using jMRUI version 6.0. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models.ResultsWe found regional subfield volume deficits in the CA1, and presubiculum in FEP at baseline, that further expanded to include the molecular and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC/ML/DG) and CA4 by week 16. Baseline hippocampal glutamate levels in FEP were not significantly different than those of HC, and there was no effect of treatment on glutamate. Glutamate levels were not related to initial subfield volumes or volume changes over 16 weeks.ConclusionWe report a progressive loss of hippocampal subfield volumes over a period of 16 weeks after initiation of treatment, suggestive of early progression in neuropathology. Our results do not suggest a role for glutamate as a driving factor. This study underscores the need to further research the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon as it has implications for early intervention to preserve cognitive decline in FEP participants.

AB  - Glycogen synthase kinase-3I3 (GSK-3I3) is an important serine/threonine kinase that implicates in multiple cellular processes and links with the neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer???s disease (AD). In this study, structure-based virtual screening was performed to search database for compounds targeting GSK-3I3 from Enamine???s screening collection. Of the top-ranked compounds, 7 primary hits underwent a luminescent kinase assay and a cell assay using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing Tau repeat domain (TauRD) with pro-aggregant mutation ??K280. In the kinase assay for these 7 compounds, residual GSK-3I3 activities ranged from 36.1% to 90.0% were detected at the IC50 of SB-216763. In the cell assay, only compounds VB-030 and VB-037 reduced Tau aggregation in SH-SY5Y cells expressing ??K280 TauRD-DsRed folding reporter. In SH-SY5Y cells expressing ??K280 TauRD, neither VB-030 nor VB-037 increased expression of GSK-3a Ser21 or GSK-3I3 Ser9. Among extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (P38) and mitogenactivated protein kinase 8 (JNK) which modulate Tau phosphorylation, VB-037 attenuated active phosphorylation of P38 Thr180/ Tyr182, whereas VB-030 had no effect on the phosphorylation status of ERK, AKT, P38 or JNK. However, both VB-030 and VB-037 reduced endogenous Tau phosphorylation at Ser202, Thr231, Ser396 and Ser404 in neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y expressing ??K280 TauRD. In addition, VB-030 and VB-037 further improved neuronal survival and/or neurite length and branch in mouse hippocampal primary culture under Tau cytotoxicity. Overall, through inhibiting GSK-3I3 kinase activity and/or p-P38 (Thr180/Tyr182), both compounds may serve as promising candidates to reduce Tau aggregation/cytotoxicity for AD treatment.

AB  - Linagliptin is a selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that indirectly elevates the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level. The aim of the present study was to check whether linagliptin has an influence on neurotransmission in rat brain. Rats were acutely and chronically exposed to linagliptin (10 and 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)). Twenty-four hours later, the striatum and hippocampus were selected for further studies. In neurochemical experiments, using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED), the concentrations of three major neurotransmitters-dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline-and their metabolites were measured. The analysis of mRNA expression of dopamine (D1 and D2), serotonin (5-HT-1 and 5-HT-2) and noradrenaline (alpha 1 and alpha 2a) receptors was also investigated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in the same brain areas. Linagliptin has the ability to influence the dopaminergic system. In the striatum, the elevation of dopamine and its metabolites was observed after repeated administration of that linagliptin, and in the hippocampus, a reduction in dopamine metabolism was demonstrated. Acute linagliptin exposure increases the serotonin level in both areas, while after chronic linagliptin administration a tendency for the mRNA expression of serotoninergic receptors (5-HT1A and 5-HT2A) to increase was observed. A single instance of exposure to linagliptin significantly modified the noradrenaline level in the striatum and intensified noradrenaline turnover in the hippocampus. The recognition of the interactions in the brain between DPP-4 inhibitors and neurotransmitters and/or receptors is a crucial step for finding novel discoveries in the pharmacology of DPP-4 inhibitors and raises hope for further applications of DPP-4 inhibitors in clinical practices.

AB  - Age-related neurodegeneration is characterized by oxidative stress and iron-dependent cell death, yet the neuroprotective mechanisms of folic acid in modulating ferroptosis remain unclear. This study systematically investigated the role of folic acid in inhibiting ferroptosis and attenuating neuronal damage in aging, with a focus on the solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11)-glutathione (GSH)-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) antioxidant pathway, using aged rats supplemented with folic acid (<0.1, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/kg<middle dot>diet) for 22 months, with young adult rats as controls. Brain iron accumulation and ferroptosis-related proteins (SLC7A11, GPX4, Ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1)) were evaluated. In vitro, HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells were pre-treated with folic acid (0, 10, 20 mu mol/L) for 72 h before combining with Erastin (10 mu mol/L)-induced ferroptosis for an additional 24 h. Intracellular Fe2+, lipid peroxidation (LPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with cystine, GSH, and ferroptosis-related protein levels were quantified. Stable sh-SLC7A11 knockdown and control (sh-NC) cell lines were used to validate the dependency of folic acid's protective effects on SLC7A11 expression. Folic acid supplementation in aged rats dose-dependently reduced aging-related brain iron accumulation and enhanced the expression of SLC7A11, GPX4, and FTH1. In Erastin-induced HT-22 cells, folic acid significantly mitigated ferroptosis hallmarks. Mechanistically, folic acid increased extracellular cystine uptake and intracellular GSH synthesis, thereby activating the SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 antioxidant pathway. Notably, molecular docking technique suggested that compared to GPX4, folic acid stabilized SLC7A11's active conformation. sh-SLC7A11 knockdown completely abolished folic acid-mediated protection against ferroptosis, as evidenced by restored loss of cystine, GSH and GPX4 production. This study innovatively emphasized the critical role of folic acid supplementation in inhibiting ferroptosis by up-regulating the SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 antioxidant pathway, primarily through enhancing cystine availability and SLC7A11 expression. These findings established folic acid as a potential dietary intervention for aging-related neurodegenerative diseases characterized by neuronal ferroptosis, providing preclinical evidence for folic acid based neuroprotection.

AB  - Serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with aggression in several psychiatric disorders. Human aggression is a continuum of traits, ranging from normal to pathological phenomena. However, the individual differences in serotonergic neurotransmission and their relationships with aggression traits in healthy individuals remain unclear. In this study, we explored the relationship between 5-HT2A receptor availability in vivo and aggression traits in healthy participants. Thirty-three healthy participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]MDL100907, a selective radioligand for 5-HT2A receptors. To quantify 5-HT2A receptor availability, the binding potential (BPND) was derived using the basis function implementation of the simplified reference tissue model, with the cerebellum as the reference region. The participants' aggression levels were assessed using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. The voxel-based correlation analysis with age and sex as covariates revealed that the total aggression score was significantly positively correlated with [11C]MDL100907 BPND in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) pole, left fusiform gyrus (FUSI), right parahippocampal gyrus, and right hippocampus. The physical aggression subscale score had significant positive correlations with [11C]MDL100907 BPND in the left olfactory cortex, left orbital superior frontal gyrus (SFG), right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, left orbitomedial SFG, left gyrus rectus, left MTG, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left angular gyrus. The verbal aggression subscale score showed significant positive correlations with [11C]MDL100907 BPND in the bilateral SFG, right medial SFG, left FUSI, and right MTG pole. Overall, our findings suggest the possibility of positive correlations between aggression traits and in vivo 5-HT2A receptor availability in healthy individuals. Future research should incorporate multimodal neuroimaging to investigate the downstream effects of 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling and integrate molecular and systems-level information in relation to aggression traits.

AB  - For early detection of Alzheimer's disease, it is important to find biomarkers with predictive value for disease progression and clinical manifestations, such as cognitive decline. Individuals can now be profiled based on their biomarker status for A beta 42 (A) or tau (T) deposition and neurodegeneration (N). The aim of this study was to compare the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging (PET/MR) biomarkers in each ATN category and to assess their ability to predict longitudinal cognitive decline. A subset of 282 patients, who had had at the same time PET investigations with amyloid-beta and tau tracers, CSF sampling, and structural MRI (18% within 13 months), was selected from the ADNI dataset. The participants were grouped by clinical diagnosis at that time: cognitively normal, subjective memory concern, early or late mild cognitive impairment, or AD. Agreement between CSF (amyloid-beta-1-42(A), phosphorylated-Tau181(T), total-Tau(N)), and imaging (amyloid-beta PET (florbetaben and florbetapir)(A), tau PET (flortaucipir)(T), hippocampal volume (MRI)(N)) positivity in ATN was assessed with Cohen's Kappa. Linear mixed-effects models were used to predict decline in the episodic memory. There was moderate agreement between PET and CSF for A biomarkers (Kappa = 0.39-0.71), while only fair agreement for T biomarkers (Kappa <= 0.40, except AD) and discordance for N biomarkers across all groups (Kappa <= 0.14) was found. Baseline PET tau predicted longitudinal decline in episodic memory irrespective of CSF p-Tau181 positivity (p <= 0.02). Baseline PET tau and amyloid-beta predicted decline in episodic memory (p <= 0.0001), but isolated PET amyloid-beta did not. Isolated PET Tau positivity was only observed in 2 participants (0.71% of the sample). While results for amyloid-beta were similar using CSF or imaging, CSF and imaging results for tau and neurodegeneration were not interchangeable. PET tau positivity was superior to CSF p-Tau181 and PET amyloid-beta in predicting cognitive decline in the AD continuum within 3 years of follow-up.

AB  - The branched architecture of neuronal dendrites is a key factor in how neurons form ordered networks and discoveries continue to be made identifying proteins and protein-protein interactions that direct or execute the branching and extension of dendrites. Our prior work showed that the molecular scaffold Pdlim5 and delta-catenin, in conjunction, are two proteins that help regulate the branching and elongation of dendrites in cultured hippocampal neurons and do so through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism triggered by upstream glutamate signaling. In this report we have focused on Pdlim5's multiple scaffolding domains and how each contributes to dendrite branching. The three identified regions within Pdlim5 are the PDZ, DUF, and a trio of LIM domains; however, unresolved is the intra-molecular conformation of Pdlim5 as well as which domains are essential to regulate dendritic branching. We address Pdlim5's structure and function by examining the role of each of the domains individually and using deletion mutants in the context of the full-length protein. Results using primary hippocampal neurons reveal that the Pdlim5 DUF domain plays a dominant role in increasing dendritic branching. Neither the PDZ domain nor the LIM domains alone support increased branching. The central role of the DUF domain was confirmed using deletion mutants in the context of full-length Pdlim5. Guided by molecular modeling, additional domain mapping studies showed that the C-terminal LIM domain forms a stable interaction with the N-terminal PDZ domain, and we identified key amino acid residues at the interface of each domain that are needed for this interaction. We posit that the central DUF domain of Pdlim5 may be subject to modulation in the context of the full-length protein by the intra-molecular interaction between the N-terminal PDZ and C-terminal LIM domains. Overall, our studies reveal a novel mechanism for the regulation of Pdlim5's function in the regulation of neuronal branching and highlight the critical role of the DUF domain in mediating these effects.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders. The etiology and pathological mechanisms of ASD are still unknown, and its prognosis is poor. This study investigated the effects of selenium (Se) supplementation on abnormal behavior and cognitive function in ASD model mice, as well as the potential action pathways. BTBR mice were randomly assigned to either a model group (BTBR group), a model selenium supplement group (BTBR+Se group), a normal control group (B6 group) or a normal selenium supplement group (B6+Se group). Sodium selenite, at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, was administered to the selenium supplementation groups by gavage. The mice in the BTBR group and the B6 group received the same amount of 0.9% saline by gavage. After 4 weeks of continuous intervention, the social functions and cognitive behaviors of the mice and the selenium concentration in hippocampal tissue were assessed. Hippocampal tissue structures were observed. Changes in neurotransmitter levels, oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory indicators were detected. Se1P protein expression was significantly lower in hippocampal tissue from BTBR mice than in hippocampal tissue from B6 mice. The administration of sodium selenite in BTBR mice: (1) increased the expression of SelP; (2) attenuated spatial learning, memory impairment and improved social behaviors; (3) changed the serum levels of 5-HT, DA and Glu; (4) decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, and IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha in serum and hippocampal tissue; (5) reduced the ROS and MDA contents and significantly increased SOD activity, CAT activity, GSH-px activity, and antioxidant GSH levels; and (6) protected against neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Se supplementation significantly improved the social functioning, repetitive stereotyped behavior and cognitive function in BTBR mice. Se may play a protective role in the hippocampus of BTBR mice by regulating neurotransmitter levels, reducing oxidative stress, alleviating neuroinflammation and rescuing neural cell damage.

AB  - In previous studies, we isolated a series of novel gentisides with nerve growth factor (NGF)-mimic activities from Gentiana rigescens Franch and conducted continuous structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Recently, a lead compound named TBG096 was discovered with significant NGF-mimic activity, low toxicity, and ability to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). At the cell level, TBG096 exerts NGF-mimic activity by regulation of heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) and downstream proteins. Subsequently, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced Alzheimer disease (AD) mouse models were used to evaluate the anti-AD efficacy of the compound. TBG096 significantly improved the memory dysfunction of AD mice at doses of 0.1, 5, and 20 mg/kg, respectively. In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of the compound against AD, the RNA-sequence analysis of transcriptomics, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot analysis were performed using animal samples. TBG096 significantly increased the expression of the Wnt gene family (Wnt10b, Wnt5a, and Wnt1) and the number of mature neurons and newborn neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of AD mice, respectively. At the same time, it reduced the activity of microglia, astrocyte cells, and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS) in the brain. Moreover, this compound significantly increased phosphorylated-adenosine 5 '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Hsc70, and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a (LAMP2A) and decreased the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), amyloid precursor protein (APP), microtubule-associated protein tau (Tau), phosphoryl-Tau, and beta-amyloid (A beta) at the protein level. These results suggest that TBG096 produced the NGF-mimic activity and the anti-AD effect via promoting neurogenesis and modification of the Hsc70/HK2/PKM2/LAMP2A signaling pathway, proposing a potential novel approach to counteracting cognitive decline by developing small molecules that promote neurogenesis and the Hsc70 signaling pathway.

AB  - Recently, we have shown the differences in the early response of corticosterone and inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and frontal cortex (FC) of rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), according to the methods of Longa et al. (LM) and Koizumi et al. (KM) which were used as alternatives in preclinical studies to induce stroke in rodents. In the present study, corticosterone and proinflammatory cytokines were assessed 3 months after MCAO. The most relevant changes detected during the first days after MCAO became even more obvious after 3 months. In particular, the MCAO-KM (but not the MCAO-LM) group showed significant accumulation of corticosterone and IL1 beta in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus and FC. An accumulation of TNF alpha was detected in the ipsilateral hippocampus and FC in the MCAO-KM group. Thus, unlike the MCAO-LM, the MCAO-KM may predispose the hippocampus and FC of rats to long-lasting bilateral corticosterone-dependent distant neuroinflammatory damage. Unexpectedly, only the MCAO-LM rats demonstrated some memory deficit in a one-trial step-through passive avoidance test. The differences between the two MCAO models, particularly associated with the long-lasting increase in glucocorticoid and proinflammatory cytokine accumulation in the limbic structures in the MCAO-KM, should be considered in the planning of preclinical experiments, and the interpretation and translation of received results.

AB  - Bipolar-disorder's pathophysiology and the mechanism by which medications exert their beneficial effect is yet unknown, but others' and our data implicate patients' brain mitochondrial-dysfunction and its amendment by mood-stabilizers. We recently designed a novel mouse bipolar-disorder-like model using chronic administration of a low-dose of the oxidative-phosphorylation complex I inhibitor, rotenone. Four and eight weeks rotenone treatment induced manic- and depressive-like behavior, respectively, accompanied by mood-related neurochemical changes. Here we aimed to investigate whether each of the autophagy-enhancers lithium (a mood-stabilizer), trehalose and resveratrol and/or each of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavengers, resveratrol and N-acetylcystein and/or the combinations lithium+resveratrol or trehalose+N-acetylcystein, can ameliorate behavioral and neurochemical consequences of neuronal mild mitochondrial-dysfunction. We observed that lithium, trehalose and N-acetylcystein reversed rotenone-induced manic-like behavior as well as deviations in protein levels of mitochondrial complexes and the autophagy marker LC3-II. This raises the possibility that mild mitochondrial-dysfunction accompanied by impaired autophagy and a very mild increase in ROS levels are related to predisposition to manic-like behavior. On the other hand, although, as expected, most of the drugs tested eliminated the eight weeks rotenone-induced increase in protein levels of all hippocampal mitochondrial complexes, only lithium ubiquitously ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors. We cautiously deduce that aberrant autophagy and/or elevated ROS levels are not involved in predisposition to the depressive phase of bipolar-like behavior. Rather, that amending the depressive-like characteristics requires different mitochondria-related interventions. The latter might be antagonizing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), thus protecting from disruption of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and its detrimental consequences. In conclusion, our findings suggest that by-and-large, among the autophagy-enhancers and ROS-scavengers tested, lithium is the most effective in counteracting rotenone-induced changes. Trehalose and N-acetylcystein may also be effective in attenuating manic-like behavior.

AB  - Background Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) represents one of the main causes of brain damage in young people and the elderly population with a very high rate of psycho-physical disability and death. TBI is characterized by extensive cell death, tissue damage and neuro-inflammation with a symptomatology that varies depending on the severity of the trauma from memory loss to a state of irreversible coma and death. Recently, preclinical studies on mouse models have demonstrated that the post-traumatic adult Neural Stem/Progenitor cells response could represent an excellent model to shed light on the neuro-reparative role of adult neurogenesis following damage. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1) plays a pivotal role in modulating the quiescence/activation balance of adult Neural Stem Cells (aNSCs) and in restraining the proliferation progression of progenitor cells. Based on these considerations, the aim of this work is to evaluate how the conditional ablation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) in the aNSCS can alter the adult hippocampal neurogenesis in physiological and post-traumatic conditions. Methods We designed a novel conditional p21(Waf1/Cip1) knock-out mouse model, in which the deletion of p21(Waf1/Cip1) (referred as p21) is temporally controlled and occurs in Nestin-positive aNSCs, following administration of Tamoxifen. This mouse model (referred as p21 cKO mice) was subjected to Controlled Cortical Impact to analyze how the deletion of p21 could influence the post-traumatic neurogenic response within the hippocampal niche. Results The data demonstrates that the conditional deletion of p21 in the aNSCs induces a strong increase in activation of aNSCs as well as proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, resulting in an enhancement of neurogenesis and the hippocampal-dependent working memory. However, following traumatic brain injury, the increased neurogenic response of aNSCs in p21 cKO mice leads to a fast depletion of the aNSCs pool, followed by declined neurogenesis and impaired hippocampal functionality. Conclusions These data demonstrate for the first time a fundamental role of p21 in modulating the post-traumatic hippocampal neurogenic response, by the regulation of the proliferative and differentiative steps of aNSCs/progenitor populations after brain damage.

AB  - The knowledge about proteome changes proceeding during protracted opioid withdrawal is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this work was to analyze the spectrum of altered proteins in the rat hippocampus in comparison with the forebrain cortex after 6-month morphine withdrawal. We utilized 2D electrophoretic workflow (Pro-Q(R) Diamond staining and Colloidal Coomassie Blue staining) which was preceded by label-free quantification (MaxLFQ). The phosphoproteomic analysis revealed six significantly altered hippocampal (Calm1, Ywhaz, Tuba1b, Stip1, Pgk1, and Aldoa) and three cortical proteins (Tubb2a, Tuba1a, and Actb). The impact of 6-month morphine withdrawal on the changes in the proteomic profiles was higher in the hippocampus-14 proteins, only three proteins were detected in the forebrain cortex. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed hippocampal proteins revealed the most enriched terms related to metabolic changes, cytoskeleton organization and response to oxidative stress. There is increasing evidence that energy metabolism plays an important role in opioid addiction. However, the way how morphine treatment and withdrawal alter energy metabolism is not fully understood. Our results indicate that the rat hippocampus is more susceptible to changes in proteome and phosphoproteome profiles induced by 6-month morphine withdrawal than is the forebrain cortex.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of exogenous calcium and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) supplementation on rice growth and stress tolerance under white-backed planthopper (WBPH) infestation. We evaluated several phenotypic traits, including shoot/root length, leaf width, tiller number, panicle length, and relative water content, alongside physiological markers such as oxidative stress indicators, antioxidant enzymes activities, hormonal levels, and amino acids biosynthesis. Our results indicate that WBPH stress significantly reduces growth parameters but calcium and GABA supplementation markedly enhance shoot length (by 26% and 36%) and root length (by 38% and 64%), respectively, compared to WBPH-infested plants. Both supplementations also reduced oxidative stress, as evidenced by decreased H2O2 and O2 center dot- levels and a lower electrolyte leakage. Notably, calcium and GABA treatments increased antioxidant enzyme activities, with GABA boosting catalase (CAT) activity by 800%, peroxidase (POD) by 144%, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 62% under WBPH stress. Additionally, calcium and GABA enhanced the accumulation of stress hormones (abscisic acid ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) and promoted stomatal closure, contributing to improved water conservation. This study reveals that calcium regulates the GABA shunt pathway, significantly increasing GABA and succinate levels in both root and shoot. Furthermore, calcium and GABA supplementation enhance the biosynthesis of key amino acids and improve ion homeostasis, particularly elevating calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg) levels under WBPH stress. Overall, this study highlights the potential of exogenous calcium and GABA as effective strategies for enhancing rice plant tolerance to WBPH infestation by modulating various physiological and biochemical mechanisms. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action.

AB  - Acute cerebral ischemia induces distant inflammation in the hippocampus; however, molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon remain obscure. Here, hippocampal gene expression profiles were compared in two experimental paradigms in rats: middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and intracerebral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The main finding is that 10 genes (Clec5a, CD14, Fgr, Hck, Anxa1, Lgals3, Irf1, Lbp, Ptx3, Serping1) may represent key molecular links underlying acute activation of immune cells in the hippocampus in response to experimental ischemia. Functional annotation clustering revealed that these genes built the same clusters related to innate immunity/immunity/innate immune response in all MCAO differentially expressed genes and responded to the direct pro-inflammatory stimulus group. The gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses also indicate that LPS-responding genes were the most abundant among the genes related to "positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor biosynthetic process", "cell adhesion", "TNF signaling pathway", and "phagosome" as compared with non-responding ones. In contrast, positive and negative "regulation of cell proliferation" and "HIF-1 signaling pathway" mostly enriched with genes that did not respond to LPS. These results contribute to understanding genomic mechanisms of the impact of immune/inflammatory activation on expression of hippocampal genes after focal brain ischemia.

AB  - To make full use of Hippophae plant resources, we use the green extraction method of deep eutectic solvent (DES) combined with ultrasonication to extract flavonoids. HPLC was used to measure four flavonoids (isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside-7-O-rhamnoside, rutin, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, and isorhamnetin) in fruit samples and five flavonoids (quercetin-7-O-glucoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside-7-O-rhamnoside, rutin, guaijaverin, and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside) in leaf samples. The best solvent was chosen from 12 kinds of DES. With betaine/acetic acid (molar ratio of 1:2) as the extraction solvent, a liquid-solid ratio of 21:1 (mL/g), an extraction temperature of 37 degrees C, and an extraction time of 22 min, the total content of four flavonoids in the fruit was 10.547 mg/g. With L-proline/levulinic acid (molar ratio of 1:2) as the extraction solvent, a liquid-solid ratio of 31:1 (mL/g), an extraction temperature of 49 degrees C, and an extraction time of 22 min, the yield of five flavonoids in the leaves was 17.921 mg/g. The extraction efficiency of this method was significantly better than that of hot reflux extraction and 60 % ethanol extraction (p < 0.05). The flavonoids obtained by further purification of the extracts from the fruit and leaves exhibited inhibitory ability to alpha-glucosidase in vitro, IC50 = 28.189 and 19.675 mu g/mL, respectively. Above all, the use of optimized DES could efficiently extract flavonoids from Hippophae plants, which have promising applications in the regulation of blood glucose.

AB  - In this study, the galectin (OrGal) was purified from the grub of rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) (Cole-optera: Scarabaeidae) using lactose-affinity chromatography and its molecular mass was determined as 191 kDa. The OrGal binds lactose, galactose and BSM. It is a heterotrimer whose IEF were similar to 5-5.5 (50 kDa), 7 (75 kDa) and 8 (95 kDa). The OrGal was glycine-rich and showed peptide-homology to galectin and mitogenic lectin. From the isolated human PBMC, CD4(+) T and CD19(+) B cells were sorted and confirmed with CD markers. The OrGal was mitogenic to T-cells but not B cells (24 h and 48 h), and this activity was repressed by lactose. Expression of inflammatory mediators showed that OrGal upregulated IL-2 and IL-4, and downregulated IFN-gamma, IL-6 and GM-CSF in LPS-primed-T-cells. In the LPS-primed-monocytes, OrGal downregulated NF-Kappa B, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-12 and NO. The de novo transcriptomics identified transcripts (PB 3585.1 & PB 3817.1) showing identity to Cole-opteran galectin-4, -6, -8 and -9, in which galectin-8 & -4 showed high similarities. Mass spectrometry sequences of OrGal and its subunit exhibited a considerable identity to PB 3585.1 (galectin-8) & PB 3817.1 (galectin-4). The in silico models of above two transcripts interacted with lactose and galactose.

AB  - Asthma is a heterogeneous and complex condition characterized by chronic airway inflammation, which may be clinically stratified into three main phenotypes: type 2 (T2) low, T2-high allergic, and T2-high non-allergic asthma. This real-world study investigated whether phenotyping patients with asthma using non-invasive parameters could be feasible to characterize the T2-low and T2-high asthma phenotypes in clinical practice. This cross-sectional observational study involved asthmatic outpatients (n = 503) referring to the Severe Asthma Centre of the San Luigi Gonzaga University Hospital. Participants were stratified according to the patterns of T2 inflammation and atopic sensitization. Among outpatients, 98 (19.5%) patients had T2-low asthma, 127 (25.2%) T2-high non-allergic, and 278 (55.3%) had T2-high allergic phenotype. In comparison to T2-low, allergic patients were younger (OR 0.945, p < 0.001) and thinner (OR 0.913, p < 0.001), had lower smoke exposure (OR 0.975, p < 0.001) and RV/TLC% (OR 0.950, p < 0.001), higher prevalence of asthma severity grade 5 (OR 2.236, p < 0.05), more frequent rhinitis (OR 3.491, p < 0.001) and chronic rhinosinusitis with (OR 2.650, p < 0.001) or without (OR 1.919, p < 0.05) nasal polyps, but less common arterial hypertension (OR 0.331, p < 0.001). T2-high non-allergic patients had intermediate characteristics. Non-invasive phenotyping of asthmatic patients is possible in clinical practice. Identifying characteristics in the three main asthma phenotypes could pave the way for further investigations on useful biomarkers for precision medicine.

AB  - Depression is one of the most common psychological disorders nowadays. Studies have shown that 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) can effectively improve depressive symptoms in mice. However, its mechanism needs to be further explored. In this study, we used an integrated approach combining network pharmacology and transcriptomics to explore the potential mechanisms of PPT for depression. First, the potential targets and pathways of PPT treatment of depression were screened through network pharmacology. Secondly, the BMKCloud platform was used to obtain brain tissue transcription data of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model mice and screen PPT-altered differential expression genes (DEGs). Gene ontology (GO) analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed using network pharmacology and transcriptomics. Finally, the above results were verified by molecular docking, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In this study, we demonstrated that PPT improved depression-like behavior and brain histopathological changes in CUMS mice, downregulated nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and elevated serum levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after PPT treatment compared to the CUMS group. Eighty-seven potential targets and 350 DEGs were identified by network pharmacology and transcriptomics. Comprehensive analysis showed that transthyretin (TTR), klotho (KL), FOS, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway were closely associated with the therapeutic effects of PPT. Molecular docking results showed that PPT had a high affinity for PI3K, AKT, TTR, KL, and FOS targets. Gene and protein level results showed that PPT could increase the expression of PI3K, phosphorylation of PI3K (p-PI3K), AKT, phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT), TTR, and KL and inhibit the expression level of FOS in the brain tissue of depressed mice. Our data suggest that PPT may achieve the treatment of depression by inhibiting the expression of FOS, enhancing the expression of TTR and KL, and modulating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.

AB  - The molecular constituents of Camellia sinensis, in particular epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) and, more remarkably, the galloylated theaflavins, mainly theaflavin-3,3 '-di-O-gallate (TF-3,3 '-DG), have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), an enzyme required for the cleavage of its polyproteins, to produce vital individual functional proteins for viral cell replication. Our results for total catechin content revealed the values of 174.72, 200.90, and 211.75 mg/g dry weight (DW) in spring, and the values of 183.59, 191.36, and 215.09 mg/g DW in summer, for tea plantation zones 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For the TF-3,3 '-DG content, the values of 2.68, 1.13, and 3.72 mg/g DW were observed in spring, and the values of 3.78, 2.06, and 8.91 mg/g DW in summer for zones 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In the same zone, different contents of TF-3,3 '-DG were observed across plucking months of April, June, and August, with values of 1.13, 2.77, and 4.18 mg/g DW, respectively, showing higher values in summer. Different values of TF-3,3 '-DG contents were also observed in the same tea plantation zone but from different plant parts, revealing higher values in the bud and the first and second leaves (3.62 mg/g DW) and lower values in the third and fourth leaves (1.14 mg/g DW). The TF-3,3 '-DG content increased from 3.31 to 4.98 mg/g DW with increased fermentation time from 1 to 3 h, respectively, and increased for lower temperature and longer fermentation time. The aim of this study was to investigate the processing conditions that lead to maximum TF-3,3 '-DG content and, given its potential impact as an inhibitor of the 3CL(pro) enzyme, to create a novel antiviral Azorean black tea.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains a significant challenge due to its complex etiology and socio-economic burden. In this study, we investigated the roles of macrophage polarization-related hub genes in AD pathology, focusing on their impact on immune infiltration and gene regulation in distinct brain regions. Using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE110226 (choroid plexus) and GSE1297 (hippocampal CA1), we identified key genes-EDN1, HHLA2, KL, TREM2, and WWTR1-associated with AD mechanisms and immune responses. Based on these findings, we developed a diagnostic model demonstrating favorable calibration and clinical applicability. Furthermore, we explored molecular interactions within mRNA-transcription factor and mRNA-miRNA regulatory networks, providing deeper insights into AD progression and identifying potential therapeutic targets. The novel identification of WWTR1 and HHLA2 as biomarkers expands the diagnostic toolkit for AD, offering new perspectives on the disease's underlying immune dynamics. However, external dataset validation and further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to confirm these results and their clinical relevance.

AB  - Dysregulated glutamate signaling, leading to neuronal excitotoxicity and death, has been associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. 17 beta-estradiol (E2) is a human steroid hormone having a role in reproduction, sexual maturation, brain health and biological activities. The study aimed to explain the neuroprotective role of E2 against glutamate-induced ROS production, MAP kinase-dependent neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in the cortex and hippocampus of postnatal day 7 rat brain. Biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses were applied. Our results showed that a single subcutaneous injection of glutamate (10 mg/kg) induced brain oxidative stress after 4 h by disturbing the homeostasis of glutathione (GSH) and revealed an upsurge in ROS and LPO levels and downregulated the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 antioxidant protein. The glutamate-exposed P7 pups illustrated increased phosphorylation of stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase (p38) and downregulated expression of P-Erk1/2. This was accompanied by pathological neuroinflammation as revealed by enhanced gliosis with upregulated expression of GFAP and Iba-1, and the activation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha) in glutamate-injected P7 pups. Moreover, exogenous glutamate also reduced the expression of synaptic markers (PSD-95, SYP) and induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the cortical and hippocampal regions by dysregulating the expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 in the developing rat brain. On the contrary, co-treatment of E2 (10 mg/kg) with glutamate significantly abrogated brain neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and synapse loss by alleviating brain oxidative stress by upregulating the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway and by deactivating pro-apoptotic P-JNK/P-p38 and activation of pro-survival P-Erk1/2 MAP kinase pathways. In brief, the data demonstrate the neuroprotective role of E2 against glutamate excitotoxicity-induced neurodegeneration. The study also encourages future studies investigating if E2 may be a potent neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic agent in different neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant lockdowns presented a global health challenge and triggered unprecedented research efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The spike glycoprotein decorating the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions is a prime target for vaccine development, antibody therapy and serology as it binds the host cell receptor and is central for viral cell entry. The electron cryo-microscopy structure of the spike protein revealed a hydrophobic pocket in the receptor-binding domain that is occupied by an essential fatty acid, linoleic acid (LA). The LA-bound spike protein adopts a non-infectious locked conformation which is more stable than the infectious form and shields important immunogenic epitopes. Here, the impact of LA binding on viral infectivity and replication, and the evolutionary conservation of the pocket in other highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), are reviewed. The importance of LA metabolic products, the eicosanoids, in regulating the human immune response and inflammation is highlighted. Lipid and fatty-acid binding to a hydrophobic pocket in proteins on the virion surface appears to be a broader strategy employed by viruses, including picornaviruses and Zika virus. Ligand binding stabilizes their protein structure and assembly, and downregulates infectivity. In the case of rhinoviruses, this has been exploited to develop small-molecule antiviral drugs that bind to the hydrophobic pocket. The results suggest a COVID-19 antiviral treatment based on the LA-binding pocket.

AB  - European countries have recently started experimenting with growing and producing their own teas in small quantities, mainly for the specialty tea sector. To characterize European teas, this study investigated a set of five tea types obtained from different Camellia sinensis varieties/cultivars, representing various oxidation grades (green, white, yellow, oolong, black), all grown and processed in the only tea garden in Europe (in Germany) that focuses on all five types. Hot and cold brews were studied by measuring the total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid contents (TFC), the antioxidant capacity and UV-Vis spectra, also with the objective of discriminating between the different tea types and the different plant varieties. The dried leaves were analyzed to measure the content of essential and toxic elements and by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to determine a chemical fingerprint for identifying the tea varieties and types. The average levels of TPC (hot brew = 5.82 +/- 2.06; cold brew = 5.4 +/- 2.46 mM GAEq), TFC (hot brew = 0.87 +/- 0.309; cold brew = 0.87 +/- 0.413 mM CAEq), and antioxidant capacity (ORAC assay-hot brew = 20.9 +/- 605; cold brew = 21.8 +/- 8.0 mM TXEq, ABTS assay-hot brew = 15.2 +/- 5.09; cold brew = 15.1 +/- 5.8 mM TXEq, FRAP assay-hot brew = 9.2 +/- 3.84; cold brew = 10.4 +/- 5.23 mM AAEq) observed compared well with those from other parts of the world such as China, Africa, and Taiwan. The hazard quotient <1 and the hazard index of 0.14 indicate that there is no non-carcinogenic risk from consumption of these teas. The obtained information is essential for elucidating the characteristics and the impact of tea processing and tea variety on the health benefits of these tea products coming from a single European tea garden. This multifaceted approach would help tea growers in Europe increase their knowledge on the health attributes of the teas they grow, ultimately leading to optimization of the nutraceutical properties of these teas.

AB  - In this study, Camellia nitidissima Chi leaf extract was investigated for its compounds and pancreatic lipase inhibitory potentials. The interaction was determined using ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy (FS), and molecular docking to understand the inhibiton, kinetic, and conformation of extraction-pancreatic lipase complex. C. nitidissima Chi leaf extraction inhibited the pancreatic lipase activity in a dose-dependent manner at the concentration of 1-12 mg/ml. The Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that the inhibition on pancreatic lipase by extraction was noncompetitive. In addition, the decrease in alpha-helix contents, increase in beta-sheet and beta-turn, and decrease in fluorescence intensity after extraction treatment indicated that the conformation of pancreatic lipase was changed. This work revealed that C. nitidissima Chi leaf extraction played a significant role in inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity and brought out a solution of delay fat accumulation. Practical applications This study reports the components in the extract of C. nitidissima Chi leaf and its inhibitory effect and mechanism of pancreatic lipase. C. nitidissima Chi leaf is a good source of bioactive components, including multiflorin B, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, vicenin-2, apigenin-6-C-pentosyl-8-C-hexosyl, vitexin, kaempferol, and other ingredients. It can inhibit pancreatic lipase and be used to control obesity and treat hyperlipidemia. This study also revealed the structure changes of C. nitidissima Chi leaf extract on pancreatic lipase, and further revealed the inhibitory mechanism of C. nitidissima Chi leaf extract on lipase, which provides a theoretical basis for C. nitidissima Chi leaf as a lipase inhibitor.

AB  - Lead (Pb) exposure can cause damage to the central nervous system (CNS)*. Pb can accumulate in the hippo campus, leading to learning and memory impairments. Recent studies have shown that high-fat diet (HFD) is also associated with cognitive impairment. However, there are few reports on CNS damage due to HFD and Pb exposure. We aimed to investigate the effect of Pb on cognitive functions of HFD-fed mice, focusing on the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells in astrocyte activation. C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into control, HFD, Pb, and HFD + Pb groups. TGF-beta and IL-10 secreted by Treg cells and the intracellular transcription factor Foxp3 were evaluated as a measure of Treg cell function; astrocyte activation was assessed by evaluating glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. The learning and memory ability was significantly lower in the HFD + Pb group than in other groups. The brain Treg cell ratio was significantly decreased and the protein levels of TGF-beta, IL-10, and Foxp3 were significantly lower, whereas the protein level of GFAP was higher in the HFD + Pb group. The hippocampus of the HFD + Pb group mice showed significantly higher levels of neurotoxic reactive astrocyte markers and astrogliosis was also much higher compared to HFD and Pb groups. Furthermore, all-trans retinoic acid treatment increased the brain Treg cell ratio, reversed cognitive decline, and suppressed astrocyte activation in the HFD + Pb group mice. We concluded that HFD along with Pb exposure could aggravate the activation of astrocytes in the brain, and the brain Treg cells may be involved in inhibiting astrocyte activation in HFD-fed mice exposed to Pb.

AB  - Rutin, a naturally derived flavonoid molecule with known neuroprotective properties, has been demonstrated to have anticonvulsive potential, but the mechanism of this effect is still unclear. The current study aimed to investigate the probable antiseizure mechanisms of rutin in rats using the kainic acid (KA) seizure model. Rutin (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) and carbamazepine (100 mg kg(-1)) were administered daily by oral gavage for 7 days before KA (15 mg kg(-1)) intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Seizure behavior, neuronal cell death, glutamate concentration, excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), glutamine synthetase (GS), glutaminase, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits GluN2A and GluN2B, activated astrocytes, and inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules in the hippocampus were evaluated. Supplementation with rutin attenuated seizure severity in KA-treated rats and reversed KA-induced neuronal loss and glutamate elevation in the hippocampus. Decreased glutaminase and GluN2B, and increased EAATs, GS, GluA1, GluA2 and GluN2A were observed with rutin administration. Rutin pretreatment also suppressed activated astrocytes, downregulated the protein levels of inflammatory molecules [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), high mobility group Box 1 (HMGB1), interleukin-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1), and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)] and upregulated anti-inflammatory molecule interleukin-10 (IL-10) protein expression. Taken together, the results indicate that the preventive treatment of rats with rutin attenuated KA-induced seizures and neuronal loss by decreasing glutamatergic hyperactivity and suppressing the IL-1R1/TLR4-related neuroinflammatory cascade.

AB  - In the present study it was hypothesized that 5-((4-methoxyphenyl)thio)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiodiazole (MTDZ), a new acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, exerts antinociceptive action and reduces the oxaliplatin (OXA)-induced peripheral neuropathy and its comorbidities (anxiety and cognitive deficits). Indeed, the acute antinociceptive activity of MTDZ (1 and 10 mg/kg; per oral route) was observed for the first time in male Swiss mice in formalin and hot plate tests and on mechanical withdrawal threshold induced by Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). To evaluate the MTDZ effect on OXA-induced peripheral neuropathy and its comorbidities, male and female Swiss mice received OXA (10 mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally, on days 0 and 2 of the experimental protocol. Oral administration of MTDZ (1 mg/kg) or vehicle was performed on days 2-14. OXA caused cognitive impairment, anxious-like behaviour, mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in animals, with females more susceptible to thermal sensitivity. MTDZ reversed the hypersensitivity, cognitive impairment and anxious-like behaviour induced by OXA. Here, the negative correlation between the paw withdrawal threshold caused by OXA and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was demonstrated in the cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord. OXA inhibited the activity of total ATPase, Na+ K+ - ATPase, Ca2+ - ATPase and altered Mg2+ - ATPase in the cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord. OXA exposure increased reactive species (RS) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord. MTDZ modulated ion pumps and reduced the oxidative stress induced by OXA. In conclusion, MTDZ is an antinociceptive molecule promising to treat OXAinduced neurotoxicity since it reduced nociceptive and anxious-like behaviours, and cognitive deficit in male and female mice.

AB  - Nanoparticles (NPs) are conventionally produced by using physical and chemical methods that are no longer in alignment with current society's demand for a low environmental impact. Accordingly, green synthesis approaches are considered a potential alternative due to the plant extracts that substitute some of the hazardous reagents. The general mechanism is based on the reducing power of natural products that allows the formation of NPs from a precursor solution. In this context, our study proposes a simple, innovative, and reproducible green approach for the synthesis of titanium dioxide (TiO2 NPs) that uses, for the first time, the major component of green tea (Camellia sinensis)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a non-toxic, dietary, accessible, and bioactive molecule. The influence of EGCG on the formation of TiO2 NPs was analyzed by comparing the physicochemical characteristics of green synthesized NPs with the chemically obtained ones. The synthesis of bare TiO2 NPs was performed by hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide in distilled water, and green TiO2 NPs were obtained in the same conditions, but in the presence of a 1 mM EGCG aqueous solution. The formation of TiO2 NPs was confirmed by UV-VIS and FTIR spectroscopy. SEM micrographs showed spherical particles with relatively low diameters. Our findings also revealed that green synthesized NPs were more stable in colloids than the chemically synthesized ones. However, the phytocompound negatively influenced the formation of a crystalline structure in the green synthesized TiO2 NPs. Furthermore, the synthesis of EGCG-TiO2 NPs could become a versatile choice for applications extending beyond photocatalysis, including promising prospects in the biomedical field.

AB  - The use of anesthetics relieves discomfort in patients during operation, but extensive application of anesthetics can cause damage to the nervous system. Atractylenolide III (ATL-III) is an active ingredient derived from Baizhu, which is a kind of traditional Chinese medicines. Recent studies have shown that ATL-III alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress in various tissues by regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. However, whether or not the application of ATL-III could relieve isoflurane-induced damage in rat hippocampal neurons remains unclear. In this study, rats were stimulated with isoflurane and treated with ATL-III (intragastric administration) simultaneously. After rats were sacrificed, apoptosis and autophagy in the hippocampal neurons were assessed using TUNEL assays and western blotting, respectively. Then, the expression of inflammatory factors was determined by q-PCR and ELISA. The levels of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR were quantified by western blotting. We found that ATL-III relieved isoflurane-induced apoptosis, autophagy and inflammation in hippocampal neurons in rats. ATL-III treatment also inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 in these cells. Furthermore, ATL-III promoted the expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR in the hippocampal neurons. All these results indicated that ATL-III alleviated isoflurane-induced injury in rat hippocampal neurons by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Practical applications Whether or not Atractylenolide III (ATL-III) could alleviate neurotoxicity induced by anesthetics is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of ATL-III on anesthetic-induced nervous system damage. The findings from this study could also provide a novel therapy for the treatment of patients with anesthetic-induced nerve injury.

AB  - Aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) protein in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS) gives rise to a group of disorders, which are labeled collectively as synucleinopathies. These clinically distinct disorders are known as pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In the case of PD, it has been demonstrated that toxic aggregates of alpha-syn protein not only cause apoptosis of dopamine neurons but its accumulation in the neocortex and limbic area principally contributes to dementia. In our multifunctional drug discovery research for PD, we converted one of our catechol-containing lead dopamine agonist molecules D520 into its prodrug D-685. The prodrug exhibited higher in vivo anti-Parkinsonian efficacy in a reserpinized PD animal model than the parent D-520 and exhibited facile brain penetration. In our study with an alpha-syn transgenic animal model (D line) for PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), we have shown that 1 month of chronic treatment with the compound D-685 was sufficient to reduce the accumulation of alpha-syn and phospho-alpha-syn in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum areas significantly compared to the control tg mice. Furthermore, D-685 did not exhibit any deleterious effect in the CNS as was evident from the neuron and microglia studies. Future studies will further explore in depth the potential of D-685 to modify disease progression while addressing symptomatic deficits.

AB  - Dexmedetomidine (DEX) displays a neuroprotective role in aged rats with isoflurane (ISO)-induced cognitive impairment through antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. Therefore, the present study was performed to define the molecular mechanism of DEX on ISO-induced neurological impairment in aged rats in relation to the MEK1/ERK1/Nrf2/HO-1 axis. The study enrolled elderly patients undergoing ISO anesthesia. Patient cognitive function following treatment with DEX was evaluated using mini-mental state examination (MMSE). The results revealed that DEX supplementation of anesthesia contributed to higher MMSE scores in patients one week post treatment. Rat model of neurological impairment was also induced in 18-month-age Wistar rats by ISO, followed by DEX treatment. Based on the results of Morris water maze experiment, ELISA, and TUNEL and hematoxylin-eosin staining, in vivo experiments confirmed that DEX could reduce the oxidative stress and neurological damage induced by ISO in rats. DEX activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)/Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway. DEX upregulated the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 by acti-vating the MEK1/ERK1 pathway, whereby attenuating the ISO-caused oxidative stress and neurological damage in rats. Collectively, DEX suppresses the ISO-induced neurological impairment in the aged rats by promoting HO -1 through activation of the MEK1/ERK1/Nrf2 axis.

AB  - Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill Fructus (SCF) is the ripe fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill, and is often used as a neuroprotective drink. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that lignans are the main bioactive components responsible for neuroprotection and have potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of action of SCF in the treatment of AD from the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) perspective remains not well established. The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the pharmacokinetic differences of lignans in normal and AD rats, as well as to investigate their effects on neurotransmitters and their role in the treatment of AD. To achieve this goal, an integrated strategy using LC-MS/MS combined with in vivo microdialysis for the simultaneous determination of lignans of SCF and endogenous neurotransmitters has been developed and validated. The results show that the pharmacokinetic behaviors of ten lignans in the AD group were significantly different from those in the normal group. The AD group had better absorption and slower elimination than the normal group. In addition, the pharmacodynamic results of the Morris water maze (MWM) test, biochemical tests, histopathological examination, as well as immunohistochemistry analysis showed that lignans could improve the learning and memory of AD rats. The oral administration of SCF could restore the levels of the neurotransmitter parameters; seven neurotransmitters showed clockwise or counterclockwise changes with the four lignans in the hippocampal region. Taken together, the PK and PD studies based on in vivo microdialysis sampling might offer novel insights into the mechanisms of action of SCF against AD.

AB  - Tetrahydropalmatine (THP) has analgesic, hypnotic, sedative, and other pharmacological effects. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neuronal plasticity, growth, and development. However, their mechanism of action in methamphetamine (MA)-induced neurotoxicity remains unclear. This study aims to explore the important role of BDNF in MA neurotoxicity and whether THP can regulate BDNF through the interaction between tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB)/calmodulin (CAM) to alleviate the neurotoxicity induced by MA. SD rats were randomly divided into control, MA, and MA + THP groups. Stereotyped behavior test, captive rejection test, open field test (OFT), and Morris water maze (MWM) were used to evaluate the anxiety, aggression, cognition, learning, and memory. Extracted hippocampus and mesencephalon tissue were detected by Western blot, HE staining, and immunohistochemistry. TUNEL staining was used to detect apoptosis. MOE was used for bioinformatics prediction, and coimmunoprecipitation was used to confirm protein interactions. Long-term abuse of MA resulted in lower weight gain ratio and nerve cell damage and caused various neurotoxicity-related behavioral abnormalities: anxiety, aggression, cognitive motor disorders, and learning and memory disorders. MA-induced neurotoxicity is related to the downregulation of BDNF and apoptosis. THP attenuated the MA-induced neurotoxicity by decreasing CAM, increasing TrkB, phosphorylating Akt, up-regulating NF-.B and BDNF, and inhibiting cell apoptosis. MA can induce neurotoxicity in rats. BDNF may play a vital role in MA-induced neurotoxicity. THP regulates BDNF through TrkB/CAM interaction to alleviate the neurotoxicity induced by MA. THP may be a potential therapeutic drug for the neurotoxic and neurodegenerative diseases related to MA.

AB  - In planning randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), researchers frequently rely on the use of existing data obtained from only two time points to estimate sample size via the subtraction of baseline from follow-up measurements in each subject. However, the inadequacy of this method has not been reported. The aim of this study is to discuss the limitation of sample size estimation based on the subtraction of available data from only two time points for RCTs. Mathematical equations are derived to demonstrate the condition under which the obtained data pairs with variable time intervals could be used to adequately estimate sample size. The MRI-based hippocampal volume measurements from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were used to illustrate the existing bias and variability of estimates. MCS results support the theoretically derived condition under which the subtraction approach may work. MCS also show the systematically under- or over-estimated sample sizes by up to 32.27% bias. Not used properly, such subtraction approach outputs the same sample size regardless of trial durations partly due to the way measurement errors are handled. Estimating sample size by subtracting two measurements should be treated with caution. Such estimates can be biased, the magnitude of which depends on the planned RCT duration. To estimate sample sizes, we recommend using more than two measurements and more comprehensive approaches such as linear mixed effect models.

AB  - Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a central component of the Hippo pathway, plays an important role in tumor metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Invadopodia are actin-rich protrusions containing multiple proteases and have been widely reported to promote cell invasiveness by degrading the extracellular matrix. In the present study, we report that YAP1 induces invadopodia formation and promotes tumor metastasis in breast cancer cells. We also identify TIAM1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as a target of the YAP1-TEAD4 complex. Our results demonstrate that YAP1 could promote TEAD4 binding to the enhancer region of TIAM1, which activates TIAM1 expression, subsequently increasing RAC1 activity and inducing invadopodia formation. These findings reveal the functional role of Hippo signaling in the regulation of invadopodia and provide potential molecular targets for preventing tumor metastasis in breast cancer.

AB  - Hippocampal synaptic plasticity is widely considered the cellular basis of learning and spatial memory processes. This article highlights the central role of Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and hippocampus -dependent memory in health and disease. The key participation of ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels, which are the principal Ca2+ release channels expressed in the hippocampus, in these processes is emphasized. It is proposed that the increased neuronal oxidative tone displayed by hippocampal neurons during aging or Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to excessive activation of RyR-mediated Ca2+ release, a process that is highly redox-sensitive, and that this abnormal response contributes to and aggravates these deleterious conditions.

AB  - Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key player in the Hippo pathway, has been shown to play a critical role in tumor progression. However, the role of YAP1 in prostate cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis is not well defined. Through functional, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses, we showed that prolyl hydroxylation of YAP1 plays a critical role in the suppression of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer. Knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of YAP1 led to an increase in cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer cells. Microarray analysis showed that the EMT pathway was activated in Yap1-KD cells. ChIP-seq analysis showed that YAP1 target genes are enriched in pathways regulating cell migration. Mass spectrometry analysis identified P4H prolyl hydroxylase in the YAP1 complex and YAP1 was hydroxylated at multiple proline residues. Proline-to-alanine mutations of YAP1 isoform 3 identified proline 174 as a critical residue, and its hydroxylation suppressed cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. KO of P4ha2 led to an increase in cell migration and invasion, which was reversed upon Yap1 KD. Our study identified a novel regulatory mechanism of YAP1 by which P4HA2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of YAP1 determines its transcriptional activities and its function in prostate cancer metastasis.

AB  - Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) places a significant socioeconomic burden, particularly on individuals with poorly managed recurrent and severe symptoms despite standard-of-care treatment. Stapokibart, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor subunit alpha, inhibits its interaction with both IL-4 and IL-13 in type 2 inflammation. Here we aim to assess the efficacy and safety of stapokibart as an add-on therapy in adults with moderate-to-severe SAR. The study was a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 108 patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe SAR and having baseline blood eosinophil counts >= 300 cells mu l-1. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive 600 mg (loading dose) to 300 mg stapokibart subcutaneously or a placebo every 2 weeks for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in daily reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over the first 2 weeks. Multiplicity-tested secondary endpoints included changes in rTNSS over 4 weeks, reflective total ocular symptom score and Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score over 2 weeks and 4 weeks. Compared with the placebo, stapokibart led to a significant improvement in the mean change from baseline in daily rTNSS during the 2-week (least-squares mean difference, -1.3; 95% confidence interval, -2.0 to -0.6; P = 0.0008) and 4-week (least-squares mean difference, -1.7; 95% confidence interval, -2.5 to -0.8; P = 0.0002) treatments. Stapokibart significantly improved the multiplicity-tested secondary endpoints. Treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable between the groups. Pharmacodynamics and exploratory analyses indicated that the observed improvements in outcomes during pollen season may be attributed to the reduction of type 2 inflammation in response to stapokibart treatment. The results of this trial show that pollen seasonal administration of stapokibart improved both nasal and ocular symptoms and quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe SAR.

AB  - Ewing sarcomas (ES) are aggressive paediatric tumours of bone and soft tissues. Resistance to chemotherapy and high propensity to metastasize remain the main causes of treatment failure. Thus, identifying novel targets for alternative therapeutic approaches is urgently needed. DNA/RNA helicases are emerging as crucial regulators of many cellular processes often deregulated in cancer. Among them, DHX9 is up-regulated in ES and collaborates with EWS-FLI1 in ES transformation. We report that DHX9 silencing profoundly impacts on the oncogenic properties of ES cells. Transcriptome profiling combined to bioinformatic analyses disclosed a gene signature commonly regulated by DHX9 and the Lysine Demethylase KDM2B, with the Hippo pathway regulator YAP1 as a prominent target. Mechanistically, we found that DHX9 enhances H3K9 chromatin demethylation by KDM2B and favours RNA Polymerase II recruitment, thus promoting YAP1 expression. Conversely, EWS-FLI1 binding to the promoter represses YAP1 expression. These findings identify the DHX9/KDM2B complex as a new druggable target to counteract ES malignancy.

AB  - Appendectomy impacts the homeostasis of gut microbiome in patients. We aimed to study the role of appendectomy in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk through causing gut microbial dysbiosis. Population-based longitudinal study (cohort 1, n = 129,155) showed a 73.0% increase in CRC risk among appendectomy cases throughout 20 years follow-up (Adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR) 1.73, 95% CI 1.49-2.01, P < 0.001). Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal samples from cohort 2 (n = 314). Gut microbial dysbiosis in appendectomy subjects was observed with significant enrichment of 7 CRC-promoting bacteria (Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Veillonella dispar, Prevotella ruminicola, Prevotella fucsa, Prevotella dentalis, Prevotella denticola) and depletion of 5 beneficial commensals (Blautia sp YL58, Enterococcus hirae, Lachnospiraceae bacterium Choco86, Collinsella aerofaciens, Blautia sp SC05B48). Microbial network analysis showed increased correlation strengths among enriched bacteria and their enriched oncogenic pathways in appendectomy subjects compared to controls. Of which, B. fragilis was the centrality in the network of the enriched bacteria. We further confirmed that appendectomy promoted colorectal tumorigenesis in mice by causing gut microbial dysbiosis and impaired intestinal barrier function. Collectively, this study revealed appendectomy-induced microbial dysbiosis characterized by enriched CRC-promoting bacteria and depleted beneficial commensals, signifying that the gut microbiome may play a crucial role in CRC development induced by appendectomy.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top five most common malignant tumors worldwide and has a high mortality rate. Identification of the mechanism of CRC and potential therapeutic targets is critical for improving survival. In the present study, we observed high expression of RAN binding protein 1 (RANBP1) in CRC tissues. Upregulated RANBP1 expression was strongly associated with TNM stages and was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo functional experiments demonstrated that RANBP1 promoted the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells and inhibited the apoptosis of CRC cells. Low RANBP1 expression reduced the expression levels of hsa-miR-18a, hsa-miR-183, and hsa-miR-106 microRNAs (miRNAs) by inhibiting the nucleoplasmic transport of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), thereby promoting the accumulation of the latter in the nucleus and reducing the expression of mature miRNAs. Further experiments and bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that RANBP1 promoted the expression of YAP by regulating miRNAs and the Hippo pathway. We also found that YAP acted as a transcriptional cofactor to activate RANBP1 transcription in combination with TEAD4 transcription factor. Thus, RANBP1 further promoted the progression of CRC by forming a positive feedback loop with YAP. Our results revealed the biological role and mechanism of RANBP1 in CRC for the first time, suggesting that RANBP1 can be used as a diagnostic molecule and a potential therapeutic target in CRC.

KW  - HIPPO PATHWAY
KW  - MECHANISM
AB  - The RNA helicase DDX21 is vital for ribosome biogenesis and is upregulated in CRC, but the mechanism by which DDX21 is dysregulated and by which DDX21 promotes tumorigenesis in CRC remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that DDX21 is a direct transcriptional target gene of beta-catenin and mediates the protumorigenic function of beta-catenin in CRC. DDX21 expression is correlated with the expression and activity of beta-catenin, and high DDX21 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in CRC patients. Loss of DDX21 leads to cytoplasmic translocation and decreased transcriptional activity of YAP and suppresses the proliferation and migration of CRC cells, which can be partially rescued by YAP reactivation. Importantly, by using translation elongation inhibitors and DNA intercalators, we showed that ribosomal stress upregulates DDX21 expression and induces the downregulation of LATS and the activation of YAP, probably through the ZAK alpha-MKK4/7-JNK axis. Overall, our study revealed the transcriptional activation mechanism of DDX21 in CRC and the activation of YAP in the ribosomal stress response, indicating the potential of combination therapy involving the induction of ribosomal stress and YAP inhibition.

TI  - PFKFB3 regulates cancer stemness through the hippo pathway in small cell lung carcinoma
T2  - ONCOGENE
LA  - English
KW  - RESISTANCE PROTEIN BCRP/ABCG2
KW  - EXPRESSION
AB  - PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase) is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis and is overexpressed in several human cancers that are associated with poor prognosis. High PFKFB3 expression in cancer stem cells promotes glycolysis and survival in the tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of PFKFB3 by the glycolytic inhibitor PFK158 and by shRNA stable knockdown in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell lines inhibited glycolysis, proliferation, spheroid formation, and the expression of cancer stem cell markers CD133, Aldh1, CD44, Sox2, and ABCG2. These factors are also associated with chemotherapy resistance. We found that PFK158 treatment and PFKFB3 knockdown enhanced the ABCG2-interacting drugs doxorubicin, etoposide, and 5-fluorouracil in reducing cell viability under conditions of enriched cancer stem cells (CSC). Additionally, PFKFB3 inhibition attenuated the invasion/migration of SCLC cells by downregulating YAP/TAZ signaling while increasing pLATS1 via activation of pMST1 and NF2 and by reducing the mesenchymal protein expression. PFKFB3 knockdown and PFK158 treatment in a H1048 SCLC cancer stem cell-enriched mouse xenograft model showed significant reduction in tumor growth and weight with reduced expression of cancer stem cell markers, ABCG2, and YAP/TAZ. Our findings identify that PFKFB3 is a novel target to regulate cancer stem cells and its associated therapeutic resistance markers YAP/TAZ and ABCG2 in SCLC models.

AB  - Intrinsic and acquired resistance represent major obstacles to optimize outcomes in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted therapy in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Hence, a deeper understanding of EGFR-TKI resistance mechanisms in LUAD will potentially assist in formulating strategies to delay or overcome such resistance. Herein, it was observed that trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) is a crucial mediator of the LUAD EGFR-TKI response. TFF3 conferred intrinsic resistance to EGFR inhibition in LUAD by promotion of EGFR activation. TFF3 expression was also increased in acquired EGFR-TKI resistant LUAD, accompanied by reduced EGFR activation. YAP, a key mediator of the Hippo signaling, was positively regulated by TFF3 by post-transcriptional mechanisms and was responsible for acquired EGFR-TKI resistance mediated by TFF3. Inhibition of TFF3 by a small molecule inhibitor not only enhanced EGFR-TKI sensitivity in LUAD cells but also restored the sensitivity of acquired EGFR-TKI resistant LUAD cells to EGFR-TKIs in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate a pivotal function of TFF3 in mediating both intrinsic and acquired EGFR-TKI resistance in LUAD and may offer a potential therapeutic mechanism for delaying or overcoming resistance to EGFR-TKIs.

AB  - Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC) is a particularly aggressive subtype that is both difficult to detect and treat. DGC is distinguished by weak cell-cell cohesion, most often due to loss of the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin, a common occurrence in highly invasive, metastatic cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that loss-of-function mutation of E-cadherin in DGC cells results in their increased sensitivity to the non-apoptotic, iron-dependent form of cell death, ferroptosis. Homophilic contacts between E-cadherin molecules on adjacent cells suppress ferroptosis through activation of the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, single nucleotide mutations observed in DGC patients that ablate the homophilic binding capacity of E-cadherin reverse the ability of E-cadherin to suppress ferroptosis in both cell culture and xenograft models. Importantly, although E-cadherin loss in cancer cells is considered an essential event for epithelial-mesenchymal transition and subsequent metastasis, we found that circulating DGC cells lacking E-cadherin expression possess lower metastatic ability, due to their increased susceptibility to ferroptosis. Together, this study suggests that E-cadherin is a biomarker predicting the sensitivity to ferroptosis of DGC cells, both in primary tumor tissue and in circulation, thus guiding the usage of future ferroptosis-inducing therapeutics for the treatment of DGC.

AB  - Aberrant hyperactivation of the Hippo pathway effector YAP/TEAD complex causes tissue overgrowth and tumorigenesis in various cancers, including endometrial cancer (EC). The transcription factor SOX17 (SRY [sex-determining region Y]-box 17) is frequently mutated in EC; however, SOX17 mutations are rare in other cancer types. The molecular mechanisms underlying SOX17 mutation-induced EC tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that SOX17 serves as a tumor suppressor to restrict the proliferation, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth of EC cells, partly by suppressing the transcriptional outputs of the Hippo-YAP/TEAD pathway. SOX17 binds to TEAD transcription factors through its HMG domain and attenuates the DNA-binding ability of TEAD. SOX17 loss by inactivating mutations leads to the malignant transformation of EC cells, which can be reversed by small-molecule inhibitors of YAP/TEAD or cabozantinib, an FDA-approved drug targeting the YAP/TEAD transcriptional target AXL. Our findings reveal novel molecular mechanisms underlying Hippo-YAP/TEAD pathway-driven EC tumorigenesis, and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting the Hippo-YAP/TEAD pathway in SOX17-mutated EC.

AB  - For the segmentation of magnetic resonance brain images into anatomical regions, numerous fully automated methods have been proposed and compared to reference segmentations obtained manually. However, systematic differences might exist between the resulting segmentations, depending on the segmentation method and underlying brain atlas. This potentially results in sensitivity differences to disease and can further complicate the comparison of individual patients to normative data. In this study, we aim to answer two research questions: 1) to what extent are methods interchangeable, as long as the same method is being used for computing normative volume distributions and patient-specific volumes? and 2) can different methods be used for computing normative volume distributions and assessing patient-specific volumes? To answer these questions, we compared volumes of six brain regions calculated by five state-of-the-art segmentation methods: Erasmus MC (EMC), FreeSurfer (FS), geodesic information flows (GIF), multi-atlas label propagation with expectation-maximization (MALP-EM), and model-based brain segmentation (MBS). We applied the methods on 988 non-demented (ND) subjects and computed the correlation (PCC-v) and absolute agreement (ICC-v) on the volumes. For most regions, the PCC-v was good ( > 0.75 ), indicating that volume differences between methods in ND subjects are mainly due to systematic differences. The ICC-v was generally lower, especially for the smaller regions, indicating that it is essential that the same method is used to generate normative and patient data. To evaluate the impact on single-subject analysis, we also applied the methods to 42 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the case where the normative distributions and the patient-specific volumes were calculated by the same method, the patient's distance to the normative distribution was assessed with the z-score. We determined the diagnostic value of this z-score, which showed to be consistent across methods. The absolute agreement on the AD patients' z-scores was high for regions of thalamus and putamen. This is encouraging as it indicates that the studied methods are interchangeable for these regions. For regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus and accumbens, and globus pallidus, not all method combinations showed a high ICC-z. Whether two methods are indeed interchangeable should be confirmed for the specific application and dataset of interest.

AB  - Despite paclitaxel's wide use in cancer treatment, patient response rate is still low and drug resistance is a major clinical obstacle. Through a Phos-tag-based kinome-wide screen, we identified MARK2 as a critical regulator for paclitaxel chemosensitivity in PDAC. We show that MARK2 is phosphorylated by CDK1 in response to antitubulin chemotherapeutics and in unperturbed mitosis. Phosphorylation is essential for MARK2 in regulating mitotic progression and paclitaxel cytotoxicity in PDAC cells. Mechanistically, our findings also suggest that MARK2 controls paclitaxel chemosensitivity by regulating class IIa HDACs. MARK2 directly phosphorylates HDAC4 specifically during antitubulin treatment. Phosphorylated HDAC4 promotes YAP activation and controls expression of YAP target genes induced by paclitaxel. Importantly, combination of HDAC inhibition and paclitaxel overcomes chemoresistance in organoid culture and preclinical PDAC animal models. The expression levels of MARK2, HDACs, and YAP are upregulated and positively correlated in PDAC patients. Inhibition of MARK2 or class IIa HDACs potentiates paclitaxel cytotoxicity by inducing mitotic abnormalities in PDAC cells. Together, our findings identify the MARK2-HDAC axis as a druggable target for overcoming chemoresistance in PDAC.

AB  - Aberrant autophagic flux and epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, limited studies have been conducted on the relationship between the histone acetylation-particularly sirtuin 2 (SIRT2)-and autophagy in cognitive deficiency. We investigated the effects of a walnut-derived peptide (WNP-8) on SIRT2, synaptic plasticity, and autophagy and the involvement of SIRT2 in learning and memory. Using four-dimensional label-free quantitative proteomics, we analyzed hippocampal tissue from mice treated or not treated with WNP-8 and exposed to scopolamine and identified 71 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). A pathway enrichment analysis showed that the DEPs were mostly located in the cytoplasm and involved in the negative regulation of cell proliferation and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, which are associated with SIRT2. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that pretreatment with WNP-8 significantly modulated the expression of synaptic and autophagic proteins in scopolamine-treated cells in both in vivo and in vitro models (p < .05). Notably, WNP-8 significantly reversed the level and morphology of synaptic plasticity and autophagic flux in PC12 cells that overexpressed SIRT2 (p < .05). Together, our results provide evidence of a link between SIRT2, autophagy, and synaptic plasticity in neurons and novel insights into a potential predictive biomarker that could be used to prevent and delay Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The extraction process, structural characterization and free radical scavenging ability of polysaccharides from Camellia oleifera have already been widely studied. However, the antioxidant activities are still lack of systematic experiments. In this study, we used Hep G2 cells and Caenorhabditis elegans to evaluate the antioxidant potential of polysaccharides that from C. oleifera flowers (P-CF), leaves (P-CL), seed cakes (P-CC) and fruit shells (P-CS). The results showed all these polysaccharides could protect cells from oxidative damage induced by t-BHP. The highest cell viabilities were 66.46 & PLUSMN; 1.36 % (P-CF), 55.2 & PLUSMN; 2.93 % (P-CL), 54.49 & PLUSMN; 1.29 % (P-CC) and 61.45 & PLUSMN; 1.67 % (P-CS), respectively. Studies have shown that four polysaccharides may protect cells from apoptosis by reducing ROS levels and maintaining MMP balance. Moreover, P-CF, P-CL, P-CC and P-CS increased the survival rate of C. elegans under thermal stress, which reduced the production of ROS by 56.1 & PLUSMN; 0.67 %, 59.37 & PLUSMN; 1.79 %, 16.63 & PLUSMN; 2.51 % and 27.55 & PLUSMN; 2.62 %, respectively. P-CF and P-CL showed stronger protective effects on C. elegans by increasing the nuclear entry rate of DAF-16 and stimulating the expression of SOD-3. Our study suggested that C. oleifera polysaccharides have the potential to develop into a natural supplement agent.

AB  - Alyssum homolocarpum seed gum (AHSG) and sodium alginate (SA) were utilized as wall materials for the microencapsulation of Echinacea purpurea extract via spray drying. Furthermore, effect of microcapsules on the oxidative stability of camelina oil was assessed over a 30-day storage period. The results showed that with an increase in AHSG concentration, the particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of emulsions decreased, while their viscosity, and stability increased. Microcapsules prepared with AHSG alone exhibited the highest encapsulation efficiency (90.70 %), loading efficiency (40.70 %), and water solubility (88.47 %), but the lowest moisture content (1.45 %), water activity (0.31), wettability (198 s), and hygroscopicity (13.50 g/100 g). Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed a spherical and smooth surface for AHSG alone-based microcapsules. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that certain chemical interactions occurred between the E. purpurea extract and wall materials. By incorporating AHSG/SA-based microcapsules containing E. purpurea extract into camelina oil, the peroxide value (increasing from 1.79 to 5.12 meq center dot O-2/kg) and anisidine value (increasing from 1.63 to 7.09) were maintained during the 30-day storage period. In conclusion, the microcapsules prepared with AHSG alone showed significant potential for encapsulating E. purpurea extract and subsequently enhancing oxidative stability of camelina oil, comparable to TBHQ.

AB  - Targeting the gut microbiota may be an emerging strategy for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Macro-molecular yeast (3-glucan (BG), derived from the yeast of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, regulates the gut microbiota. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of long-term BG in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced AD-like pathologies from the perspective of the gut microbiota. Here, we found that 80 weeks of BG treatment ameliorated HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats. In the hippocampus, BG alleviated HFDinduced the activation of astrocytes, microglia, NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway, and AD-like pathologies. BG modulated gut dysbiosis through increasing the levels of beneficial bacteria and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). BG also attenuated HFD-induced gut barrier impairment. Correlation analysis revealed a close relationship among microbiota, SCFAs, and AD-like pathologies. Furthermore, the fecal microbiota of BG-treated rats and SCFAs treatment mitigated AD-like pathologies via the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in HFD-fed aged rats. These results suggested that long-term BG promotes the production of SCFAs derived from gut microbiota, which further inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation, thereby alleviating HFD-induced AD-like pathologies in rats. BG may become a new strategy for targeting neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Lactoferrin (LF) has been shown to be effective in attenuating oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, but its potential and mechanisms in alleviating brain aging remain to be clarified. In this study, the effect of different doses of LF (L: 50, M: 500 and H: 2000 mg/kg) on D-galactose (D-gal)-induced brain aging C57BL/6 mice was evaluated. The results showed that body weight, mobility, and spatial memory capacity of aging mice were restored after LF (M & H) intervention. It also attenuated hippocampal neuronal damage and intestinal barrier damage in aging mice. LF (M & H) increased brain and serum levels of antioxidant defense enzymes (SOD, GSH, CAT) and decreased colon and serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha). Western blotting results showed that LF (M & H) increased LC3II/I, Beclin1 expression, decreased p-mTOR, p-akt, and p62 expression, and restored autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/m-TOR pathway. Furthermore, LF (M & H) protected the intestinal barrier by regulating the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and increased levels of the beneficial metabolites short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Notably, LF (H) exhibited the best anti-aging potential. 500 mg/kg/day LF intervention may be cost-effective in prevents brain aging by regulating the autophagy pathway and the microbiome-gut-brain axis.

AB  - The heart of date palm powder serves as a valuable source of various biological macromolecules, such as dietary fibers and proteins, which contribute to its benefits as a health-enhancing ingredient. The main component of the heart date palm is carbohydrates, which provide a rapid energy source and its fiber content aids digestion and promotes feelings of fullness, thereby enhancing any diet. This research studied the possibility of incorporating the heart of date palm powder at varying concentrations (0, 3 %, 6 %, 9 %, and 12 % w/v) into low-fat bio Labneh made from a mix of camel and corn milk (75 %: 25 %). Over a 21-day cold storage period, adding the heart of date palm powder improved the textural properties, sensory qualities, and bioactive compound content of low-fat bio Labneh. Furthermore, no mold, yeast, or coliform bacteria were present throughout the 21-day cold storage. The total cell count of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB12 steadily increased until the 14th day of the cold storage. According to the sensory evaluation results, up to 12 % heart of date palm powder can be added to produce low-fat bio Labneh. This study lays the groundwork for further research into the use of heart of date palm powder as an innovative functional ingredient in dairy products.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a main cause of dementia and exhibits abnormality in cognitive behaviors. Here, we probed into the role of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in cognitive dysfunction in AD. Primarily, C57BL/6 mouse and neuroblastoma cells were treated by amyloid-beta1-42 (A beta 1-42), respectively, to establish the in vivo and in vitro models of AD. The downstream genes of p75NTR were predicted by RNA-sequencing and bioin-formatics analysis. Then the interaction among p75NTR, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), microRNA-210-3p (miR-210-3p) and phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase 2 (PYCT2) was verified, followed by analysis of their effects on cognitive behaviors and biological characteristics of hippocampal neurons of mouse with AD-like symptoms. p75NTR knockout alleviated cognitive dysfunction in mice with AD-like symptoms and reduced A beta 1-42-induced hippocampal neuron damage and apoptosis. p75NTR up-regulated miR-210-3p expression by activating NF-kappa B, thereby limiting PCYT2 expression. PCYT2 silencing in p75NTR- /-mice promoted neuronal apoptosis and aggravated cognitive dysfunction in AD mouse models. In summary, p75NTR is capable of accelerating cognitive dysfunction in AD by mediating the NF-kappa B/miR-210-3p/PCYT2 axis.

AB  - Stress is an important neurological input for successful life. However, chronic stress and stress hormones could be a cause of various neurological disorders including anxiety disorders. Therefore, there have been many efforts to find effective materials for curing stress-induced neurological disorders. In this study, we examined the effect of Hydrangea macrophylla (HM) on corticosterone-induced neurotoxicity, stress-induced anxiety in mice and suggested a possible active ingredient of HM. HM protected cortical neurons against neurotoxicity of corticosterone (CORT), a stress hormone. HM also blocked CORT-induced hippocampal synaptic deficit via regulating Akt signaling. Oral administration of HM improved chronic restraint stress-induced anxiety in Elevated Plus maze test along with reduction of plasma corticosterone and TNF-alpha levels. Moreover, HM reduced stress-induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Thunberginol C, an active ingredient of HM, also prevented CORT-induced neuronal cell death and restraint stress-induced anxiety. Moreover, thunberginol C reduced plasma TNF-alpha level and neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Collectively, HM could be a good candidate for preventing stress-induced neurological disorders and thunberginol C may be an active ingredient of HM for this purpose.

AB  - Camellia polyodonta flowers are rich sources of phenolics and less attention has been paid to their potential biological activity. This study aims to explore the crude extracts and resulting purified fractions (CPFP-I, II, III, and IV) through compositional analysis and antioxidant and hypolipidemic activities in vitro and in vivo. Among four fractions, CPFP-II contained the highest total phenolic content and flavonoid content, while CPFP-III exhibited the greatest total proanthocyanidin content. Among the 14 phenolic compounds, CPFP-II displayed the highest content of procyanidin B2, B4, and C1, whereas CPFP-III contained the highest amount of 1,2,3,6-tetragalloylglucose. The DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assessments demonstrated a consistent trend: CPFP-II > CPFP-III > CPFP-I > CPFP-IV. In vivo experiments showed that that all four fractions significantly reduced lipid levels in hyperlipidemic C. elegans (p < 0.05), with CPFP-II exhibiting the most potent effect. Furthermore, CPFP-II effectively bound to bile acids and inhibited the enzymatic activity of pancreatic lipase in vitro. Consequently, CPFP-II should be prioritized as a promising fraction for further exploration and should provide substantial support for the feasibility of the C. polyodonta flower as a natural alternative.

AB  - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is necessary for maintaining a positive energy balance and essential cellular processes such as glycolysis, gene transcription, glucose uptake, and several other biological functions. However, brain injury-induced energy and metabolic stressors, such as cerebral ischemia, increase AMPK phosphorylation. Phosphorylated AMPK contributes to excitotoxicity, oxidative, and metabolic problems. Furthermore, brain disease-induced release of zinc from synaptic vesicles contributes to neuronal damage via mechanisms including ROS production, apoptotic cell death, and DNA damage. For this reason, we hypothesized that regulating zinc accumulation and AMPK phosphorylation is critical for protection against global cerebral ischemia (GCI). Through virtual screening based on the structure of AMPK subunit alpha 2, we identified a novel compound, 2G11. In this study, we verified that 2G11 administration has neuroprotective effects via the blocking of zinc translocation and AMPK phosphorylation after GCI. As a result, we demonstrated that 2G11 protected hippocampal neurons against GCI and OGD/R-derived cellular damage. In conclusion, we propose that AMPK inhibition and zinc chelation by 2G11 may be a promising tool for preventing GCI-induced hippocampal neuronal death.

AB  - Kombucha beverage is commonly prepared by black tea infusion fermentation without tea residues, and possesses various health benefits. In this paper, kombucha beverages of two non-Camellia sinensis teas, including vine tea (Ampelopsis grossedentata) and sweet tea (Rubus suavissimus), were studied for the first time. The antioxidant activities and polyphenol contents of kombucha beverages were evaluated by ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay, and Folin-Ciocalteu method, respectively. In addition, effects of tea residues on antioxidant capacities of kombucha beverages were evaluated. The results showed that kombucha beverages from vine tea and sweet tea possessed strong antioxidant activities (especially vine tea kombucha), and fermentation with tea residues could significantly increase antioxidant capacities (maximum increase of 38%) and total phenolic content (maximum increase of 55%) of two kombucha beverages compared with those without tea residues. Moreover, the sensory evaluations showed that the sensory evaluation scores of kombucha with tea residues could be improved compared with those without tea residues. Furthermore, the concentrations of several bioactive components in the kombucha beverages were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. These kombucha beverages could be used for prevention of several diseases with related of oxidative stress.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia induces an inhibition of protein synthesis and causes cell death and neuronal deficits. These deleterious effects do not occur in resilient areas of the brain, where protein synthesis is restored. In cellular stress conditions, as brain ischemia, translational repressors named eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) specifically bind to eIF4E and are critical in the translational control. We previously described that 4E-BP2 protein, highly expressed in brain, can be a molecular target for the control of cell death or survival in the reperfusion after ischemia in an animal model of transient cerebral ischemia. Since these previous studies showed that phosphorylation would not be the regulation that controls the binding of 4E-BP2 to eIF4E under ischemic stress, we decided to investigate the differential detection of 4E-BP2-interacting proteins in two brain regions with different vulnerability to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in this animal model, to discover new potential 4E-BP2 modulators and biomarkers of cerebral ischemia. For this purpose, 4E-BP2 immunoprecipitates from the resistant cortical region and the vulnerable hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region were analyzed by two-dimensional (2-D) fluorescence difference in gel electrophoresis (DIGE), and after a biological variation analysis, 4E-BP2-interacting proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Interestingly, among the 4E-BP2-interacting proteins identified, heat shock 70 kDa protein-8 (HSC70), dihydropyrimidinase-related protein-2 (DRP2), enolase-1, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme-L1 (UCHL1), adenylate kinase isoenzyme-1 (ADK1), nucleoside diphosphate kinase-A (NDKA), and Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor-1 (Rho-GDI), were of notable interest, showing significant differences in their association with 4E-BP2 between resistant and vulnerable regions to ischemic stress. Our data contributes to the first characterization of the 4E-BP2 interactome, increasing the knowledge in the molecular basis of the protection and vulnerability of the ischemic regions and opens the way to detect new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diagnosis and treatment of cerebral ischemia.</p>

AB  - Regular exercise improves several functions, including cognition, in patients with stroke. However, the effect of regular exercise on neurogenesis related to cognition remains doubtful. We investigated the most effective exercise intensity for functional recovery after stroke using RNA sequencing following regular treadmill exercise. Photothrombotic cerebral infarction was conducted for 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 36). A Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed before a regular treadmill exercise program (5 days/week, 4 weeks). Rats were randomly divided into four groups: group A (no exercise); group B (low intensity, maximal velocity 18 m/min); group C (moderate intensity, maximal velocity 24 m/min) and group D (high intensity, maximal velocity 30 m/min). After 4 weeks, another MWM test was performed, and all rats were sacrificed. RNA sequencing was performed with ipsilesional hippocampal tissue. On the day after cerebral infarction, no differences in escape latency and velocity were observed among the groups. At 4 weeks after cerebral infarction, the escape latencies in groups B, C, and D were shorter than in group A. The escape latencies in groups B and C were shorter than in group D. The velocity in groups A, B, and C was faster than in group D. Thirty gene symbols related to neurogenesis were detected (p < 0.05, fold change > 1.0, average normalized read count > four times). In the neurotrophin-signaling pathway, the CHK gene was upregulated, and the NF-kappa B gene was downregulated in the low-intensity group. The CHK and NF-kappa B genes were both downregulated in the moderate-intensity group. The Raf and IRAK genes were downregulated in the high-intensity group. Western blot analysis showed that NF-kappa B expression was lowest in the moderate-intensity group, whereas CHK and Raf were elevated, and IRAK was decreased in the high-intensity group. Moderate-intensity exercise may contribute to neuroplasticity. Variation in the expression of neurotrophins in neurogenesis according to exercise intensity may reveal the mechanism of neuroplasticity. Thus, NF-kappa B is the key neurotrophin for neurogenesis related to exercise intensity.

AB  - In women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.7% of total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (6.9%) worldwide. Bioactive dietary components such as Sea buckthorn berries are known for their high carotenoid content, which has been shown to possess anti-cancer properties. Considering the limited number of studies investigating the bioactive properties of carotenoids in breast cancer, the aim of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative, antioxidant, and proapoptotic properties of saponified lipophilic Sea buckthorn berries extract (LSBE) in two breast cancer cell lines with different phenotypes: T47D (ER+, PR+, HER2-) and BT-549 (ER-, PR-, HER2-). The antiproliferative effects of LSBE were evaluated by an Alamar Blue assay, the extracellular antioxidant capacity was evaluated through DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays, the intracellular antioxidant capacity was evaluated through a DCFDA assay, and the apoptosis rate was assessed by flow cytometry. LSBE inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a mean IC50 of 16 mu M. LSBE has proven to be a good antioxidant both at the intracellular level, due to its ability to significantly decrease the ROS levels in both cell lines (p = 0.0279 for T47D, and p = 0.0188 for BT-549), and at the extracellular level, where the ABTS and DPPH inhibition vried between 3.38-56.8%, respectively 5.68-68.65%, and 35.6 mg/L equivalent ascorbic acid/g LSBE were recorded. Based on the results from the antioxidant assays, LSBE was found to have good antioxidant activity due to its rich carotenoid content. The flow cytometry results revealed that LSBE treatment induced significant alterations in late-stage apoptotic cells represented by 80.29% of T47D cells (p = 0.0119), and 40.6% of BT-549 cells (p = 0.0137). Considering the antiproliferative, antioxidant, and proapoptotic properties of the carotenoids from LSBE on breast cancer cells, further studies should investigate whether these bioactive dietary compounds could be used as nutraceuticals in breast cancer therapy.

AB  - Despite recent advancements in the cryopreservation of dromedary camel embryos, widespread application of the technique is still limited by the need for specialised vitrification equipment and supplies. Temporary, liquidphase embryo storage methods provide a useful tool for short-term preservation of camel embryos. In the current study, we compared the use of in vitro embryo culture with cold liquid storage in order to maintain both high- (Grade 1- Excellent and 2-Good) and low- (Grade 3- Moderate and 4-Poor) morphological grade Day-7 dromedary camel embryos in vitro for up to 3 days. Embryos were either cooled and placed in HamsF10 medium supplemented with HEPES and 10% FBS and then kept at 4 degrees C; or placed in Hams-F10 supplemented with sodium bicarbonate and 10% FBS and then cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 6% CO2 at 37 degrees C before being assessed for viability at 24 h. In high-morphological grade embryos, both cold storage and culture supported 100% viability (maintenance of normal morphology) over this period (Cooled n = 22, Cultured n = 20). In low-morphological grade embryos, culture supported higher viability (16/18, 88.9%) than did cooling (4/ 18, 22.2%). We then evaluated the effect of up to 3 days of cold storage or culture on embryo morphological grade, diameter, and developmental competence following embryo transfer. High-grade embryos were divided between culture and cold storage; low-grade embryos were evaluated only after culture. Over 3 days of culture, both high- and low-grade embryos tended to either maintain or improve upon their initial morphological score (P < 0.05) and increased in diameter (P < 0.001). Embryos subjected to cooling tended to have reduced morphological scores by 48 h of storage and decreased in diameter by 72 h (P < 0.05). No significant influence of storage method (cooling vs. culture), duration (24-72 h), or embryo grade (high vs low) was observed on pregnancy establishment at Day-60 (22.2%-57.2% pregnancy rates for all treatments). Overall, rates of pregnancy establishment were similar for transferred cultured (n = 45) and cooled (n = 45) embryos (pregnancy rates at Day 18, 48% vs 51.1%; at Day 60, 37.7% vs 37.7%). Rates of embryonic loss also were similar (22.7% vs 26%). In conclusion, whilst similar rates of pregnancy and pregnancy loss were observed following the transfer of both cooled and cultured embryos held in vitro for up to 3 days, amongst the two methods, only embryo culture appears to provide a means of effectively preserving Day- 7 dromedary camel embryos with reduced morphological values in vitro. Considering these embryos appear to show poor tolerance to the cooling procedure and are unlikely candidates for vitrification, embryo culture may provide an effective method for deriving pregnancies from low-morphological grade embryos when immediate transfer is not possible on the day of flushing.

AB  - High-fat diet (HFD)-induced comorbid cognitive and behavioural impairments are thought to be the result of persistent low-grade neuroinflammation. Metformin, a first-line medication for the treatment of type-2 diabetes, seems to ameliorate these comorbidities, but the underlying mechanism(s) are not clear. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are neuroprotective peptides endowed with anti-inflammatory properties. Alterations to the PACAP/VIP system could be pivotal during the development of HFD-induced neuroinflammation. To unveil the pathogenic mechanisms underlying HFD-induced neuroinflammation and assess metformin's therapeutic activities, (1) we determined if HFD-induced proinflammatory activity was present in vulnerable brain regions associated with the development of comorbid behaviors, (2) investigated if the PACAP/VIP system is altered by HFD, and (3) assessed if metformin rescues such diet-induced neurochemical alterations. C57BL/6J male mice were divided into two groups to receive either standard chow (SC) or HFD for 16 weeks. A further HFD group received metformin (HFD + M) (300 mg/kg BW daily for 5 weeks) via oral gavage. Body weight, fasting glucose, and insulin levels were measured. After 16 weeks, the proinflammatory profile, glial activation markers, and changes within the PI3K/AKT intracellular pathway and the PACAP/VIP system were evaluated by real-time qPCR and/or Western blot in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. Our data showed that HFD causes widespread low-grade neuroinflammation and gliosis, with regional-specific differences across brain regions. HFD also diminished phospho-AKT((Ser473)) expression and caused significant disruptions to the PACAP/VIP system. Treatment with metformin attenuated these neuroinflammatory signatures and reversed PI3K/AKT and PACAP/VIP alterations caused by HFD. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that metformin treatment rescues HFD-induced neuroinflammation in vulnerable brain regions, most likely by a mechanism involving the reinstatement of PACAP/VIP system homeostasis. Data also suggests that the PI3K/AKT pathway, at least in part, mediates some of metformin's beneficial effects.

AB  - The mRNA destabilizing factor tristetraprolin (TTP) functions as a tumor suppressor by down-regulating cancer-associated genes. TTP expression is significantly reduced in various cancers, which contributes to cancer processes. Enforced expression of TTP impairs tumorigenesis and abolishes maintenance of the malignant state, emphasizing the need to identify a TTP inducer in cancer cells. To search for novel candidate agents for inducing TTP in cancer cells, we screened a library containing 1019 natural compounds using MCF-7 breast cancer cells transfected with a reporter vector containing the TTP promoter upstream of the luciferase gene. We identified one molecule, of which the enantiomers are betamethasone 21-phosphate (BTM-21-P) and dexamethasone 21-phosphate (BTM-21-P), as a potent inducer of TTP in cancer cells. We confirmed that BTM-21-P, DXM-21-P, and dexamethasone (DXM) induced the expression of TTP in MDA-MB-231 cells in a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent manner. To identify potential pathways linking BTM-21-P and DXM-21-P to TTP induction, we performed an RNA sequencing-based transcriptome analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells at 3 h after treatment with these compounds. A heat map analysis of FPKM expression showed a similar expression pattern between cells treated with the two compounds. The KEGG pathway analysis results revealed that the upregulated DEGs were strongly associated with several pathways, including the Hippo signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, FOXO signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and p53 signaling pathway. Inhibition of the FOXO pathway using a FOXO1 inhibitor blocked the effects of BTM-21-P and DXM-21-P on the induction of TTP in MDA-MB-231 cells. We found that DXM enhanced the binding of FOXO1 to the TTP promoter in a GR-dependent manner. In conclusion, we identified a natural compound of which the enantiomers are DXM-21-P and BTM-21-P as a potent inducer of TTP in breast cancer cells. We also present new insights into the role of FOXO1 in the DXM-21-P- and BTM-21-P-induced expression of TTP in cancer cells.

TI  - Ischemia-Reperfusion under Hyperthermia Increases Heme Oxygenase-1 in Pyramidal Neurons and Astrocytes with Accelerating Neuronal Loss in Gerbil Hippocampus

AB  - It has been studied that the damage or death of neurons in the hippocampus is different according to hippocampal subregions, cornu ammonis 1-3 (CA1-3), after transient ischemia in the forebrain, showing that pyramidal neurons located in the subfield CA1 (CA1) are most vulnerable to this ischemia. Hyperthermia is a proven risk factor for brain ischemia and can develop more severe and extensive brain damage related with mortality rate. It is well known that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity and expression is increased by various stimuli in the brain, including hyperthermia. HO-1 can be either protective or deleterious in the central nervous system, and its roles depend on the expression levels of enzymes. In this study, we investigated the effects of hyperthermia during ischemia on HO-1 expression and neuronal damage/death in the hippocampus to examine the relationship between HO-1 and neuronal damage/death following 5-min transient ischemia in the forebrain using gerbils. Gerbils were assigned to four groups: (1) sham-operated gerbils with normothermia (Normo + sham group); (2) ischemia-operated gerbils with normothermia (Normo + ischemia group); (3) sham-operated gerbils with hyperthermia (39.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C) during ischemia (Hyper + sham group); and (4) ischemia-operated gerbils with hyperthermia during ischemia (Hyper + ischemia group). HO-1 expression levels in CA1-3 of the Hyper + ischemia group were significantly higher than those in the Normo + ischemia group. HO-1 immunoreactivity in the Hyper + ischemia group was significantly increased in pyramidal neurons and astrocytes with time after ischemia, and the immunoreactivity was significantly higher than that in the Normo + ischemia group. In the Normo + Ischemia group, neuronal death was shown in pyramidal neurons located only in CA1 at 5 days after ischemia. However, in the Hyper + ischemia group, pyramidal neuronal death occurred in CA1-3 at 2 days after ischemia. Taken together, our findings showed that brain ischemic insult during hyperthermic condition brings up earlier and severer neuronal damage/death in the hippocampus, showing that HO-1 expression in neurons and astrocytes is different according to brain subregions and temperature condition. Based on these findings, we suggest that hyperthermia in patients with ischemic stroke must be taken into the consideration in the therapy.

AB  - Memory impairment (MI) is caused by a variety of causes, endangering human health. Yuanzhi San (YZS) is a common prescription used for the treatment of MI, but its mechanism of action needs further exploration. The purpose of this study was to investigate this mechanism through lipidomics and network pharmacology. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided randomly into the normal, model, and YZS groups. The rats were gavaged with aluminum chloride (200 mg/kg) and intraperitoneally injected with D-galactose (400 mg/kg) every day for 60 days, except for the normal group. From the 30(th) day, YZS (13.34 g/kg) was gavaged once a day to the rats in the YZS group. Post-YZS treatment, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) analysis was implemented to conduct a lipidomics study in the hippocampus of rats with memory impairment induced by aluminum chloride and D-galactose. Eight differential metabolites were identified between the normal group and the model group, whereas between the model group and the YZS group, 20 differential metabolites were established. Metabolic pathway analysis was performed on the aforementioned lipid metabolites, all of which were involved in sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Furthermore, serum pharmacochemistry analysis of YZS was carried out at the early stage of our research, which discovered 62 YZS prototype components. The results of the network pharmacology analysis showed that they were related to 1030 genes, and 451 disease genes were related to MI. There were 73 intersections between the YZS and MI targets. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that these targets were closely related to the sphingolipid metabolic, calcium signaling, and other pathways. The integrated approach of lipidomics and network pharmacology was then focused on four major targets, including PHK2, GBA, SPTLC1, and AChE, as well as their essential metabolites (glucosylceramide, N-acylsphingosine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylcholine) and pathways (sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid, and arachidonic acid metabolism). The significant affinity of the primary target for YZS was confirmed by molecular docking. The obtained results revealed that the combination of lipidomics and network pharmacology could be used to determine the effect of YZS on the MI biological network and metabolic state, and evaluate the drug efficacy of YZS and its related mechanisms of action.

AB  - Tea contains a variety of flavone C-glycosides, which are important compounds that distinguish tea cultivars and tea categories. However, the biosynthesis pathway of flavone C-glycosides in tea plant remains unknown, and the key enzymes involved have not been characterized. In this study, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method to determine 9 flavone C-glycosides was developed, and the accumulation patterns of 9 flavone C-glycosides in tea plants were examined first. Then, an entry enzyme CsF2H for flavone C-glycoside biosynthesis was identified, which had four cytochrome P450-specific conserved motifs and was targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Correlation analysis indicated that the expression level of CsF2H was positively correlated with all contents of 9 flavone C-glycosides. The recombinant CsF2H could convert flavanone (naringenin) into the corresponding 2-hydroxyflavonone (2-hydroxynaringenin), rather than into flavone (apigenin). Heterologous coexpression of CsF2H and CsCGT1 in yeast revealed that the substrate naringenin could be enzymatically converted to flavone mono-C-glycosides vitexin and isovitexin under the catalytic control of CsF2H and CsCGT1 following dehydration. Gene-specific antisense oligonucleotide analysis suggested that suppressing CsF2H significantly reduced the levels of 9 flavone C-glycosides. Together, CsF2H is the first key enzyme that generates flavone C-glycosides through the 2-hydroxyflavanone biosynthesis pathway in tea plants.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) specifically produce L-theanine, which contributes to tea function and taste. Ethylamine is a limiting factor differentiating L-theanine accumulation between tea and other plants. Ethylamine has long been assumed to be derived from L-alanine in tea. In this study, the L-alanine content in tea root cells was mainly located in vacuoles and mitochondria using a nonaqueous fractionation technique, while alanine decarboxylase in tea (CsADC) was located in the cytoplasm. Although CsADC was able to catalyze L-alanine decarboxylation to produce ethylamine in vitro, it may not provide the same enzyme activity in tea plants. Stable isotope-labeled precursor tracing in tea plants discovered that L-alanine is not a direct precursor of ethylamine but a precursor of L-glutamate, which is involved in L-theanine biosynthesis in tea. Cortex with epidermis from root tissue was the main location of ethylamine. In summary, L-alanine is converted to L-theanine via L-glutamate not ethylamine in tea plants in vivo.

AB  - BACKGROUND Local leafy vegetables are gaining attention as affordable sources of micronutrients, including vitamins, pro-vitamin carotenoids and other bioactive compounds. Stinging nettles (Urtica spp.) are used as source of fibers, herbal medicine and food. However, despite the relatively wide geographical spread of Urtica leptophylla on the American continent, little is known about its content of vitamin E congeners and carotenoids. We therefore investigated the particular nutritional potential of different plant structures of wild Costa Rican U. leptophylla by focusing on their vitamin E and carotenoid profiles. RESULTS Young, mature and herbivore-damaged leaves, flowers, stems and petioles were collected and freeze-dried. Vitamin E and carotenoids were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography after liquid/liquid extraction with hexane. alpha-Tocopherol was the major vitamin E congener in all structures. Flowers had a high content of gamma-tocopherol. Herbivore-damaged leaves had higher contents of vitamin E than undamaged leaves. Lutein was the major and beta-carotene the second most abundant carotenoid in U. leptophylla. No differences in carotenoid profiles were observed between damaged and undamaged leaves.

AB  - Camellia oleifera, a major woody oil crop in China, produces tea oil rich in unsaturated fatty acids, earning it names like liquid gold and eastern olive oil. This study provides an integrated investigation of the transcriptome and lipidome within seeds at the maturing process across three C. oleifera varieties, revealing a significant relationship between fatty acid production and genes involved in lipid synthesis. Through transcriptomic analysis, 26,344 genes with varied expression were found. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted that pathways related to starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, and lipid accumulation were highly enriched among the differentially expressed genes. Coordinated high expression of key genes (ACCase, KAS I, KAS II, KAS III, KAR, HAD, EAR, SAD, LPAAT, LACS, DGAT, PDAT) during the late maturation stage contributes largely to high oil content. Additionally, expression variations of SAD and FADs among different varieties were explored. The analysis suggests that high expression of genes such as FAD3, FAD7, and FAD8 notably increased linolenic acid content. This research provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of oil biosynthesis in C. oleifera, offering valuable references for improving yield and quality.

AB  - Theobromine is an important quality component in tea plants (Camellia sinensis), which is produced from 7-methylxanthine by theobromine synthase (CsTbS), the key rate-limiting enzyme in theobromine biosynthetic pathway. Our transcriptomics and widely targeted metabolomics analyses suggested that CsMYB114 acted as a potential hub gene involved in the regulation of theobromine biosynthesis. The inhibition of CsMYB114 expression using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) led to a 70.21% reduction of theobromine level in leaves of the tea plant, which verified the involvement of CsMYB114 in theobromine biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found that CsMYB114 was located in the nucleus of the cells and showed the characteristic of a transcription factor. The dual luciferase analysis, a yeast one-hybrid assay, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that CsMYB114 activated the transcription of CsTbS, through binding to CsTbS promoter. In addition, a microRNA, miR828a, was identified that directly cleaved the mRNA of CsMYB114. Therefore, we conclude that CsMYB114, as a transcription factor of CsTbS, promotes the production of theobromine, which is inhibited by miR828a through cleaving the mRNA of CsMYB114.

AB  - Tea aroma components are often stored as glycosidically bound forms in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). However, the determination of these glycosides in tea samples is far from optimal. In the present study, we developed a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous quantification of eight primary aroma glycosides within 10 min. After systematic optimization of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) parameters, the proposed method was highly sensitive and accurate. Optimization of the method permitted the efficient extraction of aroma glycosides. The developed method was applied to analyze the contents of aroma glycosides in different organs of tea plants, including the bud, leaves, and stem. Contents of aroma glycosides in the harvested 'Shaancha 1' ranged from 36.1 to 40454.4 mu g kg-1. Geranyl glucoside and primeveroside mainly accumulated in young leaves, while other glycosides mainly accumulated in mature leaves. The findings document a rapid, reliable, and efficient analysis method. This method will be helpful in elucidating the biosynthesis and biotransformation mechanism of tea aroma glycosides and in promoting the development of the tea industry using advanced technological control approaches during the cultivation of tea plants and tea manufacture.

AB  - Background: With therapeutic hypothermia (HT) for neonatal encephalopathy, disability rates are reduced, but not all babies benefit. Pre-clinical rodent studies suggest mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) augment HT protection. Aims: The authors studied the efficacy of intravenous (IV) or intranasal (IN) human umbilical cord derived MSCs (huMSCs) as adjunct therapy to HT in a piglet model. Methods: A total of 17 newborn piglets underwent transient cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and were then randomized to (i) HT at 33.5 degrees C 1-13 h after HI (n = 7), (ii) HT+IV huMSCs (30 x 10(6) cells) at 24 h and 48 h after HI (n = 5) or (iii) HT+IN huMSCs (30 x 10(6) cells) at 24 h and 48 h after HI (n = 5). Phosphorus-31 and hydrogen-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed at 30 h and 72 h and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and oligodendrocytes quantified. In two further piglets, 30 x 10(6) IN PKH-labeled huMSCs were administered. Results: HI severity was similar between groups. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) recovery was more rapid for HT+IN huMSCs compared with HT from 25 h to 42 h and 49 h to 54 h (P <= 0.05). MRS phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate was higher on day 2 in HT+IN huMSCs than HT (P = 0.035). Comparing HT+IN huMSCs with HT and HT+IV huMSCs, there were increased OLIG2 counts in hippocampus (P = 0.011 and 0.018, respectively), internal capsule (P = 0.013 and 0.037, respectively) and periventricular white matter (P = 0.15 for IN versus IV huMSCs). Reduced TUNEL-positive cells were seen in internal capsule with HT+IN huMSCs versus HT (P = 0.05). PKH-labeled huMSCs were detected in the brain 12 h after IN administration. Conclusions: After global HI, compared with HT alone, the authors saw beneficial effects of HT+IN huMSCs administered at 24 h and 48 h (30 x 10(6) cells/kg total dose) based on more rapid aEEG recovery, improved 31P MRS brain energy metabolism and increased oligodendrocyte survival at 72 h.

AB  - a-Farnesene, a type of acyclic sesquiterpene, is an important raw material in agriculture, aircraft fuel, and the chemical industry. In this study, we constructed an efficient a-farnesene-producing yeast cell factory by combining enzyme and metabolic engineering strategies. First, we screened different plants for a-farnesene synthase (AFS) with the best activity and found that AFS from Camellia sinensis (CsAFS) exhibited the most efficient a-farnesene production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 4741. Second, the metabolic flux of the mevalonate pathway was increased to improve the supply of the precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate. Third, inducing site-directed mutagenesis in CsAFS, the CsAFS(W281C) variant was obtained, which considerably increased a-farnesene production. Fourth, the N-terminal serine-lysine-isoleucine-lysine (SKIK) tag was introduced to construct the SKIK similar to CsAFS(W281C) variant, which further increased a-farnesene production to 2.8 g/L in shake-flask cultures. Finally, the a-farnesene titer of 28.3 g/L in S. cerevisiae was obtained by fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor.

AB  - Polyphenol-rich tea plants are aluminum (Al) accumulators. Whether an association exists between polyphenols and Al accumulation in tea plants remains unclear. This study revealed that the accumulation of the total Al and bound Al contents were both higher in tea samples with high flavonol content than in low, and Al accumulation in tea plants was significantly and positively correlated with their flavonol content. Furthermore, the capability of flavonols combined with Al was higher than that of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and root proanthocyanidins (PAs) under identical conditions. Flavonol-Al complexes signals (94 ppm) were detected in the tender roots and old leaves of tea plants through solid-state 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, and the strength of the signals in the high flavonol content tea samples was considerably stronger than that in the low flavonol content tea samples. This study provides a new perspective for studying Al accumulation in different tea varieties.

AB  - The high accumulation of galloylated flavan-3-ols in Camellia sp. is a noteworthy phenomenon. We identified a flavan3-ol galloylation-related functional gene cluster in tannin-rich plant Camellia sp., which included UGT84A22 and SCPL-AT gene clusters. We investigated the possible correlation between the accumulation of metabolites and the expression of SCPL-ATs and UGT84A22. The results revealed that C. sinensis, C. ptilophylla, and C. oleifera accumulated galloylated cis-flavan-3-ols (EGCG), galloylated trans-flavan-3-ols (GCG), and hydrolyzed tannins, respectively; however, C. nitidissima did not accumulate any galloylated compounds. C. nitidissima exhibited no expression of SCPL-AT or UGT84A22, whereas the other three species of Camellia exhibited various expression patterns. This indicated that the functions of the paralogs of SCPL-AT vary. Enzymatic analysis revealed that SCPL5 was neofunctionalized as a noncatalytic chaperone paralog, a type of chaerone-like protein, associating with flavan-3-ol galloylation; moreover, CsSCPL4 was subfunctionalized in association with the galloylation of cis- and trans-flavan-3-ols. In C. nitidissima, an SCPL4 homolog was noted with mutations in two cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond, which suggested that this homolog was defunctionalized. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the functional diversification of SCPL paralogs in Camellia sp.

AB  - Camellia sinensis contains numerous glycosylated secondary metabolites that provide various benefits to plants and humans. However, the genes that catalyze the glycosylation of multitype metabolites in tea plants remain unclear. Here, 180 uridine diphosphate-dependent glycosyltransferases that may be involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylated secondary metabolites were identified from the National Center for Biotechnology Information public databases. Subsequently, CsUGT74Y1 was screened through phylogenetic analysis and gene expression profiling. Compositional and induced expression analyses revealed that CsUGT74Y1 was highly expressed in tea tender shoots and was induced under biotic and abiotic stress conditions. In vitro enzymatic assays revealed that rCsUGT74Y1 encoded a multifunctional UGT that catalyzed the glycosylation of flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignins, and auxins. Furthermore, CsUGT74Y1-overexpressing Arabidopsis thaliana exhibited enhanced growth and accumulation of flavonol and auxin glucosides. Our findings provide insights into identifying specific UGTs and demonstrate that CsUGT74Y1 is a multifunctional UGT that promotes plant development.

AB  - Flavonoid glycosides are typical bitter and astringent tasting compounds that contribute to the taste of tea beverages. However, the genes that contribute to the biosynthesis of bitter compounds (e.g., flavanone 7-O-neohesperidoside) in tea plants have yet to be identified. In this study, we identified 194 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) from the tea transcriptome database. Among them, two genes, CsUGT75L12 and CsUGT79B28, encoding flavonoid 7-O-glycosyltransferase and 7-O-glucoside(1 -> 2)rhamnosyltransferase, respectively, were identified from Camellia sinensis. In vitro, the purified recombinant enzyme rCsUGT75L12 specifically transports the glucose unit from UDP-glucose to the 7-OH position of the flavonoid to produce the respective 7-O-glucoside. rCsUGT79B28 regiospecifically transfers a rhamnose unit from UDP-rhamnose to the 2 ''-OH position of flavonoid 7-O-glucosides to produce flavonoid 7-O-di-glycosides. Additionally, the expression profiles of the two CsUGTs were correlated with the accumulation patterns of 7-O-glucoside and 7-O-neohesperidoside, respectively, in tea plants. These results indicated that the two CsUGTs are involved in the biosynthesis of bitter flavonoid 7-O-neohesperidoside through the sequential glucosylation and rhamnosylation of flavonoids in C. sinensis. Taken together, our findings provided not only molecular insights into flavonoid di-glycoside metabolism in tea plants but also crucial molecular markers for controlling the bitterness and astringent taste of tea.

AB  - Reactive carbonyl species (RCS), sourced exogenously and endogenously, can modify proteins to generate advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which can lead to cell damage and various diseases. To date, it has not been reported that two or more RCSs can modify a single amino acid residue in proteins. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether and how formaldehyde and acrolein simultaneously modify lysine residues in proteins and whether the resulting adducts are capable of binding to the AGE receptor (RAGE). We found that the two aldehydes can comodify lysine residues in bovine serum albumin (BSA), generating a novel adduct, 5-formyl-3-methylene-2,6-dihydropyridin-lysine (FMD-lysine). In a protein band obtained from SDS-PAGE, the modified sites account for 55% of the 60 lysine residues in BSA when the molar ratio of BSA: formaldehyde: acrolein was 1:10:10. This new adduct was identified by mass spectrometry in proteins from various organs in mice after inhalation exposure to the two aldehydes. A total of 231 FMD modification sites were detected across the heart (35), liver (29), lung (33), kidney (34), hippocampus (38), brain tissues (32), plasma (8), and aorta (22). Moreover, N-acetyl-l-lysine-FMD (N-lys-FMD) stimulated more RAGE expression in RAW264.7 cells than the two common endogenous AGEs, N epsilon-carboxymethyl lysine and N epsilon-carboxyethyl lysine. Additionally, BSA-bound FMD induced a higher RAGE expression than N-lys-FMD. The activation of RAGE by FMD-lysine may trigger an inflammatory response in vivo. Thus, protein-bound FMD-lysine may serve as a promising target for monitoring both endogenous and exogenous exposure to formaldehyde and acrolein.

AB  - Nowadays, the greener pathways for the synthesis of nanostructures are being explored. The extracts of different parts of plants viz leaves, stems, and roots have been investigated. However, these extracts have been prepared by simply boiling or microwaving, or sonicating the parts of plants with water. Therefore, to have deeper insight and to investigate the full potential of plant extracts, serial extraction of leaves of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) which is a medicinally important plant was attempted using the soxhlet apparatus. The as-obtained polyphenolic-rich extract was employed for the preparation of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). Under optimized reaction conditions viz 60 degrees C temperature and 500 mu l of extract solution (5 mg ml(-1)) highly disperse spherical nanoparticles of the average size of 15.8 +/- 4.8 nm were obtained. Further, the optical band gap of Ag-NPs prepared using optimized reaction conditions was found to be 2.6 eV using the Tauc equation. Additionally, to understand the reduction by the extract, kinetic studies were also carried out which suggest the predominant occurrence of pseudo-first-order reaction. Furthermore, the mechanism of formation of Ag-NPs using major components of extract viz gallic acid and catechin which were identified by HPLC were also investigated using DFT. The mechanistic investigation was performed for both the keto-enol and radical-mediated preparation of Ag-NPs. Such theoretical investigations will help in the efficient designing of greener and novel routes for the synthesis of Ag-NPs. Additionally, the prepared silver was also employed for the colorimetric detection of H2O2.

AB  - BACKGROUND Floral and sweet odors are two typical characteristic aromas of Congou black tea, but their aroma-active compounds are still unclear. Characterizing the key aroma-active compounds can provide a theoretical foundation for the practical aroma quality evaluation of Congou black tea and directional processing technology of high-quality black tea with floral or sweet odors. Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) combined with odor activity value (OAV) is often used to screen key aroma-active substances, but the interaction between aroma components and their impact on the overall sensory quality is ignored. Therefore, in this study, OAV combined with variable importance in projection (VIP) and Spearman correlation analysis (SCA) were used to characterize the aroma-active components of Congou black teas with floral and sweet odors. RESULTS Eighty-five volatiles were identified in these samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-three compounds were identified as potential markers for the floral and sweet odors of Congou black teas from orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Eighteen compounds were selected as candidate aroma compounds based on GC-O analysis and OAV calculations. In addition, 26 compounds were screened as crucial aroma compounds based on SCA. Finally, 19 compounds were evaluated as key aroma compounds by the comprehensive evaluation of VIP, OAV, and SCA. Terpenoids are the main active compounds that contribute to the floral odor of Congou black tea, whereas aldehydes are the key compounds for the sweet odor. CONCLUSION The proposed method can effectively screen the aroma-active compounds and can be used for comprehensive quality control of products. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cold plasma (CP) was investigated as an innovative method to enhance green tea (Camellia sinensis) quality by improving extraction efficiency, bioactive retention. This study optimized dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) CP using air, argon, and nitrogen at 14, 18, and 22 kV for 6, 9, and 12 min to improve extraction and the qualitative and quantitative properties of green tea. RESULTS: CP treatments significantly impacted green tea traits. Argon and air gases, especially at higher voltages (22 kV) and longer durations (12 min), significantly increased hydrophilicity and phytochemical extraction, increasing yields by up to 48% compared to the control. These treatments had the highest total phenol [78.334 and 77.08 mg g(-1) dry weight (DW)], total flavonoid (8.09 and 7.72 mg g(-1) DW), antioxidant activity (80.74% and 81.93%), and catechins compounds content. Color properties, including brightness (L*) and greenness (a*), were enhanced compared to the control, with argon > air > nitrogen in effectiveness. Some treatments reduced color indices with higher voltage/time, while others increased them. Air and argon plasma (22 kV, 12 min) enhanced brightness, yellow-green color, and color purity in brewed tea. Principal component analysis (PCA) biplot confirmed that argon (18 and 22 kV, 12 min) and air (22 kV, 12 min) improved hydrophilicity, total phenol content, total flavonoid content, antioxidant activity, catechins, and color quality. CONCLUSIONS: While argon and air plasmas were effective for extracting important phytochemicals, successful large-scale commercialization must consider costs, ionization potential, and energy usage, and so forth, of plasmas based on argon versus air. These findings can benefit the tea processing industry in producing higher-quality products for various sectors. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Theanine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid found in the tea plant Camellia sinensis. At an elevated temperature (>90 degrees C), it released two major volatile compounds 1-ethyl-1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one and N-ethylsuccinimide. Other products were identified, including 10 pyrroles and 12 amides/imides. The formation of the two major compounds was proposed to be initiated by the deamination of theanine and through the intermediate alpha-keto acid. In the presence of glucose, the two major products and many other volatiles from theanine thermal degradation were accelerated and further Maillard reactions occurred. A total of 56 compounds were identified in the model system of theanine and glucose, including 12 amides/imides, 16 pyrazines, 16 pyrroles and other N-heterocycles, and 12 furans and other O-heterocycles. Although most of the reaction products were detected in tea leaves and in their aqueous extract with or without the addition of theanine under the same experiment conditions, imides and amides were considerably suppressed, left only minute amounts, or were even no longer detectable. Pyrazines and pyrroles were also shown at reduced concentrations as a result of the interaction with tea components but to a lesser extent. A total of 16 and 12 pyrazines were identified in the theanine/glucose reaction system and tea leaves/aqueous extract after roasting, respectively. The results indicated that pyrazines and other main volatiles in roasted tea leaves were formed from the Maillard reactions of the aqueous fraction of tea leaves. Theanine participated in the formation of pyrazines in tea leaves under roasting conditions.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the current study was to study the therapeutic potential of chrysin against repeated intranasal amyloid-beta (A beta)-induced interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling in a mouse model of AD. Methods: Male BALB/c mice were daily exposed to intranasal A beta 1-42 (10 mu g/10 mu L) for seven consecutive days. Chrysin was orally administered at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1 in 0.5% sodium carboxy methyl cellulose suspension from day 5 of A beta 1-42 administration for seven days. Following the treatment, the memory of the animals was appraised using Morris water maze, novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests. Further, the effects of chrysin on A beta 1-42-induced IL-17 signaling and redox levels were evaluated in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the mouse brain through western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: The exposure to A beta 1-42 through the intranasal route induced a significant decline in the spatial, learning and cognitive memory of the animals, and most interestingly, exposure to A beta 1-42 triggered IL-17-mediated signaling, which resulted in a significant increase in the expression of IL-17RA, Act1 and TRAF6. Furthermore, A beta 1-42 impaired the tissue redox level and inflammatory cytokines in the mouse brain. Alternatively, treatment with chrysin at 25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1 oral doses alleviated A beta 1-42-mediated memory decline, impaired redox levels and inflammation. Specifically, chrysin downregulated the expression of IL-17 and mediated signaling in the brain regions of the mice. Conclusion: Chrysin was evidenced to be a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, clearly showing a protective role against A beta 1-42-induced IL-17-mediated inflammation in the brain of the mice

AB  - Seven new polyketide compounds, four naphthoquinone derivatives, neofusarubins A-D (1, 3, 5, and 18) and three graminin-like compounds, fusofuranones A-C (19-21), together with 14 known naphthoquinone derivatives, were isolated from the solid fermentation of Fusarium solani, an endophytic fungus obtained from medicinal plant as tea, Camellia chrysantha. The structures of new compounds were elucidated based on chemical evidence and spectral data analysis (1D and 2D-NMR, HR-ESI-MS, ECD, SC-XRD). Among the isolated compounds tested, 2-acetonyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-naphthazarin (11) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against pancreatic cancer in PANC-1, MiaPaCa-2, and BxPC-3 cells. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that compound 11 inhibited cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which were confirmed by cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), microscale thermophoresis (MST) and EGFR stably knockdown cells model assay, respectively. In addition, molecular mechanism studies in vitro showed that 11 could suppress the growth of pancreatic cancer cells by targeting EGFR and effectively inhibit downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings provide a new EGFR targeting natural product for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Chronic alcohol abuse induces the cognitive deficits and is associated with low-grade inflammation and neurodegeneration. Currently, by virtue of the immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties, nutrients represent a promising strategy to attenuate cognitive impairments. We previously prepared the hydrolysates from Theragra chalcogramma skin (TCH), and this study aims to evaluate the neuroprotection of TCH on alcohol-induced cognitive impairment (AICI) and to elucidate the associated mechanism. Behavioral results showed that TCH effectively ameliorated AICI and this amelioration was highly associated with the decrease of IL-1 beta and the increase of BDNF, CREB, and PSD95 in AICI rats (P < 0.05). Furthermore, TCH restored the histopathological impairment in hippocampus by reactivating extracellular signal-regulated kinase and suppressing Caspase-3 apoptosis signal pathways and modulating the abnormality of neurotransmitters acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid(P < 0.05 or 0.01). Therefore, TCH exhibits potent attenuation of neuroinflammation and represents a potential ingredient for prevention of AICI.

AB  - Theanine and flavonoids (especially proanthocyanidins) are the most important and abundant secondary metabolites synthesized in the roots of tea plants. Nitrogen promotes theanine and represses flavonoid biosynthesis in tea plant roots, but the underlying mechanism is still elusive. Here, we analyzed theanine and flavonoid metabolism in tea plant roots under nitrogen deficiency and explored the regulatory mechanism using proteome and ubiquitylome profiling together with transcriptome data. Differentially expressed proteins responsive to nitrogen deficiency were identified and found to be enriched in flavonoid, nitrogen, and amino acid metabolism pathways. The proteins responding to nitrogen deficiency at the transcriptional level, translational level, and both transcriptional and translational levels were classified. Nitrogen-deficiency-responsive and ubiquitinated proteins were further identified. Our results showed that most genes encoding enzymes in the theanine synthesis pathway, such as CsAlaDC, CsGDH, and CsGOGATs, were repressed by nitrogen deficiency at transcriptional and/or protein level(s). While a large number of enzymes in flavonoid metabolism were upregulated at the transcriptional and/or translational level(s). Importantly, the ubiquitylomic analysis identified important proteins, especially the hub enzymes in theanine and flavonoid biosynthesis, such as CsAlaDC, CsTSI, CsGS, CsPAL, and CsCHS, modified by ubiquitination. This study provided novel insights into the regulation of theanine and flavonoid biosynthesis and will contribute to future studies on the post-translational regulation of secondary metabolism in tea plants.

AB  - Albino germplasms are prized tea plant mutants with yellow/white leaves. However, understanding of the albino mechanisms in non-Camellia sinensis tea species remains limited. This study elucidated the albino trait formation in Nanchuan Dachashu (C. nanchuanica), an arbor-type tea species, and its association with tea quality. The yellow-leaved albino individual NH1 exhibited abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure and reduced chlorophyll/carotenoid levels compared to green-leaved NL1. Integrating transcriptomics, metabolomics, yeast one-hybrid, and transgenic approaches identified the chlorophyll b reductase gene CsNYC1a as a key regulator, which was significantly up-regulated in NH1, and its overexpression in Arabidopsis recapitulated the albino phenotype. In yeast, histone CsH1.2 binds to the CsNYC1a promoter. These findings suggest that CsH1.2-CsNYC1a-mediated chlorophyll degradation may be a key mechanism underlying albino formation in Nanchuan Dachashu. In addition, as a germplasm with higher polyphenol-to-amino acid ratio than NL1, NH1 offers more possibilities for breeding and application.

AB  - We investigated the effects of cyclic peptides somatostatin, its isomer d-Trp8-somatostatin, and marketed somatostatin derivatives octreotide and lanreotide on A beta 42 aggregation and cytotoxicity in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. The aggregation kinetic studies show that all the cyclic peptides were able to reduce A beta 42 fibrillogenesis at 1, 5, 10, and 25 mu M. The native cyclic peptide somatostatin exhibited superior inhibition compared to other cyclic peptides (91% inhibition at 25 mu M) and exhibited greater inhibition compared to the reference agent orange G (86% inhibition at 25 mu M), whereas the corresponding isomer d-Trp8-somatostatin exhibited 74% inhibition at 25 mu M. The marketed drugs octreotide and lanreotide exhibited a similar inhibition profile (similar to 54% inhibition at 25 mu M). Electron microscopy and immunoblotting experiments also demonstrate their antiaggregation properties. Furthermore, the cyclic peptides were not toxic to mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells and exhibited cell viability ranging from 89 to 98.7% at 10 mu M. Strikingly, the cyclic peptides somatostatin, d-Trp8-somatostatin, octreotide, and lanreotide were able to rescue mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells from A beta 42-mediated cytotoxicity (cell viability: 71.7-83.8% at 10 mu M). The marketed cyclic peptide drugs octreotide and lanreotide exhibited superior activity (cell viability: 83.8% and 81%, respectively) in preventing A beta 42-induced cytotoxicity compared to somatostatin and d-Trp8-somatostatin. Computational studies were able to identify the potential interaction sites of cyclic peptides in the A beta 42 hexamer assembly. Our studies demonstrate the ability of these cyclic peptides to interact with A beta 42 and reduce A beta 42-induced toxicity, highlighting the potential of marketed drugs octreotide and lanreotide in drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The goal of this study is to show how to synthesize gold nanoparticles, and present a method to determine the dielectric function of nanoparticle dispersions that are used in optical biosensing applications. Camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract was used as a reducing agent to obtain nanoparticles. The gold nanoparticles were synthesized using different concentrations of green tea, which directly impact the particle size and refractive index. The experimental data from the absorption spectroscopy of colloidal solutions and the zeta potential measurements were used to determine the dielectric parameters of the gold nanoparticles. Three theoretical expressions proposed for the dielectric function have been used to estimate the measured absorption coefficient whose curves have a behavior that is quite similar to the ones obtained by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The absolute error of the peak value of the absorption coefficient is less than 1.5% in the case of the theoretical expression that most accurately describes the dielectric function of the colloidal solution of gold nanoparticles.

Here, an atrazine nanobody gene fused with a green fluorescent protein tag was transformed to Arabidopsis thaliana, which was confirmed with PCR, ELISA, and immunoblotting. High levels of nanobody accumulation were observed in the nucleus, cytoderm, and cytosol. The nanobody expressed in the plant had similar affinity, sensitivity, and selectivity as that expressed in Escherichia coli. The T3 homozygous line showed resistance in a dose-dependent manner up to 380 g ai/ha of atrazine, which is approximately one-third of the recommended field application rate. This is the first report of utilizing a nanobody in plants against herbicides. The results suggest that utilizing a high-affinity herbicide nanobody gene rather than increasing the expression of nanobodies in plants may be a technically viable approach to acquire commercial herbicide-resistant crops and could be a useful tool to study plant physiology.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory impairment. Current treatments offer only symptomatic relief, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays a crucial role in gene transcription regulation and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for AD. Building on our previous research on Atractylodes macrocephala, a traditional medicinal plant, this study reported chemical modifications on the sesquiterpene scaffold in Atractylodes. The compounds were evaluated for their LSD1 inhibitory activity and anti-AD properties in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Notably, compound A1 exhibited potent LSD1 inhibition, with an IC50 value of 0.8 mu M. In vitro assays demonstrated that A1 significantly inhibits A beta aggregation and enhances A beta-induced neuronal cell viability. Molecular dynamics results revealed stable binding interactions of A1 with LSD1 and A beta. Furthermore, in vivo studies using APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed that A1 treatment improved cognitive function and learning abilities, reduced neuroinflammation by inhibiting the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and decreased A beta deposition in the hippocampus of AD mice. These findings suggest that compound A1 is a promising candidate for the development of an effective therapy for AD, underscoring the therapeutic potential of novel LSD1 inhibitors.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common adverse event after surgical trauma in elderly patients. The pathogenesis of PND is still unclear. Adiponectin (APN) is a plasma protein secreted by adipose tissue. We have reported that a decreased APN expression is associated with PND patients. APN may be a promising therapeutic agent for PND. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of APN in PND is still unclear. In this study, 18 month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to six groups: the sham, sham + APN (intragastric (i.g.) administration of 10 mu g/kg/day for 20 days before splenectomy), PND (splenectomy), PND + APN, PND + TAK-242 (intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 3 mg/kg TAK-242), and PND + APN + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (i.p. administration of 2 mg/kg LPS). We first found that APN gastric infusion significantly improved learning and cognitive function in the Morris water maze (MWM) test after surgical trauma. Further experiments indicated that APN could inhibit the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF -Kb) p65 pathway to decrease the degree of oxidative damage (malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)), microgliamediated neuroinflammation (ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1), caspase-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin-1fi (IL-1fi), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)), and apoptosis (p53, Bcl2, Bax, and caspase 3) in hippocampus. By using LPSspecific agonist and TAK-242-specific inhibitor, the involvement of TLR4 engagement was confirmed. APN intragastric administration exerts a neuroprotective effect against cognitive deficits induced by peripheral trauma, and the possible mechanisms include the inhibition of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, mediated by the suppression of the TLR4/MyD88/NFKb signaling pathway. We propose that oral APN may be a promising candidate for PND treatment.

AB  - Neuroendocrine substances play essential roles in regulating the normal physiological functions of testicles. The purpose of this study is to explore the localization and effects of four neuroendocrine markers (NSE, SP, NFH and D beta H) in normal and cryptorchid testes of Bactrian camels using western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence methods. The results showed that cryptorchidism caused a reduction in layers of spermatogenic epithelium and decreased glycogen positivity in the basement membrane. The ultrastructure revealed that macrophages were always found around the Leydig cells, crowded with swelling mitochondria in cryptorchidism. Expression of NSE in the Leydig cells of cryptorchidism was significantly weakened compared to that in the normal group(p<0.01). We found that SP was always distributed along the nerve fibers in normal testes and was expressed in the Leydig cells of cryptorchidism. However, expression of NFH in the cryptorchidic tissue was strongly positive in the spermatogenic epithelium, with limited expression in Leydig cells and no expression in peritubular myoid cells. Therefore, the expression of D beta H in the Sertoli cells was comparatively strong in both the normal and cryptorchidism groups. NFH and D beta H expression was significantly increased in the cryptorchidism group compared with the normal group (p<0.01). These findings indicated that the underdeveloped seminiferous epithelium and pathological changes in cryptorchid tissue in Bactrian camels were potentially related to a disorder in glycoprotein metabolism. Our results suggest that NSE and SP could help judge the pathological changes of cryptorchidism. The present study provides the first evidence at the protein level for the existence of NFH and D beta H in Sertoli and Leydig cells in Bactrian camel cryptorchidism and provides a more in-depth understanding of neuroendocrine regulation is crucial for animal cryptorchidism.

AB  - Camellia sasanqua is an important economic plant that is rich in lipophilic triterpenols with pharmacological activities including antiallergic, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. However, the key enzymes related to triterpene biosynthesis have seldom been studied in C. sasanqua. Oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) are the rate-limiting enzymes related to triterpene biosynthesis. In this study, seven putative OSC genes (CsOSC1-7) were mined from the C. sasanqua transcriptome. Six CsOSCs were characterized for the biosynthesis of diverse triterpene skeletons, including alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, delta-amyrin, dammarenediol-II, psi taraxasterol, taraxasterol, and cycloartenol by the heterologous expression system. CsOSC3 was a multiple functional alpha-amyrin synthase. Three key residues, Trp260, Tyr262, and Phe415, are critical to the catalytic performance of CsOSC3 judging from the results of molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis. These findings provide important insights into the biosynthesis pathway of triterpenes in C. sasanqua.

AB  - Herbaspirillum aquaticum ZXN111 which was isolated from the tea plant Zijuan can produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and contain abiotic-stress tolerance gene 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (accd). In this study, ZXN111 PGP activity and the molecular mechanism were investigated. The result showed that ACCD activity of wild-type ZXN111 was 0.4505 mM alpha-KB/mg.Pro.h, but mutants Delta acc and Delta acc-tyrb did not showed ACCD activity. IAA production by ZXN111 within 48 hrs was 20.4 mu g/mL, while mutants of Delta tyrb and Delta acc-tyrb were lower than 3.6 mu g/mL, indicating that indole-3-pyruvic acid is the primary IAA synthesis pathway. Potting tests found that ZXN111 displayed significant PGP activity to the tea plant Zijuan, but Delta tyrb and Delta acc-tyrb did not show PGP activity, indicating that IAA is critical to PGP activity. In a salt-stress test, ZXN111 did not enhance the tea plant NaCl tolerance by gene accd. The results of this study indicated that strain ZXN111 has potential for biofertilizer development on tea plantation.

AB  - Rougui Wuyi rock tea (WRT) with the premium aroma is a subcategory of oolong tea. Roasting is a unique process that provides a comprehensive aroma to WRT. The key aroma-active compounds of rough Rougui WRT (RR) and Rougui WRT with moderate fire (RM) were characterized by sensory-directed flavor analysis. A total of 80 aroma-active compounds were identified by gas chromatography-olfactometry-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC-O-TOF-MS) and two-dimensional comprehensive gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC x GC-O-MS), and 42 of them revealing high flavor dilution (FD) factors (16-4096) during aroma extract dilution analysis were quantitated. Finally, the aroma recombination and omission experiments confirmed 26 odorants as key aroma-active compounds in Rougui WRT. Roasting enhanced the aroma of roasted, woody, burnt/smoky, and cinnamon-like odor impressions in RM evoked by 2- and 3-methylbutanal, furaneol, 3-methylbutanoic acid, propanoic acid, methional, beta-myrcene, 2-pentylfuran, 5- and 6-methyl-2-ethylpyrazine, and furfural. In contrast, hexanal, linalool, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-4-heptenal, (E)-2-heptenal, geraniol, pentanal, and beta-nerolidol were responsible for the more intense floral, fruity, and grassy/fresh leaf-like aroma attributes in RR.

AB  - Perchlorate, emerging pollution with thyroid toxicity, has a high detection rate in fresh tea leaves. What needs attention is that the uptake characteristic is insufficiently understood. Herein, the uptake, accumulation, and translocation of perchlorate in a tea plant-hydroponic solution system were investigated, of which the mechanism was further lucubrated by subcellular distribution. The perchlorate concentration in tea tissues is ramped up along with the increase in the exposure level and time. The bioaccumulation factor of tea tissues followed the rank: mature leaves > tender leaves > roots. After the seedlings have been transplanted to a perchlorate-free solution, the perchlorate in mature leaves is reduced significantly, accompanied by a progressive increase in perchlorate in new shoots and solutions. The cell-soluble fractions are the major reservoir of perchlorate both for roots (>59%) and leaves (>76%), which precisely explained the translocation within the tea plant-hydroponic solution system. These results not only illuminate the uptake characteristic in tea plants but also improve the understanding of the behavior of perchlorate in higher plants.

AB  - In many filamentary structures, such as hydrostatic arms, roots, and stems, the active or growing part of the material depends on contractile or elongating fibers. Through their activation by muscular contraction or growth, these fibers will generate internal stresses that are partially relieved by the filament acquiring intrinsic torsion and curvature. This process is fundamental in morphogenesis but also in plant tropism, nematic solid activation, and muscular motion of filamentary organs such as elephant trunks and octopus arms. Here, we provide a general theory that links the activation of arbitrary fibers at the microscale to the generation of curvature and torsion at the macroscale. This theory is obtained by dimensional reduction from the full anelastic description of three-dimensional bodies to morphoelastic Kirchhoff rods. Hence, it links the geometry and material properties of embedded fibers to the shape and stiffness of the rod. The theory is applied to fibers that are wound helically around a central core in tapered and untapered filaments.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the chemical characterization of Tianshan green tea polysaccharides (TSPS), and evaluate its antioxidant activity by chemical-based and cellular-based antioxidant models in vitro. The results showed that the TSPS were composed of mannose, ribose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, arabinose, and fucose with a molar ratio of 14.5:33.5:10.5:6.5:111.5:22.3:59.5:51: 1.0, and an average molecular weight of 19.49 kDa. TSPS exhibited excellent antioxidant ability to DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical, and ABTS radical, and enhanced the ferric-reducing power (FRAP). The antioxidation model of LO2 and HepG2 cells was established, and found that TSPS had no significant toxicity to either of the two cells at the range of 0.1-5 mg/mL, but clearly protected cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis and significantly reduced intracellular ROS level. In addition, the activities of antioxidant-associated enzymes were detected in LO2 cells, which suggested that TSPS could significantly improve the activities of SOD and CAT enzyme when the concentration was higher than 0.5 mg/mL. Furthermore, TSPS activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway by promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation and inhibited the expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1) and enhanced the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Practical applications Tianshan green tea, a local variety in Fujian Province, belongs to unfermented tea. Polysaccharide is considered as the most promising component in Tianshan green tea. This study showed that TSPS had excellent antioxidant activity and had no significant toxicity to cells, which provides a scientific foundation and new idea for its further development and application in functional foods.

AB  - As a plant hormone, salicylic acid (SA) has diverse regulatory roles in plant growth and stress resistance. Although SA is widely found in plants, there is substantial variation in basal SA among species. Tea plant is an economically important crop containing high contents of SA whose synthesis pathway remains unidentified. The phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathway is responsible for basal SA synthesis in plants. In this study, isotopic tracing and enzymatic assay experiments were used to verify the SA synthesis pathway in tea plants and evaluate the variation in phenylalanine-derived SA formation among 11 plant species with different levels of SA. The results indicated that SA could be synthesized via PAL in tea plants and conversion efficiency from benzoic acid to SA might account for variation in basal SA among plant species. This research lays the foundation for an improved understanding of the molecular regulatory mechanism for SA biosynthesis.

AB  - Background: Jinmudan (JMD) is a high-aroma variety widely cultivated in China. The current study primarily focuses on the key volatile metabolites in JMD black and oolong teas, and investigates the impact of processing technologies on the aroma quality of JMD tea. However, few studies have explored the suitability of JMD for producing a certain type of tea or the characteristic quality differences among various JMD teas using multivariate statistical analysis methods. Results: The principal volatile metabolites contributing to the floral quality of JMD tea are linalool, geraniol, indole and phenethyl alcohol. In JMD black tea (BT), the key volatile metabolites include methyl salicylate, geraniol, (E)-beta-ocimene and phenethyl alcohol. In JMD oolong tea (OT), the key volatile metabolites include indole, linalyl valerate and phenethyl alcohol. In JMD yellow tea (YT), the key volatile metabolites include methyl salicylate, geraniol and terpinolene. In JMD white tea (WT), the key volatile metabolites include methyl salicylate, geraniol and terpinolene. In JMD green tea (GT), the key volatile metabolites include (E)-beta-ocimene, indole and geraniol. Comparative analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that flavonoid biosynthesis is the primary metabolic pathway responsible for the taste differences among various tea types. GT exhibited higher levels of phloretin, dihydromyricetin and galangin. The contents of vitexin, tricetin in YT were relatively higher. The contents of aromadendrin and naringenin in BT were higher, while OT contained higher levels of kaempferol. Additionally, WT showed higher contents of 3-O-acetylpinobanksin and 3,5,7-pinobanksin. Conclusion: This study explained the reasons for the quality differences of different JMD tea and provided a reliable theoretical basis for the adaptability of JMD tea.

AB  - Studies demonstrated that alumina nanoparticles (alumina NPs) impair spatial cognition and hippocampus-dependent synaptic plasticity. Although alumina NPs accumulate in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), their effects on PFC-mediated neuronal and cognitive function have been not yet documented. Here, alumina NPs (10 or 20 mu g/kg of body weight) were bilaterally injected into the medial PFC (mPFC) of adult rats, and the levels of glycogen synthase kinase 3fi (GSK3fi) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were detected. The PFC-dependent working memory task with one-minute or three-minute delay time was conducted. Meanwhile, the neuronal correlates of working memory performance were recorded. The specific expression of neuronal BDNF was assessed by colabeled BDNF expression with the neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were employed to detect neuronal excitability. Intra-mPFC alumina NP infusions significantly enhanced the expression of GSK3fi but reduced the phosphorylation of GSK3fi (pGSK3fi) and BDNF levels more severely at a dose of 20 mu g/kg. Alumina NPs acted in a dose dependent manner to impair working memory. The neuronal expression of BDNF in the 20 mu g/kg group was markedly declined compared with the 10 mu g/kg group. During the delay time, the neuronal frequency of pyramidal cells but not interneurons was significantly weakened. Furthermore, both the frequency and amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were descended in the mPFC slices. Additionally, the infusion of GSK3fi inhibitor SB216763 or BDNF could effectively attenuate the impairments in neuronal correlate, neuronal activity, and working memory. From the perspective of the identified GSK3fi/BDNF pathway, these findings demonstrated for the first time that alumina NPs exposure can be a risk factor for prefrontal neuronal and cognitive functions.

AB  - Crateva unilocularis and C. unilocularis Buch. shoots are traditionally served as a vegetable with many health-promoting benefits. The aim of the current investigation was designed to study the preventive effect of ethanol extract from C. unilocularis shoots (CSE) on d-galactose (d-gal) induced brain and liver injury and cognitive disorders of mice, and to illuminate the potential molecular mechanisms. Results exhibited that CSE, especially at a dose of 600 mg kg(-1) b.w., remarkably improved the morphology and number of hippocampal neurons against impairment caused by d-gal (p < 0.05). Biochemical parameters displayed that CSE, especially at a high dose, substantially increased SOD (by about 35.37%, 24.98% and 45.51%), CAT (by about 45.73%, 31.44% and 30.70%), and GSH-Px (by about 36.47%, 17.68% and 52.87%) activities and decreased the level of MDA (by about 22.58%, 23.38% and 27.69%) in the plasma, liver, and brain, respectively (p < 0.05). The AChE content in mice administered a high dose of CSE decreased by about 44.48%. Further mechanism results revealed that the prevention by CSE might be achieved by upregulating the expressions of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 proteins (p < 0.05). In addition, behavioral experiments showed that CSE at a dose of 600 mg kg(-1) could significantly improve the anxiety status and impairment of learning and memory caused by d-gal (p < 0.05). These results substantially proved that C. unilocularis shoots could effectively attenuate d-gal-induced brain and liver injury and cognitive disorders of mice and could be applied to develop new functional foods to encounter aging-related impairments in brain function.

AB  - Oolong tea has gained great popularity in China due to its pleasant floral and fruity aromas. Although numerous studies have investigated the aroma differences across various tea cultivars, the genetic mechanism is unclear. This study performed multiomics analysis of three varieties suitable for oolong tea and three others with different processing suitability. Our analysis revealed that oolong tea varieties contained higher levels of cadinane sesquiterpenoids. PanTFBS was developed to identify variants of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). We found that the CsDCS gene had two TFBS variants in the promoter sequence and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding sequence. Integrating data on genetic variations, gene expression, and protein-binding sites indicated that CsDCS might be a pivotal gene involved in the biosynthesis of cadinane sesquiterpenoids.

AB  - Controlling foodborne pathogens is challenging due to the new emergence of antimicrobial resistance to conventional antimicrobials. Therefore, new alternative antimicrobials need to be developed to control foodborne pathogens and avoid microbial resistance. Furthermore, the potential of trans-Himalayan high-altitude seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides ) plants has not been explored much for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles having antibacterial properties. Hence, this study investigated the development of long-term stable silver nanomaterials using the aqueous extract of seabuckthorn leaves through a green-synthesis approach and evaluated their antibacterial efficacy. These synthesized nanomaterials were characterized along with their stability using UV spectrometry for lambda max (lambda max) characteristics. Further, the nanoparticles were evaluated for zeta potential (mV), polydispersity index, particle size distribution (nm), electrophoretic mobility (mu mcm/Vs) and conductivity (mS/cm). The seabuckthorn silver nanoparticles are of 260nm size and stable (-15mV zeta potential) with good antioxidant and antibacterial properties against two typical food pathogens, e.g., Escherichia coli (MTCC 3222) and Salmonella typhimurium (MTCC 3224). Hence, this study developed an eco-friendly, rapid, low-cost green synthesis method for the development of seabuckthorn-coated, stable silver nanoparticles with good antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogens.

AB  - The physiological and metabolic differences between shoot tips and roots of tea plants are significant, and understanding them is required for improvement of tea quality and plant growth. A high-quality full-length transcriptome sequencing on tea plant roots and shoot tips by PacBio SMRT technology was done to gain a further understanding. Approximately 160699 and 166120 full-length transcripts were recovered in roots and shoots, respectively, including 31232 and 41068 novel isoforms and 16960 and 26029 alternative splicing (AS) isoforms. These supported 21699 full-length reads and 31232 and 41068 novel transcripts from root and shoot, respectively, including 1679 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 2772 fusion transcripts, which significantly upgrade the Camellia sinensis genome annotation. The respective 6475 and 6981 transcripts in roots and shoots differ in 3'-untranslated regions. Meanwhile, extensive analyses of novel transcripts, ASs, and lncRNAs also revealed a large number of ASs and lincRNAs closely related to the regulation of characteristic secondary metabolites including catechins, theanine, and caffeine. Finally, a root-specific CsMYB6 was characterized to regulate theanine biosynthesis by genetic and molecular analyses. CsMYB6 directly bound to and activate the promoter of theanine synthetase gene (CsTSI). The study lays a foundation for the further investigation of metabolic genomics and regulation in tea plants.

AB  - An efficient and promising method of treating complex neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the multitarget-directed approach. Here in this work, a series of quinazoline derivatives (AV-1 to AV-21) were rationally designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as multitargeted directed ligands against human cholinesterase (hChE) and human beta-secretase (hBACE-1) that exhibit moderate to good inhibitory effects. Compounds AV-1, AV-2, and AV-3 from the series demonstrated balanced and significant inhibition against these targets. These compounds also displayed excellent blood-brain barrier permeability via the PAMPA-BBB assay. Compound AV-2 significantly displaced propidium iodide (PI) from the acetylcholinesterase-peripheral anionic site (AChE-PAS) and was found to be non-neurotoxic at the maximum tested concentration (80 mu M) against differentiated SH-SY5Y cell lines. Compound AV-2 also prevented AChE- and self-induced A beta aggregation in the thioflavin T assay. Additionally, compound AV-2 significantly ameliorated scopolamine and A beta-induced cognitive impairments in the in vivo behavioral Y-maze and Morris water maze studies, respectively. The ex vivo and biochemical analysis further revealed good hippocampal AChE inhibition and the antioxidant potential of the compound AV-2. Western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of hippocampal brain revealed reduced A beta, BACE-1, APP/A beta, and Tau molecular protein expressions levels. The pharmacokinetic analysis of compound AV-2 demonstrated significant oral absorption with good bioavailability. The in silico molecular modeling studies of lead compound AV-2 moreover demonstrated a reasonable binding profile with AChE and BACE-1 enzymes and stable ligand-protein complexes throughout the 100 ns run. Compound AV-2 can be regarded as the lead candidate and could be explored more for AD therapy.

AB  - This trial evaluated the effects of co-supplementing Camelina sativa oil (CSO) and a prebiotic as modulators of the gut microbiota on cardiometabolic risk factors and mental health in NAFLD patients. In all, 44 subjects with NAFLD were allocated to either an intervention (20 g d(-1) CSO + resistant dextrin) or a placebo (20 g d(-1) CSO + maltodextrin) group and received a calorie-restricted diet (-500 kcal d(-1)) for 12 weeks. Fasting plasma levels of gucose, insulin, hs-CRP, endotoxin, antioxidant enzyme activity, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 alpha, and uric acid were measured at the baseline and post-intervention. The depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS) and the general health questionnaire (GHQ) were used to assess mental health. Co-supplementing CSO and resistant dextrin significantly decreased the level of insulin concentration (-0.84 mu U ml(-1), p = 0.011), HOMA-IR (-0.27, p = 0.021), hs-CRP (-1.25 pg ml(-1), p = 0.023), endotoxin (-3.70 EU mL(-1), p = 0.001), cortisol (-2.43, p = 0.033), GHQ (-5.03, p = 0.035), DASS (-9.01, p = 0.024), and MDA (-0.54 nmol mL(-1), p = 0.021) and increased the levels of TAC (0.16 mmol L-1, p = 0.032) and superoxide dismutase (106.32 U g(-1) Hb, p = 0.45) in the intervention group compared with the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in the levels of other biomarkers. Co-supplementing CSO and resistant dextrin in combination with a low-calorie diet may improve metabolic risk factors and mental health in NAFLD patients.

AB  - Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a non-tyrosine kinase receptor and when overexpressed, leads to angiogenesis. High expression of NRP-1 has been observed in various cancers. Unique characteristic of nanobodies (small size, high affinity and stability, and ease production) make them potential therapeutic tools. Oligoclonal nanobodies which detect multiple functional epitopes on the target antigen could be potential tools for inhibition of cancer resistance problems due to escape variant of tumor cells. In this study, oligoclonal anti-NRP-1 nanobodies were selected from camel immune library and their binding activities as well as in vitro functionality were evaluated. Anti-NRP-1 nanobodies were expressed in an Escherichia coli host, and purified using nickel affinity chromatography. The effect of each individual and oligoclonal nanobodies on human endothelial cells were evaluated by MTT, Tube formation, and migration assay as well. Results showed that oligoclonal anti-NRP-1 nanobodies detected different epitopes of NRP-1 antigen and inhibited in vitro angiogenesis of human endothelial cells better than each individual nanobody. Results indicate promising oligoclonal anti-NRP-1 nanobodies for inhibition of angiogenesis.

AB  - Bisphenol AF (BPAF) has been widely used as a main alternative to bisphenol A (BPA), and previous in vitro studies have shown that BPAF has higher reproductive toxicity potentials than BPA. However, data on in vivo toxicity of BPAF is still limited. In this study, Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to BPAF (0, 50, and 100 mg/kg/ day) during gestation to study toxicokinetics and reproductive toxicity in offspring. The results showed that plasma concentrations BPAF peaked within 6 h after birth, followed by a two-phase decay, with clearance rates of approximately 3.0 l/h and terminal half-life values ranging from 77 h to 114 h, suggesting fast absorption and high persistence of BPAF. At postnatal day 21 (PND21), BPAF was found to be bioaccumulated in reproductive organs (testes and ovaries) of the offspring, resulting in adverse effects on reproduction in both sexes. Lower anogenital distance, reduced relative testicular weight, dissolved interstitial cells, fewer primary spermatocytes, decreased testosterone levels, and increased luteinizing hormone levels were detected in male offspring. In female offspring, vacuolization in follicular antrum, fewer follicles, increased 17 beta-estradiol levels, and increased luteinizing hormone levels in female offspring were found. Gene expression of scavenger receptor class B type I (SRB1), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and several steroidogenic enzymes was significantly decreased in male offspring following maternal exposure to BPAF, suggesting that the decreases in testosterone levels is a result of inhibited cholesterol uptake, cholesterol de novo synthesis, and steroidogenesis. In addition, inhibition of pathways of phagosome and cell adhesion molecules might be the underlying molecular mechanism involved in BPAF-induced reproductive disorders in male offspring. This study provides the scientific basis for a comprehensive assessment of the safety of BPAF.

AB  - To analyze the role of Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway in the regulation of the acute phase of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in juvenile rats by Tatarinow Sweetflag Extract (TSE). One hundred and twenty SPF-grade Wistar male rats were were divided into five groups by random number table method, namely, normal group, model group, low-dose TSE group, high-dose TSE group, low-dose TSE + Nrf2 inhibitor Brusatol group (low-dose TSE + BRU group), and high-dose TSE + Nrf2 inhibitor Brusatol group (high-dose TSE + BRU group), with 20 rats in each group. The success rate of modelling in the model group, low-dose TSE group, high-dose TSE group, low-dose TSE + BRU group, high-dose TSE + BRU group were 60.00% (12/20), 65.00% (13/20), 65.00% (13/20), 70.00% (14/20), and 70.00% (14/20), respectively, showing no significant difference (P > 0.05). The latency and incidence of class IV and V, discharge amplitude as well as frequency of rats in the low- and high-dose TSE groups were lower than those in the model group (P < 0.05); the lipid peroxide and malondialdehyde concentrations in hippocampal tissues in the low- and high-dose TSE groups were lower than those in the model group (P < 0.05); The Nrf2, NQO-1 and HO- 1 protein and mRNA expression levels were increased in the low- and high-dose TSE groups compared with the model group (P < 0.05). The therapeutic effect of TSE in rats with acute epilepsy was satisfactory, and its mechanism of action may be related to activation of Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway to reduce the degree of oxidative stress.

AB  - Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a biomaterial produced by Gluconacetobacter xylinus, with wide applicability in different areas, such as biomedical, pharmaceutical, and food. BC production is usually carried out in a medium containing phenolic compounds (PC), such as teas, however, the purification process leads to the loss of such bioactive. Thus, the innovation of this research consists of the reincorporation of PC after the purification of the BC matrices through the biosorption process. In this context, the effects of the biosorption process in BC were evaluated to maximize the incorporation of phenolic compounds from a ternary mixture of hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa), white tea (Camellia sinensis), and grape pomace (Vitis labrusca). The biosorbed membrane (BC-Bio) showed a great concentration of total phenolic compounds (TPC = 64.89 mg L-1) and high antioxidant capacity through different assays (FRAP: 130.7 mg L-1, DPPH: 83.4 mg L-1, ABTS: 158.6 mg L-1, TBARS: 234.2 mg L-1). The physical tests also indicated that the biosorbed membrane presented high water absorption capacity, thermal stability, low permeability to water vapor and improved mechanical properties compared to BC-control. These results indicated that the biosorption of phenolic compounds in BC efficiently increases bioactive content and improves physical membrane characteristics. Also, PC release in a buffered solution suggests that BC-Bio can be used as a polyphenol delivery system. Therefore, BC-Bio is a polymer with wide application in different industrial segments.

AB  - Objective: Radix Hedysari Polysaccharides (RHP) are the principal bioactive constituents of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Radix Hedysari. This study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of RHP in both cellular and animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: HT22 cells subjected to A beta 25-35-induced cytotoxicity were pretreated with RHP, followed by assessments of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial superoxide (mSOX) levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m). Senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice were orally administered RHP for 12 weeks. Behavioral assays were conducted to assess cognitive function, while metabolomic and proteomic analyses were performed to examine serum metabolic alterations and hippocampal protein expression profiles. Additionally, neuronal autophagy and gut barrier integrity were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and biomarker quantification. Results: RHP treatment significantly attenuated A beta 25-35-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells by reducing ROS and mSOX production while preserving Delta Psi m. In SAMP8 mice, RHP improved cognitive performance, preserved hippocampal mitochondrial ultrastructure, and enhanced neuronal autophagic activity. Moreover, RHP modulated serum metabolic pathways and alleviated gut barrier dysfunction, suggesting a role in gut-brain axis regulation. Conclusion: RHP ameliorates cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice, potentially through its modulation of systemic metabolism, mitigation of neuronal mitochondrial damage, and restoration of gut barrier integrity. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of RHP in AD intervention and warrant further investigation into its mechanistic underpinnings.

AB  - Background: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible vision impairment worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of glaucoma, are not yet fully understood. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA sequencing, and ATAC-seq datasets (GSE203499, GSE212186, GSE241782, GSE212188) containing data from glaucoma and control samples were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and chromatin accessibility changes. Functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and transcriptional regulatory networks were assessed using bioinformatics tools. Experimental validation was subsequently conducted using ELISA assays and RT-qPCR on human aqueous humor and serum, in vitro R28 cell excitotoxicity models, and in vivo retinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and NMDA-induced glaucoma rat models. Pharmacological inhibitors (JSH-23 for NF-kappa B; TED-347 for Hippo) were finally tested for neuroprotective effects. Results: Multi-omics integration identified Bcl3 and Edn2 as key proteins aberrantly upregulated in POAG, correlating with immune infiltration of M1 macrophages and CD4+ follicular T cells, and were enriched in the NF-kappa B and Hippo signaling pathways. Experimental validation confirmed elevation of Bcl3 and Edn2 expression in POAG patients' aqueous humor/serum, glaucoma animal models, and glutamate-injured R28 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of the NF-kappa B and Hippo pathways reduced Bcl3/Edn2 expression and mitigated retinal ganglion cell injury. Conclusions: In summary, Bcl3 and Edn2 could be significant in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying POAG.

AB  - Background MircoRNAs (miRNAs) play a central role in diverse biological processes of Camellia sinensis var.assamica (CSA) through their associations with target mRNAs, including CSA growth, development and stress response. However, although the experiment methods of CSA miRNA-target identifications are costly and time-consuming, few computational methods have been developed to tackle the CSA miRNA-target association prediction problem. Results In this paper, we constructed a heterogeneous network for CSA miRNA and targets by integrating rich biological information, including a miRNA similarity network, a target similarity network, and a miRNA-target association network. We then proposed a deep learning framework of graph convolution networks with layer attention mechanism, named MTAGCN. In particular, MTAGCN uses the attention mechanism to combine embeddings of multiple graph convolution layers, employing the integrated embedding to score the unobserved CSA miRNA-target associations. Discussion Comprehensive experiment results on two tasks (balanced task and unbalanced task) demonstrated that our proposed model achieved better performance than the classic machine learning and existing graph convolution network-based methods. The analysis of these results could offer valuable information for understanding complex CSA miRNA-target association mechanisms and would make a contribution to precision plant breeding.

AB  - The increasing production and consumption of tea drinks has led to the generation of large amounts of discarded extracted tea residues. As a result, researchers have attempted to extract tea water-insoluble protein (TP) from discarded tea residues to produce food emulsifiers. Thus, in this study, high-internal-phase Pickering emulsions (HIPPEs) stabilized by TP were developed and characterized. First, the effects of salt ions on the emulsifying properties of TP were examined using interfacial tension and hydrophobicity. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the suitable range of salt ions in the processing stage. Then, the particle size distribution, microstructure, rheological properties, and stability of the emulsions were systematically investigated by controlling the oil phase volume, particle concentration of TP, and emulsification method. The results showed that TP was effectively adsorbed on the oil-water interface and formed a stable particle layer, which means that TP-stable high-internal-phase Pickering emulsions (TPHIPPEs) has been successfully prepared. Further analysis showed that TPHIPPEs exhibited good stability and gelation properties. The pH range was 7-9, and the salt ion concentration was <0.5 M. Additionally, TPHIPPEs exhibited excellent temperature tolerance and antioxidant ability. Finally, the application development results revealed that the loading and retention rates of beta-carotene in TPHIPPEs were significantly higher than those of the control group of camellia oil, and that TPHIPPEs exhibited good resistance to UV light and thermal degradation. This study provides new insights into the high-value utilization of tea residue resources.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the use of green solvents, natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDES), in comparison with conventional solvents on the extraction of free unbound phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of extracts of dried bilberry fruit, bilberry leaves and green tea leaves. After preparation of the extracts via ultrasound-assisted extraction using NaDES and conventional solvents (water and ethanol), spectrophotometric determination of total phenolic and flavonoid content, HPLC analysis of extracted polyphenols and antioxidant determination using FRAP, DPPH and ABTS assays were conducted. The results showed that NaDES have a great potential as agents for the extraction of phenolic compounds with potent antioxidant activity; the highest values of phenolic content and antioxidant activity were detected in the samples obtained by extraction using the NaDES combination betaine + urea. The bilberry leaves exhibited the highest flavonoid content among all extracts and turned out to be more active than bilberry fruits, to which they are often just a by-product during processing. The most active extract of all was the betaine-urea green tea leaves extract. Further research into the most active NaDES extracts should be performed.

AB  - The diminished ability for muscle to regenerate is associated with aging, diabetes, and cancers. Muscle regeneration depends on the activation and differentiation of satellite cells (SCs). Inactivation of Mst1/2 promotes cell proliferation by activating Yap, and that has been reported as a potential therapeutic target for improving many organ regeneration. However, the function of Mst1/2 in SCs fate decision and that effect on muscle regeneration remain unknown. By using inducible conditional knockout Mst1/2 in the SCs of mice and an inhibitor of Mst1/2, we found that inhibition of Mst1/2 in SCs significantly decrease Yap phosphorylation, thus causing Yap to accumulate in the nucleus and impairing SC differentiation; Mst1/2 were slightly elevated by irisin stimulation during SC differentiation; but inhibiting Mst1/2 in SCs significantly impaired irisin-induced muscle regeneration. These results indicate that Mst1/2 is necessary for SC differentiation and inhibiting Mst1/2 as a therapeutic target has potential risks for muscle regeneration.

AB  - Selenoprotein W (Selenow) is a similar to 9 kDa selenoprotein suggested to play a beneficial role in resolving inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. SELENOW expression in the human GI tract using ScRNAseq Gut Cell Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases revealed its expression in the small intestine and colonic epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and stem cells and correlated with a protective effect in ulcerative colitis patients. Selenow KO mice treated with 4% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) showed exacerbated acute colitis, with greater weight loss, shorter colons, and increased fecal occult blood compared to the WT counterparts. Selenow KO mice expressed higher colonic Tnf alpha, increased Tnf alpha(+) macrophages in the colonic lamina propria, and exhibited loss in epithelial barrier integrity and decreased zonula occludens 1 (Zo-1) expression following DSS treatment. Expression of epithelial cellular adhesion marker (EpCam), yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1), and epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) were decreased along with CD24lo cycling epithelial cells in Selenow KO mice. Colonic lysates and organoids confirmed a crosstalk between Egfr and Yap1 that was regulated by Selenow. Overall, our findings suggest Selenow expression is key for efficient resolution of inflammation in experimental colitis that is mediated through the regulation of Egfr and Yap1.

AB  - Background The lack of better understanding of the pathophysiology and cellular mechanisms associated with high mortality seen in hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a neurological complication arising from acute hepatic failure, remains a challenging medical issue. Clinical reports showed that the degree of baroreflex dysregulation is related to the severity of HE. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a key component of the baroreflex loop that maintains blood pressure and sympathetic vasomotor tone, is known to underpin impairment of baroreflex. Realizing that in addition to angiogenic and vasculogenic effects, by acting on its key receptor (VEGFR2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) elicits neuroprotection via maintenance of mitochondrial function, the guiding hypothesis of the present study is that the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling plays a protective role against mitochondrial dysfunction in the RVLM to ameliorate baroreflex dysregulation that underpins the high fatality associated with HE. Methods Physiological, pharmacological and biochemical investigations were carried out in proof-of-concept experiments using an in vitro model of HE that involved incubation of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons with ammonium chloride. This was followed by corroboratory experiments employing a mouse model of HE, in which adult male C57BL/6 mice and VEGFR2 wild-type and heterozygous mice received an intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane, a toxin used to induce acute hepatic failure. Results We demonstrated that VEGFR2 is present in cultured neurons, and observed that whereas recombinant VEGF protein maintained cell viability, gene-knockdown of vegfr2 enhanced the reduction of cell viability in our in vitro model of HE. In our in vivo model of HE, we found that VEGFR2 heterozygous mice exhibited shorter survival rate and time when compared to wild-type mice. In C57BL/6 mice, there was a progressive reduction in VEGFR2 mRNA and protein expression, mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, alongside augmentation of apoptotic cell death in the RVLM, accompanied by a decrease in baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone and hypotension. Immunoneutralization of VEGF exacerbated all those biochemical and physiological events. Conclusions Our results suggest that, acting via VEGFR2, the endogenous VEGF plays a protective role against high fatality associated with HE by amelioration of the dysregulated baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone through sustaining mitochondrial bioenergetics functions and eliciting antiapoptotic action in the RVLM.

AB  - BMPs regulate synovial quiescence and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus in non-stress conditions. However, changes in BMP expression that are induced by inflammation during rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have not yet been reported. Here, we show that signalling with synovial BMPs (BMP-4 and -7) mediates the effect of systemic inflammation on adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus during pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in Dark Agouti (DA) rats, an animal model of RA. Moreover, we show gender differences in BMP expressions and their antagonists (Noggin and Gremlin) during PIA and their correlations with the clinical course and IL-17A and TNF-alpha levels in serum. Our results indicate gender differences in the clinical course, where male rats showed earlier onset and earlier recovery but a worse clinical course in the first two phases of the disease (onset and peak), which correlates with the initial increase of serum IL-17A level. The clinical course of the female rats worsened in remission. Their prolonged symptoms could be a reflection of an increased TNF-alpha level in serum during remission. Synovial inflammation was greater in females in PIA-remission with greater synovial BMP and antagonist expressions. More significant correlations between serum cytokines (IL-17A and TNF-alpha), and synovial BMPs and their antagonists were found in females than in males. On the other hand, males showed an increase in hippocampal BMP-4 expression during the acute phase, but both genders showed a decrease in antagonist expressions during PIA in general. Both genders showed a decrease in the number of Ki-67(+) and SOX-2(+) and DCX+ cells and in the ratio of DCX+ to Ki67(+) cells in the dentate gyrus during PIA. However, in PIA remission, females showed a faster increase in the number of Ki67(+), SOX-2(+), and DCX+ cells and a faster increase in the DCX/Ki67 ratio than males. Both genders showed an increase of hippocampal BMP-7 expression during remission, although males constantly showed greater BMP-7 expression at all time points. Our data show that gender differences exist in the BMP expressions in the periphery-hippocampus axis and in the IL-17A and TNF-alpha levels in serum, which could imply differences in the mechanisms for the onset and progression of the disease, the clinical course severity, and adult neurogenesis with subsequent neurological complications between genders.

AB  - Large-leaf Yellow tea (LYT) is a traditional beverage from Camellia Sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze in China and has unusual health-regulating functions. This investigation explored the structural characteristics of a polysaccharide extracted from LYT, which possesses anti-inflammatory activity. The polysaccharide HDCP-2, obtained through ethanol fractional precipitation and then DEAE-52 anion exchange column, followed by DPPH radical scavenging screening, exhibited a yield of 0.19 %. The HPGPC method indicated that the molecular weight of HDCP-2 is approximately 2.9 x 104 4 Da. Analysis of the monosaccharide composition revealed that HDCP-2 consisted of mannose, glucose, xylose, and galacturonic acid, and their molar ratio is approximately 0.4:0.5:1.2:0.7. The structure motif of HDCP-2 was probed carefully through methylation analysis, FT-IR, and NMR analysis, which identified the presence of f3-D-Xylp(1-*, D-Xyl p (1-*,-*2, 4)-f3-D-Xylp(1-*, D-Xyl p (1-*,-*3)-f3-D-Manp(1-*, D-Man p (1-*, a-D-Glcp(1-* D-Glc p (1-* and-*2, 4)-a-D- D- GalAp(1-* p (1-* linkages. A CCK-8 kit assay was employed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of HDCP-2. These results demonstrated that HDCP-2 could inhibit the migration and proliferation of the MH7A cells and reduce NO production in an inflammatory model induced by TNF-a. The abundant presence of xylose accounted for 39% of the LYT polysaccharide structure, and its distinctive linking mode (-*2, 4)-f3-D-Xylp(1-*) D-Xyl p (1-*) appears to be the primary contributing factor to its anti-inflammatory effect.

AB  - Nervonic acid (NA) is an extremely long chain monounsaturated fatty acid that plays a crucial biological role in brain development and repair. However, its low solubility reduced bioavailability and limited its applications. In this study, spherical water-soluble nervonic acid composite micro-powder (NA-WM) was constructed by layerby-layer self-assembly technology under electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bond, in which electronegative NA was used as the core material, and electropositive COS (Chitosan oligosaccharide) with neuroprotective properties and electronegative SF (Silk fibroin) with biocompatibility and anti-inflammatory synergism were used as the wall material. In the preparation process, the electronegative NA was first combined with electropositive COS by antisolvent method, and then the electropositive COS-NA complex was encapsulated with electronegative SF to form NA-WM. The optimal preparation conditions were screened and optimized via singlefactor and BBD method. Under the optimum conditions, the average particle size of NA-WM was 420 +/- 35 nm. The results of TGA (Thermogravimetric), SEM (Scanning electron microscopy), and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) confirmed that NA-WM had good thermal stability and spherical-defined layer-to-layer structure. Additionally, at pH 1.5, the NA release rate of NA-WM was as high as 89.54 % within 2.5 h. Through measuring the levels of MDA (Malondialdehyde), CAT (Catalase), SOD (Superoxide dismutase), GSH-Px (Glutathione peroxidase), and LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase), as well as flow cytometry and SEM analysis, it was confirmed that NA-WM could protect A beta 1-42-induced HT22 by inhibiting oxidative stress and reducing mitochondrial membrane potential. This study provided data support for the development and application of NA.

AB  - The neurotrophic factor Neuritin is known to enhance cognitive capacity and to mitigate synaptic impairments in the APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model, suggesting therapeutic potential for clinical treatment. However, the core molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death linked to iron dysregulation and oxidative stress, contributes to neurodegeneration in AD in part by accelerating amyloid-beta deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation. Here we examined if Neuritin can mitigate cognitive decline and neural degeneration in AD model mice by suppressing ferroptosis. Age-dependent cognitive decline was associated with Neuritin downregulation and increased ferroptosis in the hippocampus. Intracerebroventricular injection of exogenous Neuritin mitigated spatial and fear learning deficits as well as neural oxidative stress, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in the hippocampus without causing deleterious side effects. Neuritin injection also upregulated the activity of NAD+ kinase (NADK), the enzyme responsible for converting NAD to anti-ferroptotic NADPH, in the hippocampus of AD mice as well as in cultured hippocampal neurons. Reduced Neuritin expression in the hippocampus AD mice was associated with reduced phosphorylation (activation) of Akt (p-Akt), and Neuritin administration enhanced p-Akt expression in both HT22 cells and AD model mice. Conversely, blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway in HT22 cells reversed the Neuritin-induced increase in NADK activity and reduction in ferroptosis, indicating that Neuritin protects neurons from AD-induced damage by enhancing NADK activity through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Collectively, our results support Neuritin upregulation as a potential therapeutic strategy for early-phase AD.

AB  - Protein aggregation is a multifaceted phenomenon prevalent in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, yielding aggregates of diverse sizes. Recently, increased attention has been directed towards early protein aggregates due to their pronounced toxicity, largely stemming from inflammation mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study advocates for a therapeutic approach focusing on inflammation control rather than mere ROS inhibition in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we introduced Camellia sinensis cellulose nanoonion (CS-CNO) as an innovative, biocompatible nanocarrier for encapsulating the phytosteroid diosgenin (DGN@CS-CNO). The resulting nano-assembly, manifesting as spherical entities with dimensions averaging similar to 180-220 nm, exhibits a remarkable capacity for the gradual and sustained release of approximately 39-44 % of DGN over a 60-hour time frame. DGN@CS-CNO displays a striking ability to inhibit or disassemble various phases of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) protein aggregates, including the early (HEWLEA) and late (HEWLLA) stages. In vitro experiments employing HEK293 cells underscore the potential of DGN@CS-CNO in mitigating cell death provoked by protein aggregation. This effect is achieved by ameliorating ROS-mediated inflammation and countering mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by alterations in TNF alpha, TLR4, and MT-CO1 protein expression. Western blot analyses reveal that the gradual and sustained release of DGN from DGN@CS-CNO induces autophagy, a pivotal process in dismantling intracellular amyloid deposits. In summary, this study not only illuminates a path forward but also presents a compelling case for the utilization of phytosteroid as a formidable strategy against neuroinflammation incited by protein aggregation.

AB  - Chronic stress induces neuronal death and impairs hippocampal neurogenesis, thus leading to cognitive deficits and depressive-like behaviors. Our previous studies found that apelin-13, a novel neuropeptide, and its receptors can improve cognitive impairment and depressive-like behaviors in rats, but its mechanism remains unknown. The study aims to evaluate the underlying mechanism of apelin-13 on cognitive impairment and depressive-like behaviors. A 4-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is used to establish a rat model of depression. Apelin-13(2 ug/day) is administered daily to the rats during the last 1 week. Depressive-like behaviors, including tail suspension test (TST) and sucrose preference test (SPT), are performed. The cognitive functions are established by identify index of novel objects recognition test (NORT) and the number of crossing hidden platform in morris water maze (MWM). The neuronal death is measured by popidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-PX) in the hippocampus are determined. The protein expressions of p-AMPK, AMPK, BDNF, FNDC5 and PGC-1 alpha are examined. Golgi staining observed the spine dendritic arborization of the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) subregion. Results showed that apelin-13 improves cognitive impairment and ameliorates depressive-like behaviors. Moreover, apelin-13 significantly inhibits neuronal death via AMPK/PGC-1 alpha/FNDC5/BDNF pathway. Taken together, apelin-13 could exert antidepressant effects via protecting neuron functions, which might be related to the activation of AMPK/PGC-1 alpha/FNDC5/BDNF pathway.

AB  - Female rhinoceroses have an ovarian reserve that consists of immature oocytes in primordial follicles. Establishing methods to grow and culture these oocytes from those follicles in the laboratory might fuel efforts towards in vitro embryo production in this species without the need for repeated in vivo oocyte collection. In depth understanding of the biology behind and improvement of assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) is the only option for preventing the disappearance of functionally extinct species such as the northern white rhinoceros. In vitro follicle development can only be obtained by in depth knowledge on rhinoceros ovarian histology. In addition to known ovarian features, we identified numerous undescribed structural and molecular ovarian characteristics from adult southern white rhinoceros (n=3). Ovarian sections were stained with H&E, PAS or Masson Trichrome and molecular analyses (hyaluronic acid detection, immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay) were performed to identify proliferation, extracellular matrix, pluripotency markers, hormones, enzymes, markers for inflammation or endocrine glands, blood vessel presence, oocyte markers and apoptosis. Besides degenerating, deformed, or luteinized follicles, analysis revealed several 'follicle-like structures' (FLS) that deviated from the expected follicle appearance. Most importantly, the majority of FLS did not contain any oocyte and were comprised of a collection of cells organised around fluid islands with or without an antral cavity. The discovery and description of FLS in aged southern white rhinoceroses may play a role in poor oocyte recovery rates in ovum pick-up (OPU) in older rhinoceroses. It remains to be investigated whether FLS might be present on ovaries from other rhinoceros species and whether they might serve as a general indicator for oocyte recovery success in aged females.

AB  - IntroductionOur brain is bombarded by a diverse range of visual stimuli, which are converted into corresponding neuronal responses and processed throughout the visual system. The neural activity patterns that result from these external stimuli vary depending on the object or scene being observed, but they also change as a result of internal or behavioural states. This raises the question of to what extent it is possible to predict the presented visual stimuli from neural activity across behavioural states, and how this varies in different brain regions.MethodsTo address this question, we assessed the computational capacity of decoders to extract visual information in awake behaving mice, by analysing publicly available standardised datasets from the Allen Brain Institute. We evaluated how natural movie frames can be distinguished based on the activity of units recorded in distinct brain regions and under different behavioural states. This analysis revealed the spectrum of visual information present in different brain regions in response to binary and multiclass classification tasks.ResultsVisual cortical areas showed highest classification accuracies, followed by thalamic and midbrain regions, with hippocampal regions showing close to chance accuracy. In addition, we found that behavioural variability led to a decrease in decoding accuracy, whereby large behavioural changes between train and test sessions reduced the classification performance of the decoders. A generalised linear model analysis suggested that this deterioration in classification might be due to an independent modulation of neural activity by stimulus and behaviour. Finally, we reconstructed the natural movie frames from optimal linear classifiers, and observed a strong similarity between reconstructed and actual movie frames. However, the similarity was significantly higher when the decoders were trained and tested on sessions with similar behavioural states.ConclusionOur analysis provides a systematic assessment of visual coding in the mouse brain, and sheds light on the spectrum of visual information present across brain areas and behavioural states.

AB  - Biotechnology, cosmetics, and aesthetic remedies are now inextricably intertwined due to the production of alternative, more effective, and safer active ingredients. Additionally, there has been an increase in demand for natural cosmetic ingredients across the globe. Camellia sinensis var. assamica (Miang tea) is a good alternative because of several biological activities, and is commercially cultivated as a resource in northern Thailand. The process of fermentation mediated by probiotics can enhance the bioavailability of compounds, transform bioactive compounds, and decrease chemical solvent use for sustainability. This study aims to apply the functional evaluation of Miang tea bio-extracts to promote skin health. On the basis of their bioactive enzymes, & beta;-glucosidase, and antioxidant properties, the strains Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (previously Lactobacillus rhamnosus), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (previously Lactobacillus plantarum), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used as mixed probiotic starter cultures. The activities of white, green, and black Miang tea bio-extracts, including ferric reducing antioxidant power, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide inhibition, tyrosinase inhibition, collagenase inhibition (MMP-1 and MMP-2), and antimicrobial activity, were all considerable after 7 days of fermentation time. Additionally, phenolic antioxidant compounds (gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, caffeic acid, caffeine, and p-coumaric acid) were identified. The current study's findings can determine the most effective fermentation time and dose of bio-extract, as well as suggest improvements in bioactive compounds for use in skin care formulations. These results will be used for testing on human participants in further work.

AB  - Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a serious complication that can occur following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sustained secondary changes after TBI promote the process of PTE. Here, we aim to evaluate changes in behavior, electrocorticogram, and histomorphology in rats following chronic TBI models. We observed intensive 7-8 Hz spike-wave-discharges (SWDs) at frontal recording sites and quantified them in SD rats with different degrees of TBI and compared them with age-matched sham rats to evaluate the association between SWDs and injury severity. Notably, although SWDs were even presented in the sham group, the number and duration of events were much lower than those in the TBI groups. SWDs have numerous similarities to absence seizures, such as abrupt onset, termination, and lack of postictal suppression, which may be the nonconvulsive characteristics of PTE. Retigabine, a novel antiepileptic drug, is ineffective in reducing SWDs. In addition, we examined chronic histopathological changes in TBI rats. Rats subjected to moderate and severe TBI exhibited significantly impaired neurological function, which was accompanied by marked cortical injury, hippocampus deformation, reactive gliosis, and mossy fiber sprouting. Long-term progressive structural changes in the brain are one of the characteristics of epileptogenesis after TBI. Our study provided the potential value of epileptiform SWDs in reflecting the nonconvulsive characteristic of PTE and highlighted the vital role of chronic pathological changes, such as reactive gliosis, in promoting the epileptogenesis following TBI.

AB  - Cassava linamarase is a hydrolyzing enzyme that belongs to a glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1). It is responsible for breaking down linamarin to toxic cyanide. The enzyme provides a defensive mechanism for plants against herbivores and has various applications in many fields. Understanding the structure of linamarase at the molecular level is a key to avail its reaction mechanism. In this study, the three-dimensional (3D) structure of linamarase was built for the first time using homology modelling and used to study its interaction with linamarin. Molecular docking calculations established the binding and orientation nature of linamarin, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulation established protein-ligand complexes' stability. Binding-free energy based on MM/PBSA was further used to rescore the docking results. An ensemble structure was found to be relatively stable compared to the modelled structure. This study sheds light on the exploration of linamarase towards understanding its reaction mechanisms.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia because of insulin resistance. Diabetes with chronic hyperglycemia may alter brain metabolism, including brain glucose and neurotransmitter levels; however, detailed, longitudinal studies of metabolic alterations in T2D are lacking. To shed insight, here, we characterized the consequences of poorly controlled hyperglycemia on neurochemical profiles that reflect metabolic alterations of the brain in both humans and animal models of T2D. Using in vivo H-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we quantified 12 metabolites cross-sectionally in T2D patients and 20 metabolites longitudinally in T2D db/db mice versus db+ controls. We found significantly elevated brain glucose (91%, p < 0.001), taurine (22%, p = 0.02), glucose+taurine (56%, p < 0.001), myo-inositol (12%, p = 0.02), and choline-containing compounds (10%, p = 0.01) in T2D patients versus age- and sex-matched controls, findings consistent with measures in T2D db/db versus control db+ littermates. In mice, hippocampal and striatal neurochemical alterations in brain glucose, ascorbate, creatine, phosphocreatine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, glutamine, glutathione, glycerophosphoryl-choline, lactate, myo-inositol, and taurine persisted in db/db mice with chronic disease progression from 16 to 48 weeks of age, which were distinct from control db+ mice. Overall, our study demonstrates the utility of H-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a non-invasive tool for characterizing and monitoring brain metabolic changes with T2D progression.

AB  - Objective: Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), microRNA-15a-5p (miR-15a-5p), and chemokine C-X-C ligand 10 (CXCL10) have been studied in many diseases. However, the investigation of the EZH2/miR-15a-5p/CXCL10 axis in depression is not sufficient. Our study aimed to investigate the regulatory functions of the EZH2/miR-15a-5p/ CXCL10 axis in rats with depressive-like behaviors.Methods: The rat model of depression-like behaviors was established by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and EZH2, miR-15a-5p, and CXCL10 expression levels in rats with depression-like behaviors were detected. The silenced EZH2 or enhanced miR-15a-5p recombinant lentivirus was injected into the rats with depression-like behaviors to assess the changes in behavioral tests, hippocampal pathological structure, levels of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus, and hippocampal neuron apoptosis. The regulatory relationships among EZH2, miR-15a-5p, and CXCL10 were measured. Results: miR-15a-5p expression was reduced, and EZH2 and CXCL10 expression levels were elevated in rats with depressive-like behaviors. Downregulation of EZH2 or elevation of miR-15a-5p improved depressive behavior, and inhibited hippocampal inflammatory response and hippocampal neuron apoptosis. EZH2 promoted histone methylation at the promoter of miR-15a-5p, and miR-15a-5p bound to CXCL10 to inhibit its expression.Conclusion: Our study summarizes that EZH2 promotes the hypermethylation of the miR-15a-5p promoter, thereby promoting CXCL10 expression. Upregulation of miR-15a-5p or inhibition of EZH2 can improve the symptoms in rats with depressive-like behaviors.

AB  - Adenomyosis is a benign gynecological disease. The pathogenesis of adenomyosis is still unclear. The Hippo signaling pathway is highly conserved in vivo and associated with endometriosis and various cancers. Our objective was to study the expression of Hippo signaling pathway-related proteins in the uterus of mice with and without adenomyosis. We also sought to determine the relationship between the Hippo signaling pathway and cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and apoptosis in adenomyosis. The inactivation of Hippo signaling pathway and abnormal expression of EMT-related proteins were observed in mice with adenomyosis. In vitro, the YAP inhibitor verteporfin can inhibit the proliferation and migration of Ishikawa cells and promote apoptosis, while inhibiting the EMT process. In addition, intraperitoneal injection of verteporfin inhibits EMT process and proliferation and promotes apoptosis of cells in the uterus of adenomyosis mice. It suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway participates in the EMT, proliferation, and apoptosis of cells in adenomyosis. In conclusion, these results suggest that Hippo signaling pathway may be involved in the development of adenomyosis by regulating EMT, proliferation, and apoptosis of cells, which provide a potential target for the treatment of adenomyosis.

AB  - Ultrasound (US) is an inexpensive and non-invasive technique for capturing the image of the thyroid gland and nearby tissue. The classification and detection of thyroid disorders is still in its infant stage. This study aims to present a new thyroid diagnosis approach, which consists of three phases like "(i) feature extraction, (ii) feature dimensionality reduction, and (iii) classification ". Initially, the thyroid images as well as its related data are given as input. From the input image, the features such as " Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM), Grey level Run Length Matrix(GLRM), proposed Local Binary Pattern(LBP), and Local Tetra Patterns (LTrP) " are extracted. Meanwhile, from the input data, the higher-order statistical features like skewness, kurtosis, entropy, as well as moment get retrieved. Consequently, the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) based dimensionality reduction is processed to resolve the problem of "curse of dimensionality ". Finally, the classification is carried out via two phases: Image features are classified using an ensemble classifier that includes Support Vector Machine (SVM)& Neural Network(NN) models. The data features are subjected to Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) based classification, which is optimized by an Adaptive Elephant Herding Algorithm (AEHO) via tuning the optimal weight. At last, the performance of the adopted scheme is compared to the extant models in terms of various measures. Especially, the mean value of the suggested RNN + AEHO model is 4.35%, 3.54%, 6.07%, 3.8%, 1.69%, 2.85%, 2.07%, 2.54%, 0.13%, 0.035%, and 8.53% better than the existing CNN, NB, RF, KNN, Levenberg, RNN + EHO, RNN + FF, RNN + WOA, WF-CS, FU-SLnO and HFBO methods respectively.

AB  - Ketone bodies can be increased in the blood under certain physiological conditions, but their role under such conditions remains to be clarified. In the present study, we found the increment and usage of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during acute stress. BHB levels increased in the blood and PFC after 30-min acute immobilization stress, and BHB dehydrogenase 1 increased in the PFC simultaneously, but not in the hippocampus. Moreover, increased levels of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate carboxylase, and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 were found in the PFC, implicating the metabolism of increased BHB in the brain. Thus, we checked the levels of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA and found increased levels of glutamate and glutamine in the stressed group compared with that in the control group in the PFC. Exogenous administration of BHB enhanced struggling behaviors under stressful conditions. Our results suggest that the metabolism of BHB from peripheral blood in the PFC may contribute to acute stress responses to escape stressful conditions. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The brain constantly adapts to environmental changes by modifying the expression of genes that enable synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. The expression of several of these genes requires nuclear calcium (Ca2+) signals, which in turn requires that Ca2+ signals generated by neuronal activity at the synapses or the soma propagate to the nucleus. Since cytoplasmic Ca2+ diffusion is highly restricted, Ca2+ signal propagation to the nucleus requires the participation of other cellular mechanisms. The inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels, both of which reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, play key roles in cellular Ca2+ signal generation. Yet, their roles in the generation of nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals induced by neuronal activity require further investigation. Here, the impact of IP3R1 or RyR2 knockdown on gabazine-induced nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in neurons was evaluated. To this aim, recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) were used to introduce small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knockdown type-1 (IP3R1) and type-2 (RyR2) channel expression in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Additionally, synaptic contact numbers were assessed through immunocytochemistry. Knockdown of IP3R1 or RyR2 channels significantly reduced their protein contents and the generation of gabazine-induced nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals, without altering synaptic contact numbers. Our results highlight the contribution of IP3R1 and RyR2 channels to the generation of nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signal induced by neuronal activity, reinforcing the role that these Ca2+ release channels play in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

AB  - Delirium is the most common neurological complication after cardiac surgery with adverse impacts on surgical outcomes. Advanced age is an independent risk factor for delirium occurrence but its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Although increased A1 astrocytes and abnormal hippocampal networks are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, whether A1 astrocytes and hippocampal network changes are involved in the delirium-like behavior of aged mice remains unknown. In the present study, a mice model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion mimicking cardiac surgery and various assessments were used to investigate the different susceptibility of the occurrence of delirium-like behavior between young and aged mice and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that surgery significantly increased hippocampal A1 astrocyte activation in aged compared to young mice. The high neuroinflammatory state induced by surgery resulted in glutamate accumulation in the extrasynaptic space, which subsequently decreased the excitability of pyramidal neurons and increased the PV interneurons inhibition through enhancing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors' tonic currents in the hippocampus. These further induced the abnormal activities of the hippocampal neural networks and consequently contributed to delirium-like behavior in aged mice. Notably, the intraperitoneal administration of exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, downregulated A1 astrocyte activation and alleviated delirium-like behavior in aged mice, while IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and C1q in combination administered intracerebroventricularly upregulated A1 astrocyte activation and induced delirium-like behavior in young mice. Therefore, our study suggested that cardiac surgery increased A1 astrocyte activation which subsequently impaired the hippocampal neural networks and triggered delirium development.

AB  - Bacterial infections are rising, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria has worsened the scenario, requiring extensive research to find alternative therapeutic agents. Terpenoids play an essential role in protecting plants from herbivores and pathogens. The present study was designed to focus on in silico evaluation of terpenoids for their affinity towards two necessary enzymes, i.e. DHFR and DHPS, which are involved in forming 5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydrofolate, a key component in bacterial DNA synthesis proteins. Additionally, to account for activity against resistant bacteria, their affinity towards the L28R mutant of DHFR was also assessed in the study. The structure-based drug design approach was used to screen the compound library of terpenes for their interaction with active sites of DHFR and DHPS. Further, compounds were screened based on their dock score, pharmacokinetic properties, and binding affinities. A total of five compounds for each target protein were screened, having dock scores better than their respective standard drug molecules. CNP0169378 (-8.4 kcal/mol) and CNP0309455 (-6.5 kcal/mol) have been identified as molecules with a higher affinity toward the targets of DHFR and DHPS, respectively. At the same time, one molecule CNP0298407 (-5.8 kcal/mol for DHPS, -7.6 kcal/mol for DHFR, -6.1 kcal/mol for the L28R variant), has affinity for both proteins (6XG5 and 6XG4). All the molecules have good pharmacokinetic properties. We further validated the docking study by binding free energy calculations using the MM/GBSA approach and molecular dynamics simulations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB  - The micro-morphological examinations of the leaf lamina, petiole and stem for Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze (Theaceae) was carried out using a variety of microscopic techniques widely implemented in the area of medicine. The objective of this study was the micromorphological characterization of stem, petiole, lamina, stomata, leaf trichomes and other internal characters. The anatomical studies included the cross section of stem and leaf of Camellia sinensis thereby exhibiting a typical pattern of arrangement of tissues similar to woody plants. Some idioblastic sclereids like astrosclereids, osteosclereids were found in the medullary parenchyma of tea stem and leaf. Large numbers of sclereids were found mainly in the parenchymatous tissue of leaf petiole. Other micro-morphological features like trichomes, stomata, and different tissue layer were also recorded. The leaf trichomes were unicellular, long and densely present in the lower surface of immature leaf but a decrease in amount of trichomes was seen in the mature leaf making it a prime taxonomic feature of the tea leaf. The microscopic morphological analysis of the stem, petiole, lamina, stomata, leaf trichomes of Camellia sinensis can be used for its identification. In addition, these techniques can be further implemented for the taxonomic characterization thereby establishing a genetic relationship and solving taxonomic disputes in the field of plant systematics.

AB  - Calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) play a pivotal role in brain functioning in health and disease. They are involved in synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, and neuronal circuits development. However, the functions of neurons expressing CP-AMPARs and their role in the modulation of network activity remain elusive since reliable and accurate visualization methods are absent. Here we developed an approach allowing the vital identification of neurons containing CP-AMPARs. The proposed method relies on evaluating Ca2+ influx in neurons during activation of AMPARs in the presence of NMDAR and KAR antagonists, and blockers of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Using this method, we studied the properties of CP-AMPARs-containing neurons. We showed that the overwhelming majority of neurons containing CP-AMPARs are GABAergic, and they are distinguished by higher amplitudes of the calcium responses to applications of the agonists. Furthermore, about 30% of CP-AMPARs-containing neurons demonstrate the presence of GluK1-containing KARs. Although CP-AMPARs-containing neurons are characterized by more significant Ca2+ influx during the activation of AMPARs than other neurons, AMPAR-mediated Na+ influx is similar in these two groups. We revealed that neurons containing CP-AMPARs demonstrate weak GABA(A)R-mediated inhibition because of the low percentage of GABAergic synapses on the soma of these cells. However, our data show that weak GABA(A)R-mediated inhibition is inherent to all GABAergic neurons in the culture and cannot be considered a unique feature of CP-AMPARs-containing neurons. We believe that the suggested approach will help to understand the role of CP-AMPARs in the mammalian nervous system in more detail.

AB  - Artificial insemination (AI) in ostriches may present potential solutions to high proportions of infertile eggs commonly recorded on commercial farms and assist in reducing the number of males for breeding purposes thereby leading to a more economical and efficient farming system. Although non-invasive methods to collect semen and to artificially inseminate female ostriches have been developed, the insemination dose for maximum fertility of eggs remains unknown. This study was thus conducted to determine the minimum sperm dose that would promote fertility of eggs following AI in female ostriches. A total of 22 South African black ostriches (7 males and 15 females) aged between 2 and 9 years old were used. Semen samples were collected using the dummy female method and diluted 1:4 (semen: diluent) with an ostrich specific semen diluent. Females were inseminated with various sperm doses of diluted semen from the same male three times a week, every second day resulting in a total sperm dose of A: <2.5 x 10(9), B: 2.5-5 x 10(9), C: 5-7.5 x 10(9) and D: 7.5-9.6 x 10(9) sperm/week. Eggs produced after insemination were opened to determine the fertilization status of the germinal disc (GD) with an unaided eye. The fertile period was then calculated as the number of days fertilized eggs were laid after the last AI. Furthermore, the number of sperm trapped in the outer perivitelline membrane (spermOPVL) above the GD region was counted under fluorescent light, following staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to determine the rate of sperm loss and the number of days up to when the last egg containing sperm was laid. On average, a mean (+/- sd) of 35.34 +/- 25.72% eggs produced after AI were fertilized. Fertility was lower (mean +/- se) when sperm dose A was used (6.71 +/- 9.40%), as compared to sperm dose B (46.01 +/- 6.71%), C (37.34 +/- 6.60%) and D (37.75 +/- 8.36%) (P < 0.05). No significant difference was recorded in the latter three doses (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the length of the fertile period and the rate of sperm loss did not differ significantly between sperm doses (P > 0.05). Hence, a sperm dose of between 2.5 and 5 x 109 sperm/week is recommended to optimize fertility after AI in ostriches, as increasing the sperm dose would not benefit fertility. Further studies are, however, needed to determine the frequency of insemination that would maintain fertility throughout the breeding season as well as hatchability of eggs laid after AI.

AB  - Cholecystokinin (CCK) has been confirmed to be essential in NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at mouse cortical synapses. This paper has proven that CCK is necessary for LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation of mouse hippocampal synapses projected from the entorhinal cortex. We show that the subunit of the axonal NMDA receptor dominant modulates the activity-induced LTP by triggering pre-synaptic CCK release. A functional pre-synaptic NMDA receptor is required to induce LTP mediated by the axonal Ca2+ elevation and CCK exocytosis at CCK-specific neurons. Genetic depletion of the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors on CCK neurons, which projected from the entorhinal cortex largely abolished the axonal Ca2+ elevation and disturbed the secretion of CCK in hippocampus. These results demonstrate that activity-induced LTP at the hippocampal synapse is CCK-dependent, and CCK secretion from the axonal terminal is modulated by pre-synaptic NMDA receptors.image

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal and aggressive subtype of breast cancer, and chemoresistance is the major determinant of TNBC treatment failure. This study explores the molecular mechanism of TNBC chemoresistance. The Cancer Genome Atlas, breast cancer integrative platform, and GEPIA databases were used to analyze the expression and correlation of YTHDF1 and seven in absentia homology 2 (SIAH2) in breast cancer. Knockdown of YTHDF1 and SIAH2, or overexpression of SIAH2 in vitro and in vivo, was conducted to evaluate the impact of changes in YTHDF1 and SIAH2 expression on TNBC cell proliferation, apoptosis, stemness, drug resistance, and Hippo pathway gene expression. YTHDF1 and SIAH2 were highly expressed in breast cancer patients and TNBC cells. Knockdown of YTHDF1 and SIAH2 significantly inhibited proliferation and stemness and promoted apoptosis and chemosensitivity of TNBC cells. Mechanistically, the knockdown of YTHDF1 inhibited the expression of SIAH2, thereby downregulating the Hippo pathway, which inhibited proliferation and stemness and promoted apoptosis and chemosensitivity of TNBC cells. The current findings revealed the regulatory mechanism of YTHDF1 in TNBC and clarified the role of the YTHDF1/SIAH2 axis in TNBC drug resistance and stemness. This could provide new insights into the vital role of targeting YTHDF1/SIAH2 to suppress drug resistance and stemness in TNBC cells.

AB  - Primary cilia are essential cellular antennae that transmit external signals into intracellular responses. These sensory organelles perform crucial tasks in triggering intracellular signaling pathways, including those initiated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Given the involvement of GPCRs in serum-induced signaling, we investigated the contribution of ciliary proteins in mitogen perception and cell proliferation. We found that depletion of cilia via IFT88 silencing impaired cell growth and repressed YAP activation against serum and its mitogenic constituents, namely lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). To identify the key player of serum mitogen signaling, a mutant cell line library with 30 ablated individual ciliary proteins was established and screened based on YAP dephosphorylation and target gene induction. While 9 of them had altered signaling, ablation of IFT38 or IFT144 led to a particularly robust repression of YAP activation upon LPA and S1P. The deficiency of IFT38 and IFT144 attenuated cell proliferation, as corroborated in either 2-dimen-sional cultures or tumor spheroids. In subcutaneous skin melanoma patients, expression of IFT38 and IFT144 was associated with unfavorable outcomes in overall survival. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the involvement of ciliary proteins in mitogen signaling and identifies the regulatory roles of IFT38 and IFT144 in serum-mediated Hippo pathway signaling and cellular growth.

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify cocktails of drugs able to protect cultured rodent cortical neurons against increasing durations of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). As expected, a cocktail composed of an NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists and a voltage gated Ca2+ channel blocker (MK-801, CNQX and nifedipine, respectively) provided complete neuroprotection against mild OGD. Increasingly longer durations of OGD necessitated increasing the doses of MK-801 and CNQX, until these cocktails ultimately failed to provide neuroprotection against supra-lethal OGD, even at maximal drug concentrations. Surprisingly, supplementation of any of these cocktails with blockers of TRPM7 channels for increasing OGD durations was not neuroprotective, unless these blockers possessed the ability to inhibit NMDA receptors. Supplementation of the maximally effective cocktail with other NMDA receptor antagonists augmented neuroprotection, suggesting insufficient NMDAR blockade by MK-801. Substitution of MK-801 in cocktails with high concentrations of a glycine site NMDA receptor antagonist caused the greatest improvements in neuroprotection, with the more potent SM-31900 superior to L689,560. Substitution of CQNX in cocktails with AMPA receptor antagonists at high concentrations also improved neuroprotection, particularly with the combination of SYM2206 and NBQX. The most neuroprotective cocktail was thus composed of SM-31900, SYM2206, NBQX, nifedipine and the antioxidant trolox. Thus, the cumulative properties of antagonist potency and concentration in a cocktail dictate neuroprotective efficacy. The central target of supra-lethal OGD is excitotoxicity, which must be blocked to the greatest extent possible to minimize ion influx.

AB  - Amphiregulin (AREG) stimulates human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell invasion by downregulating E-cadherin expression. YAP is a transcriptional cofactor that has been shown to regulate tumorigenesis. This study aimed to examine whether AREG activates YAP in EOC cells and explore the roles of YAP in AREG-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and cell invasion. Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that upregulation of AREG and EGFR were associated with poor survival in human EOC. Treatment of SKOV3 human EOC cells with AREG induced the activation of YAP. In addition, AREG downregulated E-cadherin, upregulated Egr-1 and Slug, and stimulated cell invasion. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we showed that YAP was required for the AREG-upregulated Egr-1 and Slug expression. Furthermore, YAP was also involved in AREG-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and cell invasion. This study provides evidence that AREG stimulates human EOC cell invasion by downregulating E-cadherin expression through the YAP/Egr-1/Slug signaling.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta, leading to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic depression, spine elimination, and memory deficits. Glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1) modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission via NMDA receptors (NMDAR), presenting a potential alternative therapeutic approach for AD. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of GlyT1 inhibition in an amyloid-beta-induced AD mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were treated with N-[3-([1,1-Biphenyl]-4-yloxy)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)propyl]-N-methylglycine (NFPS), a GlyT1 inhibitor, 24 h prior to intrahippocampal injection of amyloid-beta. NFPS pretreatment prevented amyloid-beta-induced cognitive deficits in short-term and long-term memory, evidenced by novel object recognition and spatial memory tasks. Moreover, NFPS pretreatment curbed microglial activation, astrocytic reactivity, and subsequent neuronal damage from amyloid-beta injection. An extensive label-free quantitative UPLC-MSE proteomic analysis was performed on the hippocampi of mice treated with NFPS. In proteomics, KEGG enrichment analysis revealed increased in dopaminergic synapse, purine-containing compound biosynthetic process and long-term potentiation, and a reduction in Glucose catabolic process and glycolytic process pathways. The western blot analysis confirmed that NFPS treatment elevated BDNF levels, correlating with enhanced TRKB phosphorylation and mTOR activation. Moreover, NFPS treatment reduced the GluN2B expression after 6 h, which was associated with an increase on CaMKIV and CREB phosphorylation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GlyT1 inhibition by NFPS activates diverse neuroprotective pathways, enhancing long-term potentiation signaling and countering amyloid-beta-induced hippocampal damage.

AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are critical for the maturation and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. In the hippocampus, NMDARs mainly contain GluN2A and/or GluN2B regulatory subunits. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has emerged as a putative regulator of NMDARs, but the impact of this interaction to their function is largely unknown. By combining patch-clamp electrophysiology and molecular approaches, we unravel a dual mechanism by which APP controls GluN2B-NMDARs, depending on the life stage. We show that APP is highly abundant specifically at the postnatal postsynapse. It interacts with GluN2B-NMDARs, controlling its synaptic content and mediated currents, both in infant mice and primary neuronal cultures. Upon aging, the APP amyloidogenic-derived C-terminal fragments, rather than APP full-length, contribute to aberrant GluN2B-NMDAR currents. Accordingly, we found that the APP processing is increased upon aging, both in mice and human brain. Interfering with stability or production of the APP intracellular domain normalized the GluN2B-NMDARs currents. While the first mechanism might be essential for synaptic maturation during development, the latter could contribute to age-related synaptic impairments.

AB  - Seabuckthorn (Hippophae salicifolia) is a perennial, multipurpose wonder plant, popular for its immense medicinal, nutritional, and therapeutic properties. However, due to the lack of whole-genome-based studies, the molecular mechanism governing distinct sexual phenotypes is still not clear. We employed the high-throughput NGS Illumina NovaSeq paired-end technology to generate whole transcriptome profiles of male and female plants of H. salicifolia. In total, 3.2 million raw short reads were generated with an average length of 150 bp, including 50911358 reads from the male leaf tissue samples and 45850364 reads from the female leaf tissue samples. Clustering of the high-quality reads yielded de novo short read assembly of 50259 transcripts of >100 bp length. The final transcripts were assigned Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The digital expression of genes was studied using the DESeq2 of R package that identified 7180 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the male and female plant samples. Further, 10,850 simple sequence repeats, and 8,351 transcription factors, distributed in more than 85 transcription families, were also mined from the final assembled transcriptome. Next, COG and KEGG pathway analyses were performed to assign biological functional terms to the DEGs. The findings of the present study will provide a valuable resource for gene expression discovery and other functional genomics studies aiming towards the selection of candidate genes for the development of sex-specific markers in seabuckthorn and other closely related species.

AB  - Background. Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common malignant tumor, which brings heavy economic burden to patients and society. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance of esophageal cancer. Methods. Human esophageal cancer cell line TE13 (poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma) and normal human esophageal epithelial cell line het-1a were selected for aseptic culture. At the same time, 6 bottles of TE13 cell line were inoculated in logarithmic phase. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). Cell clone formation assay was used to analyze the proliferation. Fibronectin-coated dishes were used to detect the characteristics of cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. The Transwell method was used to detect the cell invasion ability. Western blot was used to analyze the expression of Yap1, PTPN14, FAT1, and Myc. Results. Results showed that FAT1 and PTPN14 were downregulated, while Yap1 was upregulated in esophageal cancer tissues. FAT1 inhibited the proliferation, adhesion, and invasion of human esophageal cancer cell lines, which might be associated with the upregulation of PTPN14 and the inhibition of Yap1 and Myc. Conclusion. The results suggested that PTPN14 and FAT1 could regulate malignant progression and chemotherapy resistance of esophageal cancer based on the Hippo signaling pathway.

AB  - Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo GTP biosynthesis pathway. Recent studies suggest that IMPDH2, an isoform of IMPDH, can localize to specific subcellular compartments under certain conditions and regulate site-specific GTP availability and small GTPase activity in invasive cancer cells. However, it is unclear whether IMPDH2 plays a site-specific regulatory role in subcellular functions in healthy cells. In this study, we focused on brain cells and examined the localization pattern of IMPDH2. We discovered that IMPDH2 forms localized spots in the astrocytes of the adult mouse hippocampus. Further analysis of spot distribution in primary astrocyte cultures revealed that IMPDH2 spots are predominantly localized on branching sites and distal ends of astrocyte stem processes. Our findings suggest a potential unidentified role for IMPDH2 and GTP synthesis specifically at specialized nodes of astrocyte branches.

T2  - PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY

KW  - SENESCENCE
KW  - YAP
AB  - The transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is a significant transcription factor downstream of the Hippo pathway regulating organ size, tissue regeneration, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here, we report on TAZ in response to photoaging mediated by repeated UVA irradiation in skin fibroblasts. Continuous UVA irradiation caused a decrease in TAZ and targeted CTGF mRNA and protein expression in fibroblasts, accompanied by reduced cell proliferation, DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and S phase reduction. Furthermore, P16 and P21 expression levels were increased, whereas Lamin B1 and Lamin A/C expression were decreased as a result of repeated UVA exposure. We further demonstrated that TAZ reduction enables photoaging caused by continuously UVA-irradiated fibroblasts. TAZ overexpression decreases G1 phase, augments the S phase and reduces P16 and P21 protein expression levels in fibroblasts. However, TAZ overexpressing cells exposed to chronic-UVA radiation show induced G1 phase arrest, an S phase reduction, and elevated P16 and P21 protein levels in fibroblasts, compared with TAZ overexpression cells. These findings suggest a novel function of TAZ to reduce photoaging in fibroblasts. This regulation implies that TAZ might be a viable therapeutic target for photoaging or UVA-related skin disorders.

AB  - Failure to ovulate is a major cause of infertility. The critical pathway that induces ovulation involves the EGF and MAPK phosphorylation, but studies in rodents have suggested that the Hippo activator, YAP, is also involved. It is unknown whether YAP-dependent transcriptional activity is important for the LH- or EGF-induced ovulatory cascade in monovulatory species such as the cow. Using a well-defined preovulatory GC culture system, we employed pharmacological inhibitors to demonstrate that YAP signaling is critical for expression of EGFR and downstream target genes EREG, EGR1 and TNFAIP6. Most importantly, by using an ultrasound guided follicle injection system, we also showed that the classic Hippo signaling inhibitor Verteporfin inhibits GnRH-induced ovulation in vivo in cattle. In conclusion, YAP transcriptional activity is critical for EGF-like cascade induced by LH to promote ovulation in a monovulatory species.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease threatening the health of the elderly, but the available therapeutic and preventive drugs remain suboptimal. Loganin, an iridoid glycoside extracted from Cornus officinalis, is reported to have anti-inflammatory and memory-enhancing properties. This study is aimed to explore the influence of loganin on cognitive function in 3xTg-AD mice and the underlying mechanism associated with its neuroprotection. According to the results of behavioral tests, we found that administration of loganin could significantly alleviate anxiety behavior and improve memory deficits of 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis displayed that there were decreased A beta deposition in the hippocampus and cortex of 3xTg-AD mice treated with loganin compared with the control mice. Importantly, the A beta-related pathological change was mainly involved in altering APP expression and processing. And loganin was also found to reduce the levels of phosphorylated tau (i.e. pTau(S396) and pTau(S262)) in 3xTg-AD mice. By performing 2D-DIGE combined with MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, we revealed 28 differentially expressed proteins in the 3xTg-AD mice treated with loganin compared with the control mice. Notably, 10 proteins largely involved in energy metabolism, synaptic proteins, inflammatory response, and ATP binding were simultaneously detected in 3xTg-AD mice compared to WT mice. The abnormal changes of energy metabolism (PAGM1 and ENO1), synaptic proteins (SYN2 and Cplx2), inflammatory response (1433Z) were verified by western blot. Overall, our study suggested that loganin could be used as a feasible candidate drug to ameliorate molecular deficits, pathologies and cognitive impairment for prevention and treatment of AD.

AB  - Gut microbiota alteration during the aging process serves as a causative factor for aging-related cognitive decline, which is characterized by the early hallmark, hippocampal synaptic loss. However, the impact and mechanistic role of gut microbiota in hippocampal synapse loss during aging remains unclear. Here, we observed that the fecal microbiota of naturally aged mice successfully transferred cognitive impairment and hippocampal synapse loss to young recipients. Multi-omics analysis revealed that aged gut microbiota was characterized with obvious change in Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (B.p) and metabolite of tryptophan, indoleacetic acid (IAA) in the periphery and brain. These features were also reproduced in young recipients that were transplanted with aged gut microbiota. Fecal B.p abundance was reduced in patients with cognitive impairment compared to healthy subjects and showed a positive correlation with cognitive scores. Microbiota transplantation from patients who had fewer B.p abundances yielded worse cognitive behavior in mice than those with higher B.p abundances. Meanwhile, supplementation of B.p was capable of producing IAA and enhancing peripheral and brain IAA bioavailability, as well as improving cognitive behaviors and microglia-mediated synapse loss in 5 x FAD transgenic mice. IAA produced from B.p was shown to prevent microglia engulfment of synapses in an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent manner. This study reveals that aged gut microbiota -induced cognitive decline and microglia-mediated synapse loss that is, at least partially, due to the deficiency in B.p and its metabolite, IAA. It provides a proof-of-concept strategy for preventing neurodegenerative diseases by modulating gut probionts and their tryptophan metabolites.

AB  - Epilepsy (EP) is a prevalent neurological disorder. The study sought to investigate the impact of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on hippocampal neuron damage, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) expression, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) pathway in EP in vitro model. The study involved the isolation of hippocampal neurons from newborn neonatal rats, which were identified utilizing microscopic observation and immunofluorescence staining. The EP in vitro model was developed using magnesium-free treatment. Next, the neurons were treated with 0, 1, 10, 100, and 200 mu M DEX to investigate its impact on EP. Neuron viability and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8, western blotting, and TUNEL assay. The levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured using ELISA. The determination of ROS and MDA levels and SOD activity was conducted to evaluate oxidative stress. Moreover, the binding of MeCP2 to the BDNF promoter was confirmed using a ChIP assay. The hippocampal neurons were successfully extracted from newborn neonatal rats. DEX of 100 and 200 mu M significantly promoted neuronal viability and inhibited neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and MeCP2 expression induced by magnesium-free. MeCP2 inhibited the expression of BDNF/TrkB pathway by binding to the BDNF promoter. Moreover, MeCP2 silencing promoted neuronal viability and inhibited apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, while BNDF silencing restored it. Furthermore, DEX alleviated hippocampal neuronal damage. However, MeCP2 overex pression restored it. DEX alleviated hippocampal neuronal damage in EP through BDNF/TrkB pathway by down-regulating MeCP2 expression. DEX might be one of novel and effective anti-seizure medications.

AB  - Microglia are the residential immune cells of central nervous system and they are crucial for brain development and homeostasis, as well as the progression of inflammatory brain diseases. To study microglia's physiological and pathological functions, one of the most widely used models is primary microglia culture from neonatal rodents. However, primary microglia culture is time consuming and needs a great number of animals. In our microglia culture, we found a strain of spontaneously immortalized microglia that continued to divide without any known genetic intervention. We confirmed the immortalization of these cells for uninterrupted thirty passages and we named them as immortalized microglia like-1 cells (iMG-1). The iMG-1 cells kept their microglia morphology, and they expressed macrophage/microglia-specific proteins of CD11b, CD68, P2RY12, and IBA1 in vitro. iMG-1 cells were responsive to inflammatory stimulations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pIpC), triggering increased mRNA/protein levels of IL1-beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and interferons. LPS and pIpC treated iMG-1 cells also significantly increased their accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs). We also generated a 3D spheroid model using immortalized neural progenitor cells and iMG-1 cells with defined percentages to study neuroinflammation. The iMG-1 cells distributed evenly in spheroids, and they regulated the basal mRNA levels of cytokines of neural progenitors in 3D spheroid. iMG-1 cells were responsive to LPS by increased expression of IL-6 and IL1-beta in spheroids. Together, this study indicated the reliability of iMG-1 which could be readily available to study the physiological and pathological functions of microglia.

AB  - Functional MRI (fMRI) with H-1-MRS was combined on the hippocampus and visual cortex of animal models of obesity (high-fat diet, HFD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) to identify the involved mechanisms and temporal evolution of neurometabolic changes in these disorders that could serve as potentially reliable clinical biomarkers. HFD rats presented elevated levels of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) (p = 0.0365 vs. standard diet, SD) and glutathione (GSH) (p = 0.0494 vs. SD) in the hippocampus. NAAG and GSH levels in this structure proved to be correlated (r = 0.4652, p = 0.0336). This mechanism was not observed in diabetic rats. Combining MRS and fMRI-evaluated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response, elevated taurine (p = 0.0326 vs. HFD) and GABA type A receptor (GABA(A)R) (p = 0.0211 vs. SD and p = 0.0153 vs. HFD) were observed in the visual cortex of only diabetic rats, counteracting the elevated BOLD response and suggesting an adaptative mechanism against hyperexcitability observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) (p = 0.0226 vs. SD). BOLD amplitude was correlated with the glutamate levels (r = 0.4491; p = 0.0316). Therefore, here we found evidence for several biological dichotomies regarding excitotoxicity and neuroprotection in different brain regions, identifying putative markers of their different susceptibility and response to the metabolic and vascular insults of obesity and diabetes.

AB  - The identity of the mechanism by which the Baixiangdan capsule (BXD) and the Shuyu capsule (SY) control anger-out (AO) and anger-in (AI) in rodents is unclear. The current study clarified the intervention role of BXD and SY on AO and AI male rats. We further explored the differences between BXD and SY in the treatment of AO and AI rats. Social isolation combined with the resident-intruder paradigm was used to establish the anger -out and AI rats models. On this basis, GABA content in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and serotonin (5-HT) contents in these brain regions were detected using ELISA after various time courses (0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days) treated with BXD and SY. Co-expression of 5-HT and GB1 in the DRN was detected. GB1-specific agonist baclofen and GB1-specific inhibitor CGP35348 were injected into the DRN. Changes in 5-HT levels in these brain regions were then detected. After treatment, rats in the BXD group exhibited lower aggressive behavior scores, longer latencies of aggression, lower total distances in the open field test, and a higher sucrose preference coefficient. Meanwhile, rats in the SY group exhibited higher aggressive behavior scores, shorter latencies of aggression, higher total distances in the open field test, and higher sucrose preference coefficients. With increasing medication duration, 5-HT levels in these brain regions were increased gradually, whereas GABA levels in the DRN were decreased gradually, and all recovered to normal levels by the 7th day. A large number of 5-HT-positive cells could be found in the immunofluorescence section in the DRN containing GABABR1 (GB1)-positive cells, indicating that 5-HT neurons in the DRN co-expressed with GB1. Furthermore, after the drug intervention, the 5-HT level in the DRN was elevated to a normal level, and the GB1 level in the DRN was decreased to a normal level. After the microinjection of baclofen into the DRN, the 5-HT contents in these brain regions were decreased. By contrast, the 5-HT contents were increased after injection with CGP35348. BXD and SY could effectively improve the abnormal behavior changes of AO and AI rats, and the optimal duration of action was 7 days. The improvement way is as follows: Decreased abnormal increase of GABA and GB1 in the DRN further mediated synaptic inhibition and increased 5-HT level in the DRN, leading to increased 5-HT levels in the PFC, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Therefore, GB1-mediated GABA in the DRN could regulate 5-HT levels in these brain regions, which may be one of the ways by which BXD and SY treat AO and AI, respectively.

AB  - Aims: The accumulated evidence suggests that lifestyle -specifically dietary habits and stress exposure -plays a detrimental role in health. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the interplay of stress, diet, and sex in metabolic and cognitive alterations.Main methods: For this purpose, one-month-old C57Bl/6J mice were fed with a standard diet or high-fat diet (HFD). After eight weeks, one subgroup of mice from each respective diet was exposed to 20 weeks of chronic mild stress (CMS), whilst the others were left undisturbed.Key findings: After 28 weeks of HFD feeding, mice from both sexes were overweight, with an increase in caloric intake and abdominal and subcutaneous fat pads. Stress exposure induced a decrease in body weight, related to a decrease in caloric efficiency in both males and females. Results indicate that males are more susceptible than the females in modulating metabolic and cognitive functions under HFD and CMS. Although both sexes demon-strated HFD-induced weight gain, fat accumulation, insulin resistance, high cholesterol, only males exposed to CMS but not females have (i) impaired glucose tolerance with higher glucose level; (ii) significant prolonged latency in Barnes test, suggesting cognitive impairment; (iii) increased IFN-gamma expression in hippocampus, suggesting greater neuroinflammatory response; (iv) poorer cognitive performance related to a decrease in hippocampal and spleen BDNF mRNA expression.Significance: The main finding in this study is the presence of a sexual dimorphism in modulating metabolic and cognitive functions under HFD and CMS, showing males are more susceptible than females. In addition, poorer cognitive performance was related to a decrease in hippocampal BDNF mRNA expression. Interestingly, these changes were observed in the spleen as well.

AB  - Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Many experimental studies have shown that ketamine can induce cognitive impairments and schizophrenia-like symptoms. While much data have demonstrated that glial cells are associated with the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, the response of glial cells to ketamine and its significance to schizophrenia are not clear. The present study was intended to explore whether chronic ketamine treatment would induce behavioral and glial changes in mice. First, ketamine was used to stimulate behavioral abnormalities similar to schizophrenia evaluated by the open field test, elevated plus-maze test, Y maze test, novel object recognition test, and tail suspension test. Secondly, histopathology and Nissl staining were performed. Meanwhile, immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the expression levels of IBA-1 (a microglial marker) and GFAP (an astrocyte marker) in the mouse hippocampus for any change. Then, ELISA was used to analyze proinflammatory cytokine levels for any change. Our results showed that ketamine (25 mg/kg, i.p., qid, 12 days) induced anxiety, recognition deficits, and neuronal injury in the hippocampus. Moreover, chronic ketamine treatment enhanced GFAP expression in CA1 and DG regions of the hippocampus but did not influence the expression of IBA-1. Ketamine also increased the levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in the mouse hippocampus. Our study created a new procedure for ketamine administration, which successfully induce negative symptoms and cognitive-behavioral defects in schizophrenia by chronic ketamine. This study further revealed that an increase in astrocytosis, but not microglia, is associated with the mouse model of schizophrenia caused by ketamine. In summary, hippocampal astrocytes may be involved in the pathophysiology of ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like phenotypes through reactive transformation and regulation of neuroinflammation.

AB  - Protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1), a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, was considered to be an inhibitor of STAT1 by inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of STAT1 and blocking STAT1-mediated gene transcription in response to cytokine stimulation. PIAS1 has been determined to be involved in modulating several biological processes such as cell proliferation, DNA damage responses, and inflammatory responses, both in vivo and in vitro. However, the role played by PIAS1 in regulating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), has not been determined. In our study, significantly different expression levels of PIAS1 between normal controls and AD patients were detected in four regions of the human brain. Based on a functional analysis of Pias1 in undifferentiated mouse hippocampal neuronal HT-22 cells, we observed that the expression levels of several AD marker genes could be inhibited by Pias1 overexpression. Moreover, the proliferation ability of HT-22 cells could be promoted by the overexpression of Pias1. Furthermore, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to evaluate and quantify the gene expression profiles in response to Pias1 overexpression in HT-22 cells. As a result, 285 significantly dysregulated genes, including 79 upregulated genes and 206 downregulated genes, were identified by the comparison of Pias1/+ cells with WT cells. Among these genes, five overlapping genes, including early growth response 1 (Egr1), early growth response 2 (Egr2), early growth response 3 (Egr3), FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos) and fos-like antigen 1 (Fosl1), were identified by comparison of the transcription factor binding site (TFBS) prediction results for STAT1, whose expression was evaluated by qPCR. Three cell cycle inhibitors, p53, p18 and p21, were significantly downregulated with the overexpression of Pias1. Analysis of functional enrichment and expression levels showed that basic region leucine zipper domain-containing transcription factors including zinc finger C2H2 (zf-C2H2), homeobox and basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) in several signaling pathways were significantly involved in PIAS1 regulation in HT-22 cells. A reconstructed regulatory network under PIAS1 overexpression demonstrated that there were 43 related proteins, notably Nr3c2, that directly interacted with PIAS1.

AB  - Anxiety is a commonly prevailing psychological disorder that requires effective treatment, wherein phytopharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals could offer a desirable therapeutic profile. Hybanthus enneaspermus (L.) F. Muell. is a powerful medicinal herb, reportedly effective against several ailments, including psychological disorders. The current research envisaged evaluating the anxiolytic potential of the ethanolic extract of Hybanthus enneaspermus (EEHE) and its toluene insoluble biofraction (ITHE) employing experimental and computational approaches. Elevated Plus Maze, Light and Dark Transition, Mirror Chamber, Hole board and Open field tests were used as screening models to assess the antianxiety potential of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight of EEHE and ITHE in rats subjected to social isolation, using Diazepam as standard. The brains of rats exhibiting significant anxiolytic activity were dissected for histopathological and biochemical studies. Antioxidant enzymes like catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase; and neurotransmitters viz. monoamines (serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine), Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate were quantified in the different regions of rats' brain (cortex, hippocampus, pons, medulla oblongata, cerebellum). Chromatographic techniques were used to isolate phytoconstituents from the fraction exhibiting significant activity that were characterized by spectroscopic methods and subjected to in silico molecular docking. ITHE at 400 mg/kg body weight significantly mitigated anxiety in all the screening models (p < 0.05), reduced the inflammatory vacuoles and necrosis (p < 0.05) and potentiated the antioxidant enzymes (p < 0.05). It enhanced the monoamines and GABA levels while attenuating glutamate levels (p < 0.01) in the brain. Three significant flavonoids viz. Quercitrin, Rutin and Hesperidin were isolated from ITHE. In silico docking studies of these flavonoids revealed that the compounds exhibited substantial binding to the GABAA receptor. ITHE displayed a promising pharmacological profile in combating anxiety and modulating oxidative stress, attributing its therapeutic virtues to the flavonoids present.

AB  - Ungulate embryos undergo critical cell differentiation and proliferation events around and after blastocyst hatching. Failures in these processes lead to early pregnancy losses, which generate an important economic impact on farming. Conventional embryo culture media, such as SOF, are unable to support embryo development beyond hatching. In contrast, N2B27 medium supports early post-hatching development, evidencing a swift in embryonic nutritional requirements during this developmental window. Here, we investigate if earlier exposure to N2B27 could improve embryo development after hatching. Embryo culture in N2B27 from day (D) 5, 6 or 7 significantly enhanced complete hypoblast migration (>45 vs. similar to 24%) and epiblast development into an embryonic disc (ED)-like structure at D12 (>40 vs. 23%), compared to embryos cultured in SOF up to D9. Culture in N2B27 from D5 significantly increased epiblast and hypoblast cell number in D8 blastocysts, but post-hatching embryos cultured in N2B27 from D5 or 6 frequently showed a disorganized distribution of epiblast cells. In conclusion, bovine embryo culture in N2B27 from D7 onwards improves subsequent post-hatching development. This improved fully in vitro system will be very useful to functionally explore cell differentiation mechanisms and the bases of early pregnancy failures without requiring animal experimentation.

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the most common histopathological type of renal cell carcinoma. However, the mechanism of KIRC progression remains poorly understood. Apolipoprotein M (ApoM) is a plasma apolipoprotein and a member of the lipid transport protein superfamily. Lipid metabolism is essential for tumor progression, and its related proteins can be used as therapeutic targets for tumors. ApoM influences the development of several cancers, but its relationship with KIRC remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the biological function of ApoM in KIRC and to reveal its potential molecular mechanisms. We found that ApoM expression was significantly reduced in KIRC and was strongly correlated with patient prognosis. ApoM overexpression significantly inhibited KIRC cell proliferation in vitro, suppressed the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of KIRC cells, and decreased their metastatic capacity. Additionally, the growth of KIRC cells was inhibited by ApoM over -expression in vivo. In addition, we found that overexpression of ApoM in KIRC attenuated Hippo-YAP protein expression and YAP stability and thus inhibited KIRC growth and progression. Therefore, ApoM may be a po-tential target for the treatment of KIRC.

AB  - In the central nervous system (CNS), neurons need synaptic neurotransmitter release and cellular response for various cellular stress or environmental stimuli. To achieve these highly orchestrated cellular processes, neurons should drive the molecular mechanisms that govern and integrate complex signaling pathways. The signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) family of proteins has been shown to play essential roles in diverse signal transduction mechanisms, including apoptosis and innate immunity. However, a comprehensive understanding of STAND genes remains lacking. Previously, we identified the NACHT and WD repeat domain -containing protein 1 (NWD1), a member of STAND family, in the regulation of the assembly of a giant multi -enzyme complex that enables efficient de novo purine biosynthesis during brain development. Here we identi-fied the mouse Nwd2 gene, which is a paralog of Nwd1. A molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that Nwd1 emerged during the early evolution of the animal kingdom, and that Nwd2 diverged in the process of Nwd1 duplication. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses revealed the unique expression profile of Nwd2 in the developing and adult CNS. Unlike Nwd1, Nwd2 expression was primarily confined to neurons in the medial habenular nucleus, an essential modulating center for diverse psychological states, such as fear, anxiety, and drug addiction. In the adult brain, Nwd2 expression, albeit at a lower level, was also observed in some neuronal populations in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra pars compacta. NWD2 might play a unique role in the signal transduction required for specific neuronal circuits, especially for cholinergic neurons in the habenula.

AB  - Anti-seizure drugs (ASDs) are the first choice for the treatment of epilepsy, but there is still one-third of patients with epilepsy (PWEs) who are resistant to two or more appropriately chosen ASDs, named drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a common type of epilepsy usually associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS), shares the highest proportion of drug resistance (approximately 70%). In view of the key role of the temporal lobe in memory, emotion, and other physiological functions, patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (DR-TLE) are often accompanied by serious complications, and surgical procedures also yield extra considerations. The exact mechanisms for the genesis of DR-TLE remain unillustrated, which makes it hard to manage patients with DR-TLE in clinical practice. Animal models of DR-TLE play an irreplaceable role in both understanding the mechanism and searching for new therapeutic strategies or drugs. In this review article, we systematically summarized different types of current DR-TLE models, and then recent advances in mechanism investigations obtained in these models were presented, especially with the development of advanced experimental techniques and tools. We are deeply encouraged that novel strategies show great therapeutic potential in those DR-TLE models. Based on the big steps reached from the bench, a new light has been shed on the precise management of DR-TLE.

AB  - Intense stimulation of most living cells triggers the activation of immediate early genes, such as Fos and Jun families. These genes are important in cellular and biochemical processes, such as mitosis and cell death. The present study focused on determining the temporal expression pattern of Fos and Jun families in fibroblasts and neural stem cells of cerebellum, hippocampus, and subventricular zone (SVZ) of rats of different ages at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h after stimulation with fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. In neonates, a similar expression pattern was observed in all cells analyzed, with lower expression in basal condition, peak expression at 0.5 h after stimulation, returning to baseline values between 1 and 3 h after stimulation. On the other hand, cells from adult animals only showed Fra1 and JunD expression after stimulation. In fibroblasts and hippocampus, Fra1 reached peak expression at 0.5 h after stimulation, while in the SVZ, peak level was observed at 6 h after stimulation. JunD in fibroblasts presented two peak expressions, at 0.5 and 6 h after stimulation. Between these periods, the expression observed was at a basal level. Nevertheless, JunD expression in SVZ and hippocampus was low and without significant changes after stimulation. Differences in mRNA expression in neonate and adult animals characterize the significant differences in neurogenesis and cell response to stimulation at different stages of development. Characterizing these differences might be important for the development of cell cultures, replacement therapy, and the understanding of the physiological response profile of different cell types.

TI  - COVID-19 Classification from Chest X-Ray Images: A Framework of Deep Explainable Artificial Intelligence
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE

KW  - SEGMENTATION
KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - COVID-19 detection and classification using chest X-ray images is a current hot research topic based on the important application known as medical image analysis. To halt the spread of COVID-19, it is critical to identify the infection as soon as possible. Due to time constraints and the expertise of radiologists, manually diagnosing this infection from chest X-ray images is a difficult and time-consuming process. Artificial intelligence techniques have had a significant impact on medical image analysis and have also introduced several techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Deep learning and explainable AI have shown significant popularity among AL techniques for COVID-19 detection and classification. In this work, we propose a deep learning and explainable AI technique for the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. Initially, a hybrid contrast enhancement technique is proposed and applied to the original images that are later utilized for the training of two modified deep learning models. The deep transfer learning concept is selected for the training of pretrained modified models that are later employed for feature extraction. Features of both deep models are fused using improved canonical correlation analysis that is further optimized using a hybrid algorithm named Whale-Elephant Herding. Through this algorithm, the best features are selected and classified using an extreme learning machine (ELM). Moreover, the modified deep models are utilized for Grad-CAM visualization. The experimental process was conducted on three publicly available datasets and achieved accuracies of 99.1, 98.2, and 96.7%, respectively. Moreover, the ablation study was performed and showed that the proposed accuracy is better than the other methods.

AB  - VIP binding sites are upregulated in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients, also suffering from severe cognitive deficits. Although altered VIP and VIP receptor levels were described in rodent models of epilepsy, the VIP receptor subtype(s) were never identified. We now investigated how VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptor levels change in the Li2+-pilocarpine rat model of MTLE. Cognitive decline and altered synaptic plasticity as estimated from phosphorylation of AMPA GluA1 subunit on Ser831 and Ser845 and AMPA GluA1/GluA2 ratio was also probed. Animals showing spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) for at least 4 weeks showed impaired learning in the radial arm maze (RAM) and presented decreased VPAC1 and increased VPAC2 receptor levels. In addition, SRSs rats showed increased AMPA GluA1 phosphorylation in Ser831 and Ser845, marked decrease in GluA1 levels and a milder decrease in GluA2 levels. Consequently, the GluA1/GluA2 ratio was also decreased in SRSs rats. Altered VIP receptor levels may differentially prevent or contribute to MTLE pathology, since VPAC1 receptors promote the endogenous control of LTP, mediate endogenous VIP neuroprotection against altered synaptic plasticity following epileptiform activity, and mediate anti-inflammatory actions in microglia, while VPAC2 receptors mediate VIP endogenous neuroprotection against neonatal excitotoxicity and prevent reactive astro-gliosis. This discovery imposes a different mindset for considering VIP receptors as therapeutic targets in MTLE, allowing a differential targeting of the cellular events contributing to epileptogenesis.

AB  - The increase in senescent cells in tissues, including the brain, is a general feature of normal aging and age-related pathologies. Senescent cells exhibit a specific phenotype, which includes an altered nuclear morphology and transcriptomic changes. Astrocytes undergo senescence in vitro and in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about whether this process also occurs in physiological aging, as well as its functional implication. Here, we investigated astrocyte senescence in vitro, in old mouse brains, and in post-mortem human brain tissue of elderly. We identified a significant loss of lamin-B1, a major component of the nuclear lamina, as a hallmark of senescent astrocytes. We showed a severe reduction of lamin-B1 in the dentate gyrus of aged mice, including in hippocampal astrocytes, and in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus of post-mortem human tissue from non-demented elderly. The lamin-B1 reduction was associated with nuclear deformations, represented by an increased incidence of invaginated nuclei and loss of nuclear circularity in senescent astrocytes in vitro and in the aging human hippocampus. We also found differences in lamin-B1 levels and astrocyte nuclear morphology between the granular cell layer and polymorphic layer in the elderly human hippocampus, suggesting an intra-regional-dependent aging response of human astrocytes. Moreover, we described senescence-associated impaired neuritogenic and synaptogenic capacity of mouse astrocytes. Our findings show that reduction of lamin-B1 is a conserved feature of hippocampal cells aging, including astrocytes, and shed light on significant defects in nuclear lamina structure which may contribute to astrocyte dysfunctions during aging.

AB  - Bioinformatic methods have been used to predict a new subclass of proteins among plant phosphotransmitters involved in the signaling system of multistep phosphorelay. In contrast to the canonical soluble nucleocytosolic forms, the found noncanonical phosphotransmitter sequences, belonging to a wide range of plant taxa, potentially contain transmembrane domains. This suggests localization of such proteins on cell membranes and, therefore, a different function in signaling than that of canonical phosphotransmitters. We tested the functionality of the transmembrane domain of the phosphotransmitter using the protein of the tea plant Camellia sinensis. The membrane localization of the transiently expressed recombinant phosphotransmitter with this domain was confirmed by microscopy and immunoblotting. Thus, this is the first study to obtain experimental evidence for the existence of membrane-bound plant phosphotransmitters with as yet unknown functions. These data suggest the presence of a noncanonical membrane branch of signal transduction in the multistep phosphorelay system in plants.

AB  - Paediatric Leigh syndrome (LS) is an early-onset and fatal neurodegenerative disorder lacking treatment options. LS is frequently caused by mutations in the NDUFS4 gene, encoding an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I (CI), the first complex of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Whole-body Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mice (WB-KO mice) are widely used to study isolated CI deficiency, LS pathology and interventions. These animals develop a brain-specific phenotype via an incompletely understood pathomechanism. Here we performed a quantitative analysis of the sub-brain proteome in six-weeks old WB-KO mice vs. wildtype (WT) mice. Brain regions comprised of a brain slice (BrSl), cerebellum (CB), cerebral cortex (CC), hippocampus (HC), inferior colliculus (IC), and superior colliculus (SC). Proteome analysis demonstrated similarities between CC/HC, and between IC/SC, whereas BrSl and CB differed from these two groups and each other. All brain regions displayed greatly reduced levels of two CI structural subunits (NDUFS4, NDUFA12) and an increased level of the CI assembly factor NDUFAF2. The level of CI-Q module subunits was significantly more reduced in IC/SC than in BrSl/CB/CC/HC, whereas other OXPHOS complex levels were not reduced. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated specific and common proteome changes between brain regions. Across brain regions, upregulation of cold-shock-associated proteins, mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) oxidation and synthesis (mtFAS) were the most prominent. FA-related pathways were predominantly upregulated in CB and HC. Based upon these results, we argue that stimulation of these pathways is futile and pro-pathological and discuss alternative strategies for therapeutic intervention in LS. Significance: The Ndufs4 knockout mouse model is currently the most relevant and most widely used animal model to study the brain-linked pathophysiology of human Leigh Syndrome (LS) and intervention strategies. We demonstrate that the Ndufs4 knockout brain engages futile and pro-pathological responses. These responses explain both negative and positive outcomes of intervention studies in Leigh Syndrome mice and patients, thereby guiding novel intervention opportunities.

AB  - Recent studies document the LH-releasing pathway of nerve growth factor (NGF) in male camelids and that the LH response to seminal NGF is associated with elevated plasma testosterone concentration. Results provide rationale for the hypothesis that NGF in semen is associated with male fertility. In Experiment 1, the association between the amount of NGF in the ejaculate and characteristics of the male reproductive system was examined in alpacas. The concentration of NGF was measured by radioimmunoassay in semen samples collected from male alpacas (n = 47) and correlated with sperm morphology and motility, and measurements of the male reproductive anatomy. Most ejaculates had NGF concentrations that, based on previous studies, triggered ovulation in female camelids, however, we only found a positive correlation between NGF concentration with sperm concentration, thread formation and total NGF, and a negative correlation with pH. In Experiment 2, a retrospective analysis was carried out to determine if breeding performance during the previous season was related to recent concentrations of seminal NGF in male alpacas (n = 22). Birth rates tended to be correlated with sperm concentration and total amount of NGF in the ejaculate (P = 0.09). Experiment 3 was a prospective study to determine the relationship between seminal NGF (n = 8 male alpacas) and ovulation and pregnancy rates in a breeding trial. No association was detected between seminal NGF concentration and ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, or LH response in the female. We conclude that among the breeding males used in our study, the abundance of seminal NGF was correlated with sperm concentration and thread formation, however, it was not predictive of male fertility in alpacas. Examination of males not previously selected as breeding stock may be expected to include a broader range of seminal NGF and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between seminal NGF and male fertility.

AB  - Evidence indicates that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) provides therapeutic benefits in different situations, such as epilepsy, depression, inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Despite the increasing use of tDCS, its cellular and molecular basis remains unknown. Astrocytes display a close functional and structural relationship with neurons and have been identified as mediators of neuroprotection in tDCS. Considering the importance of hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission in nociceptive pathways, we decided to investigate short-term changes in the hippocampal astrocytes of rats subjected to tDCS, evaluating specific cellular markers (GFAP and S100B), as well as markers of astroglial activity; glutamate uptake, glutamine synthesis by glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutathione content. Data clearly show that a single session of tDCS increases the pain threshold elicited by mechanical and thermal stimuli, as evaluated by von Frey and hot plate tests, respectively. These changes involve inflammatory and astroglial neurochemical changes in the hippocampus, based on specific changes in cell markers, such as S100B and GS. Alterations in S100B were also observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of tDCS animals and, most importantly, specific functional changes (increased glutamate uptake and increased GS activity) were detected in hippocampal astrocytes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of tDCS as a therapeutic strategy for nervous disorders and reinforce the importance of astrocytes as therapeutic targets.

AB  - Chimaerods represent an enigmatic lineage of cartilaginous fishes and the least studied group within Chondrichthyans. They have a widespread global distribution with a high degree of endemism. In addition, this group has been considered among the least threatened species of Chondrichthyans, but also the most data-deficient group, with biological information lacking for most species. This study represents the first microanatomical, histological, and ultrastructural description of the different stages of folliculogenesis in Callorhinchus callorhynchus, and the first ultrastructural study about this topic within chimaeroids. Specimens of different maturity stages were collected from landings of the commercial fleet operating in San Mat & iacute;as Gulf, Argentina. Folliculogenesis shows some differences compared to other elasmobranchs. Oogonia were present in immature and mature females. Atretic follicles of different sizes were present in mature female ovaries. There is a significant difference between the macroscopic (similar to 10 mm) and microscopic (similar to 2 mm) follicular size at the beginning of vitellogenesis. There is no evidence of an epigonal organ. The results are discussed in a physiological and reproductive context. This study provides valuable information that will contribute to the understanding of the reproductive biology of the chimaeroids species and its potential for fishery exploitation recovery.

AB  - Purpurogallin (PPG) has been demonstrated to exert an anti-inflammatory function in neurological diseases. This study aimed at investigating the role of PPG on microglial polarization post ischemic stroke as well as the underlying mechanism. Mouse hippocampal neurons HT-22 and microglial BV2 cells were treated by oxygen and glucose deprivation to simulate an in-vitro ischemia model. qRT-PCR and ELISA examined expression of cytokines in microglia. CCK8 and flow cytometry measured HT-22 cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. The levels of miR-124-3p and TRAF6/NF-kappa B were determined. A mouse cerebral ischemia model was set up using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method. After being dealt with PPG, the neurological functions, brain edema, neuronal apoptosis, and microglia activation of the mice were evaluated. As suggested by the results, PPG transformed "M1" to "M2" polarization of BV2 cells, and abated HT-22 cell apoptosis. PPG enhanced the neurological functions, alleviated brain edema, and decreased neuroinflammatory responses, and neuronal apoptosis in the brain lesions of MCAO mice. Furthermore, PPG enhanced miR-124-3p and repressed the TRAF6/NF-kappa B pathway. miR-124-3p suppressed the TRAF6/NF-kappa B pathway by targeting TRAF6. Collectively, PPG alleviates ischemia-induced neuronal damage and microglial inflammation by modulating the miR-124-3p/TRAF6/NF-kappa B pathway.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major health concern which causes long-term neurological disability particularly in war veterans, athletes and young adults. In spite of intense clinical and research investigations, there is no effective therapy to cease the pathogenesis of the disease. It is believed that axonal injury during TBI is potentiated by neuroinflammation and demyelination and/or failure to remyelination. This study highlights the use of naturally available cinnamein, also chemically known as benzyl cinnamate, in inhibiting neuroinflammation, promoting remyelination and combating the disease process of controlled cortical impact (CCI)induced TBI in mice. Oral delivery of cinnamein through gavage brought down the activation of microglia and astrocytes to decrease the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) in hippocampus and cortex of TBI mice. Cinnamein treatment also stimulated remyelination in TBI mice as revealed by PLP and A2B5 double-labeling, luxol fast blue (LFB) staining and axonal double-labeling for neurofilament and MBP. Furthermore, oral cinnamein reduced the size of lesion cavity in the brain, improved locomotor functions and restored memory and learning in TBI mice. These results suggest a new neuroprotective property of cinnamein that may be valuable in the treatment of TBI.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common degenerative brain disorder with limited therapeutic options. Curcumin (Cur) exhibits neuroprotective function in many diseases. We aimed to explore the role and mechanism of Cur in AD.Materials and Methods: Firstly, we established AD mice by injecting amyloid-beta 1-42 (A beta 1-42) solution into the hippocampus. Then, the AD mice received 150 mg/kg/d Cur for 10 consecutive days. The Morris water maze test was conducted to evaluate the cognitive function of the mice by hidden platform training and probe trials. To assess the spatial memory of the mice, spontaneous alternation behavior, the number of crossing the novel arm and the time spent in the novel arm during the Y-maze test was recorded. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNAL) assay were performed to assess the pathological damage and apoptosis of brain tissues. The number of damaged neurons was inspected by Nissl staining. Immunohistochemical staining was then performed to detect A beta 1-42 deposition. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in serum and hippocampus, the contents of super oxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain tissues were assessed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), RelA (p65) protein expressions and Adenosine 5 '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation were tested using Western blot.Results: Cur not only improved cognitive function and spatial memory, but also alleviated the pathological damage and apoptosis of brain tissues for AD mice. Meanwhile, upon Cur treatment, the number of damaged neurons in AD mice was decreased, the level of A beta 1-42 in AD mice was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the AD mice treated with Cur exhibited lower TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1 beta and MDA levels and a higher SOD content. Besides, Cur also downregulated p65 expression and upregulated AMPK phosphorylation. Conclusion: Cur may improve AD via suppressing the inflammatory response, oxidative stress and activating the AMPK pathway, suggesting that Cur may be a potential drug for AD.

AB  - Hippo-independent YAP dysfunction has been demonstrated to cause chronological aging of stromal cells by impairing the integrity of nuclear envelope (NE). In parallel with this report, we uncover that YAP activity also controls another type of cellular senescence, the replicative senescence in in vitro expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), but this event is Hippo phosphorylation-dependent, and there exist another NE integrity-independent downstream mechanisms of YAP. Specifically, Hippo phosphorylation causes reduced nuclear/active YAP and then decreases the level of YAP protein in the proceeding of replicative senescence. YAP/TEAD governs RRM2 expression to release replicative toxicity (RT) via licensing G1/S transition. Besides, YAP controls the core transcriptomics of RT to delay the onset of genome instability and enhances DNA damage response/repair. Hippo-off mutations of YAP (YAP(S127A/S381A)) satisfactorily release RT via maintaining cell cycle and reducing genome instability, finally rejuvenating MSCs and restoring their regenerative capabilities without risks of tumorigenesis.

AB  - A detrimental role of the receptor for the advanced glycation end product (RAGE) has been identified in the immune response, and various pathological conditions and its V and C1 domains in the extracellular region of RAGE are believed to be the main ligand-binding domains. Consequently, specific inhibitors targeting those domains could be of clinical value in fighting against the pathological condition associated with RAGE over-activation. Single-domain antibodies, also called nanobodies (Nbs), are antibody fragments engineered from the heavy-chain only antibodies found in camelids, which offer a range of advantages in therapy. In this study, we report the development and characterization of the V-C1 domain-specific Nbs. Three Nbs (3CNB, 4BNB, and 5ENB) targeting V-C1 domain of human RAGE were isolated from an immunized alpaca using a phage display. All of these Nbs revealed high thermostability. 3CNB, 4BNB, and 5ENB bind to V-C1 domain with a dissociation constant (K-D) of 27.25, 39.37, and 47.85 nM, respectively, using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). After homodimerization using human IgG1-Fc fusion, their binding affinity improved to 0.55, 0.62, and 0.41 nM, respectively, using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Flow cytometry showed all the Fc fusions Nbs can bind to human RAGE expressed on the cell surface. Competitive ELISA further confirmed their V-C1-hS100B blocking ability in solution, providing insights into the applicability of Nbs in treating RAGE-associated diseases. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Control of protein synthesis via the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is essential for learning and memory. However, the cell-type-specific and spatiotemporal regulation of this pathway during memory formation is not well understood. In this study, we expressed artificial human muscarinic M3 [hM3D(Gq)] or M4 [hM4D(Gi)] designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in hippocampal CA1 excitatory or inhibitory neurons of adult mice. We studied the impact of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), a synthetic DREADDs agonist, on the mTORC1 pathway and long-term memory. hM3D(Gq) and hM4D(Gi) activate or inactivate, respectively, mTORC1 signaling in hippocampal interneurons, as indicated by the phosphorylation of its targets, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BP1/2) and ribosomal protein S6 (S6). Activation of either hM3D(Gq) or hM4D(Gi) in mice immediately after training in memory tasks impaired long-term memory formation in inhibitory, but not in excitatory neurons. The findings underscore the importance of activity-dependent mTORC1-4E-BP1/2 signaling in hippocampal inhibitory interneurons for memory formation.image

AB  - The development of biologically realistic models of brain microcircuits and regions constitutes currently a very relevant topic in computational neuroscience. One of the main challenges of such models is the passage between different scales, going from the microscale (cellular) to the meso (microcircuit) and macroscale (region or whole-brain level), while keeping at the same time a constraint on the demand of computational resources. In this paper we introduce a multiscale modeling framework for the hippocampal CA1, a region of the brain that plays a key role in functions such as learning, memory consolidation and navigation. Our modeling framework goes from the single cell level to the macroscale and makes use of a novel mean-field model of CA1, introduced in this paper, to bridge the gap between the micro and macro scales. We test and validate the model by analyzing the response of the system to the main brain rhythms observed in the hippocampus and comparing our results with the ones of the corresponding spiking network model of CA1. Then, we analyze the implementation of synaptic plasticity within our framework, a key aspect to study the role of hippocampus in learning and memory consolidation, and we demonstrate the capability of our framework to incorporate the variations at synaptic level. Finally, we present an example of the implementation of our model to study a stimulus propagation at the macro-scale level, and we show that the results of our framework can capture the dynamics obtained in the corresponding spiking network model of the whole CA1 area.

AB  - Uncovering mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis aids in preventing further epilepsy progression and to lessen seizure severity and frequency. The purpose of this study is to explore the antiepileptogenic and neuroprotective mechanisms of EGR1 in neuron injuries encountered in epilepsy. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify the key genes related to epilepsy. The mice were rendered epileptic using the kainic acid protocol, followed by measurement of seizure severity, high amplitude and frequency, pathological changes of hippocampal tissues and neuron apoptosis. Furthermore, an in vitro epilepsy model was constructed in the neurons isolated from newborn mice, which was then subjected to loss- and gain-of-function investigations, followed by neuron injury and apoptosis assessment. Interactions among EGR1, METTL3, and VIM were analyzed by a series of mechanistic experiments. In the mouse and cell models of epilepsy, VIM was robustly induced. However, its knockdown reduced hippocampal neuron injury and apoptosis. Meanwhile, VIM knockdown decreased inflammatory response and neuron apoptosis in vivo. Mechanistic investigations indicated that EGR1 transcriptionally activated METTL3, which in turn downregulated VIM expression through m6A modification. EGR1 activated METTL3 and reduced VIM expression, thereby impairing hippocampal neuron injury and apoptosis, preventing epilepsy progression. Taken together, this study demonstrates that EGR1 alleviates neuron injuries in epilepsy by inducing METTL3-mediated inhibition of VIM, which provides clues for the development of novel antiepileptic treatments.

AB  - In vivo-collected granulosa cells (GC) from the southern white rhinoceros (SWR) provide a non-invasive assessment of the developmental status of oocytes prior to in vitro culture, which could aid in the development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Our study aimed to investigate gene expression in SWR granulosa cells, collected in vivo and gain preliminary insight into the transcriptional activity occurring within the cells during various stages of oocyte development. It was hypothesized there would be similarities between the SWR GC transcriptome and cattle and humans, two species for which well-annotated genomes are available and ART are commonly used. GC were collected from SWR following ovum pickup (OPU) and pooled from all aspirated follicles. Total RNA was isolated, libraries prepared, and sequencing performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500. Reads were aligned and annotated to CerSimCot1.0. Databases for cattle and human were acquired for comparison. This study identified 37,407 transcripts present in GC of SWR. It was determined that cattle and human transcriptomes are valuable resources with a homology of 45 % with the SWR. In conclusion, these data provide preliminary, novel insights into the transcriptional activity of GC in the SWR that can be used to enhance ART in this species.

AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a Gram-negative anaerobe involved in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis, including local inflammation of the oral cavity. However, periodontal disease has recently been identified as a significant factor in the pathogenesis of neural diseases, including Alz-heimer's disease. A virulence factor, P. gingivalis-lipopolysaccharide (LPS-PG), is involved in pro-inflammatory responses, not only in peripheral tissues but also in the brain. In this study, we exam-ined whether P. gingivalis-induced brain inflammation could be ameliorated by pharmacotherapy, using in vivo and in vitro studies. In an animal experiment, peripheral administration of LPS-PG induced inflammation in the hippocampus via microglial activation, which was inhibited by pre-treatment with the antidepressant imipramine. Similarly, LPS-PG-induced inflammation in MG-6 cells, a mouse micro-glial cell line, was inhibited by pre-treatment with imipramine, which caused imipramine-induced in-hibition of NF-kB signaling. Culture media obtained from LPS-PG-treated MG-6 cells induced neuronal cell death in Neuro-2A cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, which was prevented by pre-treatment of MG-6 cells with imipramine. These results indicate that imipramine inhibits LPS-PG-induced inflam-matory responses in microglia and ameliorates periodontal disease-related neural damage. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Critical illness encompasses a wide spectrum of life-threatening clinical conditions requiring intensive care. Our objective was to evaluate cognitive, inflammatory and cellular metabolism alterations in the central nervous system in an animal model of critical illness induced by zymosan. For this Wistar rats that were divided into Sham and zymosan. Zymozan was administered once intraperitoneally (30 g/100 g body weight) diluted in mineral oil. The animals were submitted to behavioral tests of octagonal maze, inhibitory avoidance and elevated plus maze. Brain structures (cortex, prefrontal and hippocampus) were removed at 24 h, 4, 7 and 15 days after zymosan administration for analysis of cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10), oxidative damage and oxygen consumption. Zymosan-treated animals presented mild cognitive impairment both in aversive (inhibitory avoidance) and non-aversive (octagonal maze) tasks by day 15. However, they did not show increase in anxiety (elevated-plus maze). The first neurochemical alteration found was an increase in brain pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) at day 4th in the hippocampus. In cortex, a late (7 and 15 days) increase in TNF-alpha was also noted, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 decrease from 4 to 15 days. Oxygen consumption was decreased in the hippocampus and pre-frontal, but not cortex, only at 7 days. Additionally, it was observed a late (15 days) increase in oxidative damage parameters. This characterization of brain dysfunction in rodent model of critical illness reproduces some of the alterations reported in humans such neuropsychiatric disorders, especially depression, memory loss and cognitive changes and can add to the nowadays used models.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is accompanied by psychiatric disorders, including Schizophrenic-like manifestations. Although incompletely illustrated, intestinal mucosal membrane damage and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrability may have significant roles in psychiatric symptoms of IBD. This study aimed to investigate role of the Claudin-5 (CLDN5) (a regulator of the permeability of BBB) and neuroinflammatory response in the comorbid behavioral disorders in experimental colitis in mice. Acetic acid was used to induce colitis in mice. 7 days after induction of colitis, behaviors including social interaction and locomotor activity as well as anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated. Then, the colon was extracted for gross and microscopic evaluations. The expression of CLDN5, TNF-alpha, IL1 beta and IL23 was measured by RT-PCR in the colon and hippocampus. Histopathologic evaluations demonstrated mucosal, submucosal, and crypt-related damages in the colon. The negative and positive number of social interactions significantly increased in the colitis group. A considerable increase in locomotor activities (horizontal and vertical components) shown in the colitis group. Mice in colitis group spent less time in the central zone in the open field apparatus. Gene expressions of TNF-alpha, IL1 beta, and IL23 increased and CLDN5 decreased in the colitis group. The barrier function of the intestine and brain would be impaired, partially at least, following colitis (as we observed decrease in CLDN5 gene expression). Furthermore, we found that beside inflammatory response in the colon, a neuro-immune response triggered in the hippocampus following colitis. These alterations probably, mediated comorbid behavioral disorders in acetic acid-induced colitis in mice.
   neuroinflammation and downregulation of claudin 5 in the hippocampus are possible underlying mechanisms mediating comorbid behavioral disorders in experimental colitis image

AB  - Memory formation is usually associated with Hebbian learning and synaptic plasticity, which changes the synaptic strengths but omits structural changes. A recent study suggests that structural plasticity can also lead to silent memory engrams, reproducing a conditioned learning paradigm with neuron ensembles. However, this study is limited by its way of synapse formation, enabling the formation of only one memory engram. Overcoming this, our model allows the formation of many engrams simultaneously while retaining high neurophysiological accuracy, e.g., as found in cortical columns. We achieve this by substituting the random synapse formation with the Model of Structural Plasticity. As a homeostatic model, neurons regulate their activity by growing and pruning synaptic elements based on their current activity. Utilizing synapse formation based on the Euclidean distance between the neurons with a scalable algorithm allows us to easily simulate 4 million neurons with 343 memory engrams. These engrams do not interfere with one another by default, yet we can change the simulation parameters to form long-reaching associations. Our model's analysis shows that homeostatic engram formation requires a certain spatiotemporal order of events. It predicts that synaptic pruning precedes and enables synaptic engram formation and that it does not occur as a mere compensatory response to enduring synapse potentiation as in Hebbian plasticity with synaptic scaling. Our model paves the way for simulations addressing further inquiries, ranging from memory chains and hierarchies to complex memory systems comprising areas with different learning mechanisms.

AB  - Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a severe non-traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) wherein the spinal canal and cervical cord are compressed due to the degeneration of cervical tissues. To explore the mechanism of CSM, the ideal model of chronic cervical cord compression in rats was constructed by embedding a polyvinyl alcohol-polyacrylamide hydrogel in lamina space. Then, the RNA sequencing technology was used to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways among intact and compressed spinal cords. A total of 444 DEGs were filtered out based on the value of log2(Compression/Sham); these were associated with IL-17, PI3K-AKT, TGF-& beta;, and Hippo signaling pathways according to the GSEA, KEGG, and GO analyses. Transmission electron microscopy indicated the changes in mitochondrial morphology. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining revealed neuronal apoptosis, astrogliosis and microglial neuroinflammation in the lesion area. Specifically, the expression of apoptotic indicators, such as Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, and TNF-& alpha;, were upregulated. The activation of IL-17 signaling pathway was observed in microglia instead of neurons or astrocytes, the activation of TGF-& beta; and inhibition of Hippo signaling pathways were detected in astrocytes instead of neurons or microglia, and the inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was discovered in neurons rather than microglia of astrocytes in the lesion area. In conclusion, this study indicated that neuronal apoptosis was accompanied by inhibiting of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Then, the activation of microglia IL-17 pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome effectuated the neuroinflammation, and astrogliosis was ascribed to the activation of TGF-& beta; and the inhibition of the Hippo pathway in the chronic cervical cord of compression. Therefore, therapeutic methods targeting these pathways in nerve cells could be promising CSM treatments.

AB  - Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathological feature of cardiac remodelling process with disordered expression of multiple genes and eventually lead to heart failure. Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of various biological processes. However, the exact mechanisms of lncRNAs as mediators in cardiac fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to profile the lncRNA expression pattern in human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) with cardiac fibrosis. We treated HCFs with transforming growth factor-13 (TGF-13) to induce their activation. Then, strand-specific RNA-seq was performed to profile and classify lncRNAs; and perform functional analysis in HCFs. We study the transformation of HCFs with molecular and cell biology methods. Among all identified lncRNA candidates, 176 and 526 lncRNAs were upregulated and downregulated respectively in TGF-13-stimulated HCFs compared with controls. Functional analyses revealed that the target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs were mainly related to focal adhesion, metabolic pathways, Hippo signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and hypertrophic car-diomyopathy. As a representative, novel lncRNAs NONHSAG005537 and NONHSAG017620 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and transformation of HCFs induced by TGF-13. Collectively, our study established the expression signature of lncRNAs in cardiac fibrosis and demonstrated the car-dioprotective role of NONHSAG005537 and NONHSAG017620 in cardiac fibrosis, providing a promising target for anti-fibrotic therapy.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, requiring treatment tailored to the unique phenotype of the patient's tumor. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and variants thereof have enabled targeted therapies to selectively target cancer cells. Cancer cell-specific mAbs have been used for image-guided surgery and targeted delivery of radionuclides or toxic agents, improving classical treatment strategies. Cancer cell-specific mAbs can further inhibit tumor cell growth or can stimulate immune-mediated destruction of cancer cells, a feature that has also been achieved through mAb-mediated manipulation of immune cells and pathways. Drawbacks of mAbs and their variants, together with the discovery of camelid heavy chain-only antibodies and the many advantageous features of their variable domains, referred to as VHHs, single domain antibodies or nanobodies (Nbs), resulted in the exploration of Nbs as an alternative targeting moiety. We therefore review the state-of-the-art as well as novel exploitation strategies of Nbs for targeted cancer therapy.

AB  - Midfacial hypoplasia is a type of facial dysplasia. The technique of trans-sutural distraction osteogenesis promotes midface growth so as to ameliorate this symptom. In the process of distraction osteogenesis, the fiber matrix in the suture acts as a mechanical sensor. Compared with osteogenesis, the formation of collagen fibers by fibroblasts is significant in the early stage of sutural distraction. However the transformation of fibroblasts during sutural bone formation induced by tensile force is poorly characterized. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to define the cell classification of the zygomatic maxillary suture and the changes of cell clusters in the suture before and after seven-day distraction. We identified twenty-nine cell subsets spanning monocyte/macrophages, neutrophils, red blood cells, B cells and fibroblasts. Compared with the control group, Monocle analysis revealed the emergence of a unique fibroblast subset (Cdh5+, Col4a1+, Fat1-, and Acta2-) (cluster 27) that expressed vascular endothelial cell genes within the distracted zygomatic maxillary suture. We constructed the differentiation trajectories of the fibroblast population (cluster 23, 27) in the suture before and after distraction. In addition, we clarified that a subset of fibroblasts (cluster 27) lost expression of Fat1, an upregulator of the Hippo pathway, and upregulated Cyr61, a downstream gene of the Hippo pathway, during the distraction process. Further enrichment analysis suggests that cells of the new subset (cluster 27) are undergoing conversion of their identity into a vascular endothelial cell-like state in response to mechanical stimulation, associated with upregulation of angiogenesis genes along the single-cell trajectory. Further immunofluorescence staining confirmed this phenomenon. A combined general transcriptome RNA sequencing data analysis demonstrated that the fibroblasts expressed a number of extracellular matrix-related genes under mechanical strain. These data together provide a new view of the role of fibroblasts in tension-induced sutural angiogenesis via interaction with the Hippo pathway.

AB  - Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression, though its molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. We investigated the molecular mechanism of IDO1 in depression by using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model in Ido1-/mice and WT mice. The brain blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in mice were collected by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology. IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 was intervened in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) through stereotactic injection. We found an elevation of serum IDO1 activity and decreased 5-HT in CUMS mice, and the serum IDO1 activity was negatively correlated with 5-HT level. Consistently, IDO1 was increased in hippocampus and DRN regions, accompanied by a reduction of hippocampal BDNF levels in mice with CUMS. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 activity in the DRN alleviated depressive-like behaviors with improving hippocampal BDNF expression and neurogenesis in CUMS mice. Furthermore, ablation of Ido1 exerted stress resistance and decreased the sensitivity of depression in CUMS mice with the stable BOLD signals, BDNF expression and neurogenesis in hippocampus. Thus, IDO1 hyperactivity played crucial roles in modulating 5-HT metabolism and BDNF function thereby impacting outcomes of hippocampal neurogenesis and BOLD signals in depressive disorder.

AB  - Long-term preservation of gametes has been identified as a tool to improve broodstock management and increase the number of juveniles produced by artificial fertilization. Paralichthys orbignyanus is an important commercial and recreational species distributed in marine and estuarine waters from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) to the San Mat & iacute;as Gulf (Argentina). This work focused on studying the seminal quality of tank-reared P. orbignyanus, demonstrating that males are fluent year-round, with the highest yields at the early reproductive season. Fresh sperm exhibited good forward swimming, and samples could be refrigerated up to 48 h while retaining their motility after activation. The optimal conditions for P. orbignyanus sperm motility activation were established as 950 mOsmol/Kg and pH values between 7 and 7.9. Additionally, a well-defined protocol for semen vitrification was developed to assess the cryotolerance of this species' sperm. We successfully produced high-quality sperm samples, using two vitrification formulations containing trehalose and both z-1000 and x-1000 polymers, that can be used in a near-future in vitro embryo production program.

AB  - Introduction: Brand equity plays a crucial role in a brand's commercial success; however, research on the brain regions associated with brand equity has had mixed results. This study aimed to investigate key brain regions associated with the decision-making of branded and unbranded foods using quantitative neuroimaging meta-analysis and machine learning. Methods: Quantitative neuroimaging meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood method. Activation of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) overlapped between branded and unbranded foods. The lingual and parahippocampal gyri (PHG) were activated in the case of branded foods, whereas no brain regions were characteristically activated in response to unbranded foods. We proposed a novel predictive method based on the reported foci data, referencing the multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) results. This approach is referred to as the multi-coordinate pattern analysis (MCPA). We conducted the MCPA, adopting the sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) to detect unique brain regions associated with branded and unbranded foods based on coordinate data. The sPLS-DA is an extended PLS method that enables the processing of categorical data as outcome variables. Results: We found that the lingual gyrus is a distinct brain region in branded foods. Thus, the VMPFC might be a core brain region in food categories in consumer behavior, regardless of whether they are branded foods. Moreover, the connection between the PHG and lingual gyrus might be a unique neural mechanism in branded foods. Discussion: As this mechanism engages in imaging the feature-self based on emotionally subjective contextual associative memories, brand managers should create future-oriented relevancies between brands and consumers to build valuable brands.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Therefore, novel liposomes of oleic acid coated with camel alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA coated liposomes) were developed for their potential antitumor activity against CRC, both in vitro and in DMH-induced CRC-modeled animal. In vitro results indicated the high safety of alpha-LA coated liposomes towards normal human cells with potent antitumor activity against Caco-2 cells at an IC50 value of 57.01 +/- 3.55 mu M with selectivity index of 6.92 +/- 0.48. This antitumor activity has been attributed to induction of the apoptotic mechanism, as demonstrated by nuclear condensation and arrest of Caco-2 cells in sub-G1 populations. alpha-LA coated liposomes also revealed a significant up-regulation of the p53 gene combined with a down-regulation of the Bcl2 gene. Moreover, in vivo results revealed that treatment of induced-CRC modeled animals with alpha-LA coated liposomes for six weeks markedly improved the CRC-disorders; this was achieved from the significant reduction in the values of AFP, CEA, CA19.9, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, MDA, and NO coupled with remarkable rise in SOD, GPx, GSH, CAT, and CD4+ levels. The histopathological findings asserted the therapeutic potential of alpha-LA coated liposomes in the treatment of CRC. Therefore, the present results proved the antitumor activity of alpha-LA coated liposomes against CRC through the restoration of impaired oxidative stress, improved immune response, and reduced inflammation.

AB  - Dementia, characterized by loss of cognitive abilities in the elderly, poses a significant global health challenge. This study explores the role of astrocytes, one of most representative glial cells in the brain, in mitigating cognitive decline. Specifically, we investigated the impact of Hevin (also known as SPARC-like1/SPARCL-1), a secreted glycoprotein, on cognitive decline in both normal and pathological brain aging. By using adeno-associated viruses, we overexpressed Hevin in hippocampal astrocytes of middle-aged APP/PSEN mice, an established Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. Results demonstrated that Hevin overexpression attenuates cognitive decline, as evidenced by cognitive tests, increased pre- and postsynaptic markers colocalization, and altered expression of synaptic mediators, as revealed by proteomic profiling. Importantly, Hevin overexpression did not influence the deposition of A beta plaques in the hippocampus, a hallmark of AD pathology. Furthermore, the study extended its findings to middle-aged wild-type animals, revealing improved cognitive performance following astrocytic Hevin overexpression. In conclusion, our results propose astrocytic Hevin as a potential therapeutic target for age-associated cognitive decline.

AB  - Research question: Could METTL3 and METTL14-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification play possible cooperative roles in pathogenesis and progression of endometriosis? Design: An investigation into m6A methylation profiles and the roles of METTL3 and METTL14 in the m6A regulation and pathogenesis of endometriosis. The m6A methylation and mRNA levels in paired ectopic endometrium and eutopic endometrium were measured using m6A-mRNA epitranscriptomic microarrays. The functions of m6A methylation in mRNAs were predicted using bioinformatics analysis. The levels of m6A methyltransferases were detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The role of METTL3 and METTL14 in endometriosis was explored using eutopic endometrium stromal cells. Results: The m6A methylation levels were decreased in 1312 mRNAs and increased in 518 mRNAs; 1797 mRNAs were increased and 2580 mRNAs were reduced in the ectopic endometrium compared with the eutopic endometrium. Pathway analysis found that the genes with hypo-methylated m6A were significantly associated with important pathways in endometriosis, including oestrogen, Hippo, and PI3K-Akt signalling and cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, METTL3 and METTL14 were downregulated in the ectopic endometrium compared with the eutopic endometrium (P < 0.001). Simultaneous METTL3 and METTL14 knockdown increased cell proliferation and invasion. Conclusion: Taken together, these data reveal a differential m6A epitranscriptomic pattern in endometriosis. The N6- methyladenosine modification mediated by METTL3 and METTL14 play a cooperative role in promoting cell proliferation and invasion in a model of endometriosis. Therefore, METTL3 and METTL14 may be a novel treatment target of the disease.

AB  - Preeclampsia (PE) is a common obstetric disease caused by placenta development abnormality, typically characterized as inadequate trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling. In this study, we found that LMO2 level was decreased in both cytotrophoblast (CTB) and interstitial extravillous trophoblast (iEVT) in human PE placentas, and LMO2 selectively promoted cell migration in iEVT derived HTR-8/SVneo cells whereas increased proliferation in CTB derived JEG-3 cells. In mechanism, LMO2 interacted with NCKAP1, leading to destruction of WAVE regulatory complex and increased lamellipodia formation in HTR-8/SVneo cells, whereas interacted with beta-catenin and up-regulated a number of core Wnt/Hippo pathway target genes in JEG-3 cells. This study revealed the differentially functional patterns of LMO2 in different trophoblast subtypes, and suggested LMO2 as a novel target for PE prediction, prevention and treatment in clinical.

AB  - Clinical evidence suggests that multiple exposures to sevoflurane in young people may be detrimental to cognitive development. Iron accumulation in the hippocampus is associated with sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits. The cysteine desulphurase, Nfs1, the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of iron-sulphur clusters, plays a role in cellular iron homeostasis. However, the impact of Nfs1-mediated ferroptosis on sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive impairments in neonatal mice remains undetermined. Neonatal mice at postnatal Day 6 received 3% sevoflurane daily for 3 consecutive days. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test, and neurotoxicity was evaluated through terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and immunofluorescence staining. Here, HT22 hippocampal neurons were employed for in-vitro experiments, and Fe2+ accumulation was measured. Ferroptosis-related genes, including glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) and ferritin, in the hippocampus and HT22 cells were observed, along with oxidative stress-related indicators such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Transmission electron microscopy was utilized to examine the mitochondrial microstructure. Sevoflurane exposure significantly decreased Nfs1 expression in the hippocampus of mice and HT22 cells. This exposure resulted in cognitive impairments and neuronal damage in the hippocampus, which were alleviated by overexpression of Nfs1. Intracellular and mitochondrial iron accumulation occurred in HT22 cells following sevoflurane treatment. Sevoflurane exposure also significantly reduced GSH levels and increased levels of malondialdehyde, ROS and LPO in the hippocampus or HT22 cells. Additionally, sevoflurane exposure decreased GPX4 expression but increased TFR1 and ferritin expression in the hippocampus or HT22 cells. Overexpression of Nfs1 reversed the sevoflurane-induced alterations in ferroptosis-related genes and oxidative stress-related indicators. Furthermore, overexpression of Nfs1 alleviated sevoflurane-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. However, Nfs1 knockdown alone did not result in cognitive impairments, ferroptosis or oxidative stress. The overexpression of Nfs1 mitigated sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment by modulating oxidative stress and ferroptosis through the regulation of iron metabolism and transport.

AB  - Depression is a prevalent mental illness worldwide, its multifaceted pathogenesis is still in the exploratory stage. MicroRNA (miRNA), as a crucial epigenetic regulator, plays an important role in depression.miR-124 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the central nervous system including neurons and microglia, and involved in various biological events like neuron development and differentiation, synaptic and axonal growth,neural plasticity, inflammation and autophagy. Recent studies have reported abnormal expression of miR-124 in both depression patients and animal models. Most of the studies showed that miR-124 is upregulated in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex in stress-induced rodent depression animal models such as CUMS, CSDS,CORT, CRS and LH but some evidence for divergence. Upregulation of miR-124 expression may be involved in depression-like behavior via CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway, GR pathway, SIRT1 pathway, apoptosis and autophagy pathways by directly targeting these genes including Creb,Bdnf,Sirt1,Nr3c1,Ezh2 and Stat3. The downregulation of miR-124 expression in neurons is mainly involved in the neurogenesis and neuroplasticity impairments in depression by targeting the Notch signaling pathway and DDIT4/TSC1/2/mTORC1 pathway. The downregulation of miR-124 expression also was found in the activated microglia in the stress-induced models,and resulted in neuroinflammation. In summary, the abnormal expression of miR-124 in the brain of depression-related models and its related mechanisms are complex and even contradictory, and still need further research.This review provides a summary of the research progress of miR-124 in depression

AB  - Peroxiredoxin 4 (Prdx4) is responsible for the oxidative folding of new proteins that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It has recently been suggested that increased ER stress is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Prdx4 is widely distributed throughout the brain, and is also expressed in hippocampal neurons and oligodendrocytes, suggesting that it is associated with learning and memory. We previously established Prdx4-knockout (KO) mice but did not examine the behavioral phenotypes. In the present study, we report on the learning and memory abilities of Prdx4-KO mice based on Morris water maze and the Y-maze tests. The findings indicate that Prdx4-KO mice showed a lower spatial memory ability in both tests. In contrast, the results of the open field test indicated that locomotor activity is significantly increased in Prdx4-KO mice. We then performed mRNA analyses of the brains of Prdx4-KO mice and found an increased expression of genes related to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mechanism, which is an important protein quality control system for the maintenance of ER homeostasis. Finally, proteomic analyses of the brains of Prdx4-KO mice showed an aberrant expression in the proteins, which have been suggested to be related to calcium homeostasis and synaptogenesis in neurons. Our collective results suggest that the Prdx4 ablation perturbs oxidative protein folding in the ER, thus leading to aberrant ER homeostasis in neuronal cells, ultimately leading to impaired spatial memory formation.

AB  - Cardiac disease is one of the most common complications associated with diabetes. Cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis often lead to structural and functional abnormalities leading to risks of heart failure. Several regulatory molecules related to major signaling pathways have been found to overexpress in different tissues during diabetes which show very low level of expression in non-diabetic condition. YAP1 and FOXM1 are recently being reported to play important role in various hypertrophic and fibrotic disorders. But, very limited information is still known regarding their roles in cardiomyopathies especially in the context of diabetes and hyperglycemic stress. YAP1 is known to be associated with AKT- GSK3B signaling that is one of the important regulatory pathways in glucose and lipid metabolism. On the other hand, the expression of FOXM1 has been found to be significantly upregulated in adult lung tissue with induction of fibrosis but little is known about their role in cardiac diseases. In our study, YAP1 and FOXM1 have been found to overexpress in cardiac tissue under hyperglycemic condition leading to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased fibrotic response. Further YAP1 inhibition has resulted in a reduced expression of FOXM1 pointing to a possible association of YAP1 and FOXM1 in high glucose-stressed cardiomyocyte. As mechanism we have found that YAP1 undergoes reduced ser127 phosphorylation as well as extensive 0-G1cNAcylation mediated activation under hyperglycemia. Upregulated YAP1 further acts through increased AKT phosphorylation causing inhibition of GSK3B that in turn results in increased FOXM1 expression, leading to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis.

AB  - Background: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), abnormally phosphorylated tau in the somatodendrite compartment of brain neurons causes synaptic loss, resulting in neuron death. Although the mechanism by which hyper-phosphorylated tau appears in dendrites remains unclear, we have previously reported that local translation of tau mRNA and GSK3 beta mRNA in response to glutamatergic stimulation triggers an increase of tau protein and initiation of a cycle for amplification of reactivated preexisting GSK3 beta, respectively. In this study, we investi-gated the mechanism responsible for neural excitation-dependent activation of another major tau kinase, CDK5, within dendrites.Methods: Primary hippocampal neurons were treated with glutamate and examined by in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and Western blotting.Results: The mRNAs for both CDK5 and its neural-specific activator, p35, were found to be constitutively distributed in dendrites. Glutamate treatment induced immediate local dendritic translation of these proteins as well as conversion of p35 to p25, which forms the hyper-activated CDK5/p25 complex. This neural excitation-dependent tau phosphorylation by CDK5 was suppressed in the presence of a calpain inhibitor or a NMDA re-ceptor antagonist. Conclusion: Our results indicate that in addition to an increase of dendritic tau and reactivation of preexisting GSK3 beta, increase and hyper-activation of CDK5 are evoked by translation of dendrite-distributed mRNAs upon NMDA receptor-mediated neural excitation. General significance: Hyperphosphorylated tau with AD epitopes is locally produced in dendrites via translational activation of dendrite-distributed mRNAs in response to glutamatergic stimulation. Therefore, tau hyper-phosphorylation may play a crucial role in synaptic transduction.

AB  - Accurate neuron morphologies are paramount for computational model simulations of realistic neural responses. Over the last decade, the online repository has collected over 140,000 available neuron morphologies to understand brain function and promote interaction between experimental and computational research. Neuron morphologies describe spatial aspects of neural structure; however, many of the available morphologies do not contain accurate diameters that are essential for computational simulations of electrical activity. To best utilize available neuron morphologies, we present a set of equations that predict dendritic diameter from other morphological features. To derive the equations, we used a set of archives with realistic neuron diameters, representing hippocampal pyramidal, cerebellar Purkinje, and striatal spiny projection neurons. Each morphology is separated into initial, branching children, and continuing nodes. Our analysis reveals that the diameter of preceding nodes, Parent Diameter, is correlated to diameter of subsequent nodes for all cell types. Branching children and initial nodes each required additional morphological features to predict diameter, such as path length to soma, total dendritic length, and longest path to terminal end. Model simulations reveal that membrane potential response with predicted diameters is similar to the original response for several tested morphologies. We provide our open source software to extend the utility of available morphologies, and suggest predictive equations may supplement morphologies that lack dendritic diameter and improve model simulations with realistic dendritic diameter.

AB  - We investigated the role of microRNA (miR)-485 and its downstream signaling molecules on mediating epilepsy in cellular and rat models. We established a cellular epilepsy model by exposing hippocampal neurons to magnesium and a rat model by treating ICR mice with lithium chloride (127 mg/kg) and pilocarpine (30 mg/kg). We confirmed that miR-485 could bind and inhibit histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and then measured expression of miR-485 and in mice and cells. Cells were transfected with overexpression or knockdown of miR-485, HDAC5, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1 alpha), or 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 enzyme (PFKFB3) to verify their roles in apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in epileptic hippocampal neurons. Binding relationship between miR-485, HDAC5, HIF1 alpha, and PFKFB3 was verified. Oxidative stress and inflammation marker levels in epilepsy model mice were assessed. miR-485 was downregulated and HDAC5 was upregulated in cell and animal model of epilepsy. Seizure, neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress (increased SOD and GSH-Px expression and decreased MDA and 8-OHdG expression) and inflammation (reduced 1L-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 expression) were reduced by miR-485 in epileptic cells. HIF1 alpha and PFKFB3 expression was reduced by HDACS knockdown in cells, which was recapitulated in vivo. Thus, miR-485 alleviates neuronal damage and epilepsy by inhibiting HDACS, HIF1 alpha, and PFKFB3.

AB  - Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide synthesized by posterior hypothalamic and incerto-hypothalamic neurons that project throughout the central nervous system. The MCHergic system modulates several important functions such as feeding behavior, mood and sleep. MCH exerts its biological functions through interaction with the MCHR-1 receptor, the only functional receptor present in rodents. The internalization process of MCHR-1 triggered by MCH binding was described in vitro in non-neuronal heterologous systems with over-expression of MCHR-1. Reports of in vivo MCHR-1 internalization dynamics are scarce, however, this is an important process to explore based on the critical functions of the MCHergic system. We had previously determined that 60 min after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) microinjections of MCH conjugated with fluorophore rhodamine (R-MCH), the dorsal and median raphe nucleus presented R-MCH positive labeled neurons. In the present work, we further studied the in vivo uptake process focusing on the distribution and timedependent pattern of R-MCH positive cells 10, 20 and 60 min (T10, T20 and T60, respectively) after i.c.v. microinjection of R-MCH. We also explored this uptake process to see whether it was receptor- and clathrindependent and examined the phenotype of R-MCH positive cells and their proximity to MCHergic fibers. We found a great number of R-MCH positive cells with high fluorescence intensity in the lateral septum, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus at T20 and T60 (but not at T10), while a lower number with low intensity was observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus. At T20, in rats pre-treated with a MCHR-1 antagonist (ATC-0175) or with phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a clathrin endocytosis inhibitor, a robust decrease (> 50 %) of R-MCH uptake occurred in these structures. The R-MCH positive cells were identified as neurons (NeuN positive, GFAP negative) and some MCHergic fibers run in the vicinities of them. We concluded that neurons localized at structures that were close to the ventricular surfaces could uptake R-MCH in vivo through a receptor-dependent and clathrinmediated process. Our results support volume transmission of MCH through the cerebrospinal fluid to reach distant targets. Finally, we propose that R-MCH would be an effective tool to study MCH-uptake in vivo.

AB  - The serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) is a key regulator of 5-HT signaling and is a major target for antidepressants and psychostimulants. Human SERT coding variants have been identified in subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that impact transporter phosphorylation, cell surface trafficking and/or conformational dynamics. Prior to an initial description of a novel mouse line expressing the non-phosphorylatable SERT substitution Thr276Ala, we review efforts made to elucidate the structure and conformational dynamics of SERT with a focus on research implicating phosphorylation at Thr276 as a determinant of SERT conformational dynamics. Using the high-resolution structure of human SERT in inward- and outward-open conformations, we explore the conformation dependence of SERT Thr276 exposure, with results suggesting that phosphorylation is likely restricted to an inward-open conformation, consistent with prior biochemical studies. Assessment of genotypes from SERT/Ala276 heterozygous matings revealed a deviation from Mendelian expectations, with reduced numbers of Ala276 offspring, though no genotype differences were seen in growth or physical appearance. Similarly, no genotype differences were evident in midbrain or hippocampal 5-HT levels, midbrain and hippocampal SERT mRNA or midbrain protein levels, nor in midbrain synaptosomal 5-HT uptake kinetics. Behaviorally, SERT Ala276 homozygotes appeared normal in measures of anxiety and antidepressant-sensitive stress coping behavior. However, these mice displayed sex-dependent alterations in repetitive and social interactions, consistent with circuit-dependent requirements for Thr276 phosphorylation underlying these behaviors. Our findings indicate the utility of SERT Ala276 mice in evaluation of developmental, functional and behavioral consequences of regulatory SERT phosphorylation in vivo.

AB  - Signaling pathway components are well studied, but how they mediate cell-type-specific transcription responses is an unresolved problem. Using the Hippo pathway in mouse trophoblast stem cells as a model, we show that the DNA binding of signaling effectors is driven by cell-type-specific sequence rules that can be learned genome wide by deep learning models. Through model interpretation and experimental validation, we show that motifs for the cell-type-specific transcription factor TFAP2C enhance TEAD4/YAP1 binding in a nucleosome-range and distance-dependent manner, driving synergistic enhancer activation. We also discovered that Tead double motifs are widespread, highly active canonical response elements. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that TEAD4 binds them cooperatively through surprisingly labile protein-protein interactions that depend on the DNA template. These results show that the response to signaling pathways is encoded in the cis-regulatory sequences and that interpreting the rules reveals insights into the mechanisms by which signaling effectors influence cell-type-specific enhancer activity.

AB  - The mechanisms of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and the development of liver fibrosis are not fully understood. Here, we show that deletion of a nuclear seven transmembrane protein, TM7SF3, accelerates HSC activation in liver organoids, primary human HSCs, and in vivo in metabolic -dysfunction -associated steatohepatitis (MASH) mice, leading to activation of the fibrogenic program and HSC proliferation. Thus, TM7SF3 knockdown promotes alternative splicing of the Hippo pathway transcription factor, TEAD1, by inhibiting the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU). This results in the exclusion of the inhibitory exon 5, generating a more active form of TEAD1 and triggering HSC activation. Furthermore, inhibiting TEAD1 alternative splicing with a specific antisense oligomer (ASO) deactivates HSCs in vitro and reduces MASH diet -induced liver fibrosis. In conclusion, by inhibiting TEAD1 alternative splicing, TM7SF3 plays a pivotal role in mitigating HSC activation and the progression of MASH -related fibrosis.

AB  - mRNA translation is critical for regulation of various aspects of the nervous system. Ionotropic glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors are fundamental synaptic ion channels that control excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, respectively. However, little is known about the translation of these receptors during brain development and function. By utilizing polysome profiling, a powerful tool for investigating translational machinery and mRNA translational states, we characterized the translational patterns of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), and GABA(A) receptor subunits, and compared them with total mRNA and protein levels during mouse brain development, in different brain regions, and in response to behavioral stimuli. Most of the receptor subunits exhibited developmental changes at total mRNA, translation, and protein levels, among which translation of Gria1, Gria2, Grin1, Grin2a, Gabra1, and Gabrg2 contributed greatly to their protein levels. Most of the receptor subunits also displayed differentiated levels of total mRNA, translation, and protein in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, among which translation of Gria1, Gria2, Gabrb2, and Gabrg2 contributed to their protein levels. Finally, we showed that acute foot shock stress had a rapid influence in both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, with the prefrontal cortex displaying more changes at translational and protein levels. Notably, Grin2a is translationally repressed by stress which was followed by a decrease of GluN2A protein in both brain regions. Together, this study provides a new understanding of the translational patterns of critical ionotropic synaptic receptors during brain development and behavioral stress.

AB  - The present study was aimed to develop silybin phytosome (SIBP) and evaluate its effectiveness against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) injury in rats. Initially, SIBP was prepared and characterized with Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy. Drug loading and entrapment efficiency of SIBP were also calculated. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to carry out bioavailability studies of SIBP. Adult Wistar rats were divided randomly into five groups. The CIR injury was induced after 14 days of pretreatment by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries for 30 min followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Biochemical estimation, histopathological studies, and in silico studies were carried out. Bioavailability studies revealed that SIB concentration was increased to twofolds in SIBP-treated rats. SIBP treatment significantly increases superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels while it decreases monoaldehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in both the hippocampus and cortex of the SIBP-treated CIR-injured rats. Histopathological studies reveal SIBP treatment alleviates cortex cell death and arrangement of CA1 neurons in CIR-injured rats. In silico studies against proteins (TNF-alpha and IL-6) involved in cerebral ischemia revealed that silybin (SIB) exhibits strong binding interaction with the target proteins when compared to thalidomide which was used as the positive control. Phytosome increase SIB bioavailability and SIBP treatment showed promising results when compared to treatment with SIB only. Based on our study, we conclude that phytosome is a suitable drug delivery agent to the brain for SIB as SIBP treatment was able to provide neuroprotective action against CIR injury.

AB  - Background Camrelizumab plus chemotherapy significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) in the phase III trial (CameL-sq), which has become an option of standard-of-cares for Chinese patients with advanced LUSC. However, the predictive biomarkers remain unknown. Methods Tumor tissue samples at baseline, and peripheral blood samples at baseline (pretreatment) and after two cycles of treatment (on-treatment) were prospectively collected from 270 LUSC patients from the CameL-sq study. Blood tumor mutation burden (bTMB) and its dynamics were analyzed to explore their predictive values. Results Pretreatment bTMB was not associated with objective response, PFS and OS in camrelizumab or placebo plus chemotherapy groups. Low on-treatment bTMB was associated with significantly better objective response (73.8% vs 27.8%, P < 0.001), PFS (median, 9.1 vs 4.1 months; P < 0.001) and OS (median, not reached vs 8.0 months; P < 0.001) in camrelizumab plus chemotherapy group whereas it did not correlate with objective response and PFS in chemotherapy alone group. Importantly, on-treatment bTMB level could discriminate patients of initially radiological stable disease who would long-term benefit from camrelizumab plus chemotherapy (low vs high, median OS, 18.2 vs 7.8 months; P = 0.001). Combing on-treatment bTMB and its dynamics improved the ability for predicting the efficacy of camrelizumab plus chemotherapy. Conclusion On-treatment bTMB together with its dynamics could serve as a predictive biomarker for camrelizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced LUSC.

AB  - Accumulated evidence demonstrated that an elevated plasma homocysteine level, hyperhomocysteinemia, induced cognitive impairment in animals, elderly and the patients with neurodegenerative diseases. To date, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms by which hyperhomocysteinemia induces cognitive impairment has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms behind hyperhomocysteinemia signaling in rat memory impairment. The results from this study demonstrated that hyperhomocysteinemia induced neuronal damage and loss in hippocampal CA3 region and downregulated the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. The findings of this study provide evidence that hyperhomocysteinemia induces rat memory impairment via injuring hippocampal CA3 neurons and downregulating CREB phosphorylation.

AB  - The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) has been shown to restore protein homeostasis and cell function under stress, and recent studies have confirmed that the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) regulates mtUPR. However, the role of ATF4-mediated mtUPR in a hippocampal neuronal culture model of seizures remains unclear. Our results showed that the expression of mtUPR-related proteins (HSP60 and CLpP) increased in primary hippocampal neurons with seizures induced by a magnesium-free solution, suggesting mtUPR activation. Furthermore, ATF4 overexpression by lentiviral vector transfection enhanced the expression of HSP60 and CLpP, whereas ATF4 low expression by lentiviral vector transfection weakened the expression of HSP60 and CLpP. In addition, ATF4 overexpression increased neuronal viability and reduced seizure-induced apoptosis. ATF4 overexpression reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and improved mitochondrial membrane potential damage during seizures. Moreover, ATF4 overexpression reduced the BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) expression and increased the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). In contrast, ATF4 expression showed the opposite trend. In conclusion, our results showed that ATF4-mediated mtUPR may delay the cascade activation of apoptotic pathways by reducing ROS-mediated oxidative stress, thereby attenuating seizure-induced stress injury.

AB  - Lipid-transfer proteins (LTPs) are lipid-binding small proteins, ubiquitously distributed amongst plant kingdom. Apart from their involvement in plant defense, it has also been discovered that they induce allergic reactions in humans. A plethora of LTPs have been identified in vegetables, fruits, pollens, nuts, and latex, among which Pru p 3, a LTP allergen from peach fruit, is extensively studied and exhibits cross-reactivity with potential allergens from different species. In Cicer arietinum, a family of LTPs (CaLTPs) has been identified and their importance in plant defense during Helicoverpa armigera-infestation has been recognized. However, the determination of the allergenicity potential of CaLTPs has not been attempted. In this study, we aim to decipher the allergenicity potential of defense-related CaLTPs. The allergenicity potential prediction, and identification of B-cell epitope binding regions showed that the CaLTPs had conserved domains and B-cell epitopes in the same regions as Prup3 (a marker allergen for LTPs). Using molecular docking and simulations, we observed that the CaLTPs successfully interacted with the Immunoglobin E(IgE)with docking energies ranging from -315.5 to -268.4 and the structures were stabilized within 10 ns of simulation. Through this study, we intend to embellish our present knowledge and understanding of the sensitization and allergenicity potential of CaLTPs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB  - Little is known about age-dependent changes in structure and function of astrocytes and of the impact of these on the cognitive decline in the senescent brain. The prevalent view on the age-dependent increase in reactive astrogliosis and astrocytic hypertrophy requires scrutiny and detailed analysis. Using two-photon microscopy in conjunction with 3D reconstruction, Sholl and volume fraction analysis, we demonstrate a significant reduction in the number and the length of astrocytic processes, in astrocytic territorial domains and in astrocyte-to-astrocyte coupling in the aged brain. Probing physiology of astrocytes with patch clamp, and Ca2+ imaging revealed deficits in K+ and glutamate clearance and spatiotemporal reorganisation of Ca2+ events in old astrocytes. These changes paralleled impaired synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 in old mice. Our findings may explain the astroglial mechanisms of age-dependent decline in learning and memory.

AB  - Objective beta-Site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its expression and activity play a crucial role in the development of AD. The interacting protein of BACE1 can directly or indirectly regulate BACE1 in the transcription, translation, modification, intracellular transport and other links of BACE1 by directly binding, indirectly binding, and participating in various cell signal transduction pathways, so as to participate in the occurrence of AD and the process of disease. This study aimed to screen and validate the interacting proteins of BACE1, providing new insights into the mechanisms of amyloid plaque formation. Methods Co- immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to enrich and identify BACE1 interacting proteins in the hippocampus of wild type (WT) mice and AD model mice. For candidate BACE1 interacting proteins, GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were used to explore the subcellular localization, molecular function, participating biological processes and participating signaling pathways of BACE1 interacting proteins. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of BACE1 was further constructed to explore the potential proteins interacting with BACE1. By searching the mouse genomeinformation (MGI) website and NCBI database, the more reliable proteins among the potential BACE1 interacting proteins were screened. Co-IP assay and immunofluorescence confocal technology were used to preliminarily verify the interaction between the proteins, and the changes in protein expression levels of the interacting proteins in AD cell models were explored. Results A total of 614 differentially expressed proteins interacting with BACE1 were identified in AD group. GO enrichment analysis showed that the BACE1 interacting proteins in the AD group were mainly located in membrane organelles such as Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, endosome, lysosome and vesicles, which had molecular functions such as ion channel regulation, protein kinase activity, transcription factor binding and passive transmembrane transporter activity. It is mainly involved in the biological processes of immune response regulation cell surface receptor signaling pathway, targeting Golgi vesicles transport, circadian rhythm regulation, Purkinje cell layer development, etc. . KEGG analysis showed that BACE1 interacting proteins in AD were mainly involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway and other neurodegenerative disease-related pathways. The PPI network of BACE1 showed that a total of 12 proteins were identified as high confidence binding proteins, including PRNP, APOE, SYP, NSF, NUMB, SNAP91, HSP90aa1, UCHL1, BIN1, SNX27, Rheb, Ap2m1, of which, NSF, NUMB, SNAP91, HSP90aa1 were newly identified candidate proteins. After further verification, we found that NSF not only interacts with BACE1, but also interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP), the substrate of BACE1, and the expression level of NSF is up-regulated in the AD cell model constructed by A beta 42 42 induction. Conclusion BACE1 binding proteins participate in multiple AD-associated biological processes and signal pathways. NSF is a newly identified BACE1 binding protein that interacts with BACE1, and the protein expression level of NSF is up-regulated in the AD cell model.
   It is predicted that the interaction between NSF and BACE1 is involved in regulating the course of AD, providing a new target and direction for the study of the mechanism of AD.

AB  - Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a master stress-responsive transcriptional factor, protecting cells from death. However, its gene regulation in vivo in the brain in response to neuronal stimuli remains elusive. Here, we investigated its direct regulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene (Bdnf) in response to acute neuronal stress stimuli in the brain. The results of immunohistochemistry and chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) showed that administration of kainic acid (a glutamate receptor agonist inducing excitotoxity) to young adult mice induced HSF1 nuclear translocation and its binding to multiple Bdnf promoters in the hippocampus. Footshock, a physical stressor used for learning, also induced HSF1 binding to selected Bdnf promoters I and IV. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of HSF1 gene regulation in response to neuronal stimuli in the hippocampus in vivo. HSF1 binding sites (HSEs) in Bdnf promoters I and IV were also detected when immunoprecipitated by an antibody of phosphorylated (p)CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein), suggesting their possible interplay in acute stress-induced Bdnf transcription. Interestingly, their promoter binding patterns differed by KA and footshock, suggesting that HSF1 and pCREB orchestrate to render fine-tuned promoter control depending on the types of stress. Further, HSF1 overexpression increased Bdnf promoter activity in a luciferase assay, while virus infection of constitutively active-form HSF1 increased levels of BDNF mRNA and protein in vitro in primary cultured neurons. These results indicated that HSF1 activation of Bdnf promoter was sufficient to induce BDNF expression. Taken together, these results suggest that HSF1 promoter-specific control of Bdnf gene regulation plays an important role in neuronal protection and plasticity in the hippocampus in response to acute stress, possibly interplaying with pCREB.

AB  - Hydrocephalus is defined as the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain ventricles. The usual treatment of hydrocephalus is surgical (shunt), but not all patients can undergo treatment immediately after diagnosis. Thus, neuroprotective measures were tested to minimize the tissue damage involved. Memantine is a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which has shown a neuroprotective action in neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective response of memantine in animals treated with or without a ventricular-subcutaneous shunt. Seven-day-old male Wistar rats induced by intracisternal injection of kaolin were used, divided into five groups: intact control (n = 10), hydrocephalic (n = 10), hydrocephalic treated with memantine (20 mg/kg/day) (n = 10), hydrocephalic treated with shunt (n = 10), hydrocephalic treated with shunt and memantine (20 mg/kg/day) (n = 10). Memantine administration was started on the day after hydrocephalus induction and continued until the last day of the experimental period, totaling 21 consecutive days of drug application. The CSF shunt surgery was performed seven days after hydrocephalus induction. Behavioral tests (open field, and modified Morris water maze), histological, and immunohistochemical evaluations were performed. Treatment with memantine resulted in significant improvement (p < 0.05) in sensorimotor development, preservation of spatial memory, reduction of astrocytic reaction in the corpus callosum, cortex, and germinal matrix. When associated with the shunt, it has also been shown to reduce the cell death cascade. It is concluded that memantine is a promising adjuvant drug with beneficial potential for the treatment of lesions secondary to hydrocephalus.

AB  - Chronic hyperammonemia alters membrane expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors subunits in hippocampus leading to impaired memory and learning. Increasing extracellular cGMP normalizes these alterations. However, it has not been studied whether hyperammonemia alters the function of AMPA and NMDA receptors. The aims of this work were: (1) assess if hyperammonemia alters AMPA and NMDA receptors function; (2) analyze if extracellular cGMP reverses these alterations. A multielectrode array device was used to stimulate Schaffer collaterals and record postsynaptic currents in the CA1 region in hippocampal slices from control and hyperammonemic rats and analyze different features of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Hyperammonemia reduces the amplitude and delays appearance of AMPA EPSPs, whereas increases amplitude, hyperpolarization, depolarization and desensitization area of the NMDA EPSPs. These alterations in AMPA and NMDA function are accentuated as the stimulation intensity increases. Adding extracellular cGMP reverses the alteration in amplitude in both, AMPA and NMDA EPSPs. In control slices extracellular cGMP decreases the AMPA and NMDA EPSPs amplitude and delays the response of neurons and the return to the resting potential at all stimulation intensities. In conclusion, hyperammonemia decreases the AMPA response, whereas increases the NMDA response and extracellular cGMP reverses these alterations.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the presence of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are primarily composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's main source of norepinephrine (NE), is one of the earliest regions to develop NFTs and experience neurodegeneration in AD. While LC-derived NE plays beneficial roles in cognition, emotion, locomotion, and the sleep-wake cycle, its impact on tau pathology is unclear. To explore this relationship, we administered intraperitoneal injections of either N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4), a selective neurotoxin for noradrenergic neurons, or reboxetine (RBX), a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, to decrease or increase NE levels, respectively, in early tau transgenic mice expressing mutant human P301L tau (ADLP(Tau)) for two months. Only the RBX-treated mice exhibited cognitive deficits, as evidenced by their performance in the Y-maze, novel object recognition, and contextual fear conditioning tests. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in the LC and hippocampus of the RBX-treated mice. Furthermore, neuronal apoptosis was observed in the hippocampal CA1 region of these mice. Western blotting showed that RBX injections led to the overactivation of tau kinases PKA and GSK3 beta, resulting in hyperphosphorylated tau, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairments. Consistent with these findings, human brain organoids exposed to higher NE concentrations also displayed elevated hyperphosphorylated tau and increased activity of the same tau kinases. These findings suggest that excessive NE exposure accelerates tau pathology by overactivating the tau kinases. Thus, modulating NE levels in the brain via the LC-NE system could be a potential therapeutic strategy for tau-related AD.

AB  - Selegiline, also known as L-deprenyl, and (2R)-1-(1-benzofuran-2-yl)-N-propylpentane-2-amine (BPAP) were found to induce enhancement of monoamine neurotransmission in low and very low doses. In addition, these enhancers may modify glutamatergic neurotransmission. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that under stress conditions, chronic treatment with enhancer drugs has a positive impact on the glutamatergic system and other parameters related to brain plasticity, stress-related systems, and anxiety behavior. We exposed male Wistar rats to a chronic mild stress procedure combined with chronic treatment with two synthetic enhancer drugs. The gene expression of GluR1, an AMPA receptor subunit was reduced by repeated treatment with deprenyl in the hippocampus and with both BPAP and deprenyl in the prefrontal cortex. A significant reduction of NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B expression was observed in the hippocampus but not in the pre-frontal cortex. Deprenyl treatment led to an enhancement of hippocampal BDNFmRNA concentrations in stress -exposed rats. Treatment with enhancer drugs failed to induce significant changes in stress hormone concen-trations or anxiety behavior. In conclusion, the present study in chronically stressed rats showed that concom-itant treatment with enhancer drugs did not provoke substantial neuroendocrine changes, but modified gene expression of selected parameters associated with brain plasticity. Observed changes may indicate a positive influence of enhancer drugs on brain plasticity, which is important for preventing negative consequences of chronic stress and enhancement of stress resilience. It may be suggested that the changes in glutamate receptor subunits induced by enhancer drugs are brain region-specific and not dose-related.

AB  - Chronic social stress is closed related to major depressive disorder, torturing millions of people and may destroy their lives. The prefrontal cortex is one of the core brain areas involved in pathological development and behavior changes in depression. CELF4 is a neuronal RNA-binding protein and plays an essential role in RNA processing. It is closely related to some neurological disorders, including seizures and neuroticism. Most recently, GWAS analysis indicates it is one of the significant genes associated with depression. Nonetheless, we are still unknown whether and how CELF4 gets involved in depression. Here, we reported that the protein and mRNA expression levels of CELF4 in the PFC were decreased in the CSDS depression model, as well as the spine number. Furthermore, we disturbed CELF4 expression in the PFC by using the AAV-shCELF4 virus. Unexpectedly, the spine number showed a decrease in PFC because of the impaired CELF4 expression, and the AAV-shCELF4 mice displayed depression-like behaviors. Our results suggest that CELF4 is critical for spine number and acts a critical role in depression-like behaviors of mice. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a common mental health challenge among women of reproductive age. Allopregnanolone (3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP; ALLO) mediated functional alterations of GABAA receptors (GABAA-R) are involved in PMDD pathogenesis, however, the specific mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of ALLO mediated GABAA-R alpha 4 in the pathophysiology of PMDD. Purpose: We determined whether the pathogenesis of PMDD is associated with ALLO mediated GABAA-R alpha 4 expression changes in different brain regions.Methods: Rat models of PMDD liver-qi invasion syndrome (PMDD-LIS) were established via the resident intruder paradigm. Behavioral changes of rats were assessed by aggressive behavior tests, EPM and OFT. The levels of progesterone and ALLO in serum as well as brain areas were determined by ELISA. Variations in GABAA-R alpha 4 levels in brain regions were assessed by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Medicated serum was used to interfere with rat hippocampal neurons, and changes in Cl- current were recorded through electrophysiology.Results: Premenstrual anxiety and irritability of PMDD-LIS patients can be simulated in PMDD-LIS rat models. Exogenous ALLO significantly improved the anxiety behaviors of PMDD-LIS rats. Changes in ALLO among different brain regions varied. GABAA-R alpha 4 expressions were low in the amygdala and abnormally high in the hippocampus, however, ALLO alleviated these deviations. Whole-cell patch clamp recording technique showed a weaker Cl- current intensity of PMDD-LIS rats, reduced neuroinhibitory functions and increased Cl- current intensity in the ALLO group drug serum intervention and enhanced emotional inhibition function. Conclusion: We established that ALLO regulation of the GABAA-R alpha 4 subunit in the amygdala and hippocampus is involved in PMDD-LIS pathogenesis.

AB  - Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are strictly controlled by plasma membrane transporters, the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, in which Ca2+ uptake is mediated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUc), while efflux occurs mainly through the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX). RNAseq database repository searches led us to identify the Nclx transcript as highly enriched in astrocytes when compared with neurons. To assess the role of NCLX in mouse primary culture astrocytes, we inhibited its function both pharmacologically or genetically. This resulted in re-shaping of cytosolic Ca2+ signaling and a metabolic shift that increased glycolytic flux and lactate secretion in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Interestingly, in vivo genetic deletion of NCLX in hippocampal astrocytes improved cognitive performance in behavioral tasks, whereas hippocampal neuron-specific deletion of NCLX impaired cognitive performance. These results unveil a role for NCLX as a novel modulator of astrocytic glucose metabolism, impacting on cognition.

AB  - KLS-13019, a novel devised cannabinoid-like compound, was explored for anti-inflammatory actions in dorsal root ganglion cultures relevant to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Time course studies with 3 mu M paclitaxel indicated > 1.9-fold increases in immunoreactive (IR) area for cell body GPR55 after 30 min as determined by high content imaging. To test for reversibility of paclitaxel-induced increases in GPR55, cultures were treated for 8 h with paclitaxel alone and then a dose response to KLS-13019 added for another 16 h. This "reversal" paradigm indicated established increases in cell body GPR55 IR areas were decreased back to control levels. Because GPR55 had previously reported inflammatory actions, IL-1 beta and NLRP3 (inflammasome-3 marker) were also measured in the "reversal" paradigm. Significant increases in all inflammatory markers were produced after 8 h of paclitaxel treatment alone that were reversed to control levels with KLS-13019 treatment. Accompanying studies using alamar blue indicated that decreased cellular viability produced by paclitaxel treatment was reverted back to control levels by KLS-13019. Similar studies conducted with lysophosphatidylinositol (GPR55 agonist) in DRG or hippocampal cultures demonstrated significant increases in neuritic GPR55, NLRP3 and IL-1 beta areas that were reversed to control levels with KLS-13019 treatment. Studies with a human GPR55-beta-arrestin assay in Discover X cells indicated that KLS-13019 was an antagonist without agonist activity. These studies indicated that KLS-13019 has anti-inflammatory properties mediated through GPR55 antagonist actions. Together with previous studies, KLS-13019 is a potent neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory cannabinoid with therapeutic potential for high efficacy treatment of neuropathic pain.

AB  - Recently, Parkin has been reported to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, amyloid beta oligomers WO), hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), also increase ER stress in neurons. Because a mutation in the Parkin gene is a well-known predominant cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkin has been well studied in PD but has not been well researched in AD. In this study, we investigated the role of MO-mediated Parkin associated with ER stress in AD. For AD-based research, we used MO treatments in mouse hippocampusderived HT-22 cells. We stably expressed Parkin in HT-22 cells to confirm the hypothesis and used siParkin for downregulation of Parkin expression. Moreover, using hippocampi from amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1/ Tau triple transgenic mice (3xTg-AD mice), which are used for AD models, we confirmed the relationship between ER stress and Parkin in vivo. We observed that ATF4 upregulated MO-increases in Parkin. Parkin overexpression aggravated ER stress in MO-treated HT-22 cells and the hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice. Parkin downregulation led to no significant change when compared to MO-treated cells. Moreover, Parkin-mediated ER stress was not related to oxidative stress. Our study indicates that MO-induced ATF4 upregulated Parkin levels and that Parkin increases ER stress as a positive feedback loop. Through this study, our findings provide a foundation for future studies on the specific mechanisms related to the role of Parkin in AD.

AB  - Epilepsy (SE) is a common and serious neurological disease. NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome participates in the pathogenesis of SE, while its underlying mechanism is still unclear. Here, we attempted to explore the mechanism of action of NLRP3 inflammasome in SE. SE mouse model was constructed by administration of kainic acid (KA). Astrocytes were treated with KA to mimic SE cell model. MCC950 (NLRP3 inhibitor) and Z-YVAD-FMK (Caspase-1 inhibitor) were used to treat astrocytes to inhibit the activity of NLRP3 and Caspase-1. Nissl staining was performed to examine the morphology of neuron. Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence staining were performed to assess protein expression. SE mouse model exhibited an increase of neuronal loss, and an up-regulation of Cleaved-Caspase-1, IL-1 beta and IL-18 in hippocampus. The levels of GFAP(+)ADK(+) cells were significantly increased in SE mice. MCC950 or Z-YVAD-FMK abolished these impacts conferred by KA in SE mice. Moreover, KA treatment enhanced the expression of NLRP3, Cleaved-Caspase-1, IL-1 beta and IL-18 in astrocytes, which was rescued by knockdown of NLRP3 or Caspase-1. Additionally, CREB, p-CREB, REST were up-regulated, and SP1 was down-regulated in the KA-treated SE mice and KA-treated astrocytes. Inhibition of NLRP3 or Caspase-1 rescued these proteins expression in KA-treated astrocytes. CREB or REST silencing reduced adenosine kinase (ADK) expression, while SP1 knockdown enhanced ADK expression in KA-treated astrocytes. In conclusion, NLRP3 inflammasome activation enhances ADK expression to accelerate SE in mice through regulating CREB/REST/SP1 signaling pathway. Thus, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome may be a treatment for SE.

AB  - Aging is a process of gradual decline in physical and cognitive function and is a major risk factor for mortality. Despite the increasing number of relevant studies, the mechanisms regulating the aging process have not been fully elucidated. Genetic factors have long been recognized as key factors in controlling the rate of aging. Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) has been shown to be involved in the regulation of embryonic development and intestinal homeostasis, but its role in the regulation of aging remains unclear. Here, we showed that TSP50 expression was reduced in the hippocampus of both aged humans and mice. TSP50 deficiency in neural stem cells (NSCs) drove accelerated aging in mice, characterized by exacerbated age-related cognitive impairments and significantly elevated neuroinflammation. Notably, aged mice with NSCs-specific knockout of TSP50 exhibited impaired intestinal mucosal barriers, dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and a marked reduction in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Restoring gut microbial ecology using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and overexpressing TSP50 successfully alleviated aging-associated cognitive decline and neuroinflammation. Taken together, our study suggests that TSP50 plays a critical role in the aging process and identifies gut microbiota as a pivotal mediator of TSP50's influence on age-related cognitive decline and neuroinflammation. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic value of targeting TSP50 and gut microbiota for aging, offering insights into aging mechanisms and interventions for aging-related neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formed via glycation reactions negatively impact skin health by diminishing barrier function and elasticity and causing dullness. This study systematically evaluated the inhibitory and degradative capabilities of 24 cosmetic ingredients against AGEs using BSA-glucose and ELISA-based screening systems. We identified 21 ingredients that inhibit fluorescent AGEs, 22 that degrade AGEs-collagen crosslinks, and 19 with both properties. Further investigation of six key ingredients, including freeze-dried Rosa rugosa powder (Rosa rugosa cv. Plena) and freeze-dried Camellia sinensis flower powder (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze), revealed their notable ability to degrade AGEs monomers and dimers. Freeze-dried Rosa rugosa powder achieved a 19% inhibition rate in an MGO-induced HDFs glycation model. Our findings provide valuable insights for selecting anti-glycation agents and developing effective anti-glycation products.

AB  - Shati/Nat8l was identified as an upregulated molecule in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice following repeated methamphetamine administration. Region-specific roles of this molecule are associated with psychiatric disorders. In the present study, we examined the importance of Shati/Nat8l in the hippocampus because of its high expression in this region. Mice with a hippocampus-specific knockdown of Shati/Nat8l (hippocampal ShaticKD) were prepared by the microinjection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors carrying Cre into the hippocampus of Shati/Nat8lflox/flox mice, and their phenotypes were investigated. Drastic reduction in the expression and function of Shati/Nat8l in the hippocampus was observed in Shati-cKD mice. These mice exhibited cognitive dysfunction in behavioral experiments and impaired the electrophysiological response to the stimuli, which elicits long-term potentiation. Shati/Nat8l in the hippocampus is suggested to possibly play an important role in synaptic plasticity to maintain cognitive function. This molecule could be a therapeutic target for hippocampus-related disorders such as dementia.

AB  - Assisted reproductive technologies are playing an ever-increasing role in the management of ex situ rhinoceros populations. Traditionally, sperm collection in rhinos is conducted via electroejaculation (EEJ) or gamete rescue. Sperm collection via urethral catheterization (UC) is gaining popularity in wildlife reproductive sciences as it requires less specialized equipment, is faster, and less stimulatory than EEJ. This study investigated the use of UC to collect sperm from Southern white (Ceratotherium simum simum; n = 3) and Eastern black (Diceros bicornis michaeli; n = 6) rhinoceros as an alternative or complementary to collection via EEJ. UC samples (n = 14) exhibited high sperm concentration (1.6 f 0.49 x109 sperm/mL) and low volume (0.98 f 0.26 mL). Samples obtained via EEJ (n = 11) were of moderate sperm concentration (0.14 f 0.05 x10(9) sperm/mL) and high volume (30.6 f 7.2 mL). UC samples were processed for cryopreservation in OptiXcell extender. Motility of UC sperm decreased post-thaw (56 f 2.4%) over pre-freeze (77.1 f 3.2%; P < 0.05), with longevity data consistent to prior results published for sperm collected via EEJ. These results suggest sperm quality and cryo-survival are not impacted by the collection method. Since EEJ was conducted after UC, sperm parameters could not be compared between the two methods. Results indicate that UC is a viable alternative to EEJ for sperm collection in rhinoceros.

AB  - Sepsis, defined as a dysregulated host immune response to infection, is a common and dangerous clinical syndrome. The excessive host inflammatory response can induce immediate and persistent cognitive decline, which can be worse in older individuals. Sex-specific differences in the outcome of infectious diseases and sepsis appear to favor females. We employed a murine model to examine the influence of age and sex on the brain's microRNA (miR) response following sepsis. Young and old mice of both sexes underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with daily restraint stress. Expression of hippocampal miR was examined in age- and sex-matched controls at 1 and 4 days post-CLP. Few miR were modified in a similar manner across age or sex and these few miR were generally associated with neuroprotection against inflammation. Similar to previous work examining transcription, young females exhibited a better recovery of the miR profile from day 1 to day 4, relative to young males and old females. For young males and all female groups, the initial response mainly involved a decrease in miR expression. In contrast, old males exhibited only upregulated miR on day 1 and day 4 and many of the miR upregulated on day 1 and day 4 were linked to neurodegeneration, increased neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. The results emphasize age and sex differences in epigenetic mechanisms that likely contribute to susceptibility or resilience to cognitive impairment due to sepsis.

AB  - Reproductive biotechnologies are widely consolidated as a methodology in cattle breeding and have an important impact on the genetic improvement of cattle herds. Semen is an important source of dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms during reproductive procedures. To ensure the sanitary quality of the semen, it is essential to consider the presence of various microorganisms including viruses. One of the main viral agents of reproductive interest is Bovine Alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), the etiological agent responsible for bovine rhinotracheitis and vulvovaginitis and frequently associated with reproductive efficiency of matrices and bulls. In artificial insemination centers, semen treatment is generally based only on the use of antibiotics, ignoring the possibility of inactivating other non-bacterial infectious agents. In this context, photodisinfection emerges as a promising alternative to inactivate a wide range of microorganisms, offering a complementary or substitution approach to those conventional semen treatment methods. In this work, we evaluated the use of four halogenated sulfonated porphyrins as potential photosensitizers (PSs) for photodynamic inactivation of Bovine Alphaherpesvirus I (BoHV-1) for bovine semen disinfection. The PSs were synthesized and photophysical parameters, such as UV-Vis absorption spectra and singlet oxygen quantum yield (Phi(Delta)) were presented. Photoinactivation of BoHV-1 was first shown in cell culture and then confirmed in artificially infected bovine semen and then the phototoxicity of PSs against spermatozoa was evaluated. All PSs were effective in BoHV-1 inactivation; however, the photosensitizer containing two chlorine atoms, showed to be more efficient due to the shorter time required for complete viral inactivation. The slight alterations in sperm kinetics were observed, but remained within those acceptable by regulatory agencies for animal reproduction. Although the methodology used in this work only included bovine semen, we emphasize that the proposed photodisinfection methodology can be adapted and applied to a wide range of biological materials and microorganisms of animal or human interest.

AB  - Previous evidence shows that rapid changes occur in the brain following spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we interrogated the expression of the neuropeptides pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), vasoactive intestinal peptides (VIP), and their binding receptors in the rat brain 24 h following SCI. Female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent thoracic laminectomy; half of the rats received a mild contusion injury at the level of the T10 vertebrate (SCI group); the other half underwent sham surgery (sham group). Twenty-four hours post-surgery, the hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus (dorsal and ventral), prefrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray were collected. PACAP, VIP, PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2 mRNA and protein levels were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. In SCI rats, PACAP expression was increased in the hypothalamus (104-141% vs sham) and amygdala (138-350%), but downregulated in the thalamus (35-95%) and periaqueductal gray (58-68%). VIP expression was increased only in the thalamus (175-385%), with a reduction in the amygdala (51-68%), hippocampus (40-75%), and periaqueductal gray (74-76%). The expression of the PAC1 receptor was the least disturbed by SCI, with decrease expression in the ventral hippocampus (63-68%) only. The expression levels of VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors were globally reduced, with more prominent reductions of VPAC1 vs VPAC2 in the amygdala (21-70%) and ventral hippocampus (72-75%). In addition, VPAC1 downregulation also extended to the dorsal hippocampus (69-70%). These findings demonstrate that as early as 24 h post-SCI, there are region-specific disruptions of PACAP, VIP, and related receptor transcript and protein levels in supraspinal regions controlling higher cognitive functions.

AB  - The combination and integration of multimodal imaging and clinical markers have introduced numerous classifiers to improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting and predicting AD; however, many studies cannot ensure the homogeneity of data sets and consistency of results. In our study, the XGBoost algorithm was used to classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal control (NC) populations through five rs-fMRI analysis datasets. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to analyze the interpretability of the model. The highest accuracy for diagnosing MCI was 65.14% (using the mPerAF dataset). The characteristics of the left insula, right middle frontal gyrus, and right cuneus correlated positively with the output value using DC datasets. The characteristics of left cerebellum 6, right inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part, and vermis 6 correlated positively with the output value using fALFF datasets. The characteristics of the right middle temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left temporal pole, and middle temporal gyrus correlated positively with the output value using mPerAF datasets. The characteristics of the right middle temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and left hippocampus correlated positively with the output value using PerAF datasets. The characteristics of left cerebellum 9, vermis 9, and right precentral gyrus, right amygdala, and left middle occipital gyrus correlated positively with the output value using Wavelet-ALFF datasets. We found that the XGBoost algorithm constructed from rs-fMRI data is effective for the diagnosis and classification of MCI. The accuracy rates obtained by different rs-fMRI data analysis methods are similar, but the important features are different and involve multiple brain regions, which suggests that MCI may have a negative impact on brain function.

AB  - Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common mental disorder in stroke survivors. However, its specific pathophysiology remains largely unknown. Previous studies suggested a role of hippocampus in PSD. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the lipid metabolic signatures in hippocampus of PSD rats. Here, the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was used to identify the lipid metabolic signatures in the hippocampus of PSD, control and stroke rats. Then, correlations between behavior indices and differential lipid metabolites in PSD rats were explored. Pathway and enrichment analysis were further conducted to uncover the crucial metabolic pathways related to PSD. Finally, we found that the lipid metabolic phenotype in hippocampus of PSD rats was substantially different from that in control and stroke rats, and identified 50 key lipid metabolites that were significantly decreased in PSD rats. These differential metabolites were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Meanwhile, the sucrose preference and immobility time were found to be significantly positively and negatively, respectively, correlated with glycerophospholipid metabolites. The pathway and enrichment analysis showed that the glycerophospholipid metabolism, especially cardiolipin metabolism, was significantly disturbed in PSD rats. These results suggested that the down-regulated glycerophospholipids in hippocampus, especially cardiolipin, might participate in the pathophysiology of PSD. Our findings would be helpful for future exploring the pathophysiology of PSD.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether ovarian fragmentation for follicular activation (OFFA) improves ovarian reserve markers and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in women with poor ovarian response (POR).
   Design: Randomized, controlled trial, with parallel assignment. Setting: University hospital.
   Patient(s): Thirty-four women with POR according to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology criteria. Intervention(s): Women with POR were randomly allocated to receive ovarian fragmentation in 1 ovary or to no intervention (control group). Ovarian reserve markers were followed at 2-week intervals for 6 months. In vitro fertilization cycles were initiated when the antral follicle count (AFC) doubled or at the end of follow-up.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): The primary outcome was the number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes obtained. Antral follicle count, anti-mullerian hormone level, and reproductive outcomes were recorded as secondary outcomes. Exploratory outcomes included surgical results and analysis of protein and gene expression.
   Result(s): Ovarian fragmentation for follicular activation resulted in an increase inAFC in the intervention ovary compared with the control ovary and an increase in total AFC in the OFFA group compared with controls. Serumanti mullerian hormone and follicle-stimulating-hormone levels did not improve in the OFFA group throughout the follow-up period. Fifteen patients from each arm underwent IVF. In the control group, 33 MII oocytes were retrieved and 18 embryo transfers were performed, with a 20% pregnancy rate and an 18.7% live birth rate per cycle. In the OFFA group, 23 MII oocytes were retrieved and 11 embryo transfers were performed, with a 13.3% pregnancy rate and a 6.7% live birth rate per cycle. Reproductive outcomes did not significantly differ between the groups. Hippo pathway inhibition was confirmed by an 18.8% reduction in the phospho-YAP/YAP (Yes-associated protein 1) ratio and BIRC and CCN overexpression after fragmentation.
   Conclusion(s): Ovarian fragmentation for follicular activation in women with POR resulted in an increase in AFC but did not modify IVF outcomes when compared with controls.

AB  - Objective: We studied the role of the P2X7 receptor on cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of schizophrenia. Methods: An adult mouse model was established by treatment with phencyclidine (PCP), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Young mice were divided into three groups: 1) the control (saline-injected) group; 2) experimental 5 mg/kg PCP-injected group; and 3) experimental 10 mg/kg PCP-injected group. The mice were subjected to the open-field and Morris water maze tests at 7 weeks. After intraperitoneal injection of the P2X7 receptor antagonist JNJ-47965567, the behaviour tests were performed again. Samples were taken after testing. The P2X7 receptor protein and mRNA expression levels were detected by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and PCR. Results: This study revealed that the infant sub-chronic PCP mice model showed severe spatial learning and memory impairment in the Morris water maze and schizophrenia-like symptoms (hypermotor behaviour) in the open-field test. The P2X7 receptor protein was highly expressed in the sub-chronic PCP mouse model and more highly expressed in the hippocampus than the prefrontal lobe. After the P2X7 receptor was blocked with JNJ-47965567, P2X7 receptor protein and mRNA expression in the frontal lobe were significantly increased, and the spatial memory impairment and hypermotor behaviour induced by PCP were reversed. Conclusion: PCP-induced cognitive impairment can be significantly improved by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor. Therefore, we believe that the P2X7 receptor plays an important role in the cognition of schizophrenic-like mice.

AB  - Advanced age increases the risk of severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as incidence of long COVID and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We hypothesized that perturbations in the aged antiviral CD8(+) T cell response predisposes elderly individuals to severe coronavirus infection, re-infection, and postinfectious cognitive sequelae. Using MHV-A59 as a murine model of respiratory coronavirus, we found that aging increased CNS infection and lethality to MHV infection. This was coupled with increased CD8(+) T cells within the aged CNS but reduced antigen specificity. Aged animals also displayed a decreased proportion of CD103(+) resident memory cells (T-RM), which correlated with increased severity of secondary viral challenge. Using a reciprocal adoptive transfer paradigm, data show that not only were fewer aged CD8(+) T cells retained within the adult brain post-infection, but also that adult CD8(+) cells expressed lower levels of T-RM marker CD103 when in the aged microenvironment. Furthermore, aged animals demonstrated spatial learning impairment following MHV infection, which worsened in both aged and adult animals following secondary viral challenge. Spatial learning impairment was accompanied by increased TUNEL positivity in hippocampal neurons, suggestive of neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, primary cell coculture showed that activated CD8(+) T cells induced TUNEL positivity in neurons, independent of antigen-specificity. Altogether, these results show that non-antigen specific CD8(+) T cells are recruited to the aged brain and cause broad neuronal death without establishing a T-RM phenotype that confers lasting protection against a secondary infection.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents one of the primary liver malignancies with poor prognosis. RHNO1, which implicated in the ATR-CHK1 signaling pathway thus functions in the DNA replication stress response. However, the role and molecular mechanisms of RHNO1 in HCC remain largely elusive. Here, we imply that RHNO1 is elevated in HCC tumor tissues and that high expression of RHNO1 predicts poor prognosis of HCC patients. Moreover, RHNO1 mRNA, especially protein levels were significantly increased in most HCC cells. Knockdown of RHNO1 through small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) inhibited the proliferation and triggered cell apoptosis of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we find that RHNO1 deficiency confers apoptosis via mitochondrial-mediated pathway. Mechanistically, silencing of RHNO1 impeded HCC proliferation and induced apoptosis by inactivating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Overall, these findings unravel that RHNO1 functions as an oncogene in HCC, and involved in regulating mitochondrial apoptosis to promote HCC thus may serve as a therapeutic and diagnostic target for HCC.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We investigated oxidative stress and antioxidant response in the p62/Sqstm1-Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in C57BL/6 mice cochleae during age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), and the function of full-length and variant p62 in the regulation of Nrf2 activation. Groups of young (2 months), old (13-14 months), control, and acoustic trauma (AT) mice were examined cochlear damage and oxidative stress as follows: auditory brainstem response and hair cell counts; malondialdehyde (MDA) levels measured by assay kit and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) detected by immunohistochemistry. Full-length and variant p62 were examined for expression in cochleae, hippocampus (HIP), and auditory cortex (AC) using immunoblotting. Keap1-Nrf2 pathway activation was based on immunoblotting of nuclear Nrf2 and quantitative real-time PCR of Nrf2 target genes HO-1/NQO-1. The oxidative function of full-length and variant p62 was examined in HEI-OC-1 cells by flow cytometry. The results showed hearing loss, and cochlear hair cell loss was associated with MDA accumulation and 8-oxoG expression during ARHL and NIHL. Nrf2 showed no obvious changes in nuclear protein. Expression levels mRNA for HO-1 and NQO1 were lower in old mice and mildly greater in AT Mice. The expression of p62 splicing variant lacking the Keap1-interacting region was greater than full-length p62 in cochleae. However, the expression of p62 splicing variant was lesser than full-length p62 in HIP and AC. For HEI-OC-1 cells, overexpression of full-length p62 decreased ROS levels induced by H2O2. Oxidative stress is closely related to ARHL and NIHL. Changing the ratio of full-length to variant p62 protein expression may be a new target to reduce the level of oxidative stress in cochleae.

AB  - Previous research has found that an adaptive response to ferroptosis involving glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is triggered after intracerebral hemorrhage. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying adaptive responses to ferroptosis. To explore the mechanisms underlying adaptive responses to ferroptosis after intracerebral hemorrhage, we used hemin-treated HT22 cells to mimic brain injury after hemorrhagic stroke in vitro to evaluate the antioxidant enzymes and performed bioinformatics analysis based on the mRNA sequencing data. Further, we determined the expression of GSTO2 in hemin-treated hippocampal neurons and in a mouse model of hippocampus-intracerebral hemorrhage (h-ICH) by using Western blot. After hemin treatment, the antioxidant enzymes GPX4, Nrf2, and glutathione (GSH) were upregulated, suggesting that an adaptive response to ferroptosis was triggered. Furthermore, we performed mRNA sequencing to explore the underlying mechanism, and the results showed that 2234 genes were differentially expressed. Among these, ten genes related to ferroptosis (Acsl1, Ftl1, Gclc, Gclm, Hmox1, Map1lc3b, Slc7a11, Slc40a1, Tfrc, and Slc39a14) were altered after hemin treatment. In addition, analysis of the data retrieved from the GO database for the ten targeted genes showed that 20 items on biological processes, 17 items on cellular components, and 19 items on molecular functions were significantly enriched. Based on the GO data, we performed GSEA and found that the glutathione metabolic process was significantly enriched in the hemin phenotype. Notably, the expression of glutathione S-transferase omega (GSTO2), which is involved in glutathione metabolism, was decreased after hemin treatment, and overexpression of Gsto2 decreased lipid reactive oxygen species level in hemin-exposed HT22 cells. In addition, the expression of GSTO2 was also decreased in a mouse model of hippocampus-intracerebral hemorrhage (h-ICH). The decreased expression of GSTO2 in the glutathione metabolic process may be involved in ferroptotic neuronal injury following hemorrhagic stroke.

AB  - BackgroundTripartite motif (TRIM46) is a relatively novel protein that belongs to tripartite motif family. TRIM46 organizes parallel microtubule arrays on the axons, which are important for neuronal polarity and axonal function. TRIM46 is highly expressed in the brain, but its biological function in adults has not yet been determined.ResultsTrim46 knockout (KO) rat line was established using CRISPR/cas9. Trim46 KO rats had smaller hippocampus sizes, fewer neuronal dendritic arbors and dendritic spines, and shorter and more distant axon initial segment. Furthermore, the protein interaction between endogenous TRIM46 and FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) in brain tissues was determined; Trim46 KO increased hippocampal FKBP5 protein levels and decreased hippocampal protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha1 (GABRA1) and glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 1 (NMDAR1) protein levels. Trim46 KO rats exhibited hypoactive behavioral changes such as reduced spontaneous activity, social interaction, sucrose preference, impaired prepulse inhibition (PPI), and short-term reference memory.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate the significant impact of Trim46 KO on brain structure and behavioral function. This study revealed a novel potential association of TRIM46 with dendritic development and neuropsychiatric behavior, providing new insights into the role of TRIM46 in the brain.

AB  - Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is considered to be one of the major mechanism in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Increased inflammatory cells, particularly microglia, often parallel hypoperfusion-induced gray matter damage such as hippocampal lesions, but the exact mechanism remains largely unknown. To understand the pathological mechanisms, we analyzed hippocampus-specific transcriptome profiles after cerebral hypoperfusion. The mouse hypoperfusion model was induced by employing the 0.16/0.18 mm bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) procedure. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed after 3-week hypoperfusion. Pathological changes were evaluated via hematoxylin staining and immunofluorescence staining. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed using RNA samples of sham- or BCAS-operated mice, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation. We found that the 0.16/0.18 mm BCAS induced decreased CBF, hippocampal neuronal loss, and microglial activation. Furthermore, GSEA between sham and BCAS mice showed activation of interferon-beta signaling along with inflammatory immune responses. In addition, integrative analysis with published single-cell RNA-seq revealed that up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in a distinct cell type of "microglia," and down-regulated DEGs were enriched in "CA1 pyramidal," not in "interneurons" or "S1 pyramidal." This database of transcriptomic profiles of BCAS-hypoperfusion will be useful for future studies to explore potential targets for vascular cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Skin dryness, fine lines and wrinkles, red spots, red vasculature, and porphyrin count are common indicators of skin health and beauty. The skincare system in this study contains scientifically validated ingredients such as fermented green tea (Camellia sinensis) water, niacinamide, antioxidants, and a variety of natural plant extracts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this skincare system in improving facial-skin health and beauty. Twenty-six healthy adults, both female and male, aged 18-54 and of all skin types and tones, were included in the study and participated as either the active or the control group (competitor product) using designated topical products for 30 days. Skin moisture, fine lines and wrinkles, porphyrin count, red spots, and red vasculature count were measured through high-quality photography, Visia (R) complexion analysis, FitSkin (R) skin analysis, and survey questions on day 0, day 8, and day 30. Significant improvements were observed in facial moisture, red-spot count, red vasculature count, and porphyrin count on day 30 in comparison with the control group. Non-significant improvements were observed in pores, skin texture, and wrinkles. With extensive well-documented functional ingredients, the studied skincare system used daily may significantly improve key areas of skin health and beauty.

AB  - Observational epidemiological studies have associated vitamin D deficiency with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether vitamin D deficiency would result in some impacts on the vitamin D binding receptor (VDR) remains to be characterized in AD. Vitamin D helps maintain adult brain health genomically through binding with and activating a VDR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) transcriptional complex. Thus, we investigated the role of VDR in AD using postmortem human brains, APP/PS1 mice, and cell cultures. Intriguingly, although vitamin D was decreased in AD patients and mice, hippocampal VDR levels were inversely increased. The abnormally increased levels of VDR were found to be colocalized with A beta plaques, gliosis and autophagosomes, implicating a non-genomic activation of VDR in AD pathogenesis. Mechanistic investigation revealed that A beta upregulated VDR without its canonical ligand vitamin D and switched its heterodimer binding-partner from RXR to p53. The VDR/p53 complex localized mostly in the cytosol, increased neuronal autophagy and apoptosis. Chemically inhibiting p53 switched VDR back to RXR, reversing amyloidosis and cognitive impairment in AD mice. These results suggest a non-genomic rewiring of VDR to p53 is key for the progression of AD, and thus VDR/p53 pathway might be targeted to treat people with AD.

AB  - Polarity is a feature of life. In higher plants, non-autonomous polarity is largely directed by auxin, the morphogen that drives its own polarized flow, Polar Auxin Transport (PAT), to guide patterning events such as phyllotaxis and tropism. The plasma membrane-localized PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers are rate-limiting factors in PAT. In yeasts and metazoans, the STE20 kinases are key players in cell polarity. We had previously characterized SIK1 as a STE20/Hippo orthologue in Arabidopsis and confirmed its function in mitotic exit and organ growth. Here we explore the possible link between SIK1, auxin, PIN, and polarity. Abnormal phyllotaxis and gravitropism were observed in sik1. sik1 was more sensitive to exogenous auxin in primary root elongation and lateral root emergence. RNA-Seq revealed reduced expression in auxin biosynthesis genes and induced expression of auxin flux carriers in sik1. However, normal tissue-and sub-cellular localization patterns of PIN1 and PIN2 were observed in sik1. The dark-induced vacuolar degradation of PIN2 also appeared normal in sik1. An additive phenotype was observed in the sik1 pin1 double mutant, indicating that SIK1 does not directly regulate PIN1. The polarity defects of sik1 are hence unlikely mediated by PINs and await future exploration.

AB  - Purpose There is increasing evidence that the ovarian extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in follicle development. The rigidity of the cortical ECM limits expansion of the follicle and consequently oocyte maturation, maintaining the follicle in its quiescent state. Quiescent primordial, primary, and secondary follicles still exist in primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) patients, and techniques as in vitro activation (IVA) and drug-free IVA have recently been developed aiming to activate these follicles based on the Hippo signaling disruption that is essential in mechanotransduction. In this context, we analyze the effect of drug-free IVA in POI patients, comparing the relationship between possible resumption ovarian function and biomechanical properties of ovarian tissue.
   Methods Nineteen POI patients according to ESHRE criteria who underwent drug-free IVA by laparoscopy between January 2018 and December 2019 and were followed up for a year after the intervention. A sample of ovarian cortex taken during the intervention was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in order to quantitatively measure tissue stiffness (Young's elastic modulus, E) at the micrometer scale. Functional outcomes after drug-free were analyzed.
   Results Resumption of ovarian function was observed in 10 patients (52.6%) and two of them became pregnant with live births. There were no differences in clinical characteristics (age and duration of amenorrhea) and basal hormone parameters (FSH and AMH) depending on whether or not there was activation after surgery. However, ovarian cortex stiffness was significantly greater in patients with ovarian activity after drug-free IVA: median E = 5519 Pa (2260-11,296) vs 1501 (999-3474); p-value < 0.001.
   Conclusions Biomechanical properties of ovarian cortex in POI patients have a great variability, and higher ovarian tissue stiffness entails a more favorable status when drug-free IVA is applied in their treatment. This status is probably related to an ovary with more residual follicles, which would explain a greater possibility of ovarian follicular reactivations after treatment.

AB  - Hippocampal ripple oscillations have been implicated in important cognitive functions such as memory consolidation and planning. Multiple computational models have been proposed to explain the emergence of ripple oscillations, relying either on excitation or inhibition as the main pacemaker. Nevertheless, the generating mechanism of ripples remains unclear. An interesting dynamical feature of experimentally measured ripples, which may advance model selection, is intra-ripple frequency accommodation (IFA): a decay of the instantaneous ripple frequency over the course of a ripple event. So far, only a feedback-based inhibition-first model, which relies on delayed inhibitory synaptic coupling, has been shown to reproduce IFA. Here we use an analytical mean-field approach and numerical simulations of a leaky integrate-and-fire spiking network to explain the mechanism of IFA. We develop a drift-based approximation for the oscillation dynamics of the population rate and the mean membrane potential of interneurons under strong excitatory drive and strong inhibitory coupling. For IFA, the speed at which the excitatory drive changes is critical. We demonstrate that IFA arises due to a speed-dependent hysteresis effect in the dynamics of the mean membrane potential, when the interneurons receive transient, sharp wave-associated excitation. We thus predict that the IFA asymmetry vanishes in the limit of slowly changing drive, but is otherwise a robust feature of the feedback-based inhibition-first ripple model.
   The hippocampus plays a central role in the acquisition and consolidation of explicit memories. During sleep or rest, hippocampal neurons replay recently acquired memories, while the neuronal network exhibits high-frequency oscillations, so-called ripples. To study the potential function of ripples, their generation mechanism needs to be clarified. Here we analyze a model network of inhibitory interneurons as a potential ripple pacemaker. We derive an analytical approximation of the ripple dynamics that explains why the ripple frequency tends to decay over the course of an event (intra-ripple frequency accommodation, IFA). Studying dynamical phenomena such as IFA advances model selection and enables an understanding of how rhythmic brain activity contributes to cognitive functions.

AB  - SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a was previously shown to be neuroprotective in murine ischemic stroke models. In this study, we further examined the efficacy of four ZT-1a derivatives (ZT-1c, -1d, -1g and -1h) on reducing strokeinduced sensorimotor function impairment and brain lesions. Vehicle control (Veh) or ZT-1 derivatives were administered via osmotic pump to adult C57BL/6J mice during 3-21 h post-stroke. Neurological behavior of these mice was assessed at days 1, 3, 5, and 7 post-stroke and MRI T2WI and DTI analysis was subsequently conducted in ex vivo brains. Veh-treated stroke mice displayed sensorimotor function deficits compared to Sham mice. In contrast, mice receiving ZT-1a derivatives displayed significantly lower neurological deficits at days 3-7 post-stroke (p < 0.05), with ZT-1a, ZT-1c and ZT-1d showing greater impact than ZT-1h and ZT-1g. ZT-1a treatment was the most effective in reducing brain lesion volume on T2WI and in preserving NeuN + neurons (p < 0.01), followed by ZT-1d > -1c > -1g > -1h. The Veh-treated stroke mice displayed white matter tissue injury, reflected by reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) or axial diffusivity (AD) values in external capsule, internal capsule and hippocampus. In contrast, only ZT-1a-as well as ZT-1c-treated stroke mice exhibited significantly higher FA and AD values. These findings demonstrate that post-stroke administration of SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a and its derivatives (ZT-1c and ZT-1d) is effective in protecting gray and white matter tissues in ischemic brains, showing a potential for ischemic stroke therapy development.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe disease of unknown pathogenesis with a lifetime prevalence of similar to 10%. Therapy requires prolonged treatment that often fails. We have previously demonstrated that ceramide levels in the blood plasma of patients and in mice with experimental MDD are increased. Neutralization of blood plasma ceramide prevented experimental MDD in mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that blood plasma ceramide accumulated in endothelial cells of the hippocampus, inhibited phospholipase D (PLD) and thereby decreased phosphatidic acid in the hippocampus. Here, we demonstrate that phosphatidic acid binds to and controls the activity of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP1B) in the hippocampus and thus determines tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of cellular proteins including TrkB. Injection of PLD, phosphatidic acid, or inhibition of PTP1B abrogated MDD and normalized cellular tyrosine phosphorylation, including phosphorylation of TrkB and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Most importantly, these treatments also rapidly normalized behavior of mice with experimental MDD. Since phosphatidic acid binds to and inhibits PTP1B, the lack of phosphatidic acid results in increased activity of PTP1B and thereby in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB and other cellular proteins. Thus, our data indicate a novel pathogenetic mechanism of and a rapidly acting targeted treatment for MDD.

AB  - Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) are valuable tools that can be used for a better understanding of molecular mimicry and the immunological network. In this work, we showed a new application of a phage-displayed alpha-type Ab2 (Ab2 alpha) to improve the sensitivity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detecting cya-nobacterial toxin microcystin-LR (MC-LR). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) against MC-LR was used as an antigen to isolate binders in a camelid nanobody library. After three rounds of panning, three unique clones with strong binding against anti-MC-LR mAbs were isolated. These clones could specifically bind to anti-MC-LR mAbs without influencing mAbs binding with MC-LR, meaning these clones were Ab2 alpha s. Based on the signal ampli-fication effect of phage coat proteins and the non-competitive nature of Ab2 alpha, a novel competitive ELISA method for MC-LR was established with a phage-displayed Ab2 alpha. It showed that the phage-displayed Ab2 alpha greatly enhanced the ELISA signal and sensitivity of the method was improved 3.5-fold to the conventional one. Combining with the optimization of pre-incubation time, the optimized ELISA decreased its limit of detection (LOD) from 4.5 ng/mL to 0.8 ng/mL (5.6-fold improvement). This new application of Ab2 alpha may potentially be employed to improve the sensitivity of immunoassays for other environmental pollutants.

AB  - Background: Ischemic stroke may trigger neuroplastic changes via proliferation, migration towards the lesion, and differentiation of neuroprogenitor cells into mature neurons. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) may promote brain plasticity. This study aimed to assess rTMS's effect on post-stroke endogenous neuroplasticity by dosing plasma miRs 17 similar to 92, Netrin-1, Sema3A, and BDNF. Methods: In this case-controlled study, we randomized 19 ischemic stroke patients within five days from symptoms onset (T0) to neuronavigated-rTMS or sham stimulation. Stimulation was applied on the stroke hemisphere daily between the 7th and 14th day from stroke onset. Blood samples were collected at T0, before the first rTMS section (T7), and at the end of the last rTMS session (T14). Five healthy controls were also enrolled in this study. Results: Of 19 patients, 10 received rTMS and 9 sham stimulation. Compared with the sham group, in the rTMS group, plasma levels of miRs17 similar to 92 and Ntn-1 significantly increased whereas Sema3A levels tended to decrease. In multivariate linear regression analyses, rTMS was independently related to Ntn-1 and miR-25 levels at T14. Conclusions: We found an association between rTMS and neurogenesis/axonogenesis biomarker enhancement. Our preliminary data suggest that rTMS may positively interfere with natural endogenous plasticity phenomena of the post-ischemic human brain.

AB  - Neurofeedback (NF) shows promise in enhancing memory, but its application to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) still needs to be studied. Therefore, we aimed to develop an NF system for the memory function of the MTL and examine neural activity changes and memory task score changes through NF training. We created a memory NF system using intracranial electrodes to acquire and visualise the neural activity of the MTL during memory encoding. Twenty trials of a tug-of-war game per session were employed for NF and designed to control neural activity bidirectionally (Up/Down condition). NF training was conducted with three patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and we observed an increasing difference in NF signal between conditions (Up-Down) as NF training progressed. Similarities and negative correlation tendencies between the transition of neural activity and the transition of memory function were also observed. Our findings demonstrate NF's potential to modulate MTL activity and memory encoding. Future research needs further improvements to the NF system to validate its effects on memory functions. Nonetheless, this study represents a crucial step in understanding NF's application to memory and provides valuable insights into developing more efficient memory enhancement strategies.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia in the United States and the world. The pathophysiology of AD is complex and multifaceted. Accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are hallmarks of AD. The aggregation of amyloid beta (senile plaques) and tau tangles (NFTs) results in the death of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, which manifests itself in cognitive decline and memory loss. Current therapies rely on conventional approaches that have only treated the underlying symptoms without disease modification. Data from clinical studies point to a complex role of amyloid beta (A beta) in a way that enhances the tau phenotype throughout the disease process. To address the co-pathogenic role of A beta and tau, we undertook development of multitarget compounds aiming at both tau and A beta to slow or stop disease progression and provide neuroprotection. Here, we demonstrate a dose-dependent effect of the novel test compounds that inhibit aggregation of AcPHF6 (a shorter version of tau protein) and A beta(1-42) peptides in thioflavin T fluorescent assays. The compounds were also shown to disaggregate preformed aggregates dose dependently. To further validate these findings, circular dichroism experiments were carried out to examine the nature of inhibition. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy experiments were carried out to gain insights into the morphologies of aggregates obtained from dose-dependent inhibition of AcPHF6 and A beta(1-42) as well as dissociation of preformed aggregates from these peptides. Compounds D-687 and D-688 reversed A beta(1-42) induced toxicity in SH-SH5Y cells, significantly demonstrating neuroprotective properties. Finally, in a study with Drosophila melanogaster expressing human tau protein isoform (2N4R) in all the neurons, compound D-688 significantly increased the survival of flies compared to vehicle treated controls. Future studies will further examine the neuroprotective properties of these lead compounds in various animal models.

AB  - "Runner's high" refers to a momentary sense of pleasure that suddenly appears during running or other exercise activities, characterized by anti-anxiety, pain relief, and other symptoms. The neurobiological mechanism of "runner's high" is unclear. This review summarizes human and animal models for studying "runner 's high", analyzes the neurotransmitters and neural circuits involved in runner's high, and elucidates the evidence and shortcomings of researches related to "runner's high". This review also provides prospects for future research. Research has found that exercise lasting more than 30 min and with an intensity exceeding 70% of the maximum heart rate can reach a "runner's high". Human experiments on "runner's high" mostly use treadmill exercise intervention, and evaluate it through questionnaire surveys, measurement of plasma AEA, miRNA and other indicators. Animal experiments often use voluntary wheel running intervention, and evaluate it through behavioral experiments such as conditional place preference, light dark box experiments (anxiety), hot plate experiments (pain sensitivity), and measurement of plasma AEA and other indicators. Dopamine, endogenous opioid peptides, endogenous cannabinoids, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and other substances increase after exercise, which may be related to the "runner's high". However, attention should be paid to the functional differences of these substances in the central and peripheral regions, as well as in different brain regions. Moreover, current studies have not identified the targets of the neurotransmitters or neural factors mentioned above, and further in-depth researches are needed. The mesolimbic dopamine system, prefrontal cortex- nucleus accumbens projection, ventral hippocampus-nucleus accumbens projection, red nucleus-ventral tegmental area projection, cerebellar-ventral tegmental area projection, and brain-gut axis may be involved in the regulation of runner's high, but there is a lack of direct evidence to prove their involvement. There are still many issues that need to be addressed in the research on the neurobiological mechanisms of "runner's high". (1) Most studies on "runner 's high" involve one-time exercise, and the characteristics of changes in "runner's high" during longterm exercise still need to be explored. (2) The using of scales to evaluate subjects lead to the lacking of objective indicators. However, some potential biomarkers (such as endocannabinoids) have inconsistent characteristics of changes after one-time and long-term exercise. (3) The neurotransmitters involved in the formation of the "runner 's high" all increase in the peripheral and/or central nervous system after exercise. Attention should be paid to whether peripheral substances can enter the blood-brain barrier and the binding effects of neurotransmitters to different receptors are completely different in different brain regions. (4) Most of the current evidence show that some brain regions are activated after exercise. Is there a functional circuit mediating "runner "runner 's high" between these brain regions? (5) Although training at a specific exercise intensity can lead to 's high", most runners have not experienced "runner's high". Can more scientific training methods or technological means be used to make it easier for people to experience the "runner's high" and thus be more willing to engage in exercise? (6) The "runner's high" and "addiction" behaviors are extremely similar, and there are evidences that exercise can reverse addictive behaviors.
   However, why is there still a considerable number of people in the sports population and even athletes who smoke or use addictive drugs instead of pursuing the "pleasure" brought by exercise? Solving the problems above is of great significance for enhancing the desire of exercise, improving the clinical application of neurological and psychiatric diseases through exercise, and enhancing the overall physical fitness of the population.

AB  - Soluble A beta 1-42 oligomers (A beta O) are formed in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and were previously shown to trigger enhanced Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial dysfunction via the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). Src kinase is a ubiquitous redox-sensitive non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, which was demonstrated to have a reciprocal interaction towards NMDAR activation. However, little is known about the early-stage mechanisms associated with A beta O-induced neurodysfunction involving Src. Thus, in this work, we analysed the influence of brief exposure to oligomeric A beta 1-42 on Src activation and related mechanisms involving mitochondria and redox changes in mature primary rat hippocampal neurons. Data show that brief exposure to A beta O induce H2O2-dependent Src activation involving different cellular events, including NMDAR activation and mediated intracellular Ca2+ rise, enhanced cytosolic and subsequent mitochondrial H2O2 levels, accompanied by mild mitochondrial fragmentation. Interestingly, these effects were prevented by Src inhibition, suggesting a feedforward modulation. The current study supports a relevant role for Src kinase activation in promoting the loss of postsynaptic glutamatergic synapse homeostasis involving cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS generation after brief exposure to A beta O. Therefore, restoring Src activity can constitute a protective strategy for mitochondria and related hippocampal glutamatergic synapses.

AB  - Neuropathic pain is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. Currently, prescribed treatments are still unsatisfactory or have limited effectiveness. Camellia japonica leaves are known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.; however, their antinociceptive efficacy has not yet been explored. We examined the antinociceptive efficacy and underlying mechanism of C. japonica leaf extract (CJE) in chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain models. To test the antinociceptive activity of CJE, three types of allodynia were evaluated: punctate allodynia using von Frey filaments, dynamic allodynia using a paintbrush and cotton swab, and cold allodynia using a cold plate test. CCI rats developed neuropathic pain representing increases in the three types of allodynia and spontaneous pain. In addition, CCI rats showed high phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), transcription factors, and nociceptive mediators in dorsal root ganglion (DRG). The ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 levels and neuroinflammation also increased following CCI surgery in the spinal cord. CJE and its active components have potential antinociceptive effects against CCI-induced neuropathic pain that might be mediated by MAPK activation in the DRG and microglial activation in the spinal cord. These findings suggest that CJE, (-)-epicatechin, and rutin could be novel candidates for neuropathic pain management.

AB  - The cell-to-cell transmission of tau aggregates is considered a mechanism underlying the intracerebral spreading of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Recent studies suggest that tau oligomers, rather than fibrils, participate in this process. We previously showed that intranasal rifampicin inhibits tau oligomer accumulation and improves cognition in tauopathy mice. In the present study, we examined the effects of nasal rifampicin on tau propagation in a new mouse model of tauopathy. A tau oligomer-rich fraction prepared from the brain of an AD patient was injected into a unilateral hippocampus of tau264 mice that express both 3-repeat and 4-repeat wild-type human tau. Rifampicin administration was started one week after the injection and performed three times a week for 24 weeks. Cognitive function and tau pathology were assessed by the Morris water maze test and brain section staining. Rifampicin treatment inhibited the spreading of tau oligomers from the injection site to other brain regions and neurofibrillary tangle formation in the entorhinal cortex. Synapse and neuronal loss in the hippocampus were also prevented, and cognitive function remained normal. These results suggest that intranasal rifampicin could be a promising remedy that halts the progression of tauopathy by inhibiting tau oligomer propagation.

AB  - The acute and long-term consequences of perinatal asphyxia have been extensively investigated, but only a few studies have focused on postnatal asphyxia. In particular, electrophysiological changes induced in the motor cortex by postnatal asphyxia have not been examined so far, despite the critical involvement of this cortical area in epilepsy. In this study, we exposed primary motor cortex slices obtained from infant rats in an age window (16-18 day-old) characterized by high incidence of hypoxia-induced seizures associated with epileptiform motor behavior to 10 min of hypoxia. Extracellular field potentials evoked by horizontal pathway stimulation were recorded in layers II/III of the primary motor cortex before, during, and after the hypoxic event. The results show that hypoxia reversibly depressed glutamatergic synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. Data obtained in the presence of specific blockers suggest that synaptic depression was mediated by adenosine acting on pre-synaptic A(1) receptors to decrease glutamate release, and by a nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP postsynaptic pathway. These effects are neuroprotective because they limit energy failure. The present findings may be helpful in the preclinical search for therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing acute and long-term neurological consequences of postnatal asphyxia.

AB  - A total green nanotechnological nasal spray has been manufactured and proposed as an alternative treatment of rhinitis and rhinosinusitis. It was obtained by combining the strengthening effect of liposomes on barrier function, the hydrating and lubricating properties of sodium hyaluronan and the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of the extract of Zingiber officinalis. To this purpose, the extract was loaded in special phospholipid vesicles immobilized with hyaluronic acid (hyalurosomes), which were further enriched with glycerol in the water phase. Liposomes and glycerosomes were prepared as well and used as reference. Vesicles were oligolamellar and multi-compartment, as confirmed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) observation, small in size (similar to 140 nm) and negatively charged (similar to-23 mV). Spray characteristics were evaluated by using the Spraytec(R) and instant images, from which the plume angle was measured. The range of the droplet size distribution and the narrow spray angle obtained suggest a good nebulization and a possible local deposition in the nasal cavity. In vitro studies performed by using human keratinocytes confirmed the high biocompatibility of vesicles and their ability to effectively counteract oxidative damage on cells induced by hydrogen peroxide. The overall collected data suggest that our vesicles are suitable as nasal spray.

AB  - Despite being a crucial physiological function of the brain, the mechanisms underlying forgetting are still poorly understood. Estrogens play a critical role in different brain functions, including memory. However, the effects of sex hormones on forgetting vulnerability-mediated by retroactive interference (RI), a phenomenon in which newly acquired information interferes with the retrieval of already stored information, are still poorly understood. The aim of our study was to characterize the sex differences in interference-mediated forgetting and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that adult male C57bl/6 mice showed a higher susceptibility to RI-dependent memory loss than females. The preference index (PI) in the NOR paradigm was 52.7 +/- 5.9% in males and 62.3 +/- 13.0% in females. The resistance to RI in female mice was mediated by estrogen signaling involving estrogen receptor alpha activation in the dorsal hippocampus. Accordingly, following RI, females showed higher phosphorylation levels (+30%) of extracellular signal-regulated kinasel/2 (ERK1/2) in the hippocampus. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 made female mice prone to RI. The PI was 70.6 +/- 11.0% in vehicle-injected mice and 47.4 +/- 10.8% following PD98059 administration. Collectively, our data suggest that hippocampal estrogen alpha receptor-ERK1/2 signaling is critically involved in a pattern separation mechanism that inhibits object-related RI in female mice.

AB  - The increasing popularity of additive manufacturing technologies in the prototyping and building industry requires the application of novel, improved composite materials. In this paper, we propose the use of a novel 3D printing cement-based composite material with natural, granulated cork, and additional reinforcement using a continuous polyethylene interlayer net combined with polypropylene fibre reinforcement. Our assessment of different physical and mechanical properties of the used materials during the 3D printing process and after curing verified the applicability of the new composite. The composite exhibited orthotropic properties, and the compressive toughness in the direction of layer stacking was lower than that perpendicular to it, by 29.8% without net reinforcement, 42.6% with net reinforcement, and 42.9% with net reinforcement and an additional freeze-thaw test. The use of the polymer net as a continuous reinforcement led to decreased compressive toughness, lowering it on average by 38.5% for the stacking direction and 23.8% perpendicular to the stacking direction. However, the net reinforcement additionally lowered slumping and elephant's foot effects. Moreover, the net reinforcement added residual strength, which allowed for the continuous use of the composite material after the failure of the brittle material. Data obtained during the process can be used for further development and improvement of 3D-printable building materials.

AB  - Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in neurodegeneration. Therefore, reducing oxidative stress in the brain is an important strategy to prevent neurodegenerative disorders. Thunbergia laurifolia (Rang-jued) is well known as an herbal tea in Thailand. Here, we aimed to determine the protective effects of T. laurifolia leaf extract (TLE) on glutamate-induced oxidative stress toxicity and mitophagy-mediated cell death in mouse hippocampal cells (HT-22). Our results reveal that TLE possesses a high level of bioactive antioxidants by LC-MS technique. We found that the pre-treatment of cells with TLE prevented glutamate-induced neuronal death in a concentration-dependent manner. TLE reduced the intracellular ROS and maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential caused by glutamate. Moreover, TLE upregulated the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and GPx). Interestingly, glutamate also induced the activation of the mitophagy process. However, TLE could reverse this activity by inhibiting autophagic protein (LC3B-II/LC3B-I) activation and increasing a specific mitochondrial protein (TOM20). Our results suggest that excessive glutamate can cause neuronal death through mitophagy-mediated cell death signaling in HT-22 cells. Our findings indicate that TLE protects cells from neuronal death by stimulating the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and inhibiting glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity via the mitophagy-autophagy pathway. TLE might have potential as an alternative or therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is caused by insufficient blood flow to the brain. Astrocytes have a role in bidirectionally converting pyruvate, generated via glycolysis, into lactate and then supplying it to neurons through astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS). Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is an enzyme that dephosphorylates phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate during glycolysis in astrocytes. We hypothesized that a reduction in lactate supply in astrocyte PKM2 gene deletion exacerbates neuronal death. Mice harboring a PKM2 gene deletion were established by administering tamoxifen to Aldh1l1-Cre(ERT2); PKM2(f/f) mice. Upon development of global cerebral ischemia, mice were immediately injected with sodium l-lactate (250 mg/kg, i.p.). To verify our hypothesis, we compared oxidative damage, microtubule disruption, ANLS disruption, and neuronal death between the gene deletion and control subjects. We observed that PKM2 gene deletion increases the degree of neuronal damage and impairment of lactate metabolism in the hippocampal region after GCI. The lactate administration groups showed significantly reduced neuronal death and increases in neuron survival and cognitive function. We found that lactate supply via the ANLS in astrocytes plays a crucial role in maintaining energy metabolism in neurons. Lactate administration may have potential as a therapeutic tool to prevent neuronal damage following ischemic stroke.

AB  - Introduction: Doping and steroid use represent a serious threat to animal health and can even lead to their untimely and painful death. However, doping is an acute problem in today's animal racing world, particularly in camel racing. Testosterone and its ten esters (benzoate, valerate, isocaproate, hexahydrobenzoate, decanoate, undecanoate, laurate, enanthate, cypionate, and caproate) are of utmost importance, because when they are administered to animals it is difficult to measure them efficiently. The levels of testosterone and its esters in camels and other animals are typically determined using urine and blood tests. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method to determine testosterone esters in camel hair, and to apply the validated method to determine testosterone esters in collected samples. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such research. Results and Discussion: The levels of testosterone and its ten derivatives, along with the cortisol-D4 internal standard, were optimised for LC-MS/MS analysis; however, only testosterone along with its seven esters (namely benzoate, valerate, isocaproate, hexahydrobenzoate, decanoate, undecanoate and laurate) could be validated in camel hair. Only five testosterone esters could be determined in camel hair samples; the concentrations were obtained as 10.5-14.9 pg/mg for valerate (in three camels), 12.5-151.6 pg/mg for hexahydrobenzoate (in six camels), 4.8-32.1 pg/mg for laurate (in five camels), 5.1 pg/mg decanoate (in one camel), and 8.35-169 pg/mg for testosterone (in all 24 camels). Interestingly, the three racing camels displayed high concentrations of testosterone (59.2-169 pg/mg, all three camels), laurate (4.8-14.5 pg/mg, two camels), hexahydrobenzoate (116 pg/mg, one camel), decanoate (5.1 pg/mg, one camel), and valerate (11.7 pg/mg, one camel). Methods: Camel hair samples were collected from 21 non-racing dromedary camels along with three racing camels in Al Ain, UAE; these were decontaminated, pulverised, sonicated, and extracted prior to analysis. An LC-MS/MS method was employed to determine the levels of testosterone esters in the hair samples. Conclusions: This novel camel-hair test procedure is accurate, sensitive, rapid, and robust. The findings reported in this study could be significant to evaluate racing camels for suspected doping offenses. Further controlled testosterone supplementation studies are required to evaluate individual esters' effects on camel health and diseases and on performance enhancement levels. This new hair test could promote further studies in doping control, toxicology, and pharmacology, as well as having other clinical applications relating to camel health, injury, and disease.

AB  - The nasal mucosa functions as a frontline biological defense against various foreign substances and pathogens. Maintaining homeostasis of the nasal epithelium is necessary to promote good health. Nasal epithelia are constantly replaced under normal conditions. However, hereditary diseases, including primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis, can result in intractable dysfunction of the nasal mucosa. Since there is no treatment for this underlying condition, extrinsic manipulation is necessary to recover and maintain nasal epithelia in cases of hereditary diseases. In this study, we explored the use of airway epithelial cells (AECs), including multiciliated airway cells, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) on porcine atelocollagen vitrigel membranes, as a candidate of a therapeutic method for irreversible nasal epithelial disorders. To confirm the regenerative capacity of iPSC-derived AECs, we transplanted them into nasal cavities of nude rats. Although the transplanted cells were found within cysts isolated from the recipient nasal respiratory epithelia, they survived in some rats. Furthermore, the surviving cells were composed of multiple cell types similar to the human airway epithelia. The results could contribute to the development of novel transplantation-related technologies for the treatment of severe irreversible nasal epithelial disorders. Impact StatementNasal respiratory epithelia are important for the functions of nasal cavity, including humidifying the air and filtering various toxic substances. However, hereditary diseases, including primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis, can result in intractable dysfunction of the nasal mucosa. Our novel method to transplant airway epithelial cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells will be a candidate method to replace malfunctioned nasal respiratory epithelia in such a situation. To secure our method's safety, we used porcine atelocollagen vitrigel membranes, which prevent the immune response and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, as a scaffold.

AB  - Cartilage is considered to be immune privileged in general. Clinically, live cells are removed from subcutaneously transplanted allogeneic cartilage mainly for preservation and for infection control. However, because maintaining cartilage feature requires live chondrocyte, it would be beneficial to subcutaneously transplant cartilage with live chondrocyte even if it was allogeneic. We harvested femoral head from 3-week-old male C57BL/6 mice, subcutaneously transplanted to 6-week-old male mice, BALB/c, BALB/c nu/nu, or C57BL/6-Tg (enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP] under the control of the CMV-IE enhancer, chicken beta-actin promoter, rabbit beta-globin genomic DNA [CAG promoter]), as allogeneic, allogeneic immunodeficient control, or syngeneic transplantation. We also transplanted cartilaginous particles from human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from human leukocyte antigen homozygous donor to 6-week-old male mice either BALB/c and BALB/c nu/nu as xenogeneic or xenogeneic immunodeficient control. The transplantation periods were 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. As the result, we did not observe exposure of the transplant or apparent macroscopic inflammatory in all samples. Histological analysis suggested that the femoral head showed focal ossification and thinning in syngeneic transplantation. In allogeneic transplantation, slight invasion of CD3 (+) T cell and the denaturation of the cartilage were observed, suggesting immune reaction against allogeneic cartilage. In xenogeneic transplantation, slight invasion of CD3 (+) cell and CD4 (+) cell and the structure of the perichondrium-like tissue got unclear, suggesting slight immune reaction against xenogeneic cartilage. Our findings suggest that we should carefully investigate for appropriate procedure to control immune reaction against allogeneic cartilage with live chondrocyte and to maintain its cartilage feature for long time.
   Impact statementClinically, subcutaneous transplantation of allogeneic cartilage is conducted with live cells removed from the tissue. Because live chondrocyte is essential for the maintenance of the cartilage feature, it would be beneficial if cartilage with live chondrocyte could be transplanted subcutaneously without issue even in allogeneic transplantation. We subcutaneously transplanted cartilage with live cells to immunologically normal mouse in syngeneic, allogeneic, and xenogeneic combination. Macroscopically, severe inflammation or exposure of the transplant was not observed. Histologically, signs of immune reaction were observed in allogeneic and xenogeneic transplantations. Taking these, we should carefully investigate for appropriate countermeasures to control immune reaction.

AB  - The non-coding GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in C9orf72 gene is a dominant cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This intronic mutation elicits the formation of nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions containing RNA, RNA-binding proteins, and HRE-derived dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), leading to neurodegeneration via the gain-of-toxic function or loss-of-function of relevant proteins. Using C9-500 mice harboring similar to 500 repeats of the GGGGCC sequence in human C9orf72 gene, we investigated the effects of rifampicin against HRE-related pathological phenotypes. Rifampicin was administered intranasally to 4.5- to 5-month-old mice for 1 month, and their cognitive function and neuropathology were assessed by the Morris water maze test and immunohistochemical staining. Rifampicin treatment reduced the formation of RNA foci and cytoplasmic inclusions containing DPRs or phosphorylated TDP-43, and furthermore, the levels of phosphorylated double-strand RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) that regulates repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. Synapse loss in the hippocampus and neuronal loss and microglial activation in the prefrontal and motor cortices were also attenuated, and mouse memory was significantly improved. Our findings suggest a therapeutic potential of nasal rifampicin in the prevention of C9orf72-linked neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion are essential for maintaining healthy mitochondria and ATP production. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can enhance mitochondrial function in mouse hippocampi, but its underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Lactate generated during HIIT may mediate the beneficial effects of HIIT on neuroplasticity by activating the lactate receptor GPR81. Furthermore, growing evidence shows that lactate contributes to mitochondrial function. Given that mitochondrial function is crucial for cerebral physiological processes, the current study aimed to determine the mechanism of HIIT in hippocampal mitochondrial function. In vivo, GPR81 was knocked down in the hippocampi of mice via the injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The GPR81-knockdown mice were subjected to HIIT. The results demonstrated that HIIT increased mitochondria numbers, ATP production, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the hippocampi of mice. In addition, HIIT induced mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion, synaptic plasticity, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation but not in GPR81-knockdown mice. In vitro, Neuro-2A cells were treated with L-lactate, a GPR81 agonist, and an ERK1/2 inhibitor. The results showed that both L-lactate and the GPR81 agonist increased mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion, ATP levels, OXPHOS, mitochondrial membrane potential, and synaptic plasticity. However, the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation blunted L-lactate or the GPR81 agonist-induced promotion of mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity. In conclusion, our findings suggest that lactate mediates HIIT-induced promotion of mitochondrial function through the GPR81-ERK1/2 pathway.

AB  - Neurotrophins are growth factors that exert important neuroprotective effects by preventing neuronal death and synaptic loss. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) acts through the activation of its high-affinity, pro-survival TrkA and low-affinity, pro-apoptotic p75(NTR) receptors. NGF has been shown to slow or prevent neurodegenerative signals in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression. However, its low bioavailability and its blood-brain-barrier impermeability limit the use of NGF as a potential therapeutic agent against AD. Based on our previous findings on synthetic dehydroepiandrosterone derivatives, we identified a novel NGF mimetic, named ENT-A013, which selectively activates TrkA and exerts neuroprotective, anti-amyloid-beta actions. We now report the chemical synthesis, in silico modelling, metabolic stability, CYP-mediated reaction phenotyping and biological characterization of ENT-A013 under physiological and neurodegenerative conditions. We show that ENT-A013 selectively activates the TrkA receptor and its downstream kinases Akt and Erk1 /2 in PC12 cells, protecting these cells from serum deprivation-induced cell death. Moreover, ENT-A013 promotes survival of primary Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons upon NGF withdrawal and protects hippocampal neurons against Amyloid beta-induced apoptosis and synaptic loss. Furthermore, this neurotrophin mimetic partially restores LTP impairment. In conclusion, ENT-A013 represents a promising new lead molecule for developing therapeutics against neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease, selectively targeting TrkA-mediated pro-survival signals.

AB  - BackgroundNeural stem cells (NSCs) are considered to be the most promising cell type for cell replacement therapy in neurodegenerative diseases. However, their low neuronal differentiation ratio impedes their application in such conditions. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of NSC differentiation may provide the necessary experimental basis for expanding their application. Previous studies have indicated that POU3F4 can induce neuronal differentiation of NSCs, this study aims to underly the possible exact mechanism of POU3F4 on the NSC differentiation and development.MethodsNSCs were isolated and cultured from the hippocampus of neonatal mice. The frozen hippocampal sections were prepared for immunohistochemical staining. Synaptic development was assessed using electron microscopy. High-throughput sequencing was employed to analyze the gene expression profile following the overexpression of Brn4. Gene expression levels were determined through Western blotting and qRT-PCR. Cell cycle and differentiation were evaluated using flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining.ResultsIt was found that POU3F4 promoted the neuronal differentiation of hippocampal NSCs and synapse development, and inhibited NSC proliferation. POU3F4-deficient mice exhibited impairments in learning and memory. RNA sequencing and ChIP assays confirmed that Gli1 was downstream of POU3F4. Loss and gain function experiments indicated that Gli1 mediated POU3F4 promoting neuronal differentiation and synapse development. Forced expression of Gli1 in hippocampus improved learning and memory function of animal models.ConclusionsThe results suggest that POU3F4 and Gli1 promote neuronal differentiation and synaptic development of NSCs, and that Gli1 partially mediates the effects of POU3F4.

AB  - Background: Resveratrol has been shown to modulate stress-related anxiety by reducing brain monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) activity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this neurochemical effect remains unknown. In this study, we employed in silico approaches to investigate the binding affinity of resveratrol and its predominant blood metabolite, resveratrol glucuronide, to specific sites on MAO-A. Methods: For the in silico analysis, we employed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Within the liver-brain axis, we investigated the role of hepatic MAO-A in the development of anxiety. The activity of whole-brain MAO-A was compared with its activity in specific brain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Results: Our findings suggest the presence of an allosteric site on the enzyme that accommodates these compounds. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated that high-dose resveratrol suppresses MAO activity not only in the brain but also in the liver of stress-exposed rats. The in vivo results are interpreted in the context of an allosteric site on MAO-A in both the brain and liver, which may mediate the interaction with resveratrol and its metabolite. Conclusions: The primary outcomes of the study include the identification of the role of hepatic MAO-A in the development of anxiety-like behavior, as well as the determination of resveratrol dose ranges at which it functions as an allosteric modulator of MAO-A activity.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia worldwide, with no cure. There is growing interest in mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as possible pathogenesis-related therapeutic targets in AD. Previously, using senescence-accelerated OXYS rats, which simulate key characteristics of the sporadic AD type, we have shown that prolonged treatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant plastoquinonyl-decyltriphenylphosphonium (SkQ1) during active progression of AD-like pathology improves the activity of many signaling pathways (SPs) including the p38 MAPK SP. In this study, we continued to investigate the mechanisms behind anti-AD effects of SkQ1 in OXYS rats and focused on hippocampal extracellular regulated kinases' (ERK1 and -2) activity alterations. According to high-throughput RNA sequencing results, SkQ1 eliminated differences in the expression of eight out of nine genes involved in the ERK1/2 SP, compared to untreated control (Wistar) rats. Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining revealed that SkQ1 suppressed ERK1/2 activity via reductions in the phosphorylation of kinases ERK1/2, MEK1, and MEK2. SkQ1 decreased hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which is present in pathological aggregates in AD. Thus, SkQ1 alleviates AD pathology by suppressing MEK1/2-ERK1/2 SP activity in the OXYS rat hippocampus and may be a promising candidate drug for human AD.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death globally and is primarily caused by cigarette smoking (CS). Neurocognitive comorbidities such as anxiety and cognitive impairments are common among people with COPD. CS-induced lung inflammation and oxidative stress may "spill-over" into the systemic circulation, driving the onset of these comorbidities. We investigated whether a prophylactic treatment with the NADPH Oxidase 2 (NOX2) inhibitor, apocynin, could prevent CS-induced neurocognitive impairments. Adult male BALB/c mice were exposed to CS (9 cigarettes/day, 5 days/week) or room air (sham) for 8 weeks with co-administration of apocynin (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection once daily) or vehicle (0.01% DMSO in saline). Following 7 weeks of CS exposure, mice underwent behavioral testing to assess recognition and spatial memory (novel object recognition and Y maze, respectively) and anxiety-like behaviors (open field and elevated plus maze). Mice were then euthanized, and blood, lungs, and brains were collected. Apocynin partially improved CS-induced lung neutrophilia and reversed systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde). Apocynin exerted an anxiolytic effect in CS-exposed mice, which was associated with restored microglial profiles within the amygdala and hippocampus. Thus, targeting oxidative stress using apocynin can alleviate anxiety-like behaviors and could represent a novel strategy for managing COPD-related anxiety disorders.

AB  - Abnormal deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) is a core pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Syndecan-3 (SDC3), a type I transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), is abnormally overexpressed in the brains of AD patients and model animals, specifically accumulating in the peri-plaque region of amyloid plaques. However, its regulatory mechanism in the process of A beta deposition remains unclear. This study aims to clearly define the role of SDC3 in A beta aggregation and neuroinflammation, two critical processes in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, we investigate how SDC3 modulates A beta aggregation and its interaction with neuroinflammatory pathways, which may contribute to the progression of AD. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying SDC3's involvement in these processes, we seek to provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets for AD. In this study, a 5xFAD mouse model with downregulated SDC3 expression was constructed. Behavioral assessments and synaptic function tests were performed to explore the effects of SDC3 on cognition in 5xFAD mice. Immunofluorescence co-localization technology was utilized to analyze the pathological co-deposition of SDC3 and A beta in the hippocampus, cortex, and meningeal blood vessels. Quantitative assessments of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Tnf-alpha and Cxcl10 in the brain were performed through histopathological analysis combined with qPCR. Western blotting was used to examine the phosphorylation status of STAT1/STAT3 and the expression changes of IBA1/GFAP to systematically analyze the molecular mechanisms through which SDC3 regulates AD pathology. This study revealed that SDC3 expression was significantly upregulated in the brain regions of the 5xFAD model mice and co-localized pathologically with A beta. Cell lineage tracing analysis showed that the elevated SDC3 expression primarily originated from glial cells. Behavioral and pathological results demonstrated that downregulation of SDC3 significantly improved cognitive dysfunction in the model mice and effectively reduced the A beta burden in the brain. Molecular mechanism studies showed that downregulation of SDC3 reduced the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, thereby inhibiting the activation of the JAK-STAT and cGAS-STING signaling pathways, reducing the activation of microglia/astrocytes and suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Tnf-alpha and Cxcl10. This study reveals that SDC3 co-localizes with A beta pathology and synergistically exacerbates neuroinflammation. Knockdown of SDC3 can simultaneously reduce both A beta deposition and the release of inflammatory factors from glial cells. Mechanistic research indicates that SDC3 drives a "glial activation-cytokine release" vicious cycle through the JAK-STAT and cGAS-STING signaling pathways. These findings suggest that SDC3 may serve as a key hub coordinating amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation in AD, providing new insights for the development of combination therapies targeting the HSPG network.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is the most common form of radiation-induced brain injury. TDP-43 is known to be associated with hippocampal degeneration and cognitive dysfunction, in this study we wanted to know if it also had an effect on radiation-induced hippocampus damage. At first, we found the expression of TDP-43 and p-TDP-43 was increased in the hippocampus of rats with radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the rat hippocampus showed that TDP-43 was expressed in all cell types and was significantly upregulated in neuron cells after irradiation. Enrichment analysis of gene ontology (GO) functions and KEGG pathways showed that the differential expression genes in neuron after irradiation may be involved in synaptic plasticity. In vitro, the expression of TDP- 43 was also increased in neuron cells after irradiation, while the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), TrkB, typical synaptic signature proteins (SYN, GAP43 and PSD95), b-tubulin and dendritic spines were decreased. In the irradiated neurons, the b-tubulin, dendritic and spines typical synaptic signature proteins had more severe damage in pcDNA3.1-TDP-43 plasmid transfections group, however, the damages were alleviated in the siRNA-TDP-43 plasmid transfections group. BDNF was highly expressed in the irradiated pcDNA3.1-TDP-43 plasmid transfections group, while its expression was decreased in the siRNA-TDP-43 group. The TrkB expression was significantly reduced in neurons after exposure to ionizing radiation, however, there was no significant correlation with TDP-43 expression. These data indicate that TDP-43 is involved in radiation-induced neuronal synaptic plasticity decline and developmental damage, furthermore, the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway may not be involved in this process.

AB  - Amyloid-fl peptide (Afl), characterized by its abnormal folding into neurotoxic aggregates, impairs synaptic plasticity and causes synaptic loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurotoxicity of Afl oligomers via the binding to various cell-surface receptors was frequently observed experimentally; however, the toxic mechanism still remains unknown. In this paper, we study the intervention of Afl oligomers to the receptor-peptide binding in the GABA(B)R1a sushi1-APP 9mer complex, a key node in increasing short-term synaptic facilitation in the mouse hippocampus and decreasing neuronal activity by inhibiting neurotransmitter release by molecular dynamics simulations. The residue types of A beta 42 oligomers involved in the intervention and core contact areas of the receptor were first identified, by which an unprecedented toxicity mechanism of A beta 42 oligomers is proposed. These involved residues of A beta 42 oligomers are positively charged residues Asp and Glu, and the core area of GABA(B)R1a sushi1 domain is the Coil one, sharing the rich negatively charged residues R19/R21/R25/R45 with the pocket, in which APP 9mer is locked. The presence of an A beta 42 oligomer rather than of a monomer stretches these key residues in the core area and consequently "unlocks and releases" the APP 9mer from its initial pocket, unsteadying the sushi1 domain and taking into toxic effect. It looks like a chemical "substitution" reaction, A beta 42 oligomer + GABABR1a sushi1-APP 9mer complex + A beta 42 oligomer-GABA(B)R1a sushi1 complex + APP 9mer. Further analysis reveals that the toxicity of A beta 42 oligomer to GABA(B)R1a sushi1 domain stability depends on the residue number of the contact area and the size of A beta 42 oligomer, in which semi-extended trimeric A beta 42 oligomer is identified as the most toxic one. This work provides a novel insight into the mechanism of A beta oligomeric toxicity to neuroreceptors and sets an important precedent for dealing with A beta oligomeric toxicity to other receptors at the molecular level.

AB  - Natural polysaccharides are concerned for their high biological activity and low toxicity. Two kinds of polysaccharides were extracted from Hippophae rhamnoide L. by microwave-assisted aqueous two-phase system. Under the optimal conditions predicted by RSM model (K2HPO4/ethanol (18.93 %/28.29 %), liquid to material ratio 77 mL/g, power 625 W and temperature 61 degrees C), the yield of total polysaccharides reached 35.91 +/- 0.76 %. Moreover, the polysaccharides extraction was well fitted to the Weibull model. After purification by Sepharose6B, the polysaccharides from top phase (PHTP, purity of 81.44 +/- 1.25 %) and bottom phase (PHBP, purity of 88.85 +/- 1.40 %) were obtained. GC, FT-IR, methylation and NMR analyses confirmed the backbone of PHTP was composed of a repeated unit -> 4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 -> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -> 4)-beta-D-Galp-(1 -> 4)-alpha-D-GalAp-(1 -> 3)-alpha-LAraf-(1 -> 3)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 ->, while the repeated unit in PHBP was -> 3)-alpha-L-Araf-(1 -> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -> 4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 -> 3)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 -> 4)-beta-D-Galp-(1 -> 4)-alpha-D-GalAp-(1 ->. Compared with PHTP (6.46 x 106 g/mol), PHBP with relatively low molecular weight (8.2 x 105 g/mol) exhibited the smaller particle size, better water solubility, thermal and rheological property, stronger anti-glycosylation and alpha-amylase inhibitory effects. Moreover, PHTP and PHBP displayed a reversible inhibition on alpha-amylase in a competitive manner. This study provides a high-efficient and eco-friendly method for polysaccharides extraction, and lays a foundation for sea buckthorn polysaccharides as potential therapeutic agents in preventing and ameliorating diabetes.

AB  - The effect of cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE)-derived hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the reactive proliferation of astrocytes and neural functional recovery over 30 d after acute cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) was determined by applying wildtype (WT) and CSE knockout (KO) mice. The changes of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in hippocampal tissues was tested. Besides, we assessed the changes of mice spatial learning memory ability, neuronal damage, RhoA, Rho kinase 2 (ROCK2), and myelin basic protein (MBP) expressions in hippocampal tissues. The results revealed that cerebral I/R resulted in obvious increase of GFAP expression in hippocampal tissues. Besides, we found the neuronal damage, learning, and memory deficits of mice induced by cerebral I/R as well as revealed the upregulation of RhoA and ROCK2 expressions and reduced MBP expression in hipppcampal tissues of mice following cerebral I/ R. Not surprisingly, the GFAP expression and cerebral injury as well as the upregulation of the RhoA/ROCK2 pathway were more remarkable in CSE KO mice, compared with those in WT mice over 30 d following acute cerebral I/R, which could be blocked by NaHS treatment, a donor of exogenous H2S. In addition, the ROCK inhibitor Fasudil also inhibited the reactive proliferation of astrocytes and ameliorated the recovery of neuronal function over 30 d after cerebral I/R. For the purpose of further confirmation of the role of H2S on the astrocytes proliferation following cerebral I/R, the immunofluorescence double staining: bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and GFAP was evaluated. There was a marked upregulation of BrdU-labeled cells coexpressed with GFAP in hippocampal tissues at 30 d after acute cerebral I/R; however, the increment of astrocytes proliferation could be ameliorated by both NaHS and Fasudil. These findings indicated that CSE-derived H2S could inhibit the reactive proliferation of astrocytes and promote the recovery of mice neural functional deficits induced by a cerebral I/R injury via inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK2 signal pathway.

AB  - Rhodiola rosea L. (Crassulaceae) are popularly used as a natural supplement for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Here, saponin extracts from R. rosea were investigated for their roles on relieving sleeplessness. The levels of neurotransmitters, hormones, and inflammation cytokines in plasma, and the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the hypothalamus and hippocampus were detected using ELISA, RT-PCR, and western blotting. First, the butanol fraction extracted from R. rosea was collected as the total saponins (HJT-I), then a saponin-rich fraction (HJT-II) was obtained after the further purification of HJT-I. The saponin contents of HJT-I and HJT-II were 28.92% and 65.69%, respectively. Second, behavioral tests were performed and showed that both HJT-I and HJT-II could effectively reduce the duration of immobility in the tail suspension test, and shorten sleep latency and prolong the sleep duration time in the sodium barbital-induced sleeping test, with HJT-II better than HJT-I. Third, ELLISA results showed that the concentrations of GABA, 5-HT, norepinephrine (NA), PGD2, and IL-1 beta in plasma were significantly increased after HJT-I and HJT-II administration, while IL-6 was decreased. HJT-I and HJT-II also exhibited differential modulation of the receptors of 5-HT, GABA, PGD2, and IL-1 beta expression. In hypothalamus, HJT-II was more powerful than HJT-I in regulation of the GABA(A)R alpha 2, GABA(A)R alpha 3, and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65/67 expression, as well as 5-HT2A and IL-1 beta. As for DPR and PGD2, HJT-II was more effective in the hippocampus. The efficacy of HJT-I was better than HJT-II at stimulating GABA(A)R alpha 2, GAD 65/67, 5-HT1A, and IL-1 beta expression in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the potential sedative and hypnotic effects of HJT-I and HJT-II may possibly be related to the serotonergic, GABA(A)ergic, and immune systems, while the underlying mechanism of HJT-I and HJT-II differed from each other.

AB  - Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) are indeed widely recognized and utilized as one of the most prominent photoanode materials in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Therefore continuous efforts have been made to improve the performance of TiO2 photoanodes in terms of light absorption, charge carrier mobility, and overall energy conversion efficiency. Green synthesis methods for the production of TiO2 NPs, including the use of plant-based reducing agents, have gained significant attention in recent years. These methods are considered environmental friendly alternatives to traditional physical and chemical synthesis methods, which often involve the use of hazardous chemicals and complex processes. Therefore, in this work, a variety of tea types, including green, white, black, oolong, pu-erh have been used to synthesize TiO2 NPs. The differences in the amount of phenolic compounds and caffeine in various tea varieties can influence the topology, structure, and composition of the as synthesized nanoparticles (NPs). The prepared TiO2 NPs were comprehensively characterized for particle size, morphology, purity, composition, crystalline nature, structural, electrochemical and photovoltaic capabilities. The as synthesized titanium oxide (TiO2) NPs were spherical in shape and particle sizes ranged from 10 to 20 nm with little agglomerations. For DSSC application, thin films of synthesized TiO2 NPs were prepared by making paste of TiO2 NPs with Triton-X and spread onto conducting substrate (FTO) with the help of glass rod and finally sintering for 1 h at 450 degrees C. The prepared TiO2 electrodes were dipped in the standard N719 dye solution (0.1 x 10(-3) M) in acetonitrile medium overnight for complete adsorption. Overall efficiency = 3.0 %, J(SC) = 9.72 mA/cm(2), V-OC = 660 mV and FF = 0.46 was achieved with the DSSC made up with green tea mediated TiO2 NPs based photo anode. Due to high phenolic content and good reductive properties, TiO2 NPs prepared using green tea extract were highly crystalline in nature, have high surface area, high roughness factor, good stability which results in maximum dye loading and hence increase in the overall conversion efficiency.

AB  - We introduce a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reduce grains' manual inspection time after image processing on raw 3D x-ray computed tomography (3DXRCT) images from a sample of granular material to obtain level-set function-based digital twins of individual grains. The CNN automatically distinguishes properly segmented digital grains with up to 90% of accuracy. This algorithm is trained using, ground-truth, level set-based digital grain representations from a natural soil sampled at Jaramijo (Ecuador). The implemented convolutional neural network provides groundbreaking processing power, reducing the, otherwise, manual inspection time expended for a small sample, e.g., 200 000 grains, from approximately a couple of weeks to only a few hours. Furthermore, transfer learning and training from scratch are compared for artificially graded granular materials such as oysand (Norway) and Hostun sand (France). The CNN's learning process is interpreted by means of grain morphological parameters, i.e., sphericity, roundness, grain diameter, and volume-surface ratio. Hence, being able to automatically segment a greater amount of grains from 3DXRCT images of natural and artificial soils in a short period of time, enables us, for first time, to perform actual 3DLS-DEM-based virtual laboratory testing (a plug-and-play one-stop shop). Providing unprecedented and unique data for engineering applications.

AB  - In this work, a novel renewable taurine-based ionic liquid (IL), [TauIm][HSO4], was synthesized via the Debus- Radziszewski reaction. The synthesized IL was then used to produce ethyl levulinate (EL) from several lignocellulosic substrates under microwave irradiation. Experimental conditions (temperature, time, and IL quantity) for EL production from a model substrate (microcrystalline cellulose, MCC) were first investigated by design of experiment (DoE) using a central composite design (CCD). The highest EL yields (over 80%) in MCC were achieved at the upper limits of all factors (190 degrees C; 60 min; 10 equiv of IL). Computational studies revealed that the IL-cellobiose interaction is stronger than the IL itself at the reaction temperature (190 degrees C), indicating the efficiency of the IL in interacting with cellulose in the optimal reaction conditions. Moreover, the formation of the IL- cellobiose complex was mediated by the hydrogen sulfate anion, while the cation worked as a spacer. Optimized conditions from DoE were also applied to sugarcane bagasse and straw, elephant grass leaves and stems, rice husks and straw, and corn biomass. EL production yields from 12 to 59% were obtained from these biomasses using this novel imidazolium IL, with the highest EL yields obtained with raw sugarcane bagasse (SCB) without any pretreatments. The superior performance of SCB was associated with the higher content of hemicelluloses in its composition compared to that of the other biomasses. Together, these results presented herein open new possibilities for increasing biomass valorization using renewable and straightforward routes.

AB  - The search for materials made from renewable resources and free of toxic substances is a global trend towards cleaner production, which can be extended to the development of wood-based panels. However, the industrial sector of wood-based panels has been facing several gaps and challenges related to the shortage of wood raw materials for panel manufacturing with the toxic emissions of traditional adhesives. Camellia oleifera shell (COS), as a common waste, is a potential alternative raw material for wood-based panels and also has an important role in alleviating environmental stress. Faced with these problems, the aim of this study was to assess the technical feasibility and environmental aspects of manufacturing particleboard from COS waste at scale. For this purpose, particles made from conventional eucalyptus species were used as particleboard reinforcing phase. Particleboard was manufactured and tested by varying some production parameters, namely: of 10, 20 and 30% content of COS addition; and adhesive types of melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) and polymeric 4-4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate (pMDI) adhesives. The results showed that the physical-mechanical properties of COSbased particleboards were satisfactory for a 10% MUF resin loading or a 3.5% pMDI resin loading. COS-based particleboards with 20-30% COS content similarly met the standards and requirements for non-structural applications. This study presents an informative discussion for decision makers in the wood-based panel industry, providing a trade-off between lower adhesive application and higher COS substitution that is more suitable for direct production at total plant scale.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of zinc oxide (ZnO) and nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles (NPs), biosynthesized from camel milk, to combat bacterial resistance and enhance heavy metal removal from water. The antimicrobial efficacy against various pathogens, including Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida tropicalis were studied. Characterization of the NPs was conducted using UV-vis, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, and atomic force microscopy techniques. Results showed that ZnO NPs exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity, with an inhibition zone of 16 mm against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 13 mm against Candida tropicalis, while NiO NPs displayed reduced activity against all selected microorganisms. Additionally, ZnO NPs demonstrated an impressive Cu(ii) ion removal rate of 96.76% at pH 8.4, with a contact time of 90 min, using 0.5 g<middle dot>L-1 of adsorbent at an initial concentration of 200 mg<middle dot>L-1. Adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model, with isotherm data fitting the Langmuir model (Q max = 100.0 mg<middle dot>g-1, R 2 = 0.9905). Thermodynamic analysis indicated an exothermic process (triangle H degrees = -4,127.4 J<middle dot>mol-1) and spontaneous physical adsorption. Future research should focus on scaling up the biosynthesis of ZnO NPs for practical antimicrobial therapies and wastewater treatment technologies, alongside exploring their long-term environmental impact.

AB  - In many European countries, the common pheasant is one of the most popular game bird species. Despite its popularity, little information has been published related to its sperm profile, including the common semen parameters used to characterise the quality of this material. Additionally, the spermatozoon's ultrastructure has never been characterised, and very few data on reproductive performance in the male bird are available. The aim of the present study was to provide these data and fill these gaps in the literature. Semen was collected by the dorso-abdominal massage technique for pheasants and evaluated during the late spring period (May to mid-June). For the ultrastructure and morphometric descriptions, scanning electron and transmission electron images were obtained. The data show that pheasants produce ejaculates of a smaller volume (average volume = 131 mu L) but with a higher sperm concentration compared with roosters. Semen pH values tended towards alkaline values (average pH = 8.3). The general shape of the pheasant spermatozoon resembles that of roosters and turkeys, although a bigger sub-acrosomal space was observed compared with these species. As a consequence, its perforatorium occupies two-thirds of the acrosome. A lower number of mitochondria (20-24) was also detected compared with roosters and turkeys. The pheasant spermatozoon's dimensions are most similar to those observed in turkeys and guineafowl. The present study provides basic information useful for assisted reproductive techniques and conservation programmes.

AB  - Background: Organ dysfunction, especially liver injury, caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection has been associated with fatal cases in dengue patients around the world. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of liver involvement in dengue remain unclear. There is accumulating evidence that miRNAs are playing an important role in regulating viral pathogenesis, and it can help in diagnostic and anti-viral therapies development.
   Methods: We collected liver tissues of DENV-infected for small RNA sequencing to identify significantly different express miRNAs during dengue virus infection, and the identified target genes of these miRNAs were annotated by biological function and pathway enrichment.
   Results: 31 significantly altered miRNAs were identified, including 16 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated miRNAs. By performing a series of miRNA prediction and signaling pathway enrichment analyses, the down-regulated miRNAs of mmu-miR-484, mmu-miR-1247-5p and mmu-miR-6538 were identified to be the crucial miRNAs. Further analysis revealed that the inflammation and immune responses involving Hippo, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, Wnt, mTOR, TGF-beta, Tight junction, and Platelet activation were modulated collectively by these three key miRNAs during DENV infection. These pathways are considered to be closely associated with the pathogenic mechanism and treatment strategy of dengue patients.
   Conclusion: The miRNAs identified by sequencing, especially miR-484 may be the potential therapeutic targets for liver involvement in dengue patients which involves the regulation of vascular permeability and expression of inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Energy consumption is constantly increasing all around the world, and one of the substantial energy consumption fields is the electricity required for lighting in buildings. There are various approaches to tackle this problem, among which the use of transparent facades is the common method to reduce electrical energy consumption in modern buildings such as museums; However, these solutions have many problems, such as space security, heat gains during summer, and glare; The main problems related to transparent facades are energy loss through light transmitting seams and visual discomfort. Hence, it is necessary to develop a new method that can pass natural light to enhance visual comfort without damaging the thermal insulation of the building's exterior walls. One solution that can be given to this issue is using light transmitting concrete. In this study, five high-performance light transmitting concrete samples, including the different amounts of optical fiber were made, and their performances in terms of daylight and electricity saving have been analyzed based on simulation with Diva for Rhino software. For a better comparison between different studies, the analysis was done based on the reference office, which had been used in previous relevant studies. As a result, the reference office was modeled in 6 cities (Tehran, Houston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Vancouver, & Chicago). It was found that using this material along with using lighting sensors resulted in 45.7%, 31.5%, and 38.8% electricity saving for offices in Tehran, Vancouver, and Phoenix, respectively, and also can increase UDI (Useful Daylight Illuminance) by about 39% in Tehran.

AB  - Despite the eradication of smallpox four decades ago, poxviruses continue to be a threat to humans and animals. The arsenal of anti-poxvirus agents is very limited and understanding mechanisms of resistance to agents targeting viral DNA polymerases is fundamental for the development of antiviral therapies. We describe here the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of poxvirus DNA polymerase mutants isolated under selective pressure with different acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, including HPMPC (cidofovir), cHPMPC, HPMPA, cHPMPA, HPMPDAP, HPMPO-DAPy, and PMEO-DAPy, and the pyrophosphate analogue phosphonoacetic acid. Vaccinia virus (VACV) and cowpox virus drug-resistant viral clones emerging under drug pressure were characterized phenotypically (drug-susceptibility profile) and genotypically (DNA polymerase sequencing). Different amino acid changes in the polymerase domain and in the 3'-5' exonuclease domain were linked to drug resistance. Changes in the 3'-5' domain emerged earlier than in the polymerase domain when viruses acquired a combination of mutations. Our study highlights the importance of poxvirus DNA polymerase residues 314, 613, 684, 688, and 851, previously linked to drug resistance, and identified several novel mutations in the 3'-5' exonuclease domain (M313I, F354L, D480Y) and in the DNA polymerase domain (A632T, T831I, E856K, L924F) associated with different drug-susceptibility profiles. Furthermore, a combination of mutations resulted in complex patterns of cross-resistance. Modeling of the VACV DNA polymerase bearing the newly described mutations was performed to understand the effects of these mutations on the structure of the viral enzyme. We demonstrated the emergence of drug-resistant DNA polymerase mutations in complex patterns to be considered in case such mutations should eventually arise in the clinic.

AB  - Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is a complex multifactorial disorder clinically characterized by cognitive impairment and memory loss. Pathologically, FAD is characterized by intracellular accumulation of the protein fragment A beta 42 (iA beta), hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein TAU (p-TAU), and extensive degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) and the medial septal nucleus (MSN), mainly caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and PSEN2 gene. Since the dopaminergic system may contribute to FAD symptoms, alterations in the nigro-hippocampal pathway may be associated with cognitive impairment in FAD. Interestingly, p-alpha-synuclein (p-alpha-Syn), A beta, and p-TAU have been found to coexist in vulnerable regions of postmortem AD brains. However, the mechanism by which A beta, p-TAU, and alpha-Syn coexist in DAergic neurons in AD brains has not been determined. We generated PSEN1 I416T dopaminergic-like neurons (DALNs) from I416T menstrual stromal cells (MenSCs) in NeuroForsk 2.0 medium for 7 days and then cultured them in minimal culture medium (MCm) for another 4 days. On day 11, DALNs were analyzed for molecular and pathological markers by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. We found that mutant DALNs showed increased accumulation of iA beta as well as increased phosphorylation of TAU at S202/T205 compared to WT DALNs. Thus, mutant DALNs exhibited typical pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, PSEN1 I416T DALNs showed concomitant signs of OS as evidenced by the appearance of oxidized sensor protein DJ-1 (i.e., DJ-1C106-SO3) and apoptotic markers TP53, pS63-c-JUN, PUMA, and cleavage caspase 3 (CC3). Notably, these DALNs exhibited PD-associated proteins such as intracellular accumulation of alpha-Syn (detected as aggregates of pS129-alpha-Syn) and phosphorylation of LRRK2 kinase at residue S935. In addition, mutant DALNs showed a 17.16- and 6.17-fold decrease in DA-induced Ca2+ flux, compared to WT DALNs. These observations suggest that iA beta and p-TAU, together with p-alpha-Syn, and p-LRRK2 kinase, may damage DAergic neurons and thereby contribute to the exacerbation of neuropathologic processes in FAD. Remarkably, the LRRK2 inhibitor PF-06447475 (PF-475) significantly reversed PSEN1 I416T-induced neuropathological markers in DAergic neurons. PF-465 inhibitor reduced iA beta, oxDJ-1C106-SO3, and p-TAU. In addition, this inhibitor reduced pS935-LRRK2, pS129-alpha SYN, pS63-c-JUN, and CC3. We conclude that the observed neuroprotective effects of PF-475 are due to direct inhibition of LRRK2 activity and that the LRRK2 protein is upstream of the molecular cascade of apoptosis and proteinopathy. Our results suggest that PF-475 is an effective neuroprotective agent against endogenous PSEN1 I416T-induced neurotoxicity in DALNs coexisting with Parkinson's disease markers. Therefore, PF-475 may be of great therapeutic value in FAD.

AB  - Background: The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PIN1) plays a vital role in cellular processes, including intracellular signaling and apoptosis. While oxidative stress is considered one of the primary mechanisms of pathogenesis in brain ischemic injury, the precise function of PIN1 in this disease remains to be elucidated. Objective: We constructed a cell-permeable PEP-1-PIN1 fusion protein and investigated PIN1's function in HT-22 hippocampal cells as well as in a brain ischemic injury gerbil model. Methods: Transduction of PEP-1-PIN1 into HT-22 cells and signaling pathways were determined by Western blot analysis. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage was confirmed by DCF-DA and TUNEL staining. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Protective effects of PEP-1-PIN1 against ischemic injury were examined using immunohistochemistry. Results: PEP-1-PIN1, when transduced into HT-22 hippocampal cells, inhibited cell death in H2O2-treated cells and markedly reduced DNA fragmentation and ROS production. This fusion protein also reduced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and modulated expression levels of apoptosis-signaling proteins in HT-22 cells. Furthermore, PEP-1-PIN1 was distributed in gerbil hippocampus neuronal cells after passing through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and significantly protected against neuronal cell death and also decreased activation of microglia and astrocytes in an ischemic injury gerbil model. Conclusions: These results indicate that PEP-1-PIN1 can inhibit ischemic brain injury by reducing cellular ROS levels and regulating MAPK and apoptosis-signaling pathways, suggesting that PIN1 plays a protective role in H2O2-treated HT-22 cells and ischemic injury gerbil model.

AB  - Pyroptosis has been regarded as caspase-1-mediated monocyte death that induces inflammation, showing a critical and detrimental role in the development of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). MARCH1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that exerts potential anti-inflammatory functions. Therefore, the study probed into the significance of MARCH1 in inflammation and pyroptosis elicited by cerebral IRI. Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R)-treated mice and oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated hippocampal neurons were established to simulate cerebral IRI in vivo and in vitro. MARCH1 and PCSK9 expression was tested in MCAO/R-operated mice, and their interaction was identified by means of the cycloheximide assay and co-immunoprecipitation. The functional roles of MARCH1 and PCSK9 in cerebral IRI were subsequently determined by examining the neurological function, brain tissue changes, neuronal viability, inflammation, and pyroptosis through ectopic expression and knockdown experiments. PCSK9 expression was increased in the brain tissues of MCAO/R mice, while PCSK9 knockdown reduced brain damage and neurological deficits. Additionally, inflammation and pyroptosis were inhibited in OGD/R-exposed hippocampal neurons upon PCSK9 knockdown, accompanied by LDLR upregulation and NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation. Mechanistic experiments revealed that MARCH1 mediated ubiquitination and degradation of PCSK9, lowering PCSK9 protein expression. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that MARCH1 suppressed inflammation and pyroptosis after cerebral IRI by downregulating PCSK9 both in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, the present study demonstrate the protective effect of MARCH1 against cerebral IRI through PCSK9 downregulation, which might contribute to the discovery of new therapies for improving cerebral IRI.

AB  - Loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with age represents an important source of frailty and functional decline in the elderly. Antioxidants from botanical extracts have been shown to enhance the development, mass, and strength of skeletal muscle by influencing age-related cellular and molecular processes. Tannase-treated green tea extract contains high levels of the antioxidants (-)-epicatechin (EC) and gallic acid that may have therapeutic benefits for age-related muscle decline. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tannase-treated green tea extract on various muscle-related parameters, without concomitant exercise, in a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Administration of tannase-treated green tea extract (600 mg/day) for 12 weeks significantly increased isokinetic flexor muscle and handgrip strength in the treatment group compared with those in the placebo (control) group. In addition, the control group showed a significant decrease in arm muscle mass after 12 weeks, whereas no significant change was observed in the treatment group. Blood serum levels of follistatin, myostatin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and cortisol were analyzed, and the decrease in myostatin resulting from the administration of tannase-treated green tea extract was found to be related to the change in muscle mass and strength. In summary, oral administration of tannase-treated green tea extract containing antioxidants without concomitant exercise can improve muscle mass and strength and may have therapeutic benefits in age-related muscle function decline.

AB  - Although Platycodon grandiflorum saponins exhibit many beneficial biological effects in various diseases and conditions, how they protect nerve cells against neurodegenerative diseases and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is unknown. We investigated whether P. grandiflorum crude saponin (PGS) protects neurons from neurodegeneration caused by amyloid beta (A beta)-induced oxidative stress. Hippocampal neuron HT-22 cells were used in the in vitro experiment, and AD mice (5XFAD mice) were used as the in vivo model. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was stained with DCF-DA and assessed using fluorescence microscopy. To elucidate the mechanism underlying neuroprotection, intracellular protein levels were assessed by western blotting. In 5XFAD mice, an animal model of AD, nerve damage recovery due to the induction of A beta toxicity was evaluated by histological analysis. PGS attenuates A beta-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting A beta-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis in HT-22 cells. Furthermore, PGS upregulated Nrf2-mediated antioxidant signaling and downregulated NF-kappa B-mediated inflammatory signaling. Additionally, PGS inhibited apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. In addition, PGS ameliorated A beta-mediated pathologies, leading to AD-associated cognitive decline. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that PGS inhibits A beta accumulation in the subiculum and cerebral cortex and attenuates A beta toxicity-induced nerve damage in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, PGS is a resource for developing AD therapeutics.

AB  - The brain during Alzheimer's disease (AD) is under severe oxidative attack by reactive oxygen species that may lead to methionine oxidation. Oxidation of the sole methionine (Met35) of beta-amyloid (A beta), and possibly methionine residues of other extracellular proteins, may be one of the earliest events contributing to the toxicity of A beta and other proteins in vivo. In the current study, we immunized transgenic AD (APP/PS1) mice at 4 months of age with a recombinant methionine sulfoxide (MetO)-rich protein from Zea mays (antigen). This treatment induced the production of anti-MetO antibody in blood-plasma that exhibits a significant titer up to at least 10 months of age. Compared to the control mice, the antigen-injected mice exhibited the following significant phenotypes at 10 months of age: better short and long memory capabilities; reduced A beta levels in both blood-plasma and brain; reduced A beta burden and MetO accumulations in astrocytes in hippocampal and cortical regions; reduced levels of activated microglia; and elevated antioxidant capabilities (through enhanced nuclear localization of the transcription factor Nrf2) in the same brain regions. These data collected in a preclinical AD model are likely translational, showing that active immunization could give a possibility of delaying or preventing AD onset. This study represents a first step toward the complex way of starting clinical trials in humans and conducting the further confirmations that are needed to go in this direction.

AB  - Previously, we reported that intracerebroventricularly administered kisspeptin-13 (KP-13) induces anxiety-like behavior and activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in rats. In the present study, we aimed to shed light on the mediation of KP-13 & PRIME;s stress-evoking actions. The relative gene expressions of the corticotropin-releasing factor (Crf, Crfr1, and Crfr2) and arginine vasopressin (Avp, Avpr1a, and Avpr1b) systems were measured in the amygdala and hippocampus of male Wistar rats after icv KP-13 treatment. CRF and AVP protein content were also determined. A different set of animals received CRF or V1 receptor antagonist pretreatment before the KP-13 challenge, after which either an open-field test or plasma corticosterone levels measurement was performed. In the amygdala, KP-13 induced an upregulation of Avp and Avpr1b expression, and a downregulation of Crf. In the hippocampus, the mRNA level of Crf increased and the level of Avpr1a decreased. A significant rise in AVP protein content was also detected in the amygdala. KP-13 also evoked anxiety-like behavior in the open field test, which the V1 receptor blocker antagonized. Both CRF and V1 receptor blockers reduced the KP-13-evoked rise in the plasma corticosterone level. This suggests that KP-13 alters the AVP and CRF signaling and that might be responsible for its effect on the HPA axis and anxiety-like behavior.

AB  - Age-related neurodegenerative diseases and vascular dementia are major challenges to the modern health care system. Most neurodegenerative diseases are associated with impaired spatial working memory and anxiety-like behavior. Thus, it is important to understand the underlying cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases in different regions of the brain to develop an effective therapeutic approach. In our previous research paper, we have reported the ameliorative effect of curcumin in Cd-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration. However, recently many researchers had reported the important role of the prefrontal cortex in higher cognitive functions. Therefore, to look into the cellular mechanism of curcumin protection against Cd-induced prefrontal cortex neurotoxicity, we investigated spatial working memory, anxiety-like behavior and analyzed prefrontal cortex inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF alpha), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH, and CAT), and pro-oxidant MDA level. Further, we conducted histological studies of the prefrontal cortex in Swiss albino mice exposed to cadmium (2.5 mg/kg). We observed that curcumin treatment improved the spatial working memory and anxiety-like behavior of mice through reduction of prefrontal cortex neuroinflammation and oxidative stress as well as increasing the number of viable prefrontal cortex neuronal cells. Our result suggests that environmental heavy metal cadmium can induce behavioral impairment in mice through prefrontal cortex cellular inflammation and oxidative stress. We found that curcumin has a potential therapeutic property to mitigate these behavioral and biochemical impairments induced by cadmium.

AB  - Mammalian oocyte activation is a critical process occurring post-gamete fusion, marked by a sequence of cellular events initiated by an upsurge in intracellular Ca2+. This surge in calcium orchestrates the activation/deactivation of specific kinases, leading to the subsequent inactivation of MPF and MAPK activities, alongside PKC activation. Despite various attempts to induce artificial activation using distinct chemical compounds as Ca2+ inducers and/or Ca2+-independent agents, the outcomes have proven suboptimal. Notably, incomplete suppression of MPF and MAPK activities persists, necessitating a combination of different agents for enhanced efficiency. Moreover, the inherent specificity of activation methods for each species precludes straightforward extrapolation between them. Consequently, optimization of protocols for each species and for each technique, such as PA, ICSI, and SCNT, is required. Despite recent strides in camelid biotechnologies, the field has seen little advancement in chemical activation methods. Only a limited number of chemical agents have been explored, and the effects of many remain unknown. In ICSI, despite obtaining blastocysts with different chemical compounds that induce Ca2+ and calcium-independent increases, viable offspring have not been obtained. However, SCNT has exhibited varying outcomes, successfully yielding viable offspring with a reduced number of chemical activators. This article comprehensively reviews the current understanding of the physiological activation of oocytes and the molecular mechanisms underlying chemical activation in mammals. The aim is to transfer and apply this knowledge to camelid reproductive biotechnologies, with emphasis on chemical activation in PA, ICSI, and SCNT.

AB  - Shade cultivation of tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) is employed for the production of high-quality green tea which increases the content of chlorophylls and free amino acids, including theanine. However, shaded tea plants suffer from photooxidative stress caused by sudden exposure to high light (HL) when the shade is removed. In this study, we tried to acclimatize shaded tea plants to light prior to shade removal to alleviate HL-induced stress. Acclimated tea plants showed milder photoinhibition in response to HL exposure than the shaded plants without acclimation. Moreover, there were no large differences in the total chlorophylls and free amino acids (including theanine) content between acclimated and non-acclimated plants. These results indicate that acclimation of shaded tea plants can alleviate subsequent HL stress without causing large changes in the content of chemical components associated with tea quality.

AB  - Linalool is anticipated to have significant ecological roles. In this study, linalyl 6- O- alpha-arabinopyranosyl-beta-n-glucopyranoside (linalyl beta-vicianoside: LinVic) was synthesized, and a linalool diglycoside purified from soybean leaves was identified as LinVic by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. High levels of LinVic were detected in leaves and sepals during soybean plant growth. The LinVic content did not significantly increase following methyl jasmonate treatment of the leaves, indicating that its synthesis is independent of the jasmonic acid signaling pathway. In addition to LinVic, soybean also contains 1-octen-3-yl primeveroside. We treated soybean leaves with vaporized linalool and 1-octen-3-ol to determine whether the glycosylation system discriminates between these 2 volatile alcohols. Linalool treatment resulted in the accumulation of LinVic, while 1-octen-3-ol treatment caused little change in the amount of 1-octen-3-yl primeveroside, suggesting discrimination between these compounds. Linalool-treated soybean leaves exhibited increased resistance against common cutworms, indicating that LinVic may contribute to herbivore resistance.

AB  - Aluminum is a well-known and widely distributed environmental neurotoxin. This study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-98-5p targeting insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) on aluminum neurotoxicity. Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups and administered 0, 10, 20, and 40 mu mol/kg maltol aluminum [Al(mal)3], respectively. They were intraperitoneally injected every other day for three months. PC12 cells were divided into four dose groups: 0, 100, 200, and 400 mu mol/L Al(mal)3, and four intervention groups: inhibitor NC, Al(mal)3 + inhibitor NC, miR-98-5p inhibitor, and Al(mal)3 + miR-98-5p inhibitor. The Morris water maze was used to test the learning and memory abilities of rats. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the arrangement and quantity of neurons in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus. Cell viability was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry and the 5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine assay. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of miR-98-5p, IGF2 mRNA, IGF2/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway proteins, and apoptosis-related proteins caspase3 and cleaved caspase3. The dual-luciferase assay was used to determine the targeting relationship between miR-98-5p and IGF2 mRNA. As the dose of aluminum exposure increased, the escape latency of rats gradually prolonged, and the target quadrant residence time and the number of crossing platforms gradually decreased. The arrangement of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area was significantly loose, and their number gradually decreased. The total and early apoptosis rates of PC12 cells gradually increased, and the cell proliferation rate slowed down. Both in vivo and in vitro experimental results showed that with the increase of aluminum exposure dose, the relative expression levels of miR-98-5p and caspase3 and cleaved caspase3 proteins gradually increased, while the relative expression levels of IGF2 mRNA and IGF2, p-JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008), and p-STAT3 (Tyr705) proteins gradually decreased. After inhibiting miR-98-5p in the aluminum exposure group, the cell apoptosis rate and expression of apoptosis-related proteins decreased, and the expression of IGF2 mRNA and IGF2/JAK2/STAT3 proteins increased. These results indicate that miR-98-5p plays a vital role in aluminum-induced neurotoxicity by targeting IGF2.

AB  - The goal of this investigation was to find antidiabetic peptides and inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (M11) fermented dromedary camel milk (Camelus dromedaries). According to the findings, the rate of antidiabetic activity increased along with the incubation periods and reached its peak after 48 hr of fermentation. The inhibitions of alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and lipase were 80.75, 59.62, and 65.46%, respectively. The inhibitory activity of ACE was 78.33%, and the proteolytic activity was 8.90 mg/mL. M11 at 0.25 mg/mL effectively suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and their mediators such as NO, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta in RAW 264.7 cells. The rate of inoculum in the optimization phase was 1.5-2.5%, and the greatest proteolytic activity was observed after 48 hr of fermentation. The investigation of the above property in the ultrafiltered fermented milk exhibited the highest antidiabetic and ACE inhibition activities in the 3 kDa than 10 kDa fractions. The molecular weight was determined employing SDS-PAGE, and the six-peptide sequences were identified using 2D gel electrophoresis. Due to its high proteolytic activity, the L. paracasei strain has been reported to be useful in the production of ACE-inhibitory and antidiabetic peptides. Amino acid sequences such from alpha1, alpha2, and beta-caseins have been identified within fermented camel milk by searching on online databases, including BIOPEP (for antidiabetic peptides) and AHTPDB (for hypertension peptides) to validate the antidiabetic and ACE-inhibitory actions of several peptides. Practical applications The study aims to identify antidiabetic peptides and inhibit ACE in dromedary camel milk fermented with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei M11. Maximum antidiabetic and ACE-inhibitory actions of the fermented camel milk were observed in 3 kDa permeate fractions. Fermented camel milk significantly reduced the excessive TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. RP-LC/MS was used to identify 6 bioactive peptides from dromedary fermented camel milk. This fermented camel milk could be used for the management of hypertension and diabetic related problems.

AB  - The scientific interest in the medicinal properties of Kombucha beverages, a carbonated drink with live microorganisms, has increased recently. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the chemical profile and to examine the antioxidant, antidiabetic and antineurodegenerative potential of unfermented and also Kombucha fermented Camellia sinensis (green tea), Coffea arabica (coffee), and Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) extracts. The extracts were prepared as follows: the first (unfermented) set contained 1 L of water, 50 g of sucrose and 20 g of dried and ground green tea, coffee, or Reishi basidiocarp, while the second (fermented) set contained all of the aforementioned ingredients individually inoculated with Kombucha and fermented for 21 days. The chemical analysis was conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The antioxidant activity was assessed by DPPH, total reducing power (TRP), and beta-carotene bleaching assays. The inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activity was used to estimate the antidiabetic potential, while the level of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and tyrosinase (TYR) was used to evaluate the antineurodegenerative activity. The results suggested that the fermented extracts of green tea, coffee, and Reishi exert significant antioxidant effects, although they were lower compared to the unfermented extracts. The unfermented green tea extract exhibited the highest DPPH-scavenging activity (87.46%) and the highest preservation of beta-carotene (92.41%), while the fermented coffee extract showed the highest TRP (120.14 mg AAE per g) at 10 mg mL(-1). Although the extracts did not inhibit the activity of alpha-amylase, they were quite effective at inhibiting alpha-glucosidase, especially the unfermented Reishi extract, inhibiting 95.16% (at a concentration of 10 mg mL(-1)) of alpha-glucosidase activity, which was slightly higher than the positive control at the same concentration. The most effective AChE inhibitor was unfermented green tea extract (68.51%), while the fermented coffee extract inhibited 34.66% of TYR activity at 10 mg mL(-1). Altogether, these results are in accordance with the differences found in the extracts' chemical composition. Finally, this is the first report that highlights the differences in the chemical profile between the unfermented and Kombucha fermented green tea, coffee and Reishi extracts, while it also reveals, for the first time, the antineurodegenerative potential of Kombucha fermented Reishi extract. The examined extracts represent potent functional foods, while their more detailed mechanisms of action are expected to be revealed in future research.

AB  - Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), also known as G-protein-coupled receptor 49 (GPR49), is a class A G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in embryonic development and functions as a marker for adult stem cells in various tissues and organs. LGR5 possesses a large extracellular domain (ecto-domain) enriched with leucine-rich repeats (LRR), primarily responsible for binding to ligands such as R-spondins. The C-terminal LRR extracellular LOOP region of LGR5 refers to the loop structure connecting the C-terminus of LGR5 to the first transmembrane helix. As the LOOP region is located extracellularly, it is readily accessible to exogenous molecules such as antibodies, nanobodies, or small-molecule drugs. In this study, we successfully expressed and purified the LGR5 LOOP region protein in a prokaryotic expression system. The purified protein was subsequently used as an antigen to immunize camels, leading to the generation of nanobodies. These nanobodies are composed solely of the variable domain of the heavy-chain antibody (VHH), with a molecular weight of approximately 15 kDa. Using the purified LGR5 LOOP region protein as an antigen, we isolated nanobodies that specifically bind to it. Subsequent assays demonstrated that the selected nanobody, NB 4C4 and NB 3E8, specifically targeted the LGR5 LOOP region, exhibited an inhibitory effect on (3-cateninmediated Wnt signaling to a certain extent. This study provides insights for the development of LGR5-targeted diagnostic reagents and antibody-based therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Dilution rate, dilution temperature and storage time have been recognized as vital steps in the processing of semen for storage before artificial insemination. The objective of this study was to determine optimal dilution and dilution temperature with an ostrich-specific semen extender for chilled storage. Four preselected ostrich (Struthio camelus var. domesticus) males, known for their ease of collection and specific semen quality parameters, were collected using the "dummy" fe-male method. Dilution of 384 semen samples, at rates of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8 semen/diluent ratio with a diluent set at 5, 21 and 38 degrees C was performed and stored for 48 h at 5 degrees C. In vitro sperm function tests were conducted to evaluate treated semen during different storage intervals of 1, 5, 24 and 48 h. Motility and kinematic parameters were measured by the Sperm Class Analyzer (R), the percentage live sperm measured by fluorescence SYBR14 (R)/PI (LIVE/DEAD (R)), the percentage of sperm able to resist the hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) stress test and sperm morphology determined by Nigrosin-Eosin staining. Progressive motility (PMOT), motility (MOT), sperm ki-nematics, LIVE and HOS were best (P < 0.05) maintained at a higher dilution of 1:4-1:8. The beneficial effect (P < 0.05) of a higher dilution temperature (21 degrees C) was prominent in terms of PMOT at a higher dilution. Storage of chilled semen at 5 degrees C requires dilution, at interpolated rates of 1:6-1:7, together with an extender temperature of 21 degrees C, to maintain optimal sperm function with minimal loss over a 48 h storage period.

AB  - Social interaction is essential for life but is impaired in many psychiatric disorders. We presently focus on rats with a truncated allele for dopamine transporter (DAT). Since heterozygous individuals possess only one non-mutant allele, epigenetic interactions may unmask latent genetic predispositions. Homogeneous "maternal" heterozygous offspring (termed MAT-HET) were born from dopamine-transporter knocked-out (DAT-KO) male rats and wild-type (WT) mothers; "mixed" heterozygous offspring (termed MIX-HET) were born from both DAT-heterozygous parents. Their social behavior was assessed by: partner-preference (PPT), social-preference (SPT) and elicited-preference (EPT) tests. During the PPT, focal MIX-HET and MAT-HET males had a choice between two WT females, one in estrous and the other not. In the SPT, they met as stimulus either a MIX-HET or a WT male. In the EPT, the preference of focal male WT rats towards either a MIX- or a MAT-HET stimulus was tested. MIX-HET focal males showed an abnormal behavior, seeming not interested in socializing either with a female in estrous or with another male if MIX-HET. Focal MAT-HET males, instead, were very attracted by the female in estrous, but totally ignored the MIX-HET male. We assessed the expression of noradrenaline transporter (NET) in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus, finding differences between the two offspring. MIX-HETs' hypothalamus and hippocampus showed less NET than MAT-HETs, while the latter, in turn, showed higher NET than WTs. These behavioral differences between heterozygous groups may be attributed to different maternal cares received. Results allow preclinical understanding of epigenetic factors involved in social-behavior abnormalities, typical of many psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The genera Prangos Lindl. and Cachrys L., for a long time interpreted as a single genus but today distinct and separate, and both belonging to the majestic Apiaceae family, are species with a large distribution and are used in ethnomedicine in various countries, especially in Asian countries. In this context, we investigated the chemical characteristics and biological properties of two essential oils (EOs) obtained from different specimens, namely Cachrys cristata (Cc) and Prangos trifida (Pt). The chemical composition of the two EOs was investigated by GC-MS analysis. From gas-chromatography analyses, while the (Cc) EO was rich in beta-myrcene (45.34%), allo-ocimene (10.90%), and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde (23.47%), the (Pt) EO was characterized by moderate amounts of alpha-pinene (8.85%), sylvestrene (11.32%), alpha-phellandrene (12.14%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (18.12%), and finally, p-mentha-1,3,8-triene (9.56%). Furthermore, the protective and antioxidant capacity of (Pt) and (Cc) EOs on Lunularia cruciata and Brassica napus exposed to cadmium (Cd) stress was studied. To study these possible effects, the liverwort and oilseed rape, previously pretreated with both EOs, were subsequently subjected to oxidative stress by treatment with Cd. Then, DNA damage and antioxidant enzyme activity were measured in both EOs-pretreated and untreated samples to examine EOs-induced tolerance to Cd toxicity. The results indicate that (Pt) and (Cc) EOs have antioxidant and protective capacity in modulating the redox state through the antioxidant pathway by reducing oxidative stress induced by Cd. Furthermore, B. napus was found to be a more resistant and tolerant species than L. cruciata.

AB  - This study aimed for the first time to examine the effects of L-citrulline single administration on the camel testicular haemodynamics, morphometry, steroids (estradiol [E2] and testosterone [T]), nitric oxide (NO) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) under environmental heat stress conditions. For this purpose, 10 adult Maghateer male camels were examined during September 2024 at the end of the non-breeding season. Animals were categorised into a control group (n = 5) and a treated group that received an intravenous dose of L-citrulline (n = 5;155 mu mol/kg BW). Testicular length, volume, coloured area, testicular artery (TA) haemodynamics and hormonal profile were examined along the examination (-1, 0, 2, 4, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h after injection). Results represented that no change occurred in testicular length, but the volume was elevated (p < 0.05) from 4 to 96 h after injection with no interaction between treatment and time, but both TA Doppler indices were declined (p < 0.05) at 4-48 h after injection compared to control. Circulating L-citrulline, NO and E2 levels increased 2 h post-injection until 48 h, then all were declined (p < 0.05) again with a lowering pattern of total antioxidant capacity (TAC; p < 0.05), but T took more time to elevate from 4 h until 72 h after injection. L-citrulline could be safe and act as a vasodilator with elevation of steroids (E2 and T), circulating L-citrulline and nitric oxide. This was accompanied by a declination of TAC as early as possible to 48 h. Further studies are needed to show its detailed action on semen quality to be linked with future fertility.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as the primary and most common cause of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly population worldwide. Chemical analyses of B. pendula leaf extract (BPE), performed using spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods (LC/MS), revealed high amounts of polyphenol carboxylic acids (gallic, chlorogenic, caffeic, trans-p-coumaric, ferulic, and salicylic acids), as well as flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, naringenin, hyperoside, quercetin, and quercitrin). Four groups of Wistar rats were used in this experiment (n = 7/group): control (untreated), A beta(1-42) (2 mu g/rat intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.), A beta(1-42) + BPE (200 mg/Kg b.w.), and DMSO (10 mu L/rat). On the first day, one dose of A beta(1-42) was intracerebroventricularly administered to animals in groups 2 and 3. Subsequently, BPE was orally administered for the next 15 days to group 3. On the 16th day, behavioral tests were performed. Biomarkers of brain oxidative stress Malondialdehyde (MDA), (Peroxidase (PRx), Catalase (CAT), and Superoxid dismutase (SOD) and inflammation (cytokines: tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX 2)) in plasma and hippocampus homogenates were assessed. Various protein expressions (Phospho-Tau (Ser404) (pTau Ser 404), Phospho-Tau (Ser396) (pTau Ser 396), synaptophysin, and the Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) signaling pathway) were analyzed using Western blot and immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus. The results show that BPE diminished lipid peroxidation and neuroinflammation, modulated specific protein expression, enhanced the antioxidant capacity, and improved spontaneous alternation behavior, suggesting that it has beneficial effects in AD.

AB  - The blood serum of dromedary camels contains a unique type of antibodies with a high potency to neutralize toxins and to identify and inactivate some bacterial pathogens. The present study was designed to examine changes in the endometrial histology of cows with no subclinical endometritis (SE) (experiment 1) and changes in the uterine cytology and endometrial mRNA expression of COX2, IL-1 beta, IL-8, and iNOS following intrauterine administration of DCBS in cows with SE as compared to different common treatments (experiment 2). In addition, the effects of the intrauterine administration of DCBS were examined on the pregnancy rate in dairy cows with SE (experiment 3). DCBS did not induce any histological reactions in the bovine endometrium. The mean (+/- SE) percentage of PMNs after intrauterine infusion of Pen-Strep, DCBS and double DCBS in cows with SE differed as compared to cows treated with PGF2 alpha and no treated cows with SE (1.47 +/- 0.87; 1.43 +/- 1.08 and 1.31 +/- 0.23 vs 3.00 +/- 0.43 and 3.5 +/- 0.75, P < 0.05, respectively) in experiment 2. The mRNA expression of COX2, IL-1 beta, and iNOS was reduced (P < 0.05) after treatment with Pen-Strep, DCBS and double DCBS as compared with no treated-cows with SE. The pregnancy rate after the first AI was tended to be higher (49.2 vs 39.0%), while the overall pregnancy rate was greater (P < 0.05) in cows with SE when treated with DCBS as compared to the Pen-Strep group (76.9 vs 61.0%) in experiment 3. In conclusion, serum of dromedary camel, as a non-antibiotic preparation, can improve the uterine health and fertility when used for the treatment of bovine SE.

AB  - BackgroundBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have shown therapeutic potential in various in vitro and in vivo studies in cutaneous wound healing. Furthermore, there are ubiquitous studies highlighting the pro-regenerative effects of BM-MSC extracellular vesicles (BM-MSC EVs). The similarities and differences in BM-MSC EV cargo among potential healthy donors are not well understood. Variation in EV protein cargo is important to understand, as it may be useful in identifying potential therapeutic applications in clinical trials. We hypothesized that the donors would share both important similarities and differences in cargo relating to cell proliferation, angiogenesis, Wnt signaling, and basement membrane formation-processes shown to be critical for effective cutaneous wound healing.MethodsWe harvested BM-MSC EVs from four healthy human donors who underwent strict screening for whole bone marrow donation and further Good Manufacturing Practices-grade cell culture expansion for candidate usage in clinical trials. BM-MSC EV protein cargo was determined via mass spectrometry and Proteome Discoverer software. Corresponding proteomic networks were analyzed via the UniProt Consortium and STRING consortium databases.ResultsMore than 3000 proteins were identified in each of the donors, sharing > 600 proteins among all donors. Despite inter-donor variation in protein identities, there were striking similarities in numbers of proteins per biological functional category. In terms of biologic function, the proteins were most associated with transport of ions and proteins, transcription, and the cell cycle, relating to cell proliferation. The donors shared essential cargo relating to angiogenesis, Wnt signaling, and basement membrane formation-essential processes in modulating cutaneous wound repair.ConclusionsHealthy donors of BM-MSC EVs contain important similarities and differences among protein cargo that may play important roles in their pro-regenerative functions. Further studies are needed to correlate proteomic signatures to functional outcomes in cutaneous repair.

AB  - The bark of Aesculus hippocastanum is an herbal remedy used in conditions connected with vascular insufficiency; however, there is a lack of data concerning its mechanisms of action. The present work is a preliminary investigation into some of the potential directions of the bark activity. The phytochemically (qualitative UHPLC-PDA-MS/MS and quantitative UHPLC-PDA assays) characterized extract and its four main constituents (esculin, fraxin, (-)-epicatechin and procyanidin A2) were first evaluated in terms of their antioxidant capacity. All analytes demonstrated dose-dependent scavenging potential towards the most common in vivo oxidants, with particularly advantageous capacity of the extract and its flavan-3-ol constituents against peroxynitrite (3.37-13.26 mmol AA/g), hydroxyl radical (5.03-8.91 mmol AA/g) and superoxide radical (3.50-5.50 mmol AA/g). Moreover, even at low concentrations (1-5 mu g/mL), they protected components of human plasma against oxidative damage inflicted by peroxynitrite, preventing oxidation of plasma protein thiols and diminishing the tyrosine nitration and lipid peroxidation. High efficiency of the analytes was also demonstrated in preventing the peroxynitrite-induced nitrative changes of fibrinogen (up to 80% inhibition for (-)-epicatechin at 50 mu g/mL), an important protein of coagulation cascade. Additionally, the extract and its constituents had, at most, moderate inhibitory activity towards platelet aggregation induced by ADP and only negligible influence on clotting times. The results show that, among the investigated properties, the antioxidant activity might, to the highest extent, be responsible for the bark efficacy in vascular disorders, thus supporting its application in those conditions; they also indicate the directions for future research that would allow for better understanding of the bark activity.

AB  - Canonical transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3) is the most abundant TRPC channel in the brain and is highly expressed in all subfields of the hippocampus. Previous studies have suggested that TRPC3 channels may be involved in the hyperexcitability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and seizures. Genetic ablation of TRPC3 channel expression reduced the intensity of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unexplored and the contribution of TRPC3 channels to SE-induced neurodegeneration is not determined. In this study, we investigated the contribution of TRPC3 channels to the electrophysiological properties of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and the contribution of TRPC3 channels to seizure-induced neuronal cell death. We found that genetic ablation of TRPC3 expression did not alter basic electrophysiological properties of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and had a complex impact on epileptiform bursting in CA3. However, TRPC3 channels contribute significantly to long-term potentiation in CA1 and SE-induced neurodegeneration. Our results provided further support for therapeutic potential of TRPC3 inhibitors and raised new questions that need to be answered by future studies.

AB  - Glucose dysregulation is strongly correlated with cancer development, and cancer is prevalent in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying autophagy in response to glucose dysregulation in human bladder cancer (BC). 220 BC patients were included in this retrospective study. The expression of YAP1, TAZ and AMPK, EMT-associated markers, and autophagy marker proteins was analysed by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Further, T24 and UMUC-3 BC cells were cultured in media with different glucose concentrations, and the expression of YAP1, TAZ, AMPK and EMT-associated markers, and autophagy marker proteins was analysed by western blotting and qPCR. Autophagy was observed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. BC cell viability was tested using MTT assays. A xenograft nude mouse model of diabetes was used to evaluate tumour growth, metastasis and survival. A poorer pathologic grade and tumour-node-metastasis stage were observed in patients with BC with comorbid T2D than in others with BC. YAP1 and TAZ were upregulated in BC samples from patients with T2D. Mechanistically, high glucose (HG) promoted BC progression both in vitro and in vivo and inhibited autophagy. Specifically, various autophagy marker proteins and AMPK were negatively regulated under HG conditions and correlated with YAP1 and TAZ expression. These results demonstrate that HG inhibits autophagy and promotes cancer development in BC. YAP1/TAZ/AMPK signalling plays a crucial role in regulating glucose dysregulation during autophagy. Targeting these effectors exhibits therapeutic significance and can serve as prognostic markers in BC patients with T2D.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis [L.] O. Kuntze) is an important global economic crop and is considered to enhance health. However, the functions of many genes in tea plants are unknown. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) mediated by tobacco rattle virus (TRV) is an effective tool for the analysis of gene functions, although this method has rarely been reported in tea plants. In this study, we established an effective VIGS-mediated gene knockout technology to understand the functional identification of large-scale genomic sequences in tea plants. The results showed that the VIGS system was verified by detecting the virus and using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The reporter gene CsPOR1 (protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase) was silenced using the vacuum infiltration method, and typical photobleaching and albino symptoms were observed in newly sprouted leaves at the whole plant level of tea after infection for 12 d and 25 d. After optimization, the VIGS system was successfully used to silence the tea plant CsTCS1 (caffeine synthase) gene. The results showed that the relative caffeine content was reduced 6.26-fold compared with the control, and the level of expression of CsPOR1 decreased by approximately 3.12-fold in plants in which CsPOR1 was silenced. These results demonstrate that VIGS can be quickly and efficiently used to analyze the function of genes in tea plants. The successful establishment of VIGS could eliminate the need for tissue culture by providing an effective method to study gene function in tea plants and accelerate the process of functional genome research in tea.

AB  - Treatment resistant (TR) psychosis is considered to be a significant cause of disability and functional impairment. Numerous efforts have been made to identify the clinical predictors of TR. However, the exploration of molecular and biological markers is still at an early stage. To understand the TR condition and identify potential molecular and biological markers, we analyzed demographic information, clinical data, structural brain imaging data, and molecular brain imaging data in 7 Tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy from a first episode psychosis cohort that includes 136 patients. Age, gender, race, smoking status, duration of illness, and antipsychotic dosages were controlled in the analyses. We found that TR patients had a younger age at onset, more hospitalizations, more severe negative symptoms, a reduction in the volumes of the hippocampus (HP) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and a reduction in glutathione (GSH) levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), when compared to non-TR patients. The combination of multiple markers provided a better classification between TR and non-TR patients compared to any individual marker. Our study shows that ACC-GSH, HP and SFG volumes, and age at onset, could potentially be biomarkers for TR diagnosis, while hospitalization and negative symptoms could be used to evaluate the progression of the disease. Multimodal cohorts are essential in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of brain disorders.

AB  - Arsenic is a detrimental environmental toxicant linked to neurological damage; however, the mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Chronic proinflammatory responses are thought to play a central role in arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. Astrocytes, which are the predominant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), release significant amounts of proinflammatory cytokines upon overactivation. However, the molecular mechanisms driving this response remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced astrocyte activation and the subsequent neuronal damage, both in vivo and in vitro. In a rat model of arsenic exposure, significant neuropathological damage was detected in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Specifically, markers of astrocyte activation, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), as well as the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta, were significantly upregulated, and apoptosis was markedly increased, indicating neurotoxic damage. Furthermore, in vitro experiments revealed that arsenic exposure induced substantial upregulation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING), GFAP, iNOS, and IL-1 beta in astrocytes, accompanied by an increase in IL-1 beta secretion into the culture supernatant. In addition, co-culturing neurons with conditioned medium from arsenic-exposed astrocytes resulted in significant neuronal apoptosis. Importantly, the cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor H-151 effectively suppressed the arsenic-induced astrocyte activation and IL-1 beta secretion, while also reducing neuronal apoptosis in the conditioned medium. Collectively, these results indicate that arsenic exposure activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in astrocytes, enhancing proinflammatory activation and IL-1 beta expression, which in turn mediates neuronal apoptosis, representing a critical mechanism underlying arsenic-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Neuroinflammation following peripheral surgery is a pivotal pathogenic mechanism of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). However, the key site of inflammation-mediated neural damage remains unclear. Impaired mitochondrial function is a vital feature of degenerated neurons. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a crucial regulator of mitochondrial dynamics, has been shown to play an essential role in synapse formation. Here, we designed experiments to assess whether Drp1-regulated mitochondrial dynamics and function are involved in the pathological processes of POCD and elucidate its relationship with neuroinflammation. Aged mice were subjected to experimental laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). We found an increase in Drp1 activation as well as mitochondrial fragmentation both in the hippocampus of mice after surgery and primary neurons after TNF exposure. Pretreatment with Mdivi-1, a Drp1 specific inhibitor, reduced this mitochondrial fragmentation. Drp1 knockdown with small interfering RNA blocked TNF-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in SH-SY5Y cells. However, the application of Mdivi-1 exhibited a negative impact on mitochondrial function and neurite growth in primary neurons. Calcineurin activity was increased in primary neurons after TNF exposure and contributed to the Drp1 activation. The calcineurin inhibitor FK506 exhibited a Drp1-independent function that mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, we found that FK506 pretreatment ameliorated the neurite growth in neurons treated with TNF and the learning ability of mice after surgery. Overall, our research indicated a crucial role of mitochondrial function in the pathological processes of POCD, and neuronal metabolic modulation may represent a novel and important target for POCD.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe psychiatric condition with key symptoms of low mood and lack of motivation, joy, and pleasure. Recently, the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)/ceramide system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD. ASM is a lysosomal glycoprotein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, an abundant component of membranes, into the bioactive sphingolipid ceramide, which impacts signaling pathways. ASM activity is inhibited by several common antidepressant drugs. Human and murine studies have confirmed that increased ASM activity and ceramide levels are correlated with MDD. To define a molecular marker for treatment monitoring, we investigated the mRNA expression of SMPD1, which encodes ASM, in primary cell culture models, a mouse study, and a human study with untreated MDD patients before and after antidepressive treatment. Our cell culture study showed that a common antidepressant inhibited ASM activity at the enzymatic level and also at the transcriptional level. In a genetically modified mouse line with depressive-like behavior, Smpd1 mRNA expression in dorsal hippocampal tissue was significantly decreased after treatment with a common antidepressant. The large human study showed that SMPD1 mRNA expression in untreated MDD patients decreased significantly after antidepressive treatment. This translational study shows that SMPD1 mRNA expression could serve as a molecular marker for treatment and adherence monitoring of MDD.

AB  - LRRK2 mutations are the leading cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and are a significant risk factor for idiopathic PD cases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in LRRK2 PD patients remain unclear. To determine the translatomic impact of LRRK2 expression in DA neurons, we employed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to analyze a translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) RNA-seq dataset from a DA-neuron-specific-expressing Drosophila model. We found that the tyrosine metabolism pathway, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), is downregulated in DA neurons with LRRK2 overexpression; in contrast, the Hippo signaling pathway is downregulated in the G2019S mutant compared to wild-type LRRK2 in the DA neurons. These results imply that the downregulation of tyrosine metabolism occurs before pronounced DA neuron loss and that LRRK2 may downregulate the tyrosine metabolism in a DA-neuron-loss-independent way.

AB  - Bats that feed on insects and are members of the Hipposideridae family, category Chiroptera is widely dispersed worldwide, including Hipposideros spp. There are 29 species of 73 species that inhabit Indonesia. Most of these species use caves as their roosting habitat. In cave habitats, with different physicochemical conditions from surface habitats, the hematological profile can be a physiological indicator in responding to habitat conditions. This study aims to analyze the hematological profile of Hipposideros spp. as a parameter of physiological adaptation in the cave habitat in Gunung Sewu Karst Area, Indonesia. Sampling was carried out purposively in six caves locality of the Gunung Sewu karst area. Bats were collected with misnet (12 x 3 m), and Harpnet was installed at the entrance of the cave at 17.00 - 21.00 WIB. The Blood samples from each bat were taken intravenously, as much as 1 mL, on the Forearm and inserted into a 1.5 mL microtube that had been given EDTA anticoagulant. A total of 20 parameters were observed from erythrocyte, leukocyte, and platelet profiles. These parameters use a Hematology Analyzer for analysis. Data differences in hematological profiles between species and sex were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (sig= 95%), respectively. The relationship trend between the physicochemical parameters of the roosting area in the cave with erythrocytes and hemoglobin was then analyzed using a univariate linear model with multiple regression. All statistical analyses were performed using the Paleontological statistics program (PAST) ver. 4.09 and R. Studio v1.4.1717-3. We found three species (Hipposideros diadema, H. larvatus, and H. ater) with 70 individuals. This study concluded that there were differences in the hematological profiles between the three Hipposideros species based on species and gender, although some samples did not show significant differences based on statistical tests. Erythrocytes and hemoglobin can be used as parameters of physiological adaptation to cave habitats. This is indicated by an increase in erythrocytes and hemoglobin followed by a decrease in air temperature and oxygen levels, as well as increased humidity and ammonia levels in cave habitats. These study results can be supported if similar studies analyze the hematological profile of non-cave-roosting bat. It is recommended that future studies analyze the hematological profile of non-cave-roosting bats around the caves of the studies or in areas with similar conditions.

AB  - This study presents for the first time an analysis of the content and chemical composition of the cuticular waxes and cutin in the leaves of the widespread and important tropical species Terminalia catappa. The leaves were collected in the equatorial Atlantic islands of Sao Tome and Principe, in the Gulf of Guinea. The epicuticular and intracuticular waxes were determined via dichloromethane extraction and their chemical composition via GC-MS analysis, and the content and monomeric composition of cutin were determined after depolymerization via methanolysis. The leaves contained an epidermal cuticular coverage of 52.8 mu g cm(-2) of the cuticular waxes (1.4% of mass) and 63.3 mu g cm(-2) (1.5% of mass) of cutin. Cuticular waxes include mainly n-alkanols and fatty acids, with a substantial proportion of terpenes in the more easily solubilized fraction, and sterols in the more embedded waxes. Cutin is mostly constituted by C16 fatty acids and dihydroxyacids, also including aromatic monomers, suggesting a largely linear macromolecular arrangement. The high proportion of triacontanol, alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, germanicol, and lupeol in the easily solubilized cuticular fraction may explain the bioactive properties attributed to the T. catappa leaves via the popular medicine, which allows us to consider them as a potential source for the extraction of these compounds.

AB  - We previously discovered using transcriptomics that rats undergoing withdrawal after chronic ethanol exposure had increased expression of several genes encoding RNA splicing factors in the hippocampus. Here, we examined RNA splicing in the rat hippocampus during withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure and in postmortem hippocampus of human subjects diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD). We found that expression of the gene encoding the splicing factor, poly r(C) binding protein 1 (PCBP1), was elevated in the hippocampus of rats during withdrawal after chronic ethanol exposure and AUD subjects. We next analyzed the rat RNA-Seq data for differentially expressed (DE) exon junctions. One gene, Hapln2, had increased usage of a novel 3 & PRIME; splice site in exon 4 during withdrawal. This splice site was conserved in human HAPLN2 and was used more frequently in the hippocampus of AUD compared to control subjects. To establish a functional role for PCBP1 in HAPLN2 splicing, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) with a PCBP1 antibody in rat and human hippocampus, which showed enriched PCBP1 association near the HAPLN2 exon 4 3 & PRIME; splice site in the hippocampus of rats during ethanol withdrawal and AUD subjects. Our results indicate a conserved role for the splicing factor PCBP1 in aberrant splicing of HAPLN2 after chronic ethanol exposure. As the HAPLN2 gene encodes an extracellular matrix protein involved in nerve conduction velocity, use of this alternative splice site is predicted to result in loss of protein function that could negatively impact hippocampal function in AUD.

AB  - The dentate gyrus is one of the only brain regions that continues its development after birth in rodents. Adolescence is a very sensitive period during which cognitive competences are programmed. We investigated the role of dentate granule neurons (DGNs) born during adolescence in spatial memory and compared them with those generated earlier in life (in embryos or neonates) or during adulthood by combining functional imaging, retroviral and optogenetic tools to tag and silence DGNs. By imaging DGNs expressing Zif268, a proxy for neuronal activity, we found that neurons generated in adolescent rats (and not embryos or neonates) are transiently involved in spatial memory processing. In contrast, adult-generated DGNs are recruited at a later time point when animals are older. A causal relationship between the temporal origin of DGNs and spatial memory was confirmed by silencing DGNs in behaving animals. Our results demonstrate that the emergence of spatial memory depends on neurons born during adolescence, a function later assumed by neurons generated during adulthood.

AB  - A total of nine sesquiterpenoid lactones together with phenolic compounds and other terpenes were identified from the crude methanol extract of Elephantopus mollis Kunth. Compounds were isolated using different chromatographic techniques and their structures were determined by NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. The structures of some detected compounds were assigned based on LC-ToF-ESI-MS screening of main fractions/subfractions from flash chromatography and comparison with isolated analogues as standards. The findings revealed not only the in-source loss of water as the base peak in hirsutinolides but also the in-source loss of corresponding alcohol when the oxygen at position 1 is alkylated. The present study also draws up a complement of data with respect to hirsutinolide-like sesquiterpene lactones whose LC-MS characteristics are not available in the literature. The chemophenetic significance is also discussed. Some of the isolated compounds were reported for the first time to be found in the species, the genus as well as the plant family. The medium-polar fractions of the crude extract, also containing the larger amount of sesquiterpenoid lactones, exhibited activity both against a cancer cell line and bacterial strains. Isolated lactones were also active against the cancer cell line, while the chlorogenic derivatives also valuable in Elephantopus genus showed potent radical scavenging activity. This is the first report of cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of our samples against the tested strains and cell line. The present study follows the ongoing research project dealing with the characterization of taxa with antibacterial and antiparasitic activities from Cameroonian pharmacopeia.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. It can instigate immediate cell death, followed by a time-dependent secondary injury that results from disproportionate microglial and astrocyte activation, excessive inflammation and oxidative stress in brain tissue, culminating in both short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction and behavioral deficits. Within the brain, the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to a TBI. We studied a new pomalidomide (Pom) analog, namely, 3,6 '-dithioPom (DP), and Pom as immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiD) for mitigating TBI-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration, microgliosis, astrogliosis and behavioral impairments in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in rats. Both agents were administered as a single intravenous dose (0.5 mg/kg) at 5 h post injury so that the efficacies could be compared. Pom and DP significantly reduced the contusion volume evaluated at 24 h and 7 days post injury. Both agents ameliorated short-term memory deficits and anxiety behavior at 7 days after a TBI. The number of degenerating neurons in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus after a TBI was reduced by Pom and DP. DP, but not Pom, significantly attenuated the TBI-induced microgliosis and DP was more efficacious than Pom at attenuating the TBI-induced astrogliosis in CA1 and DG at 7D after a TBI. In summary, a single intravenous injection of Pom or DP, given 5 h post TBI, significantly reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration and prevented cognitive deficits with a concomitant attenuation of the neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.

AB  - We previously introduced the brain erythropoietin (EPO) circle as a model to explain the adaptive 'brain hardware upgrade' and enhanced performance. In this fundamental circle, brain cells, challenged by motor-cognitive tasks, experience functional hypoxia, triggering the expression of EPO among other genes. We attested hypoxic cells by a transgenic reporter approach under the ubiquitous CAG promoter, with Hif-1 alpha oxygen-dependent degradation-domain (ODD) fused to CreERT2-recombinase. To specifically focus on the functional hypoxia of excitatory pyramidal neurons, here, we generated CaMKII alpha-CreERT2-ODD::R26R-tdTomato mice. Behavioral challenges, light-sheet microscopy, immunohistochemistry, single-cell mRNA-seq, and neuronal cultures under normoxia or hypoxia served to portray these mice. Upon complex running wheel performance as the motor-cognitive task, a distinct increase in functional hypoxic neurons was assessed immunohistochemically and confirmed three-dimensionally. In contrast, fear conditioning as hippocampal stimulus was likely too short-lived to provoke neuronal hypoxia. Transcriptome data of hippocampus under normoxia versus inspiratory hypoxia revealed increases in CA1 CaMKII alpha-neurons with an immature signature, characterized by the expression of Dcx, Tbr1, CaMKII alpha, Tle4, and Zbtb20, and consistent with accelerated differentiation. The hypoxia reporter response was reproduced in vitro upon neuronal maturation. To conclude, task-associated activity triggers neuronal functional hypoxia as a local and brain-wide reaction mediating adaptive neuroplasticity. Hypoxia-induced genes such as EPO drive neuronal differentiation, brain maturation, and improved performance.

AB  - According to previous studies, the median raphe region (MRR) is known to contribute significantly to social behavior. Besides serotonin, there have also been reports of a small population of dopaminergic neurons in this region. Dopamine is linked to reward and locomotion, but very little is known about its role in the MRR. To address that, we first confirmed the presence of dopaminergic cells in the MRR of mice (immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR), and then also in humans (RT-PCR) using healthy donor samples to prove translational relevance. Next, we used chemogenetic technology in mice containing the Cre enzyme under the promoter of the dopamine transporter. With the help of an adeno-associated virus, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) were expressed in the dopaminergic cells of the MRR to manipulate their activity. Four weeks later, we performed an extensive behavioral characterization 30 min after the injection of the artificial ligand (Clozapine-N-Oxide). Stimulation of the dopaminergic cells in the MRR decreased social interest without influencing aggression and with an increase in social discrimination. Additionally, inhibition of the same cells increased the friendly social behavior during social interaction test. No behavioral changes were detected in anxiety, memory or locomotion. All in all, dopaminergic cells were present in both the mouse and human samples from the MRR, and the manipulation of the dopaminergic neurons in the MRR elicited a specific social response.

AB  - The yes-associated protein (YAP) of the Hippo pathway regulates a variety of target genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, and inflammation. YAP and transcription activator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) proteins act as mediators of the inflammatory response. Still, their role in atopic dermatitis (AD)-particularly, the association with the nuclear factor kappa-B and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways-is not fully understood. In this study, we found that YAP, is upregulated in AD patients and NC/Nga mouse model of AD. In addition, inhibition of YAP significantly reduced epidermal cell proliferation by 58% and mast cell numbers by 51% and attenuated the upregulation of both Th1- and Th2-associated cytokines. Among the JAK-STAT family proteins, the expressions of JAK1 and JAK2 and those of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 were also downregulated. These findings may explain the role of YAP in AD and suggest YAP inhibitors as promising therapeutic agents for AD.

AB  - Phased secondary small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) in plants play important roles in regulating genome stability, plant development and stress adaption. Camellia sinensis var. assamica has immense economic, medicinal and cultural significance. However, there are still no studies of phasiRNAs and their putative functions in this valuable plant. We identified 476 and 43 PHAS loci which generated 4290 twenty one nucleotide (nt) and 264 twenty four nt phasiRNAs, respectively. Moreover, the analysis of degradome revealed more than 35000 potential targets for these phasiRNAs. We identified several conserved 21 nt phasiRNA generation pathways in tea plant, including miR390 -> TAS3, miR482/miR2118 -> NB-LRR, miR393 -> F-box, miR828 -> MYB/TAS4, and miR7122 -> PPR in this study. Furthermore, we found that some transposase and plant mobile domain genes could generate phasiRNAs. Our results show that phasiRNAs target genes in the same family in cis- or trans-manners, and different members of the same gene family may generate the same phasiRNAs. The phasiRNAs, generated by transposase and plant mobile domain genes, and their targets, suggest that phasiRNAs may be involved in the inhibition of transposable elements in tea plant. To summarize, these results provide a comprehensive view of phasiRNAs in Camellia sinensis var. assamica.

AB  - Traditional sanitation practices remain the main strategy for controlling Bombyx mori infections caused by microsporidia Nosema bombycis. This actualizes the development of new approaches to increase the silkworm resistance to this parasite. Here, we constructed a mouse scFv library against the outer loops of N. bombycis ATP/ADP carriers and selected nine scFv fragments to the transporter, highly expressed in the early stages of the parasite intracellular growth. Expression of selected scFv genes in Sf9 cells, their infection with different ratios of microsporidia spores per insect cell, qPCR analysis of N. bombycis PTP2 and Spodoptera frugiperda COXI transcripts in 100 infected cultures made it possible to select the scFv fragment most effectively inhibiting the parasite growth. Western blot analysis of 42 infected cultures with Abs against the parasite beta-tubulin confirmed its inhibitory efficiency. Since the VL part of this scFv fragment was identified as a human IgG domain retained from the pSEX81 phagemid during library construction, its VH sequence should be a key antigen-recognizing determinant. Along with the further selection of new recombinant Abs, this suggests the searching for its natural mouse VL domain or "camelization" of the VH fragment by introducing cysteine and hydrophilic residues, as well as the randomization of its CDRs.

AB  - The microglial fatty-acid-binding protein 4-uncoupling protein 2 (FABP4-UCP2) axis is a key regulator of neuroinflammation in high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed animals, indicating a role for FABP4 in brain immune response. We hypothesized that the FABP4-UCP2 axis is involved in regulating diet-induced cognitive decline. We tested cognitive function in mice lacking microglial FABP4 (AKO mice). Fifteen-week-old male AKO and wild-type (WT) mice were maintained on 60% HFD or normal chow (NC) for 12 weeks. Body composition was measured using EchoMRI. Locomotor activity, working memory, and spatial memory were assessed using behavioral tests (open field, T-maze, and Barnes maze, respectively). Hippocampal microgliosis was assessed via immunohistochemical staining. An inflammatory cytokine panel was assayed using hippocampal tissue. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to measure microglial UCP2 mRNA expression. Our data support that loss of FABP4 prevents cognitive decline in vivo. HFD-fed WT mice exhibited impaired long- and short-term memory, in contrast with HFD-fed AKO mice. HFD-fed WT mice had an increase in hippocampal inflammatory cytokine expression (IFN gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-5, IL-6, KC/GRO(CXCL1), IL-10, and TNF alpha) and microgliosis, and decreased microglial UCP2 expression. HFD-fed AKO mice had decreased hippocampal inflammatory cytokine expression and microgliosis and increased microglial UCP2 expression compared to HFD-fed WT mice. Collectively, our work supports the idea that the FABP4-UCP2 axis represents a potential therapeutic target in preventing diet-induced cognitive decline.

AB  - The fast-growing food industry is bringing significant number of new products to the market. To protect consumers' health and rights, it is crucial that food control laboratories are able to ensure reliable quality testing, including product authentication and detection of adulterations. In our study, we applied a fast and eco-friendly method based on shotgun-lipidomic mass spectrometry for the authentication of niche edible oils. Comprehensive lipid profiles of camelina (CA), flax (FL) and hemp (HP) seed oils were obtained. With the aid of principal component analysis (PCA), it was possible to detect and distinguish each of them based on their lipid profiles. Lipidomic markers characteristic ofthe oils were also identified, which can be used as targets and expedite development of new multiplexed testing methods.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern, sometimes leading to long-term neurological disability, especially in children, young adults and war veterans. Although research investigators and clinicians have applied different treatment strategies or neurosurgical procedures to solve this health issue, we are still in need of an effective therapy to halt the pathogenesis of brain injury. Earlier, we reported that sodium benzoate (NaB), a metabolite of cinnamon and a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug against urea cycle disorders and glycine encephalopathy, protects neurons in animal models of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This study was undertaken to examine the therapeutic efficacy of NaB in a controlled cortical impact (CCI)-induced preclinical mouse model of TBI. Oral treatment with NaB, but not sodium formate (NaFO), was found to decrease the activation of microglia and astrocytes and to inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the hippocampus and cortex of CCI-insulted mice. Further, administration of NaB also reduced the vascular damage and decreased the size of the lesion cavity in the brain of CCI-induced mice. Importantly, NaB-treated mice showed significant improvements in memory and locomotor functions as well as displaying a substantial reduction in depression-like behaviors. These results delineate a novel neuroprotective property of NaB, highlighting its possible therapeutic importance in TBI.

AB  - Phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferases (PDCT) regulate the fatty acid composition of seed oil (triacylglycerol, TAG) by interconversion of diacylglycerols (DAG) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). PtdCho is the substrate for polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, as well as for a number of unusual fatty acids. By the action of PDCT, these fatty acids can be transferred into the DAG pool to be utilized in TAG biosynthesis by the action of acyl-CoA:DAG and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferases. Despite its importance in regulating seed oil composition, biochemical characterization of PDCT enzymes has been lacking. We characterized Camelina sativa PDCT in microsomal preparations of a yeast strain expressing Camelina PDCT and lacking the capacity of producing TAG. Camelina PDCT was specific for PtdCho and the sn-1,2 enantiomer of DAG and could not utilize ceramide. The interconversion reaches equilibrium within 15 min of incubation, indicating that only distinct pools of DAG and PtdCho were available for exchange. However, the pool sizes of DAG and PtdCho involved in the exchange were not fixed but increased with the amount of exogenous DAG or PtdCho added. Camelina PDCT showed about the same selectivity for di-oleoyl, di-linoleoyl, and di-linolenoyl species in both PtdCho and DAG substrates, suggesting that no unidirectional transfer of particular unsaturated substrates occurred. Camelina PDCT had a good activity with erucoyl-DAG as a substrate despite low erucic acid levels in PtdCho in plant species accumulating a high amount of this fatty acid in the seed oil.

AB  - Elevated risk for schizophrenia is associated with a variation in the DTNBP1 gene encoding dysbindin-1, which may underpin cognitive impairments in this prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder. The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia involve anomalies in glutamate and dopamine signaling, particularly within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Indeed, mice with Dtnbp1 mutations exhibit spatial and working memory deficits that are associated with deficits in glutamate release and NMDA receptor function as determined by slice electrophysiology. The present study extended the results from ex vivo approaches by examining how the Dtnbp1 mutation impacts high K+- and NMDA receptor-evoked glutamate release within the PFC using in vivo microdialysis procedures. Dntbp1 mutant mice are also reported to exhibit blunted K+-evoked dopamine release within the PFC. Thus, we examined also K+- and NMDA-evoked dopamine release within this region. Perfusion of high-concentration K+ or NMDA solutions increased the PFC levels of both dopamine and glutamate in wild-type (WT) but not in Dtnbp1 mutants (MUT), whereas mice heterozygous for the Dtnbp1 mutation (HET) exhibited blunted K+-evoked dopamine release. No net-flux microdialysis procedures confirmed elevated basal extracellular content of both glutamate and dopamine within the PFC of HET and MUT mice. These in vivo microdialysis results corroborate prior indications that Dtnbp1 mutations perturb evoked dopamine and glutamate release within the PFC, provide in vivo evidence for impaired NMDA receptor function within the PFC, and suggest that these neurochemical anomalies may be related to abnormally elevated basal neurotransmitter content.

AB  - Paternal methamphetamine (METH) exposure results in long-term behavioural deficits in the sub-generations with a sex difference. Here, we aim to investigate the sex-specific neurobehavioural outcomes in the first-generation offspring mice (F1 mice) paternally exposed to METH prior to conception and explore the underlying brain mechanisms. We found that paternal METH exposure increased anxiety-like behaviours and spatial memory deficits only in female F1 mice and caused depression-like behaviours in the offspring without sex-specific differences. In parallel, METH-sired F1 mice exhibited sex-specific brain activity pattern in response to mild stimulus (in water at room temperature for 3 min). Overall, paternal METH exposure caused a blunting phenomenon of prelimbic cortex (PrL), infralimbic cortex (IL) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) core in both male and female F1 mice, as indicated by the decreased c-Fos levels under mild stimulus. Of note, the activity of central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) by mild stimulus was triggered in male but suppressed in female F1 mice, whereas the neurons of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), cingulate cortex (Cg1), NAc shell, medial habenula (mHb), dorsal hippocampal CA1 (dCA1) and ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) were only blunted in female F1 mice. Taken together, the distinct brain stimulation patterns between male and female F1 mice might contribute to the sex-specific behavioural outcomes by paternal METH exposure, which indicate that sex differences should be considered in the treatment of offspring paternally exposed drugs.

AB  - Virus-induced neurological sequelae resulting from infection by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) are used for studying human conditions ranging from epileptic seizures to demyelinating disease. Mouse strains are typically considered susceptible or resistant to TMEV infection based on viral persistence and extreme phenotypes, such as demyelination. We have identified a broader spectrum of phenotypic outcomes by infecting strains of the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse resource. We evaluated the chronic-infection gene expression profiles of hippocampi and thoracic spinal cords for 19 CC strains in relation to phenotypic severity and TMEV persistence. Strains were clustered based on similar phenotypic profiles and TMEV levels at 90 days post-infection, and we categorized distinct TMEV response profiles. The three most common profiles included "resistant " and "susceptible, " as before, as well as a "resilient " TMEV response group which experienced both TMEV persistence and mild neurological phenotypes even at 90 days post-infection. Each profile had a distinct gene expression signature, allowing the identification of pathways and networks specific to each TMEV response group. CC founder haplotypes for genes involved in these pathways/networks revealed candidate response-specific alleles. These alleles demonstrated pleiotropy and epigenetic (miRNA) regulation in long-term TMEV infection, with particular relevance for resilient mouse strains.</p>

AB  - Leptin is a hormone produced by the small intestines and adipose tissue that promotes feelings of satiety. Leptin receptors (LepRs) are highly expressed in the hypothalamus, enabling central neural control of hunger. Interestingly, LepRs are also expressed in several other regions of the body and brain, notably in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These brain regions mediate higher-order sensory, motor, cognitive, and memory functions, which can be profoundly altered during periods of hunger and satiety. However, LepR expression in these regions has not been fully characterized on a cell-type-specific basis, which is necessary to begin assessing their potential functional impact. Consequently, we examined LepR expression on neurons and glia in the forebrain using a LepR-Cre transgenic mouse model. LepR-positive cells were identified using a 'floxed' viral cell-filling approach and co-labeling immunohistochemically for cell-type-specific markers, i.e., NeuN, VGlut2, GAD67, parvalbumin, somatostatin, 5-HT3R, WFA, S100 beta, and GFAP. In the cortex, LepR-positive cells were localized to lower layers (primarily layer 6) and exhibited non-pyramidal cellular morphologies. The majority of cortical LepR-positive cells were neurons, while the remainder were identified primarily as astrocytes or other glial cells. The majority of cortical LepR-positive neurons co-expressed parvalbumin, while none expressed somatostatin or 5-HT3R. In contrast, all hippocampal LepR-positive cells were neuronal, with none co-expressing GFAP. These data suggest that leptin can potentially influence neural processing in forebrain regions associated with sensation and limbic-related functions.

AB  - To better assess the practical value and avoid potential risks of the traditionally medicinal and edible basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune, which may arise from undescribed metabolites, a combination of elicitors was introduced for the first time to discover products from cryptic and low-expressed gene clusters under laboratory cultivation. Treating S. commune NJFU21 with the combination of five elicitors led to the upregulated production of a class of unusual linear diterpene-derived variants, including eleven new ones (1-11), along with three known ones (12-14). The structures and stereochemistry were determined by 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, ECD, OR and VCD calculations. Notably, the elongation terminus of all the diterpenes was decorated by an unusual butenedioic acid moiety. Compound 1 was a rare monocyclic diterpene, while 2-6 possessed a tetrahydrofuran moiety. The truncated metabolites 4, 5 and 13 belong to the trinorditerpenes. All the diterpenes displayed approximately 70% scavenging of hydroxyl radicals at 50 mu M and null cytotoxic activity at 10 mu M. In addition, compound 1 exhibited potent antifungal activity against the plant pathogenic fungi Colletotrichum camelliae, with MIC values of 8 mu g/mL. Our findings indicated that this class of diterpenes could provide valuable protectants for cosmetic ingredients and the lead compounds for agricultural fungicide development.

AB  - In recent years, the quality and sourcing of tea have gained importance in Europe, but information remains scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of fluoride (F-) and total aluminium (Al) species in infusions of commercially available teas in Slovenia, and thus in Europe, and to relate them to tea quality and their impact on consumer safety. F- concentrations were determined using a fluoride-ion-selective electrode and Al concentrations using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. A comparison of the results obtained for four selected tea samples using the calibration curve and a standard addition technique showed good agreement, with no interferences caused by the sample matrix. The concentrations of 35 commercial teas ranged from 0.34 to 4.79 and 0.51 to 8.90 mg/L for F- and Al, respectively. The average concentrations of the two elements followed the same descending order: black filter > green filter > black leaves approximate to green leaves. Single and multivariate statistical methods supported the categorisation of teas by packaging but not by type, with tea in filter bags being more expensive than loose tea. The linear relationship between F- and Al concentrations in infusions (C(Al) = 1.2134 center dot C(F-)) allows for the determination of one element and estimation of the other, leading to a significant reduction in laboratory effort and cost. This research advances tea assessment by proposing Al concentration alongside F- as a quality indicator and provides the basis for tea-monitoring protocols. Finally, the daily consumption of larger quantities of tea (approximate to 1 L) with elevated F- and Al concentrations could potentially pose a health risk.

AB  - Presenilin-2 (PSEN2) mutation Thr421Met was identified from a 57-years old patient with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) for the first time in Korea. Previously, this mutation was discovered in an EOAD patient in Japan without a change on amyloid production from the cellular study. Both Korean and Japanese patients developed the disease in their 50s. Memory loss was prominent in both cases, but no additional clinical information was available on the Japanese patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of the Korean patient revealed asymmetric atrophies in both temporo-parietal lobes. In addition, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) also revealed amyloid deposits in the gray matter of the temporo-parietal lobes asymmetrically. PSEN2 Thr421 was conserved among a majority of vertebrates (such as zebras, elephants, and giant pandas); hence, Thr421 could play an important role in its functions and any mutations could cause detrimental ramifications in its interactions. Interestingly, PSEN2 Thr421 could have homology with PSEN1 Thr440, as PSEN1 T440del mutations were reported from patients with AD or dementia with Lewy bodies. Hence, the changed amino acid from threonine to methionine of PSEN2 Thr421 could cause significant structural alterations in causing local protein dynamics, leading to its pathogenicity in EOAD. Lastly, PSEN2 Thr421Met may interact with other mutations in neurodegenerative disease related genes, which were found in the proband patient, such as ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7), Notch Receptor 3 (NOTCH3), or Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). These interactions of pathway networks among PSEN2 and other disease risk factors could be responsible for the disease phenotype through other pathways. For example, PSEN2 and ABCA7 may impact amyloid processing and reduce amyloid clearance. Interaction between PSEN2 and NOTCH3 variants may be associated with abnormal NOTCH signaling and a lower degree of neuroprotection. Along with LRRK2 variants, PSEN2 Thr421Met may impact neurodegeneration through Wnt related pathways. In the future, cellular studies of more than one mutation by CRISPR-Cas9 method along with biomarker profiles could be helpful to understand the complicated pathways.

AB  - Mitochondria damage and apoptosis were found associated with sevoflurane induced neurotoxicity in developing brains of rodent and neuro cell lines. The detailed upstream mechanism remains unclear. This study explored whether sevoflurane induces neurotoxicity by activating a GSK3 beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta)/Drp1 (dynaminrelated protein-1)-dependent mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Our results showed that sevoflurane exposure promoted mitochondria fission in hippocampus of neonatal mice, resulted in a prolonged escape latency from P32 (32-day-postnatal) to P35, and decreased platform crossing times on P36 as compared to the control treatment. Additionally, sevoflurane upregulated GSK3 beta stability and activation, promoted phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616 along with its translocation to mitochondria and resulted in increasing cytochrome c and cleaved casepase-3 in hippocampus of neonatal mice and in human SK-N-SH cells. Simultaneously, sevoflurane promoted the interaction between Drp1 and GSK3 beta. Furthermore, GSK3 beta activated phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser(616), induced mitochondrial fission, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells, which was attenuated by TDZD-8, an inhibitor of GSK3 beta. In conclusion, sevoflurane induced neurotoxicity links to a GSK3 beta/Drp1 dependent mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of focal epilepsy. Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic drug whose mechanism of action at the genetic level has not been fully described. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the relevant gene expression changes in the dentate gyrus (DG) of LEV-treated rats with pilocarpine-induced TLE. Whole-transcriptome microarrays were used to obtain the differential genetic profiles of control (CTRL), epileptic (EPI), and EPI rats treated for one week with LEV (EPI + LEV). Quantitative RT-qPCR was used to evaluate the RNA levels of the genes of interest. According to the results of the EPI vs. CTRL analysis, 685 genes were differentially expressed, 355 of which were underexpressed and 330 of which were overexpressed. According to the analysis of the EPI + LEV vs. EPI groups, 675 genes were differentially expressed, 477 of which were downregulated and 198 of which were upregulated. A total of 94 genes whose expression was altered by epilepsy and modified by LEV were identified. The RT-qPCR confirmed that LEV treatment reversed the increased expression of Hgf mRNA and decreased the expression of the Efcab1, Adam8, Slc24a1, and Serpinb1a genes in the DG. These results indicate that LEV could be involved in nonclassical mechanisms involved in Ca2+ homeostasis and the regulation of the mTOR pathway through Efcab1, Hgf, SLC24a1, Adam8, and Serpinb1a, contributing to reduced hyperexcitability in TLE patients.

AB  - Cells are constantly exposed to various mechanical forces, including hydrostatic pressure, cyclic stretch, fluid shear stress, and extracellular matrix stiffness. Mechanical cues can be translated into the cell-specific transcriptional process by a cellular mechanic-transducer. Evidence suggests that mechanical signals assist activated intracellular signal transduction pathways and the relative phenotypic adaptation to coordinate cell behavior and disease appropriately. The Hippo/yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathway is regulated in response to numerous mechanical stimuli. It plays an important role in the mechanotransduction mechanism, which converts mechanical forces to cascades of molecular signaling to modulate gene expression. This review summarizes the recent findings relevant to the Hippo/YAP pathway-based mechanotransduction in cell behavior and maintaining blood vessels, as well as cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Broad-spectrum crop protection technologies, such as abamectin and bifenthrin, are globally relied upon to curb the existential threats from economic crop pests such as the generalist herbivore Tetranychus urticae Koch (TSSM). However, the rising cost of discovering and registering new acaricides, particularly for specialty crops, along with the increasing risk of pesticide resistance development, underscores the urgent need to preserve the efficacy of currently registered acaricides. This study examined the overall genetic mechanism underlying adaptation to abamectin and bifenthrin in T. urticae populations from commercial hop fields in the Pacific Northwestern region of the USA. A transcriptomic study was conducted using four populations (susceptible, abamectin-resistant, and two bifenthrin-resistant populations). Differential gene expression analysis revealed a notable disparity, with significantly more downregulated genes than upregulated genes in both resistant populations. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed a striking consistency among all three resistant populations, with downregulated genes predominately associated with chitin metabolism. In contrast, upregulated genes in the resistant populations were linked to biological processes, such as peptidase activity and oxidoreductase activity. Proteolytic activity by peptidase enzymes in abamectin- and bifenthrin-resistant TSSM populations may suggest their involvement in acaricide metabolism. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying acaricide resistance in the TSSM. This knowledge can be utilized to develop innovative pesticides and molecular diagnostic tools for effectively monitoring and managing resistant TSSM populations.

AB  - The single nucleotide polymorphism rs13166360, causing a substitution of valine (Val) 147 to leucine (Leu) in the adenylyl cyclase 2 (ADCY2), has previously been associated with bipolar disorder (BD). Here we show that the disease-associated ADCY2 missense mutation diminishes the enzyme<acute accent>s capacity to generate the second messenger 3',5'-cylic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by altering its subcellular localization. We established mice specifically carrying the Val to Leu substitution using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing. Mice homozygous for the Leu variant display symptoms of a mania-like state accompanied by cognitive impairments. Mutant animals show additional characteristic signs of rodent mania models, i.e., they are hypersensitive to amphetamine, the observed mania-like behaviors are responsive to lithium treatment and the Val to Leu substitution results in a shifted excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance towards more excitation. Exposure to chronic social defeat stress switches homozygous Leu variant carriers from a mania- to a depressive-like state, a transition which is reminiscent of the alternations characterizing the symptomatology in BD patients. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) revealed widespread Adcy2 mRNA expression in numerous hippocampal cell types. Differentially expressed genes particularly identified from glutamatergic CA1 neurons point towards ADCY2 variant-dependent alterations in multiple biological processes including cAMP-related signaling pathways. These results validate ADCY2 as a BD risk gene, provide insights into underlying disease mechanisms, and potentially open novel avenues for therapeutic intervention strategies.

AB  - Despite several antidepressant treatments being available in clinics, they are not effective in all patients. In recent years, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been explored as adjunctive therapy for many psychiatric disorders, including depression, for its antioxidant properties. Given the promising efficacy of this compound for the treatment of such pathologies, it is fundamental to investigate, at the preclinical level, the ability of the drug to act in the modulation of neuroplastic mechanisms in basal conditions and during challenging events in order to highlight the potential features of the drug useful for clinical efficacy. To this aim, adult male Wistar rats were treated with the antidepressant venlafaxine (VLX) (10 mg/kg) or NAC (300 mg/kg) for 21 days and then subjected to 1 h of acute restraint stress (ARS). We found that NAC enhanced the expression of several immediate early genes, markers of neuronal plasticity in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and amygdala, and in particular it mediated the acute-stress-induced upregulation of Nr4a1 expression more than VLX. These data suggested the ability of NAC to induce coping strategies to face external challenges, highlighting its potential for the improvement of neuroplastic mechanisms for the promotion of resilience, in particular via the modulation of Nr4a1.

AB  - Neuronal firing patterns are the result of inputs converging onto single cells. Identifying these inputs, anatomically and functionally, is essential to understand how neurons integrate information. Single-cell electroporation of helper genes and subsequent local injection of recombinant rabies viruses enable precisemapping of inputs to individual cells in superficial layers of the intact cortex. However, access to neurons in deeper structures requires more invasive procedures, including removal of overlying tissue. We developed amethod that, through a combination of virus injections, allows us to target 4 or fewer hippocampal cells 48% of the time and a single cell 16% of the time inwild-typemicewithout use of electroporation or tissue aspiration. We identify local anddistant monosynaptic inputs that can be functionally characterized in vivo. By expanding the toolbox formonosynaptic circuit tracing, this method will help further our understanding of neuronal integration at the level of single cells.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by down-regulated levels of neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BchE) in the neocortex and hippocampus; and aberrant processing and polymerization of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). Inhibition of cholinesterase (ChE) activity will effectively measure in AD treatment. In the present study, in silico analysis of anticholinesterase activity by 18 plant phytochemicals revealed four phytochemicals Quercetin, Cirsimaritin, Genkwanin and Genistein could be potential drugs candidates as they showed high binding affinity and interaction with the target protein AchE and BchE. These phytochemicals may play an essential role in regulating ChE activity in AD patients. Also, they are previously reported to play a vital role in altering other AD contributing factors. Thus, the present study reports potential drug targets that can be used to develop a drug against AD after experimental validation.

AB  - Sea buckthorn berries are rich in bioactive compounds and can be used for medicine and food. The variety and drying method used have an important influence on quality. In this study, different sea buckthorn varieties from China were selected and dried with four common drying methods. The total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids content (TFC), contents of 12 phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity in vitro were analyzed. The results showed that the TPC, TFC and antioxidant activity of two wild sea buckthorn berries were higher than those of three cultivated berries, and for the same varieties, measured chemical contents and antioxidant activity of the freeze-dried fruit were significantly higher than those obtained with three conventional drying methods. In addition, forty-one compounds in sea buckthorn berry were identified by UPLC-PDA-Q/TOF-MS, most of which were isorhamnetin derivatives. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed narcissin and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside varied significantly in sea buckthorn berries of different varieties and with different drying methods; they were potential quality markers. Strong correlations were found between TPC, gallic acid and antioxidant capacity (p < 0.05).

AB  - Grass pollen allergies significantly contribute to atopic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, resulting in considerable healthcare burdens. Objective: In this study, molecular sensitization patterns to grass pollen in Swiss patients were addressed. The research utilized a retrospective cohort approach using ImmunoCAP (TM) ISAC testing from October 2015 to July 2020. Clinical histories, demographics, and skin prick test results were collected for analysis. The minimum patient age was 18 years and the average patient age was 41.3 years, with a female predominance (68.5%). In total, 4814 measurements were analyzed. Allergic rhinitis was the most common clinical symptom, followed by asthma and urticaria. A total of 1963 patients (40.8%) revealed sensitization to grass pollen. The most common sensitizations were found to the major allergens Phl p 1 (86%) and Phl p 5 (65%), but also to Phl p 4 (62%). Monosensitization was mostly found to allergens Phl p 1 (266/13.5%) and Phl p 4 (157/7.9%), and less so to Phl p 5 (33/1.7%). Notably, the Phl p 4-monosensitized subgroup showed only an 18% positivity rate in skin prick tests and presented mostly with urticaria. This study gives insights into the spectrum of grass pollen allergies in a Central European setting and underscores the possibly underestimated role of Phl p 4 among grass pollen allergens, especially in a subgroup that suffers mainly from seasonal urticaria. Monovalent sensitization to Phl p 4 can also cause seasonal rhinitis and might therefore be missed if only Phl p 1/p 5 are tested. A better understanding of sensitization patterns will further improve diagnosis and treatment options.

AB  - The phenotype of albino tea plants (ATPs) is significantly influenced by temperature regimes and light conditions, which alter certain components of the tea leaves leading to corresponding phenotypic changes. However, the regulatory mechanism of temperature-dependent changes in photosynthetic pigment contents and the resultant leaf colors remain unclear. Here, we examined the chloroplast microstructure, shoot phenotype, photosynthetic pigment content, and the expression of pigment synthesis-related genes in three tea genotypes with different leaf colors under different temperature conditions. The electron microscopy results revealed that all varieties experienced the most severe chloroplast damage at 15 degrees C, particularly in albino cultivar Baiye 1 (BY), where chloroplast basal lamellae were loosely arranged, and some chloroplasts were even empty. In contrast, the chloroplast basal lamellae at 35 degrees C and 25 degrees C were neatly arranged and well-developed, outperforming those observed at 20 degrees C and 15 degrees C. Chlorophyll and carotenoid measurements revealed a significant reduction in chlorophyll content under low temperature treatment, peaking at ambient temperature followed by high temperatures. Interestingly, BY showed remarkable tolerance to high temperatures, maintaining relatively high chlorophyll content, indicating its sensitivity primarily to low temperatures. Furthermore, the trends in gene expression related to chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolism were largely consistent with the pigment content. Correlation analysis identified key genes responsible for temperature-induced changes in these pigments, suggesting that changes in their expression likely contribute to temperature-dependent leaf color variations.

AB  - HCC is a globally high- incidence malignant tumour, and its pathogenesis is still un-clear. Recently, STRN3 has been found to be elevated in various tumours, but its ex-pression and biological functions in HCC have not been studied. In the study, clinical correlation analysis was performed on 371 liver cancer patients from TCGA database and liver cancer tissues and normal tissues from the GEO database. qRT- PCR and western blotting were used to detect relevant proteins in cells, and CCK8 and colony formation experiments were performed to analyse cell proliferation ability. Trans well and wound healing experiments were performed to detect cell invasion ability, and flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. Single- cell sequencing data and multiple immunofluorescence were analysed for the expression abundance and distribution of certain proteins. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the expression of STRN3 in patients' tumour and adjacent non- cancerous tissues. The results indicated STRN3 was highly expressed in liver tumour tissues and was closely associated with poor prognosis. Knockdown of STRN3 could significantly inhibit cell proliferation and migration ability. At the same time, we found that STRN3 could inhibit the Hippo pathway and promote the entry of YAP protein into the nucleus. Our study first found that STRN3 could promote tumour growth by inhibiting the Hippo pathway. The study of STRN3 can promote the understanding and treatment of the occurrence and development of HCC.

AB  - Physical exercise (EX) is well established for its positive impact on brain health. However, conventional EX may not be feasible for certain individuals. In this regard, this study explores electromyostimulation (EMS) as a potential alternative for enhancing cognitive function. Conducted on both human participants and rats, the study involved two sessions of EMS applied to the quadriceps with a duration of 30 min at one-week intervals. The human subjects experienced assessments of cognition and mood, while the rats underwent histological and biochemical analyses on the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and quadriceps. Our findings indicated that EMS enhanced executive functions and reduced anxiety in humans. In parallel, our results from the animal studies revealed an elevation in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), specifically in the hippocampus. Intriguingly, this increase was not associated with heightened neuronal activity or cerebral hemodynamics; instead, our data point towards a humoral interaction from muscle to brain. While no evidence of increased muscle and circulating BDNF or FNDC5/irisin pathways could be found, our data highlight lactate as a bridging signaling molecule of the muscle-brain crosstalk following EMS. In conclusion, our results suggest that EMS could be an effective alternative to conventional EX for enhancing both brain health and cognitive function.

AB  - The bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) expressed in human sinonasal mucosae are known to elicit innate immune responses involving the release of nitric oxide (NO). We investigated the expression and distribution of two T2Rs, T2R14 and T2R38, in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and correlated the results with fractional exhaled NO (FeNO) levels and genotype of the T2R38 gene (TAS2R38). Using the Japanese Epidemiological Survey of Refractory Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis (JESREC) phenotypic criteria, we identified CRS patients as either eosinophilic (ECRS, n = 36) or non-eosinophilic (non-ECRS, n = 56) patients and compared these groups with 51 non-CRS subjects. Mucosal specimens from the ethmoid sinus, nasal polyps, and inferior turbinate were collected from all subjects, together with blood samples, for RT-PCR analysis, immunostaining, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing. We observed significant downregulation of T2R38 mRNA levels in the ethmoid mucosa of non-ECRS patients and in the nasal polyps of ECRS patients. No significant differences in T2R14 or T2R38 mRNA levels were found among the inferior turbinate mucosae of the three groups. Positive T2R38 immunoreactivity was localized mainly in epithelial ciliated cells, whereas secretary goblet cells generally showed lack of staining. The patients in the non-ECRS group showed significantly lower oral and nasal FeNO levels compared with the control group. There was a trend towards higher CRS prevalence in the PAV/AVI and AVI/AVI genotype groups as compared to the PAV/PAV group. Our findings reveal complex but important roles of T2R38 function in ciliated cells associated with specific CRS phenotypes, suggesting the T2R38 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for promotion of endogenous defense mechanisms.

AB  - Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe congenital heart disease with 30% mortality from heart failure (HF) in the first year of life, but the cause of early HF remains unknown. Induced pluripotent stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) from patients with HLHS showed that early HF is associated with increased apoptosis, mitochondrial respiration defects, and redox stress from abnormal mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and failed antioxidant response. In contrast, iPSC-CM from patients without early HF showed normal respiration with elevated antioxidant response. Single-cell transcriptomics confirmed that early HF is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These findings indicate that uncompensated oxidative stress underlies early HF in HLHS. Importantly, mitochondrial respiration defects, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were rescued by treatment with sildenafil to inhibit mPTP opening or TUDCA to suppress ER stress. Together these findings point to the potential use of patient iPSC-CM for modeling clinical heart failure and the development of therapeutics.

AB  - The multi-systemic genetic disorder tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) impacts multiple neurodevelopmental processes including neuronal morphogenesis, neuronal migration, myelination and gliogenesis. These alterations contribute to the development of cerebral cortex abnormalities and malformations. Although TSC is caused by mTORC1 hyperactivation, cognitive and behavioral impairments are not improved through mTORC1 targeting, making the study of the downstream effectors of this complex important for understanding the mechanisms underlying TSC. As mTORC1 has been shown to promote the activity of the transcriptional co-activator Yap, we hypothesized that altered Yap/Taz signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of TSC. We first observed that the levels of Yap/Taz are increased in human cortical tuber samples and in embryonic cortices of Tsc2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. Next, to determine how abnormal upregulation of Yap/Taz impacts the neuropathology of TSC, we deleted Yap/Taz in Tsc2 cKO mice. Importantly, Yap/Taz/Tsc2 triple conditional knockout (tcKO) animals show reduced cortical thickness and cortical neuron cell size, despite the persistence of high mTORC1 activity, suggesting that Yap/Taz play a downstream role in cytomegaly. Furthermore, Yap/Taz/Tsc2 tcKO significantly restored cortical and hippocampal lamination defects and reduced hippocampal heterotopia formation. Finally, the loss of Yap/Taz increased the distribution of myelin basic protein in Tsc2 cKO animals, consistent with an improvement in myelination. Overall, our results indicate that targeting Yap/Taz lessens the severity of neuropathology in a TSC animal model. This study is the first to implicate Yap/Taz as contributors to cortical pathogenesis in TSC and therefore as potential novel targets in the treatment of this disorder.

AB  - Natural extracts are a rich source of biomolecules that are useful not only as antioxidant drugs or diet supplements but also as complex reagents for the biogenic synthesis of metallic nanoparticles. The natural product components can act as strong reducing and capping substrates guaranteeing the stability of formed NPs. The current work demonstrates the suitability of extracts of Camellia sinensis, Ilex paraguariensis, Salvia officinalis, Tilia cordata, Levisticum officinale, Aegopodium podagraria, Urtica dioica, Capsicum baccatum, Viscum album, and marine algae Porphyra Yezoensis for green synthesis of AgNPs. The antioxidant power of methanolic extracts was estimated at the beginning according to their free radical scavenging activity by the DPPH method and reducing power activity by CUPRAC and SNPAC (silver nanoparticle antioxidant capacity) assays. The results obtained by the CUPRAC and SNAPC methods exhibited excellent agreement (R-2 similar to 0.9). The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), dynamic light scattering (DLS) particle size, and zeta potential. The UV-vis absorption spectra showed a peak at 423 nm confirming the presence of AgNPs. The shapes of extract-mediated AgNPs were mainly spherical, spheroid, rod-shaped, agglomerated crystalline structures. The NPs exhibited a high negative zeta potential value in the range from -49.8 mV to -56.1 mV, proving the existence of electrostatic stabilization. FTIR measurements indicated peaks corresponding to different functional groups such as carboxylic acids, alcohol, phenol, esters, ethers, aldehydes, alkanes, and proteins, which were involved in the synthesis and stabilization of AgNPs. Among the examined extracts, green tea showed the highest activity in all antioxidant tests and enabled the synthesis of the smallest nanoparticles, namely 62.51, 61.19, and 53.55 nm, depending on storage times of 30 min, 24 h, and 72 h, respectively. In turn, the Capsicum baccatum extract was distinguished by the lowest zeta potential, decreasing with storage time from -66.0 up to -88.6 mM.

AB  - Environmental factors, including substance abuse and stress, cause long-lasting changes in the regulation of gene expression in the brain via epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation. We examined genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC, BA10) of 25 pairs of control and individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD), using the Infinium(R) MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We identified 5254 differentially methylated CpGs (p(nominal) < 0.005). Bioinformatic analyses highlighted biological processes containing genes related to stress adaptation, including the glucocorticoid receptor (encoded by NR3C1). Considering that alcohol is a stressor, we focused our attention on differentially methylated regions of the NR3C1 gene and validated the differential methylation of several genes in the NR3C1 network. Chronic alcohol drinking results in a significant increased methylation of the NR3C1 exon variant 1(H), with a particular increase in the levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine over 5-methylcytosine. These changes in DNA methylation were associated with reduced NR3C1 mRNA and protein expression levels in PFC, as well as other cortico-limbic regions of AUD subjects when compared with controls. Furthermore, we show that the expression of several stress-responsive genes (e.g., CRF, POMC, and FKBP5) is altered in the PFC of AUD subjects. These stress-response genes were also changed in the hippocampus, a region that is highly susceptible to stress. These data suggest that alcohol-dependent aberrant DNA methylation of NR3C1 and consequent changes in other stress-related genes might be fundamental in the pathophysiology of AUD and lay the groundwork for treatments targeting the epigenetic mechanisms regulating NR3C1 in AUD.

AB  - The WRKY gene family is essential for controlling a variety of plant physiological functions, yet the involvement of specific WRKY members in pigment biosynthesis and accumulation in Camellia chekiangoleosa remains unexplored, particularly in anthocyanins and carotenoids, which play crucial roles in the pigmentation of C. chekiangoleosa. This study systematically identified 87 WRKY genes across 15 chromosomes in C. chekiangoleosa through bioinformatic approaches. Further structural and phylogenetic analyses of these TFs enabled their classification into six different subgroups. WRKY family expansion was shown to be mostly driven by tandem duplication. W-box elements, which can be binding sites for WRKY transcription factors, were present in a number of biosynthetic genes in the pigment production pathway. Yeast one-hybrid assay confirmed that five WRKY transcription factors (CchWRKY15/24/33/47/76) directly bind to the promoter regions of two key biosynthetic genes, CchPSY1 and Cch4CL1. Intriguingly, among the five WRKYs tested, the expression levels of CchWRKY15, CchWRKY33, and CchWRKY47 showed the strongest positive associations with flavonoid accumulation (p < 0.05, Pearson correlation analysis).These findings provide novel insights into the evolutionary patterns, transcriptional regulation, and functional characteristics of CchWRKYs, while elucidating their possible regulatory mechanisms in the fruit coloration of C. chekiangoleosa.

AB  - Golden camellia is defined as a species of the Camellia genus with yellow flowers, which have long been used as a medicine, food, and cosmetic in many Asian countries. To date, more than 50 golden camellia species are considered endemic in Vietnam; however, more information is needed about its chemical constituents and biological activity. This work aims to unveil the potential of Camellia tienii Ninh, a golden camellia species, as an herbal beverage by examining the presence and abundance of chemical components in flowers and leaves. A comprehensive strategy has been developed using both liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Specifically, LC-MS-based widely targeted analyses were opted to characterize 158 polar metabolites belonging mainly to flavonoids, catechins, and amino acids classes, and an untargeted approach using GC-MS annotated 42 major volatile compounds such as terpenes and fatty acids. The extensive profile revealed by these techniques could help understand the significant discrimination between two organs. C. tienii flowers accumulated more flavonoids, amino acids, and fatty acids, while leaves contain more terpenes, suggesting different pharmacological properties of these materials. Overall, this pipeline can be applied for other Camellia species and valorization of these valuable resources for health benefits purposes.

AB  - Insecticide resistance is a global concern and requires immediate attention to manage dreadful insect pests. One of the resistance mechanisms adopted by insects is through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. These proteins rapidly transport and eliminate the insecticidal molecules across the lipid membranes (Phase III detoxification mechanism). In the present study, we investigated the potential role of ABC transporter genes in imparting insecticide resistance in field-collected insecticide resistant larvae of eggplant shoot and fruit borer (Leucinodes orbonalis; Crambidae: Lepidoptera). Dose-mortality bioassays against five insecticidal molecules revealed moderate to high levels of insecticide resistance (32.2. to 134.1-fold). Thirty-one genes encoding ABC transporter proteins were mined from the transcriptome resources of L. orbonalis. They were classified under eight sub-families (ABCA to ABCH). Phylogenetic analysis indicated ABCG is the most divergent, composed of nine genes as compared to many other insects. Transcriptome analysis of the insecticide resistant and susceptible strains of L. orbonalis revealed differential expression of 13 ABC transporter genes. The altered expression of these genes was further validated using qRT-PCR. The knockdown studies indicated the involvement of ABCD1 and ABCG2 genes in chlorantraniliprole resistance in the insecticide-resistant strain of L. orbonalis. This study unveils the additional mechanisms employed by L. orbonalis in resisting insecticide toxicity through accelerated excretion mode. These ABCD and ABCG family genes could be candidate targets in developing genome-assisted pest management strategies in the future.

AB  - Trauma-related intrusive memories (TR-IMs) possess unique phenomenological properties that contribute to adverse post-traumatic outcomes, positioning them as critical intervention targets. However, transdiagnostic treatments for TR-IMs are scarce, as their underlying mechanisms have been investigated separate from their unique phenomenological properties. Extant models of more general episodic memory highlight dynamic hippocampal-cortical interactions that vary along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus (HPC) to support different cognitive-affective and sensory-perceptual features of memory. Extending this work into the unique properties of TR-IMs, we conducted a study of eighty-four trauma-exposed adults who completed daily ecological momentary assessments of TR-IM properties followed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Spatiotemporal dynamics of anterior and posterior hippocampal (a/pHPC)-cortical networks were assessed using co-activation pattern analysis to investigate their associations with different properties of TR-IMs. Emotional intensity of TR-IMs was inversely associated with the frequency and persistence of an aHPC-default mode network co-activation pattern. Conversely, sensory features of TR-IMs were associated with more frequent co-activation of the HPC with sensory cortices and the ventral attention network, and the reliving of TR-IMs in the "here-and-now" was associated with more persistent co-activation of the pHPC and the visual cortex. Notably, no associations were found between HPC-cortical network dynamics and conventional symptom measures, including TR-IM frequency or retrospective recall, underscoring the utility of ecological assessments of memory properties in identifying their neural substrates. These findings provide novel insights into the neural correlates of the unique features of TR-IMs that are critical for the development of individualized, transdiagnostic treatments for this pervasive, difficult-to-treat symptom.

AB  - Dravet syndrome (DS) is an epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in the Scn1a gene encoding the alpha 1 subunit of the Nav1.1 sodium channel, which is associated with recurrent and generalized seizures, even leading to death. In experimental models of DS, histological alterations have been found in the brain; however, the retina is a projection of the brain and there are no studies that analyze the possible histological changes that may occur in the disease. This study analyzes the retinal histological changes in glial cells (microglia and astrocytes), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and GABAergic amacrine cells in an experimental model of DS (Syn-Cre/Scn1a(WT/A1783V)) compared to a control group at postnatal day (PND) 25. Retinal whole-mounts were labeled with anti-GFAP, anti-Iba-1, anti-Brn3a and anti-GAD65/67. Signs of microglial and astroglial activation, and the number of Brn3a+ and GAD65+67+ cells were quantified. We found retinal activation of astroglial and microglial cells but not death of RGCs and GABAergic amacrine cells. These changes are similar to those found at the level of the hippocampus in the same experimental model in PND25, indicating a relationship between brain and retinal changes in DS. This suggests that the retina could serve as a possible biomarker in DS.

AB  - Maternal infections during pregnancy and the consequent maternal immune activation (MIA) are the major risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Epidemiological evidence is corroborated by the preclinical models in which MIA leads to ASD-like behavioral abnormalities and altered neuroinflammatory profiles, with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial markers. In addition to neuroinflammatory response, an abnormal expression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) has been identified in neurodevelopmental disorders and have been found to correlate with disease severity. Our aim was to evaluate the transcriptional profile of several ERV families, ERV-related genes, and inflammatory mediators (by RT real-time PCR) in mouse offspring of both sexes, prenatally exposed to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA molecule targeting TLR-3 that mimics viral maternal infection during pregnancy. We found that prenatal exposure to Poly I:C deregulated the expression of some ERVs and ERV-related genes both in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, while no changes were detected in the blood. Interestingly, sex-related differences in the expression levels of some ERVs, ERV-related genes, and inflammatory mediators that were higher in females than in males emerged only in PFC. Our findings support the tissue specificity of ERV and ERV-related transcriptional profiles in MIA mice.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity is a cellular process involved in learning and memory by which specific patterns of neural activity adapt the synaptic strength and efficacy of the synaptic transmission. Its induction is governed by fine tuning between excitatory/inhibitory synaptic transmission. In experimental conditions, synaptic plasticity can be artificially evoked at hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by repeated stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. However, long-lasting synaptic modifications studies during memory formation in physiological conditions in freely moving animals are very scarce. Here, to study synaptic plasticity phenomena during recognition memory in the dorsal hippocampus, field postsynaptic potentials (fPSPs) evoked at the CA3-CA1 synapse were recorded in freely moving mice during object-recognition task performance. Paired pulse stimuli were applied to Schaffer collaterals at the moment that the animal explored a new or a familiar object along different phases of the test. Stimulation evoked a complex synaptic response composed of an ionotropic excitatory glutamatergic fEPSP, followed by two inhibitory responses, an ionotropic, GABA(A)-mediated fIPSP and a metabotropic, G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GirK) channel-mediated fIPSP. Our data showed the induction of LTP-like enhancements for both the glutamatergic and GirK-dependent components of the dorsal hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse during the exploration of novel but not familiar objects. These results support the contention that synaptic plasticity processes that underlie hippocampal-dependent memory are sustained by fine tuning mechanisms that control excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission balance.

TI  - Distinct Regulation of Dopamine D3 Receptor in the Basolateral Amygdala and Dentate Gyrus during the Reinstatement of Cocaine CPP Induced by Drug Priming and Social Stress

AB  - Relapse in the seeking and intake of cocaine is one of the main challenges when treating its addiction. Among the triggering factors for the recurrence of cocaine use are the re-exposure to the drug and stressful events. Cocaine relapse engages the activity of memory-related nuclei, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), which are responsible for emotional and episodic memories. Moreover, D3 receptor (D3R) antagonists have recently arisen as a potential treatment for preventing drug relapse. Thus, we have assessed the impact of D3R blockade in the expression of some dopaminergic markers and the activity of the mTOR pathway, which is modulated by D3R, in the BLA and DG during the reinstatement of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) evoked by drug priming and social stress. Reinstatement of cocaine CPP paralleled an increasing trend in D3R and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in the BLA. Social stress, but not drug-induced reactivation of cocaine memories, was prevented by systemic administration of SB-277011-A (a selective D3R antagonist), which was able, however, to impede D3R and DAT up-regulation in the BLA during CPP reinstatement evoked by both stress and cocaine. Concomitant with cocaine CPP reactivation, a diminution in mTOR phosphorylation (activation) in the BLA and DG occurred, which was inhibited by D3R blockade in both nuclei before the social stress episode and only in the BLA when CPP reinstatement was provoked by a cocaine prime. Our data, while supporting a main role for D3R signalling in the BLA in the reactivation of cocaine memories evoked by social stress, indicate that different neural circuits and signalling mechanisms might mediate in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviours depending upon the triggering stimuli.

AB  - As the global population ages, the mechanisms underlying age-related susceptibility to delirium have attracted attention. Given the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of inflammation-related delirium, we investigated the temporal dynamics of neurobehavioral changes and microglial responses, following lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 200 mu g/kg) administration in young and old male C57BL/6 mice. Although a similar illness trajectory across 48 h post-treatment (HPT) was observed in both age groups, old-LPS mice exhibited worsened delirium-like behavior. At 48 HPT, in old but not young mice, significantly decreased hippocampal neuronal activity coincided with microglial overactivation. Widespread hippocampal microglial activation was present at 3 HPT but subsided by 12 HPT in young but not old mice, indicating a generally retarded but prolonged microglial response to LPS challenge in old mice. However, for both age groups, at 3 HPT, p16INK4a-negative microglia (with low abundance in the aged brain) exhibited comparable morphological activation, which was not observed for p16INK4a-positive microglia (highly abundant in the aged brain). These results suggest that age-related susceptibility to LPS-induced delirium-like behavior accompanied by different patterns of microglial response might implicate microglial composition shifts and that optimizing microglial composition represents a promising approach to reduce vulnerability to inflammatory challenge.

AB  - Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a major human prion disease worldwide. CJD is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal prion protein (PrPSc). To date, the exact etiology of sporadic CJD has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the E200K and V203I somatic mutations of the prion protein gene (PRNP) in sporadic CJD patients and matched healthy controls using pyrosequencing. In addition, we estimated the impact of somatic mutations on the human prion protein (PrP) using PolyPhen-2, PANTHER and PROVEAN. Furthermore, we evaluated the 3D structure and electrostatic potential of the human PrP according to somatic mutations using DeepView. The rates of PRNP K200 somatic mutation were significantly increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of sporadic CJD patients compared to the matched controls. In addition, the electrostatic potential of the human PrP was significantly changed by the K200 somatic mutation of the PRNP gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on an association of the PRNP K200 somatic mutation with sporadic CJD.

AB  - Chronic pain is a significant health problem worldwide. Recent evidence has suggested that the ventral hippocampus is dysfunctional in humans and rodents, with decreased neuronal excitability and connectivity with other brain regions, parallel pain chronicity, and persistent nociceptive hypersensitivity. But the molecular mechanisms underlying hippocampal modulation of pain remain poorly elucidated. In this study, we used ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recording, immunofluorescence staining, and behavioral tests to examine whether hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels 2 (HCN2) in the ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) were involved in regulating nociceptive perception and CFA-induced inflammatory pain in mice. Reduced sag potential and firing rate of action potentials were observed in vCA1 pyramidal neurons from CFA-injected mice. Moreover, the expression of HCN2, but not HCN1, in vCA1 decreased in mice injected with CFA. HCN2 knockdown in vCA1 pyramidal neurons induced thermal hypersensitivity, whereas overexpression of HCN2 alleviated thermal hyperalgesia induced by intraplantar injection of CFA in mice. Our findings suggest that HCN2 in the vCA1 plays an active role in pain modulation and could be a promising target for the treatment of chronic pain.

AB  - Vascular endothelium maintains vascular homeostasis through liberating a spectrum of vasoactive molecules, both protective and harmful regulators of vascular tone, structural remodeling, inflammation and atherogenesis. An intricate balance between endothelium-derived relaxing factors (nitric oxide, prostacyclin and endotheliumderived hyperpolarizing factor) and endothelium-derived contracting factors (superoxide anion, endothelin-1 and constrictive prostaglandins) tightly regulates vascular function. Disruption of such balance signifies endothelial dysfunction, a critical contributor in aging and chronic cardiometabolic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic vascular diseases. Among many proposed cellular and molecular mechanisms causing endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation are often the pivotal players and they are naturally considered as useful targets for intervention in patients with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. In this article, we provide a recent update on the therapeutic values of pharmacological agents, such as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors, bone morphogenic protein 4 inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta agonists, and glucagon-like peptide 1-elevating drugs, and the physiological factors, particularly hemodynamic forces, that improve endothelial function by targeting endothelial oxidative stress and inflammation.

AB  - This paper provides a detailed identification and assessment of hormetic dose responses in neural stem cells (NSCs) as identified in a number of animal models and human tissues, with particular emphasis on cell proliferation and differentiation. Hormetic dose responses were commonly observed following administration of a number of agents, including dietary supplements [e.g., berberine, curcumin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), Ginkgo Biloba, resveratrol], pharmaceuticals (e.g., lithium, lovastatin, melatonin), endogenous ligands [e.g., hydrogen sulfide (H2S), magnesium, progesterone, taurine], environmental contaminants (e.g., arsenic, rotenone) and physical agents [e.g., hypoxia, ionizing radiation, electromagnetic radiation (EMF)]. These data indicate that numerous agents can induce hormetic dose responses to upregulate key functions of such as cell proliferation and differentiation in NSCs, and enhance resilience to inflammatory stresses. The paper assesses both putative mechanisms of hormetic responses in NSCs, and the potential therapeutic implications and application(s) of hormetic frameworks in clinical approaches to neurological injury and disease.

AB  - The edible parts of the plants Camellia sinensis, Vitis vinifera and Withania somnifera were extensively used in ancient practices such as Ayurveda, owing to their potent biomedical significance. They are very rich in secondary metabolites such as polyphenols, which are very good antioxidants and exhibit anti-carcinogenic properties. This study aims to evaluate the anti-cancerous properties of these plant crude extracts on human liver cancer HepG2 cells. The leaves of Camellia sinensis, Withania somnifera and the seeds of Vitis vinifera were collected and methanolic extracts were prepared. Then, these extracts were subjected to DPPH, alpha- amylase assays to determine the antioxidant properties. A MTT assay was performed to investigate the viability of the extracts of HepG2 cells, and the mode of cell death was detected by Ao/EtBr staining and flow cytometry with PI Annexin- V FITC dual staining. Then, the protein expression of BAX and BCl2 was studied using fluorescent dye to determine the regulation of the BAX and BCl2 genes. We observed that all the three extracts showed the presence of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols or phytochemicals. The W. somnifera bioactive compounds were found to have the highest anti-proliferative activity on human liver cancer cells.

AB  - Cognitive impairment, a core symptom of psychiatric disorders, is frequently observed in adolescents exposed to early-life stress (ES). However, the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear, and therapeutic efficacy is limited. Targeting parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), we report that ES reduces mPFC PVI activity, which causally mediated ES-induced cognitive deficits in adolescent male mice through chemogenetic and optogenetic experiments. To understand the possible causes of PVI activity reduction following ES, we then demonstrated that ES upregulated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor 1 [CRHR1, mainly expressed in pyramidal neurons (PNs)] and reduced activity of local pyramidal neurons (PNs) and their excitatory inputs to PVIs. The subsequent genetic manipulation experiments (CRHR1 knockout, CRH overexpression, and chemogenetics) highlight that ES-induced PVI activity reduction may result from CRHR1 upregulation and PN activity downregulation and that PVIs play indispensable roles in CRHR1- or PN-mediated cognitive deficits induced by ES. These results suggest that ES-induced cognitive deficits could be attributed to the prefrontal CRHR1-PN-PVI pathway. Finally, treatment with antalarmin (a CRHR1 antagonist) and environmental enrichment successfully restored the PVI activity and cognitive deficits induced by ES. These findings reveal the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ES-induced cognitive deficits in adolescent male mice and highlight the therapeutic potentials of PVIs in stress-related cognitive deficits in adolescent individuals.

AB  - Background: Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that prolonged exposure to propofol (A general anaesthetics) can lead to hippocampus injury in immature brains and impact long-term learning and memory functions. Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the impairment of brain function associated with early exposure to anesthetic drugs. Nevertheless, the involvement of hippocampal pyroptosis and neuroinflammation mediated by the NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling cascade in propofol-induced developmental neurotoxicity remains unclear. Methods: Postnatal day (PND) 7 SD rats, PC12 cells, and HAPI cells were used to establish propofol neurotoxicity models in vivo and in vitro, respectively. We examined the potential hippocampal injury and cognitive dysfunction caused by propofol in neonatal rats through the NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathway using MCC950 and VX765 to inhibit the pathway. This investigation involved assessing histological changes in the hippocampus, behavioral performance in adulthood, NLRP3-related pyroptosis indicators, and neuroinflammatory cytokines. Results: Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that exposure to propofol activates the NLRP3/ caspase-1 signaling cascade in the hippocampus of PND7 rats, leading to pyroptosis, neuroinflammation, and subsequent hippocampal injury and behavioral changes in adulthood. However, MCC950 and VX765 inhibit the NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling cascade, reversing the developmental neurotoxicity of propofol. Conclusion: Our study findings suggest that negative regulation of NLRP3/caspase-1 activation may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for developmental neuroinflammation induced by propofol.

AB  - In direct lineage conversion, transcription factor (TF) overexpression reconfigures gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to reprogram cell identity. We previously developed CellOracle, a computational method to infer GRNs from single-cell transcriptome and epigenome data. Using inferred GRNs, CellOracle simulates gene expression changes in response to TF perturbation, enabling in silico interrogation of network reconfiguration. Here, we combine CellOracle analysis with lineage tracing of fibroblast to induced endoderm progenitor (iEP) conversion, a prototypical direct reprogramming paradigm. By linking early network state to reprogramming outcome, we reveal distinct network configurations underlying successful and failed fate conversion. Via in silico simulation of TF perturbation, we identify new fac-tors to coax cells into successfully converting their identity, uncovering a central role for the AP-1 subunit Fos with the Hippo signaling effector, Yap1. Together, these results demonstrate the efficacy of CellOracle to infer and interpret cell-type-specific GRN configurations, providing new mechanistic insights into lineage reprogramming.

AB  - Voluntary physical exercise is a robust enhancer of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). A complete understanding of the molecular regulation of AHN is important in order to exploit the benefits of the process toward therapeutic approaches. Several factors such as epigenetic modifiers, non-coding RNAs, and transcription factors have been reported to regulate AHN. However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) on exercise-mediated AHN, in spite of their well-documented significance in embryonic neurogenesis. The present study is the first global analysis to catalog the potential RBPs influencing exercise-mediated AHN. Here, a transcriptome meta-analysis was conducted to study exercise-mediated gene expression modulation in hippocampi of adult mice. Next, potential RBPs influencing transcriptome-wide expression changes via untranslated regions (UTRs) were identified. Among other RBPs, MATR3, Musashi, TIA1, and FXR2 (known critical modulators of neurogenesis) were found to potentially regulate gene expression patterns. Subsequently, binding sites of known neurogenesis-regulating RBPs were identified in the UTRs of AHN-associated genes modulated by exercise. Finally, a number of RBPs including RBFOX1, RBFOX3, and QKI (known regulators of neurogenesis) were found to be highly expressed in mouse hippocampal formation and also potentially interact with other RBPs, suggesting their combinatorial functioning in exercise-induced AHN. Thus, the present meta-analysis-based computational study identified several RBPs potentially important in exercise-induced AHN, which could form a foundation for further experiments to unravel RBP-mediated regulation of AHN.

AB  - The YAP-TEAD transcriptional complex is responsible for the expression of genes that regulate cancer cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway due to overexpression of YAP has been reported in various cancers. Inhibition of TEAD represses the expression of associated genes, proving the value of this transcription factor for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. We retrieved a promising hit compound L06 which is a potent TEAD4 inhibitor through docking-based virtual screening. L06 inhibits TEAD autopalmitoylation, interrupts YAP-TEAD interaction, and reduces the YAP-TEAD transcriptional activity. Moreover, L06 reduces the expression of CTGF, inhibits HCT 116 colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The YAP-TEAD complex is a viable drug target, and L06 is a lead compound for the development of more potent TEAD inhibitors to treat colorectal cancer and other hyperproliferative pathologies.

AB  - Optosensorics is the direction of research possessing the possibility of non-invasive monitoring of the concentration of intracellular ions or activity of intracellular components using specific biosensors. In recent years, genetically encoded proteins have been used as effective optosensory means. These probes possess fluorophore groups capable of changing fluorescence when interacting with certain ions or molecules. For monitoring of intracellular concentrations of chloride ([Cl-](i)) and hydrogen ([H+] (i)) the construct, called ClopHensor, which consists of a H+- and Cl--sensitive variant of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (E(2)GFP) fused with a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mDsRed) has been proposed. We recently developed a line of transgenic mice expressing ClopHensor in neurons and obtained the map of its expression in different areas of the brain. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of transgenic mice expressing ClopHensor for estimation of [H+](i) and [Cl-](i) concentrations in neurons of brain slices. We performed simultaneous monitoring of [H+](i) and [Cl-](i) under different experimental conditions including changing of external concentrations of ions (Ca2+, Cl-, K+, Na+) and synaptic stimulation of Shaffer's collaterals of hippocampal slices. The results obtained illuminate different pathways of regulation of Cl- and pH equilibrium in neurons and demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing ClopHensor represent a reliable tool for non-invasive simultaneous monitoring of intracellular Cl- and pH.

AB  - Excitotoxic events underlying ischaemic and traumatic brain injuries activate degenerative and protective pathways, particularly in the hippocampus. To understand opposing pathways that determine the brain's response to excitotoxicity, we used hippocampal explants, thereby eliminating systemic variables during a precise protocol of excitatory stimulation. N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) was applied for 20 min and total RNA isolated one and 24 h later for neurobiology-specific microarrays. Distinct groups of genes exhibited early vs. delayed induction, with 63 genes exclusively reduced 24-h post-insult. Egr-1 and NOR-1 displayed biphasic transcriptional modulation: early induction followed by delayed suppression. Opposing events of NMDA-induced genes linked to pathogenesis and cell survival constituted the early expression signature. Delayed degenerative indicators (up-regulated pathogenic genes, down-regulated pro-survival genes) and opposing compensatory responses (down-regulated pathogenic genes, up-regulated pro-survival genes) generated networks with temporal gene profiles mirroring coexpression network clustering. We then used the expression profiles to test whether NF-kappa B, a potent transcription factor implicated in both degenerative and protective pathways, is involved in the opposing responses. The NF-kappa B inhibitor MG-132 indeed altered NMDA-mediated transcriptional changes, revealing components of opposing expression signatures that converge on the single response element. Overall, this study identified counteracting avenues among the distinct responses to excitotoxicity, thereby suggesting multi-target treatment strategies and implications for predictive medicine.

AB  - Cancerous transcriptome alterations in carcinoma cells could be originated from either genetic copy number changes or epigenetic reprogramming. Ovarian cancer (OV) is the most malignant gynecologic tumor, known for high aneuploidy with robust copy number alterations. However, low aneuploidy ovarian tumors are also frequently found, indicating an essential contribution of epigenetic factors during tumorigenesis and cancer development. Chromatin remodeling modulates the transcriptome epigenetically in a variety of cancer types, but its role in OV is still unclear. Hence, we investigated a cohort of 102 OV patients, analyzed transcriptomic and clinical data from public databases, and performed cellular experiments. We found that RUVBL2, a subunit of the INO80 complex, functions as the key oncogenic chromatin remodeler in OV. RUVBL2 is upregulated in tumors, particularly in low-aneuploidy cases, and is associated with poor prognosis. RUVBL2 drives nucleosome dynamics and elevates chromatin accessibility selectively at promoter regions. The landscape of RUVBL2-dependent modulation of chromatin accessibility and the transcriptome exhibits activation of various transcription factors, especially the AP-1 family, and upregulation of a series of key genes, including CDKN3, MYBL2, and ZNF144, resulting in mediation of cell cycle and Hippo signaling pathway to promote DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Hence, RUVBL2-dependent chromatin remodeling plays a key role in oncogenic reprogramming of the transcriptome in OV. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular etiology of OV and disclose potential biomarkers and drug targets.

AB  - The leaves of Ilex paraguariensis (known as Yerba mate), used as a popular beverage, are a very well-recognized plant material with various biological activities, including analeptic (because of caffeine), anti-obesity (phenolics, saponins), antimicrobial, and antiviral (phenolics, saponins). Here, the chemical compositions of the leaves of two European Ilex species (x meserveae and aquifolium) with three varieties each were investigated. The terpenoid, saponin, and polyphenolic fractions were submitted for LC-MS or GC-MS analysis against a standard Mate leaf. In addition, the aroma profiles of all the species were analysed using HS-SPME-Arrow prior to GC-MS analysis. All fractions were subjected to antiviral and cytotoxic assays. We found 86 compounds in all accessions, with limonene, linalool, and p-cymene being predominant. There were minor similarities between the volatile compositions of the European and South American species. We found ursolic and oleanolic acid to be the main compounds in the terpenoid fraction. Mono-caffeoylquinic acids and di-caffeoylquinic acids were the main constituents of the polar fractions. About 180 compounds from the saponin group were tentatively identified, of which 9 and 3 were selected as distinctive markers for I. meserveae and I. aquifolium, respectively. Based on chemical screening, I. aquifolium Silver Queen was chosen as the source of terpenoid and saponin fractions and polyphenol extracts. The most substantial inhibition of cancer cell growth was observed with saponin in the case of the MCF7 (human breast cancer) cell line, while for LoVo and L929 cell lines (human colorectal cancer and reference mouse fibroblasts), it was slightly weaker. These results should be analysed further as a promising chemoprevention of colorectal and gastrointestinal cancers. Saponin and polyphenolic extracts exhibited similar activities against HSV-1 and HAdV-5, with 4-log reduction in virus titres. This study focuses our attention on a field of potential antiviral formulations derived from European holly.

AB  - The plant MADS-box transcription factor family is a major regulator of plant flower development and reproduction, and the AGAMOUS-LIKE11/SEEDSTICK (AGL11/STK) subfamily plays conserved functions in the seed development of flowering plants. Camellia japonica is a world-famous ornamental flower, and its seed kernels are rich in highly valuable fatty acids. Seed abortion has been found to be common in C. japonica, but little is known about how it is regulated during seed development. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the MADS-box gene the in C. japonica genome and identified 126 MADS-box genes. Through gene expression profiling in various tissue types, we revealed the C/D-class MADS-box genes were preferentially expressed in seed-related tissues. We identified the AGL11/STK-like gene, CjSTK, and showed that it contained a typical STK motif and exclusively expressed during seed development. We found a significant increase in the CjSTK expression level in aborted seeds compared with normally developing seeds. Furthermore, overexpression of CjSTK in Arabidopsis thaliana caused shorter pods and smaller seeds. Taken together, we concluded that the fine regulation of the CjSTK expression at different stages of seed development is critical for ovule formation and seed abortion in C. japonica. The present study provides evidence revealing the regulation of seed development in Camellia.

AB  - The hippocampus is crucial for acquiring and retrieving episodic and contextual memories. In previous studies, the inactivation of dentate gyrus (DG) neurons by chemogenetic- and optogenetic-mediated hyperpolarization led to opposing conclusions about DG's role in memory retrieval. One study used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD)-mediated clozapine N-oxide (CNO)-induced hyperpolarization and reported that the previously formed memory was erased, thus concluding that denate gyrus is needed for memory maintenance. The other study used optogenetic with halorhodopsin induced hyperpolarization and reported and dentate gyrus is needed for memory retrieval. We hypothesized that this apparent discrepancy could be due to the length of hyperpolarization in previous studies; minutes by optogenetics and several hours by DREADD/CNO. Since hyperpolarization interferes with anterograde and retrograde neuronal signaling, it is possible that the memory engram in the dentate gyrus and the entorhinal to hippocampus trisynaptic circuit was erased by long-term, but not with short-term hyperpolarization. We developed and applied an advanced chemogenetic technology to selectively silence synaptic output by blocking neurotransmitter release without hyperpolarizing DG neurons to explore this apparent discrepancy. We performed in vivo electrophysiology during trace eyeblink in a rabbit model of associative learning. Our work shows that the DG output is required for memory retrieval. Based on previous and recent findings, we propose that the actively functional anterograde and retrograde neuronal signaling is necessary to preserve synaptic memory engrams along the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit.

AB  - Matcha is a powdered green tea obtained from the Camellia sinensis L. plant intended for both "hot" and "cold" consumption. It is a rich source of bioactive ingredients, thanks to which it has strong antioxidant properties. In this research, an organoleptic evaluation was carried out, and the physical characteristics (i.e., instrumental color measurement (L*a*b*), water activity, water solubility index (WSI), water holding capacity (WHC) of 10 powdered Matcha green teas, and in the 2.5% Matcha water solutions, pH, degrees Brix and osmolality were tested. Also, the content of phenolic ingredients, i.e., selected phenolic acids, flavonoids and total polyphenols, was assessed. The content of chlorophyll, vitamin C and antioxidant potential were also examined. Matcha M-4 was used to design two functional model beverages, in the form of ready-to-use powdered drinks, consisting of Matcha green tea, protein preparations, inulin, maltodextrin and sugar. The obtained powdered drink, when dissolved in the preferred liquid (water, milk, juice), is regenerative, high-protein and rich in bioactive ingredients from the Matcha drink, with prebiotic properties derived from the added inulin. The beverage is also characterized by low osmolality. It can be recommended as a regenerating beverage for a wide group of consumers, athletes and people with deficiencies, among others protein, and elderly people, as well as in the prevention and supportive treatment of bone and joint tissue diseases.

AB  - Growth-regulating factor (GRF) is a kind of transcription factor unique to plants, playing an important role in the flowering regulation, growth, and development of plants. Melastoma dodecandrum is an important member of Melastomataceae, with ornamental, medicinal, and edible benefits. The identification of the GRF gene family in M. dodecandrum can help to improve their character of flavor and continuous flowering. The members of the GRF gene family were identified from the M. dodecandrum genome, and their bioinformatics, selective pressure, and expression patterns were analyzed. The results showed that there were 20 GRF genes in M. dodecandrum. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 71 GRF genes from M. dodecandrum, Arabidopsis thaliana, Camellia sinensis, and Oryza sativa can be divided into three clades and six subclades. The 20 GRF genes of M. dodecandrum were distributed in twelve chromosomes and one contig. Furthermore, the gene structure and motif analysis showed that the intron and motif within each clade were very similar, but there were great differences among different clades. The promoter contained cis-acting elements related to hormone induction, stress, and growth and development. Different transcriptomic expression of MdGRFs indicated that MdGRFs may be involved in regulating the growth and development of M. dodecandrum. The results laid a foundation for further study on the function and molecular mechanism of the M. dodecandrum GRF gene family.

AB  - Growing evidence supports the pivotal role of the bidirectional interplay between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system during the progression of alcohol use disorder (AUD). In our previous study, supplementation with sodium butyrate (SB) in C57BL/6J mice prevented increased ethanol consumption in a binge-like drinking paradigm (DID) as a result of treatment with a non-absorbable antibiotic cocktail (ABX). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SB protection against enhanced ABX-induced ethanol consumption in mice is partially due to modulation of neuroinflammatory responses. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as changes in microglia and astrocytes were analyzed in hippocampus tissues from ABX-, SB-, ABX+SB-treated mice subjected to 4-week DID. We found that ethanol without or with ABX treatment increased mRNA levels of key brain cytokines (MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-10) while SB supplementation prevented these changes. Additionally, SB supplementation prevented changes in microglia, i.e., increase in Iba-1 positive cell number and morphology, and in astrocytes, i.e., decrease in GFAP-positive cell number, induced by combination of ethanol and ABX treatments. Our results suggest that gut microbiota metabolites can influence drinking behavior by modulation of neuroinflammation, highlighting the potential for microbiome-targeting strategies for treatment or prevention of AUD.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in biological processes by regulating specific gene expression. Limited miRNAs information is available on embryonic development in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) so far. In this study, six important embryonic development stages of C. carpio were collected to perform a times-series of small RNA-seq experiments from cleavage, blastocyst, gastrulation, organ formation, hatching stage to 1 day post-hatching larva. The expression profiles of miRNAs were identified and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were screened out based on pairwise comparison. A mean of 12,744,989 raw reads and 9,888,123 clean reads were obtained from each library. A total of 2565 miRNAs were identified. 68 of 204 DEMs were overlapped with stage-specific miRNAs, in which 15 were known miRNAs and seemed to play a key role in embryogenesis. Additionally, time-course expression reveals several intriguing fluctuations during embryogenesis. Numerous signaling pathways were identified in embryonic development, including the phototransduction, hippo signaling pathway, Wnt, melanogenesis, histidine metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. The results would provide new insight into the roles of miRNAs in embryonic development, and would help us to advance the understanding of miRNA-mediated mechanisms in embryonic development of fish.

AB  - Prolactin is a hormone with demonstrated roles in the brain, including neurogenesis, neuroprotection, learning, stress response or memory consolidation. To determine the prolactin expression in the rat hippocampus during aging and to resolve some controversies related to the presence of prolactin in the hippocampus, the aim of this study was to analyze whether changes occur in the expression of prolactin during different stages of life. To determine this, we designed an experimental study in which we analyzed the expression and location of prolactin in the rat hippocampus, Ammon's horn and Dentate Gyrus, during different stages of life (prepubertal, postpubertal, young adult, adult and old) and checked if there are differences related to sex. Overall, the results obtained show that prolactin is present in the rat hippocampus and that prolactin is synthesized, as deduced from the findings obtained via ELISA, immunohistochemistry, qPCR and in situ hybridization. After analyzing the correlation between serum and hippocampal prolactin levels and comparing the amounts of Prl mRNA and the hormone, the results obtained suggest that hippocampal prolactin has a dual origin: local synthesis of the hormone and its passage from the blood. On the other hand, the amounts of prolactin and its mRNA in the hippocampus vary with sex and age, suggesting the existence of age-related sexual dimorphism. The results obtained suggest that hippocampal aging is related to a decrease in the hippocampal prolactin system, which helps to better understand brain aging.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) is impaired during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Curcumin has been reported to reduce cell apoptosis and stimulate neurogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the influence of curcumin on adult neurogenesis in AD mice and its potential mechanism. Two-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were injected with soluble beta-amyloid (A beta 1-42) using lateral ventricle stereolocalization to establish AD models. An immunofluorescence assay, including bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), doublecortin (DCX), and neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN), was used to detect hippocampal neurogenesis. Western blot and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to test the expression of related proteins and the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A Morris water maze was used to detect the cognitive function of the mice. Our results showed that curcumin administration (100 mg/kg) rescued the impaired neurogenesis of A beta 1-42 mice, shown as enhanced BrdU+/DCX+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ cells in DG. In addition, curcumin regulated the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) -mediated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta) /Wingless/Integrated (Wnt)/beta-catenin pathway and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB)/BDNF in A beta 1-42 mice. Inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin and depriving BDNF could reverse both the upregulated neurogenesis and cognitive function of curcumin-treated A beta 1-42 mice. In conclusion, our study indicates that curcumin, through targeting PI3K/Akt, regulates GSK3 beta/Wnt/beta-catenin and CREB/BDNF pathways, improving the adult neurogenesis of AD mice.

AB  - Reductions of astroglia expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are consistently found in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients with depression and in rodent chronic stress models. Here, we examine the consequences of PFC GFAP+ cell depletion and cell activity enhancement on depressive-like behaviors in rodents. Using viral expression of diphtheria toxin receptor in PFC GFAP+ cells, which allows experimental depletion of these cells following diphtheria toxin administration, we demonstrated that PFC GFAP+ cell depletion induced anhedonia-like behavior within 2 days and lasting up to 8 days, but no anxiety-like deficits. Conversely, activating PFC GFAP+ cell activity for 3 weeks using designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) reversed chronic restraint stress-induced anhedonia-like deficits, but not anxiety-like deficits. Our results highlight a critical role of cortical astroglia in the development of anhedonia and further support the idea of targeting astroglia for the treatment of depression.

AB  - Tea leaf-color mutants have attracted increasing attention due to their accumulation of quality-related biochemical components. However, there is limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind leaf-color bud mutation in tea plants. In this study, a chlorina tea shoot (HY) and a green tea shoot (LY) from the same tea plant were investigated using transcriptome and biochemical analyses. The results showed that the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll contents in the HY were significantly lower than the LY's, which might have been caused by the activation of several genes related to chlorophyll degradation, such as SGR and CLH. The down-regulation of the CHS, DFR, and ANS involved in flavonoid biosynthesis might result in the reduction in catechins, and the up-regulated GDHA and GS2 might bring about the accumulation of glutamate in HY. RT-qPCR assays of nine DEGs confirmed the RNA-seq results. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of the chlorophyll deficient-induced metabolic change in tea plants.

AB  - Brown planthopper (BPH), a monophagous phloem feeder, consumes a large amount of photoassimilates in rice and causes wilting. A near-isogenic line 'TNG71-Bph45' was developed from the Oryza sativa japonica variety 'Tainung 71 (TNG71) carrying a dominant BPH-resistance locus derived from Oryza nivara (IRGC 102165) near the centromere of chromosome 4. We compared the NIL (TNG71-Bph45) and the recurrent parent to explore how the Bph45 gene confers BPH resistance. We found that TNG71-Bph45 is less attractive to BPH at least partially because it produces less limonene. Chiral analysis revealed that the major form of limonene in both rice lines was the L-form. However, both L- and D-limonene attracted BPH when applied exogenously to TNG71-Bph45 rice. The transcript amounts of limonene synthase were significantly higher in TNG71 than in TNG71-Bph45 and were induced by BPH infestation only in the former. Introgression of the Bph45 gene into another japonica variety, Tainan 11, also resulted in a low limonene content. Moreover, several dominantly acting BPH resistance genes introduced into the BPH-sensitive IR24 line compromised its limonene-producing ability and concurrently decreased its attractiveness to BPH. These observations suggest that reducing limonene production may be a common resistance strategy against BPH in rice.

AB  - We describe the design, synthesis, and application of voltage-sensitive silicon rhodamines. Based on the Berkeley Red Sensor of Transmembrane potential, or BeRST, scaffold, the new dyes possess an isomeric molecular wire for improved alignment in the plasma membrane and 2 ' carboxylic acids for ready functionalization. The new isoBeRST dyes have a voltage sensitivity of 24% Delta F/F per 100 mV. Combined with a flexible polyethyleneglycol (PEG) linker and a chloroalkane HaloTag ligand, isoBeRST dyes enable voltage imaging from genetically defined cells and neurons and provide improved labeling over previous, rhodamine-based hybrid strategies. isoBeRST-Halo hybrid indicators achieve single-trial voltage imaging of membrane potential dynamics from cultured hippocampal neurons or cortical neurons in brain slices. With far-red/near infrared excitation and emission, turn-on response to action potentials, and effective cell labeling in thick tissue, the new isoBeRST-Halo derivatives provide an important complement to voltage imaging in neurobiology.

AB  - As an economically important crop, tea is widely cultivated in more than 50 countries and has numerous health benefits. Metabolomics has considerable advantages in the analysis of small molecules and has been widely used in tea science. We applied a metabolomic method to evaluate the dynamic changes in metabolites and pathways in the large-, middle- and small-leaf cultivars of Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze var. niaowangensis grown in the same area from Yunwu Mountain. The results indicate that flavonoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and propanoate metabolism may play important roles in the differences among cultivars. The levels of tea polyphenols, flavonoids and amino acids may impact the sensory properties of teas of different cultivars. Our results may help to elucidate the mechanism underlying the difference in tea quality and offer references for the breeding of high-quality tea cultivars.

AB  - The relationship between the two most prominent neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), extracellular amyloid-beta (A beta) deposits and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), remains at present not fully understood. A large body of evidence places A beta upstream in the cascade of pathological events, triggering NFTs formation and the subsequent neuron loss. Extracellular A beta deposits were indeed causative of an increased tau phosphorylation and accumulation in several transgenic models but the contribution of soluble A beta peptides is still controversial. Among the different A beta variants, the N-terminally truncated peptide A beta(4-42) is among the most abundant. To understand whether soluble A beta(4-42) peptides impact the onset or extent of tau pathology, we have crossed the homozygous Tg4-42 mouse model of AD, exclusively expressing A beta(4-42) peptides, with the PS19 (P301S) tau transgenic model. Behavioral assessment showed that the resulting double-transgenic line presented a partial worsening of motor performance and spatial memory deficits in the aged group. While an increased loss of distal CA1 pyramidal neurons was detected in young mice, no significant alterations in hippocampal tau phosphorylation were observed in immunohistochemical analyses.

AB  - Ancient introgression is an infrequent evolutionary process often associated with conflicts between nuclear and organellar phylogenies. Determining whether such conflicts arise from introgression, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), or other processes is essential to understanding plant diversification. Previous studies have reported phylogenetic discordance in the placement of Xanthoceras, but its causes remain unclear. Here, we analyzed transcriptome data from 41 Sapindaceae samples to reconstruct phylogenies and investigate this discordance. While nuclear phylogenies consistently placed Xanthoceras as sister to subfam. Hippocastanoideae, plastid data positioned it as the earliest-diverging lineage within Sapindaceae. Our coalescent simulations suggest that this cyto-nuclear discordance is unlikely to be explained by ILS alone. HyDe and PhyloNet analyses provided strong evidence that Xanthoceras experienced ancient introgression, incorporating approximately 16% of its genetic material from ancestral subfam. Sapindoideae lineages. Morphological traits further support this evolutionary history, reflecting characteristics of both contributing subfamilies. Likely occurring during the Paleogene, this introgression represents a rare instance of cross-subfamily gene flow shaping the evolutionary trajectory of a major plant lineage. Our findings clarify the evolutionary history of Xanthoceras and underscore the role of ancient introgression in driving phylogenetic conflicts, offering a rare example of introgression-driven diversification in angiosperms.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) is a CRS phenotype. However, the mechanisms of CRSsNP remains unclear. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from the GSE36830 and GSE198950 datasets through the GEO2R tool. The six hub genes were screened by the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and Cytoscape software. Then we constructed the mouse models of CRS and verified the expression levels of hub genes by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was employed to observe pathological alterations in mouse tissues. Casepase-3 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-6, IL-1 beta, LDH, and IL-18 were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pyroptosis-related protein expressions were measured by western blotting. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry were performed to assess the proliferation and apoptosis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NP69 cells. Six hub DEGs were identified. The expression levels of IRF4, IKZF1, and CD79A were obviously increased in CRSsNP, while those of ADH6, ADH1A, and LDHC were significantly decreased. IRF4 knockdown attenuated the pathologic features of CRSsNP. IRF4 knockdown reduced levels of the TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-6 IL-1 beta, LDH, and IL-18 as well as the proteins expression of Casepase-1, GSDMD, and NLRP3 both in vivo and in vitro, implying that inflammation and pyroptosis were inhibited. IRF4 knockdown hinders the development of CRSsNP by inhibiting the inflammatory response and NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis, which offers novel promising treatment strategies for clinical intervention.

AB  - Despite intense investigations, no effective therapy is available to halt the pathogenesis of traumatic brain injury (TBI), a major health concern, which sometimes leads to long-term neurological disability, especially in war veterans and young adults. This study highlights the use of glyceryl tribenzoate (GTB), a flavoring ingredient, in ameliorating the disease process of controlled cortical impact (CCI)-induced TBI in mice. Oral administration of GTB decreased the activation of microglia and astrocytes to inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in hippocampus and cortex of TBI mice. Accordingly, GTB treatment protected and/or restored synaptic maturation in the hippocampus of TBI mice as revealed by the status of PSD-95, NR-2A and GluR1. Furthermore, oral GTB also reduced the size of lesion cavity in the brain of TBI mice. Finally, GTB treatment improved locomotor functions and protected spatial learning and memory in TBI mice. These results outline a novel neuroprotective property of GTB which may be beneficial in treatment of TBI.

AB  - Sucrose phloem unloading plays a vital role in photoassimilate distribution and storage in sink organs such as fruits and seeds. In most plants, the phloem unloading route was reported to shift between an apoplasmic and a symplasmic pattern with fruit development. However, the molecular transition mechanisms of the phloem unloading pathway still remain largely unknown. In this study, we applied RNA sequencing to profile the specific gene expression patterns for sucrose unloading in C. oleifera fruits in the apo- and symplasmic pathways that were discerned by CF fluoresce labelling. Several key structural genes were identified that participate in phloem unloading, such as PDBG11, PDBG14, SUT8, CWIN4, and CALS10. In particular, the key genes controlling the process were involved in callose metabolism, which was confirmed by callose staining. Based on the co-expression network analysis with key structural genes, a number of transcription factors belonging to the MYB, C2C2, NAC, WRKY, and AP2/ERF families were identified to be candidate regulators for the operation and transition of phloem unloading. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that some important metabolism pathways such as plant hormone metabolism, starch, and sucrose metabolism altered with the change of the sugar unloading pattern. Our study provides innovative insights into the different mechanisms responsible for apo- and symplasmic phloem unloading in oil tea fruit and represents an important step towards the omics delineation of sucrose phloem unloading transition in crops.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy; it is considered a network disorder associated with structural changes. Incomplete knowledge of the pathological changes in TLE complicates a therapeutic approach; indeed, 30 to 50% of patients with TLE are refractory to drug treatment. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), acting as epigenetic factors, participate in the regulation of the pathophysiological processes of epilepsy and are dysregulated during epileptogenesis. Abnormal expression of ncRNA is observed in patients with epilepsy and in animal models of epilepsy. Furthermore, ncRNAs could also be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of treatment response in epilepsy. In summary, ncRNAs can represent important mechanisms and targets for the modulation of brain excitability and can provide information on pathomechanisms, biomarkers and novel therapies for epilepsy. In this review, we summarize the latest research advances concerning mainly molecular mechanisms, regulated by ncRNA, such as synaptic plasticity, inflammation and apoptosis, already associated with the pathogenesis of TLE. Moreover, we discuss the role of ncRNAs, such as microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, highlighting their use as potential biomarkers for future therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The process of domestication, despite its short duration as it compared with the time scale of the natural evolutionary process, has caused rapid and substantial changes in the phenotype of domestic animal species. Nonetheless, the genetic mechanisms underlying these changes remain poorly understood. The present study deals with an analysis of the transcriptomes from four brain regions of gray rats (Rattus norvegicus), serving as an experimental model object of domestication. We compared gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray matter, and the midbrain tegmental region between tame domesticated and aggressive gray rats and revealed subdivisions of differentially expressed genes by principal components analysis that explain the main part of differentially gene expression variance. Functional analysis (in the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) Bioinformatics Resources database) of the differentially expressed genes allowed us to identify and describe the key biological processes that can participate in the formation of the different behavioral patterns seen in the two groups of gray rats. Using the STRING- DB (search tool for recurring instances of neighboring genes) web service, we built a gene association network. The genes engaged in broad network interactions have been identified. Our study offers data on the genes whose expression levels change in response to artificial selection for behavior during animal domestication.

AB  - AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play a pivotal role in excitatory neurotransmission, particularly in the hippocampus where the TARP gamma-8 subunit is enriched and serves as a target for emerging anti-epileptic drugs. To enable in vivo visualization of TARP gamma-8 distribution and expression by positron emission tomography (PET), this study focuses on the development of novel (18) F-labeled TARP gamma-8 inhibitors and their corresponding precursors, stemming from the azabenzimidazole scaffold. The resulting radioligands [(18) F]TARP-2204 and [(18) F]TARP-2205 were successfully synthesized with acceptable radiochemical yield, high molar activity, and excellent radiochemical purity. In vitro autoradiography demonstrates high level of specific binding of [(18) F]TARP-2205 to TARP gamma-8 in both rat and nonhuman primate brain tissues. However, unexpected radiodefluorination in PET imaging studies of rodents emphasizes the need for further structural refinement. This work serves as an excellent starting point for the development of future (18) F-labeled TARP gamma-8 PET tracers, offering valuable insights into medicinal chemistry design, radiosynthesis and subsequent PET evaluation.

AB  - Immunosenescence and chronic inflammation associated with old age accompany brain aging and the loss of complex behaviors. Neuroinflammation in the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in the development of cognitive impairment and anxiety. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explained. In this study, we aimed to investigate the disruption of insulin signaling and the mechanisms underlying metabolic inflammation ("metaflammation") in the brains of wild-type (WT) and NLRP3 knockout (KO) mice of different ages. We found a significant upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus during aging, leading to an increase in the expression of phosphorylated metaflammation proteinases and inflammatory markers, along with an increase in the number of senescent cells. Additionally, metaflammation causes anxiety and impairs social preference behavior in aged mice. On the other hand, deletion of NLRP3 improves some behavioral and biochemical characteristics associated with aging, such as signal memory, neuroinflammation, and metabolic inflammation, but not anxious behavior. These results are associated with reduced IL-18 signaling and the PKR/IKK beta/IRS1 pathway as well as the SASP phenotype. In NLRP3 gene deletion conditions, PKR is down-regulated. Therefore, it is likely that slowing aging through various NLRP3 inhibition mechanisms will lessen the corresponding cognitive decline with aging. Thus, the genetic knockout of the NLRP3 inflammasome can be seen as a new therapeutic strategy for slowing down central nervous system (CNS) aging.

AB  - Neurotrophins (NTFs) are structurally related neurotrophic factors essential for differentiation, survival, neurite outgrowth, and the plasticity of neurons. Abnormalities associated with neurotrophin-signaling (NTF-signaling) were associated with neuropathies, neurodegenerative disorders, and age-associated cognitive decline. Among the neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has the highest expression and is expressed in mammals by specific cells throughout the brain, with particularly high expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Whole genome sequencing efforts showed that NTF signaling evolved before the evolution of Vertebrates; thus, the shared ancestor of Protostomes, Cyclostomes, and Deuterostomes must have possessed a single ortholog of neurotrophins. After the first round of whole genome duplication that occurred in the last common ancestor of Vertebrates, the presence of two neurotrophins in Agnatha was hypothesized, while the monophyletic group of cartilaginous fishes, or Chondrichthyans, was situated immediately after the second whole genome duplication round that occurred in the last common ancestor of Gnathostomes. Chondrichthyans represent the outgroup of all other living jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomes) and the sister group of Osteichthyans (comprehensive of Actinopterygians and Sarcopterygians). We were able to first identify the second neurotrophin in Agnatha. Secondly, we expanded our analysis to include the Chondrichthyans, with their strategic phylogenetic position as the most basal extant Gnathostome taxon. Results from the phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of four neurotrophins in the Chondrichthyans, namely the orthologs of the four mammalian neurotrophins BDNF, NGF, NT-3, and NT-4. We then proceeded to study the expression of BDNF in the adult brain of the Chondrichthyan Scyliorhinus canicula. Our results showed that BDNF is highly expressed in the S. canicula brain and that its expression is highest in the Telencephalon, while the Mesencephalic and Diencephalic areas showed expression of BDNF in isolated and well-defined cell groups. NGF was expressed at much lower levels that could be detected by PCR but not by in situ hybridization. Our results warrant further investigations in Chondrichthyans to characterize the putative ancestral function of neurotrophins in Vertebrates.

AB  - Persistent pain has been recently suggested as a risk factor for dementia. Indeed, chronic pain is frequently accompanied by maladaptive brain plasticity and cognitive deficits whose molecular underpinnings are poorly understood. Despite the emerging role of Tau as a key regulator of neuronal plasticity and pathology in diverse brain disorders, the role of Tau has never been studied in the context of chronic pain. Using a peripheral (sciatic) neuropathy to model chronic pain in mice-spared nerve injury (SNI) for 4 months-in wildtype as well as P301L-Tau transgenic mice, we hereby demonstrate that SNI triggers AD-related neuropathology characterized by Tau hyperphosphorylation, accumulation, and aggregation in hippocampus followed by neuronal atrophy and memory deficits. Molecular analysis suggests that SNI inhibits autophagy and reduces levels of the Rab35, a regulator of Tau degradation while overexpression of Rab35 or treatment with the analgesic drug gabapentin reverted the above molecular changes leading to neurostructural and memory recovery. Interestingly, genetic ablation of Tau blocks the establishment of SNI-induced hippocampal morphofunctional deficits supporting the mediating role of Tau in SNI-evoked hippocampal pathology and memory impairment. These findings reveal that exposure to chronic pain triggers Tau-related neuropathology and may be relevant for understanding how chronic pain precipitates memory loss leading to dementia.

AB  - In this study, we performed an association analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics to reveal the anthocyanin biosynthesis mechanism in a new purple-leaf tea cultivar Zikui (Camellia sinensis cv. Zikui) (ZK). Three glycosylated anthocyanins were identified, including petunidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and their contents were the highest in ZK leaves at 15 days. This is the first report on petunidin 3-O-glucoside in purple-leaf tea. Integrated analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome identified eleven dependent transcription factors, among which CsMYB90 had strong correlations with petunidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (PCC > 0.8). Furthermore, we also identified key correlated structural genes, including two positively correlated F3'H (flavonoid-3 '-hydroxylase) genes, two positively correlated ANS (anthocyanin synthase) genes, and three negatively correlated PPO (polyphenol oxidase) genes. Overexpression of CsMYB90 in tobacco resulted in dark-purple transgenic calluses. These results showed that the increased accumulation of three anthocyanins in ZK may promote purple-leaf coloration because of changes in the expression levels of genes, including CsMYB90, F3'Hs, ANSs, and PPOs. These findings reveal new insight into the molecular mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple-leaf tea plants and provide a series of candidate genes for the breeding of anthocyanin-rich cultivars.

The aim of this study was to analyse and compare the amounts of bioactive compounds present in Aesculus hippocastanum and Aesculus x carnea flowers and leaves over two years. These two species from six independent locations (parks and green areas) located in Warsaw were assessed in this study. The dry matter by the scale method and polyphenol, carotenoid, and chlorophyll content by the HPLC method of the flowers and leaves was evaluated. Red horse chestnut flowers contained significantly more total carotenoids (40.6 mu g/g FW) and chlorophylls (36.9 mu g/g FW) than horse chestnut flowers, and red horse chestnut flowers contained higher levels of anthocyanins (5.41 mu g/g FW) than other species. We observed that horse chestnut flowers were characterized by a higher total polyphenols concentration (9.45 mu g/g FW) compared to red horse chestnut flowers. In addition, the analysis of leaves showed that all quality parameters were higher in red horse chestnut species. Five individual anthocyanins were identified in both species' flowers, but a higher concentration was found in red horse chestnut flowers, and pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside was the predominant form among a pool of total anthocyanins. In both experimental years, leaves (109.25 mMol/100 g FW and 112.0 mMol/100 g FW) were characterized by a higher antioxidant activity than flowers (27.0 mMol/100 g FW and 27.5 mMol/100 g FW).

AB  - In this study, the flavor compounds of Camellia seed oils obtained by four processes were characterized by headspace solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC/MS). A variety of about 76 volatile flavor compounds were identified from all the oil samples. Of the four processing processes, the pressing process can retain a lot of volatile components. Among these, compounds nonanal and 2-undecenal were predominantly in the majority of the samples. Meanwhile, other compounds such as octyl ester formic acid, octanal and 2-nonenal (E), 3-acetyldihydro 2(3H)-furanone, (E)-2-decenal, dihydro-5-penty 2(3H)-furanone, nonanoic acid, and dodecane were also among the most consistently found compounds among the oil samples analyzed. The principal component analysis carried out to categorize the data produced seven clusters of the total oil samples based on the number of flavor compounds obtained in each sample. This categorization would lead to understanding the components which highly contributed to the characteristic volatile flavor and build up the flavor profile of Camellia seed oil.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that cellular senescence plays a role in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis. We hypothesize that cellular senescence markers might be tracked in the peripheral tissues of AD patients. Senescence hallmarks, including altered metabolism, cell-cycle arrest, DNA damage response (DDR) and senescence secretory associated phenotype (SASP), were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy controls (HC), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD patients. Senescence-associated beta eta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity, G0-G1 phase cell-cycle arrest, p16 and p53 were analyzed by flow cytometry, while IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA were analyzed by qPCR, and phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (gamma H2AX) was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Senescent cells in the brain tissue were determined with lipofuscin staining. An increase in the number of senescent cells was observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of advanced AD patients. PBMCs of aMCI patients, but not in AD, showed increased SA-beta-Gal compared with HCs. aMCI PBMCs also had increased IL-6 and IL8 mRNA expression and number of cells arrested at G0-G1, which were absent in AD. Instead, AD PBMCs had significantly increased p16 and p53 expression and decreased gamma H2Ax activity compared with HC. This study reports that several markers of cellular senescence can be measured in PBMCs of aMCI and AD patients.

AB  - O-Methylated benzoxazinoids (BXs) and flavonoids are widespread defenses against herbivores and pathogens in the grasses (Poaceae). Recently, two flavonoid O-methyltransferases (FOMTs), ZmFOMT2 and ZmFOMT3, have been reported to produce phytoalexins in maize (Zea mays). ZmFOMT2 and ZmFOMT3 are closely related to the BX O-methyltransferases (OMTs) ZmBX10-12 and ZmBX14, suggesting a common evolutionary origin in the Poaceae. Here, we studied the evolution and enzymatic requirements of flavonoid and BX O-methylation activities in more detail. Using BLAST searches and phylogenetic analyses, we identified enzymes homologous to ZmFOMT2 and ZmFOMT3, ZmBX10-12, and ZmBX14 in several grasses, with the most closely related candidates found almost exclusively in species of the Panicoideae subfamily. Biochemical characterization of candidate enzymes from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sugar cane (Saccharum spp.), and teosinte (Zea nicaraguensis) revealed either flavonoid 5-O-methylation activity or DIMBOA-Glc 4-O-methylation activity. However, DIMBOA-Glc 4-OMTs from maize and teosinte also accepted flavonols as substrates and converted them to 3-O-methylated derivatives, suggesting an evolutionary relationship between these two activities. Homology modeling, sequence comparisons, and site-directed mutagenesis led to the identification of active site residues crucial for FOMT and BX OMT activity. However, the full conversion of ZmFOMT2 activity into BX OMT activity by switching these residues was not successful. Only trace O-methylation of BXs was observed, indicating that amino acids outside the active site cavity are also involved in determining the different substrate specificities. Altogether, the results of our study suggest that BX OMTs have evolved from the ubiquitous FOMTs in the PACMAD clade of the grasses through a complex series of amino acid changes.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) and herbal tea have been recognized as rich sources of bioactive constituents with the ability to exert antioxidant actions. The aims of this study were to analyze phenolic, carotenoid and saccharide contents in a set of Vietnamese tea and herbal tea and compare the results with those of green and black teas marketed in the U.S. In total, 27 phenolics, six carotenoids and chlorophylls, and three saccharides were quantitatively identified. Catechins, quercetin glycosides and chlorogenic acid were the predominating phenolics in the teas, with the concentrations following the order: jasmine/green teas > oolong tea > black tea. Lutein was the dominant carotenoid in the teas and its concentrations were generally found to be higher in the jasmine and green teas than in the oolong and black teas. The study showed that the green teas originating in Vietnam had much higher levels of phenolics and carotenoids than their counterparts stemming from another country. The application of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) as a chemometric tool was able to differentiate phenolic profiles between methanolic extracts and tea infusions. Through principal component analysis (PCA), the similarities and dissimilarities among the jasmine, green, oolong, black teas and herbal teas were depicted.

AB  - Determining the sex and controlling the sex ratio are essential aspects of fish genetics that can assist in developing successful fish breeding programs. High quality genome assembly and annotations are prerequisites to determine sex-specific genes and their expression. In addition, analysis of resequencing data can identify genomic difference between male and female fishes. In this study, we performed chromosome-level genome assembly in female Ancherythroculter nigrocauda fish having low heterozygosity using PacBio reads. Highthroughput chromatin conformation capture (HiC) yielded a genome of size 1054.05 Mb, with a contig N50 length of 3.40 Mb and a scaffold N50 length of 42.68 Mb. In addition, we sequenced 5 female and 5 male A. nigrocauda samples and identified sex-specific regions on LG20 Furthermore, diet-specific amino acid mutation were found on 582 genes between herbivorous and carnivorous fishes, with 26 of them exhibiting significantly different expression patterns in the liver tissue of these two types of fishes. The chromosome-level genome assembly of A. nigrocauda provides valuable resources for conducting in-depth comparative genomic studies with immense applications in fish genetic breeding and farming. Similarly, the diet-specific amino acid mutations are useful in the breeding of new strains of carnivorous fishes with an herbivorous diet.

AB  - Background: To reveal the underling molecular mechanism in brain damage induced by chronic fluorosis, the neurotoxicity and its correlation were investigated by transcriptomics and proteomics.
   Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with fluoride at different concentrations (0, 5, 50 and 100 ppm, prepared by NaF) for 3 months. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated by Morris water maze test; neuronal morphological change in the hippocampus was observed using Nissl staining; and the level of oxidative stress including reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were detected by biological methods. The high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic sequencing were performed to detect the expression of differentially expressed genes and proteins, respectively.
   Results: The results showed that compared with control group, rats exposed to high-dose fluoride exhibited declined abilities of learning and memory, decreased SOD activity and increased ROS and MDA levels, with lighter colored Nissl bodies. A total of 28 important differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out by transcriptomics. Then, functional enrichment analyses showed that upregulated proteins enriched in cellular transport, while downregulated proteins enriched in synapse-related pathways. Thirteen corresponding DEGs and DAPs (cor-DEGs-DAPs) were identified by differential expressions selected with positively correlated genes/proteins, most of which were related to neurodegenerative changes and oxidative stress response.
   Conclusion: These results provide new omics evidence that rats chronically exposed to high-dose fluoride can induce neurotoxicity in the brains through changes in the cholinergic pathway and oxidative stress.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are the most prevalent mood disorders and cause considerable burden worldwide. Compelling evidence suggests a pronounced overlap between these two disorders in clinical symptoms, treatment strategies, and genetic etiology. Here we leverage a BD GWAS (1822 cases and 4650 controls) and a MDD GWAS (5303 cases and 5337 controls), followed by independent replications, to investigate their shared genetic basis among Han Chinese. We have herein identified a lead SNP rs126277 at the 1q32.2 locus, which also exhibited nominal associations with mood disorders and several relevant sub-clinical phenotypes (e.g., mania) in European populations. Bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analyses suggest that the risk G-allele of rs126277 predicted lower SYT14 mRNA expression in human brains. We generated mice lacking Syt14 (Syt14-/-) and mice with insufficient expression of Syt14 in the hippocampus (Syt14-KD), and found that depletion of Syt14 resulted in mania-like behaviors including hyperactivity and anti-depressive behaviors, resembling aspects of mood disorders. We also confirmed that deficiency of this gene in the hippocampus was sufficient to induce hyperactivity in mice. RNA-sequencing analyses of the hippocampus of Syt14-/- mice revealed significant upregulation of Per1 as well as downregulation of Slc7a11 and Ptprb. Ultrastructural analyses showed significant alteration of the number of vesicles within 50 nm to the active zone and the width of synaptic cleft in the ventral hippocampus of Syt14-/- mice compared with the control mice. Overall, we have identified a novel mood disorder risk gene SYT14, and confirmed its impact on mania-like behaviors. While the current study identifies an essential mood disorder risk gene, further investigations elucidating the detailed mechanisms by which SYT14 contributes to the pathogenesis of the illnesses are needed.

AB  - Metastasis in breast cancer is the major cause of death in females (about 30%). Based on our earlier observation that Vitamin D3 downregulates mTOR, we hypothesized that Vitamin D3 conjugated to gold nanoparticles (VD3-GNPs) reduces breast cancer aggressiveness by downregulating the key cancer controller PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Western blots, migration/invasion assays, and other cell-based, biophysical, and bioinformatics studies are used to study breast cancer cell aggressiveness and nanoparticle characterization. Our VD3-GNP treatment of breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) significantly reduces the aggressiveness (cancer cell migration and invasion rates > 45%) via the simultaneous downregulation of ETV7 and the Hippo pathway. Consistent with our hypothesis, we, indeed, found a downregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. It is surprising that the extremely low dose of VD3 in the nano formulation (three orders of magnitude lower than in earlier studies) is quite effective in the alteration of cancer invasiveness and cell signaling pathways. Clearly, VD3-GNPs are a viable candidate for non-toxic, low-cost treatment for reducing breast cancer aggressiveness.

AB  - Organophosphorus insecticides (OPs), acting as serine phosphorylating agents in acetylcholinesterase (AChE), are highly effective neurotoxic insecticides. In our previous research, we found that six herbivorous pests and four ladybirds howed significantly higher AChE LC50 values than seven parasitoids and a predator (Epistrophe balteate), and that there was a significant correlation with the corresponding bimolecular rate constant (Ki) value. The Ki value of pests was much smaller than that of natural enemies and had a higher LC50 value.Then, we speculated that the low sensitivity of the pest AChE to OPs may be associated with its higher recovery and lower aging ability. In this work, the I50 and I90 were calculated, to determine the sensibility of AChE in ten representative species, including Plutella xylostella, Prodenia litura, Musca domestica, and Cavia porcellus, to paraoxon and malaoxon. The enzyme activities were measured at various time points, and kinetic calculations were used to obtain their spontaneous reactivation (Ks) and aging (Ka) constants, which were comprehensively compared. We conclude that the Ka and Ks of the AChE inhibited by OPs showed primarily species-specific correlations, and little correlation with the sensitivity to OPs. The differences in the AChE sensitivity to paraoxon among the ten species were much greater than in the sensitivity to malaoxon. Compared to paraoxon, malaoxon was more selective for Cavia porcellus. Coleoptera insects showed a stronger dephosphorylation ability than other insect groups. The recovery ability of phospho-AChE was stronger in mammals than in insects, which could be related to the low sensitivity of the AChE site of action to OPs. The Ka of the AChE inhibited by malaoxon was larger than that inhibited by paraoxon with the corresponding biomaterials, indicating that the OP type had a substantial relationship with the Ka of the AChE. We further discovered that, when insects were inhibited by OP, the tendency of AChE to undergo aging was greater than that of dephosphorylation. Overall, the study provides valuable information on the action mechanism of various OPs on AChE in several species, which could be used to further research into AChE and the potential dangers that organophosphates pose to animals.

AB  - Neuregulins (NRGs) signal via ErbB receptors to regulate neural development, excitability, synaptic and network activity, and behaviors relevant to psychiatric disorders. Bidirectional signaling between NRG2/ErbB4 and NMDA receptors is thought to homeostatically regulate GABAergic interneurons in response to increased excitatory neurotransmission or elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Unprocessed proNRG2 forms discrete clusters on cell bodies and proximal dendrites that colocalize with the potassium channel Kv2.1 at specialized endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions, and NMDA receptor activation triggers rapid dissociation from ER-PM junctions and ectodomain shedding by ADAM10. Here, we elucidate the mechanistic basis of proNRG2 clustering at ER-PM junctions and its regulation by NMDA receptors. Importantly, we demonstrate that proNRG2 promotes the formation of ER-PM junctions by directly binding the ER-resident membrane tether VAP, like Kv2.1. The proNRG2 intracellular domain harbors two non-canonical, low-affinity sites that cooperatively mediate VAP binding. One of these is a cryptic and phosphorylation-dependent VAP binding motif that is dephosphorylated following NMDA receptor activation, thus revealing how excitatory neurotransmission promotes the dissociation of proNRG2 from ER-PM junctions. Therefore, proNRG2 and Kv2.1 can independently function as VAP-dependent organizers of neuronal ER-PM junctions. Based on these and prior studies, we propose that proNRG2 and Kv2.1 serve as co-regulated downstream effectors of NMDA receptors to homeostatically regulate GABAergic interneurons.

AB  - Camelina oil obtained from the seeds of Camelina sativa exhibits strong antioxidative properties. This study was based on four years of field experiments conducted on 63 genotypes of spring and 11 genotypes of winter camelina. The aim of the study was to determine the variability in the content of the selected bioactive compounds, depending on the weather conditions during the cultivation, the functional form, and genotype. The cultivation form of the genotypes analysed in our study did not exhibit significant differences in the quantitative profiles of the tested phenolic acids and flavonoids. Sinapic acid was the most abundant of all phenolic acids under analysis (617-668 mg/kg), while quercetin was the main flavonoid (91-161 mg/kg). Camelina has great potential not only for the food industry but also for researchers attempting to breed an oil plant with the stable biosynthesis of bioactive compounds to ensure oxidative protection of obtained fat.

AB  - The complexity of microglia phenotypes and their related functions compels the continuous study of microglia in diseases animal models. We demonstrated that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induced rapid, time- and space-dependent phenotypic microglia modifications in CA1 stratum pyramidalis (SP) and stratum radiatum (SR) of rat organotypic hippocampal slices as well as the degeneration of pyramidal neurons, especially in the outer layer of SP. Twenty-four h following OGD, many rod microglia formed trains of elongated cells spanning from the SR throughout the CA1, reaching the SP outer layer where they acquired a round-shaped amoeboid phagocytic head and phagocytosed most of the pyknotic, damaged neurons. NIR-laser treatment, known to preserve neuronal viability after OGD, prevented rod microglia formation. In CA3 SP, pyramidal neurons were less damaged, no rod microglia were found. Thirty-six h after OGD, neuronal damage was more pronounced in SP outer and inner layers of CA1, rod microglia cells were no longer detectable, and most microglia were amoeboid/phagocytic. Damaged neurons, more numerous 36 h after OGD, were phagocytosed by amoeboid microglia in both inner and outer layers of CA1. In response to OGD, microglia can acquire different morphofunctional phenotypes which depend on the time after the insult and on the subregion where microglia are located.

AB  - Individual differences in coping with stress may determine either a vulnerable or resilient phenotype. Therefore, it is important to better understand the biology underlying the behavioral phenotype. We assessed whether individual behavioral phenotype to acute stress is related with the hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), Nurr1, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Wistar male rats were exposed to forced swimming for 15 min and sacrificed at different times. Behavioral response was analyzed, and it was compared with the gene and protein expression of GR, Nurr1, IL-1 beta and BDNF in the hippocampus for each time point. Behavioral phenotyping showed a group with high immobility (vulnerable) while another had low immobility (resilient). No significant differences were found in the Nurr1, IL-1 beta and BDNF mRNA levels between resilient and vulnerable rats at different recovery times except for Nr3c1 (gene for GR). However, exposure to stress caused significantly higher levels of GR, Nurr1 and IL-1 beta proteins of vulnerable compared to resilient rats. This variability of behavioral phenotypes is associated with a differential molecular response to stress that involves GR, Nurr1, and IL-1 beta as mediators in coping with stress. This contributes to identifying biomarkers of susceptibility to stress.

AB  - We previously showed that the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) inhibits microglial activation, but the mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the target of LEV in microglial activity suppression. The mouse microglial BV-2 cell line, cultured in a ramified form, was pretreated with LEV and then treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A comprehensive analysis of LEV targets was performed by cap analysis gene expression sequencing using BV-2 cells, indicating the transcription factors BATF, Nrf-2, FosL1 (Fra1), MAFF, and Spic as candidates. LPS increased AP-1 and Spic transcriptional activity, and LEV only suppressed AP-1 activity. FosL1, MAFF, and Spic mRNA levels were increased by LPS, and LEV only attenuated FosL1 mRNA expression, suggesting FosL1 as an LEV target. FosL1 protein levels were increased by LPS treatment and decreased by LEV pretreatment, similar to FosL1 mRNA levels. The FosL1 siRNA clearly suppressed the expression of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus increased hippocampus FosL1 expression, along with inflammation. LEV treatment significantly suppressed FosL1 expression. Together, LEV reduces FosL1 expression and AP-1 activity in activated microglia, thereby suppressing neuroinflammation.

AB  - The phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) proteins belong to the subfamily of basic helixloop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and play important roles in chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Currently, knowledge about the PIF gene family in Camellia sinensis remains very limited. In this study, seven PIF members were identified in the C. sinensis genome and named based on homology with AtPIF genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. All C. sinensis PIF (CsPIF) proteins have both the conserved active PHYB binding (APB) and bHLH domains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CsPIFs were clustered into four groups-PIF1, PIF3, PIF7, and PIF8-and most CsPIFs were clustered in pairs with their corresponding orthologs in Populus tremula. CsPIF members in the same group tended to display uniform or similar exon-intron distribution patterns and motif compositions. CsPIF genes were differentially expressed in C. sinensis with various leaf colors and strongly correlated with the expression of genes involved in the chlorophyll metabolism pathway. Promoter analysis of structural genes related to chlorophyll metabolism found DNA-binding sites of PIFs were abundant in the promoter regions. Protein-protein interaction networks of CsPIFs demonstrated a close association with phytochrome, PIF4, HY5, TOC1, COP1, and PTAC12 proteins. Additionally, subcellular localization and transcriptional activity analysis suggested that CsPIF3b was nuclear localized protein and possessed transcriptional activity. We also found that CsPIF3b could activate the transcription of CsHEMA and CsPOR in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. This work provides comprehensive research of CsPIFs and would be helpful to further promote the regulation mechanism of PIF on chlorophyll metabolism in C. sinensis.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L. (HR)) leaf powders are the underutilized, promising resource of valuable compounds. Genotype and processing methods are key factors in the preparation of homogenous, stable, and quantified ingredients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenolic, triterpenic, antioxidant profiles, carotenoid and chlorophyll content, and chromatic characteristics of convection-dried and freeze-dried HR leaf powders obtained from ten different female cultivars, namely 'Avgustinka', 'Botaniceskaja Liubitelskaja', 'Botaniceskaja', 'Hibrid Percika', 'Julia', 'Nivelena', 'Otradnaja', 'Podarok Sadu', 'Trofimovskaja', and 'Vorobjovskaja'. The chromatic characteristics were determined using the CIELAB scale. The phytochemical profiles were determined using HPLC-PDA (high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector) analysis; spectrophotometric assays and antioxidant activities were investigated using ABTS (2,2 '-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) and FRAP (ferric ion reducing antioxidant power) assays. The sea buckthorn leaf powders had a yellowish-green appearance. The drying mode had a significant impact on the total antioxidant activity, chlorophyll content, and chromatic characteristics of the samples; the freeze-dried samples were superior in antioxidant activity, chlorophyll, carotenoid content, and chromatic profile, compared to convection-dried leaf powder samples. The determined triterpenic and phenolic profiles strongly depend on the cultivar, and the drying technique had no impact on qualitative and quantitative composition. Catechin, epigallocatechin, procyanidin B3, ursolic acid, alpha-amyrin, and beta-sitosterol could be used as quantitative markers in the phenolic and triterpenic profiles. The cultivars 'Avgustinka', 'Nivelena', and 'Botaniceskaja' were superior to other tested cultivars, with the phytochemical composition and antioxidant activity.

AB  - Exposure of rodents to <20 cGy Space Radiation (SR) impairs performance in several hippocampus-dependent cognitive tasks, including spatial memory. However, there is considerable inter-individual susceptibility to develop SR-induced spatial memory impairment. In this study, a robust label-free mass spectrometry (MS)-based unbiased proteomic profiling approach was used to characterize the composition of the hippocampal proteome in adult male Wistar rats exposed to 15 cGy of 1 GeV/n Ti-48 and their sham counterparts. Unique protein signatures were identified in the hippocampal proteome of: (1) sham rats, (2) Ti-exposed rats, (3) Ti-exposed rats that had sham-like spatial memory performance, and (4) Ti-exposed rats that impaired spatial memory performance. Approximately 14% (159) of the proteins detected in hippocampal proteome of sham rats were not detected in the Ti-exposed rats. We explored the possibility that the loss of the Sham-only proteins may arise as a result of SR-induced changes in protein homeostasis. SR-exposure was associated with a switch towards increased pro-ubiquitination proteins from that seen in Sham. These data suggest that the role of the ubiquitin-proteome system as a determinant of SR-induced neurocognitive deficits needs to be more thoroughly investigated.

AB  - Microglia play a critical role in maintaining neural function. While microglial activity follows a circadian rhythm, it is not clear how this intrinsic clock relates to their function, especially in stimulated conditions such as in the control of systemic energy homeostasis or memory formation. In this study, we found that microglia-specific knock-down of the core clock gene, Bmal1, resulted in increased microglial phagocytosis in mice subjected to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic stress and likewise among mice engaged in critical cognitive processes. Enhanced microglial phagocytosis was associated with significant retention of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-immunoreactivity in the mediobasal hypothalamus in mice on a HFD as well as the formation of mature spines in the hippocampus during the learning process. This response ultimately protected mice from HFD-induced obesity and resulted in improved performance on memory tests. We conclude that loss of the rigorous control implemented by the intrinsic clock machinery increases the extent to which microglial phagocytosis can be triggered by neighboring neurons under metabolic stress or during memory formation. Taken together, microglial responses associated with loss of Bmal1 serve to ensure a healthier microenvironment for neighboring neurons in the setting of an adaptive response. Thus, microglial Bmal1 may be an important therapeutic target for metabolic and cognitive disorders with relevance to psychiatric disease.

AB  - Natural-origin edible gels are gaining attention as innovative carriers for bioactive compounds, offering consumer-friendly formats and potential to enhance stability and bioavailability. This study aimed to develop and characterize edible gels incorporating Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze extract using different plant-based gelling agents, including whole flaxseeds, ground flaxseeds, medium-size oatmeal, and coarse oatmeal. The physical properties of the gels were evaluated by rheological (flow curve) and pH studies. The phytochemical composition of the green tea extract and gels with this extract and the main phenolic compounds, including catechins, gallic acid, and caffeine, were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The biopharmaceutical properties of the prepared gels were evaluated by dissolution testing. Rheological analysis revealed that oat-based gels exhibited higher viscosity (up to 24.33 Pa<middle dot>s) compared to flaxseed-based gels. Despite differences in consistency, no statistically significant differences were found in total phenolic release among gel formulations (p > 0.05), except for epigallocatechin, which showed significantly higher release from coarse oatmeal gels (p > 0.05). The findings suggest that both flaxseed- and oatmeal-based gels are promising natural carriers for green tea phytochemicals, offering standardized dosing and potential cognitive health benefits. Further studies are warranted to assess the in vivo bioavailability and long-term stability of these formulations.

AB  - Breast cancer is a heterogeneous tumor with 4 major molecular subtypes. Hormone receptor (HR)-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer accounts for 70% of invasive breast cancers. In our study, we collected 15 original Luminal B breast cancer tissue (LBBC) and paired non-cancerous adjacent tissue (NATs) from patients and performed LC-MS/MS-based label-free quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis. The untargeted metabolomics analysis was also used to determine the differences in metabolic patterns between LBBC and NATs. In addition, an integrative analysis of phosphoproteomics and metabolomics data was performed to investigate regulatory metabolic pathways. The main regulatory proteins were verified by western blot. Phosphoproteomics analysis identified 1385 differentially phosphorylated sites in 785 proteins. The protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) families and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (RPS6K) were strongly activated in LBBC, whereas the cycle-dependent kinases (CDKs) were markedly inhibited. Cancer-specific activation of PI3K-mTORC and Hippo signaling pathways were also highlighted. Metabolomic analysis showed that 223 metabolites were significantly differentially accumulated, including fatty acids (3-hydroxycapric acid; dodecanoic acid; linoleic acid; stearic acid), glycerophospholipids, glycerophosphatidylcholines, and sphingolipids, which were mainly involved in fatty acid oxidation metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, purine metabolism, and amino acid metabolism pathway. After integrative analysis, we found that the sphingolipid metabolic pathway played the major regulatory role. We also validated 3 phosphorylated proteins (p-YAP, p-SGK1, and p-SGPP2) in the PI3K-mTORC, Hippo signaling pathway, and sphingolipid metabolic pathway, respectively. The present study provides the first integrative phosphoproteome and metabolome profiles of LBBC, mainly involving dysregulation of sphingolipid homeostasis mediated by PI3K-mTORC and Hippo signaling pathways. This study described two phosphorylation pathways and sphingolipid metabolism regulation module for a better understanding of LBBC carcinogenesis and therapy.

AB  - A major challenge in the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the identification of molecular mechanisms linked to specific pathophysiological features of the disease. Importantly AD has a two-fold higher incidence in women than men and a protracted prodromal phase characterized by amnestic mild-cognitive impairment (aMCI) suggesting that biological processes occurring early can initiate vulnerability to AD. Here, we used a sample of 125 subjects from two independent study cohorts to determine the levels in plasma (the most accessible specimen) of two essential mitochondrial markers acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC) and its derivative free-carnitine motivated by a mechanistic model in rodents in which targeting mitochondrial metabolism of LAC leads to the amelioration of cognitive function and boosts epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression. We report a sex-specific deficiency in free-carnitine levels in women with aMCI and early-AD compared to cognitively healthy controls; no change was observed in men. We also replicated the prior finding of decreased LAC levels in both women and men with AD, supporting the robustness of the study samples assayed in our new study. The magnitude of the sex-specific free-carnitine deficiency reflected the severity of cognitive dysfunction and held in two study cohorts. Furthermore, patients with the lower free-carnitine levels showed higher beta-amyloid(A beta) accumulation and t-Tau levels assayed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Computational analyses showed that the mitochondrial markers assayed in plasma are at least as accurate as CSF measures to classify disease status. Together with the mechanistic platform in rodents, these translational findings lay the groundwork to create preventive individualized treatments targeting sex-specific changes in mitochondrial metabolism that may be subtle to early cognitive dysfunction of AD risk.

AB  - Background: Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is intricately involved in modulating the inflammatory response in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Nevertheless, the myeloid PTEN governing Hippo-YAP pathway mediated oxidative stress and inflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI remains to be elucidate. Methods: The floxed Pten (PtenFL/FL) and myeloid-specific Pten knockout (PtenM- KO) mice were intratracheal instill LPS (5 mg/kg) to establish ALI, then Yap siRNA mix with the mannose-conjugated polymers was used to knockdown endogenous macrophage YAP in some PtenM-KO mice before LPS challenged. The bone marrowderived macrophages (BMMs) from PtenFL/FL and PtenM-KO mice were obtained, and BMMs were transfected with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated glycogen synthase kinase 3 Beta (GSK3(3) knockout (KO) or Yes-associated protein (YAP) KO vector subjected to LPS (100 ng/ml) challenged or then cocultured with MLE12 cells. Results: Here, our findings demonstrate that myeloid-specific PTEN deficiency exerts a protective against LPSinduced oxidative stress and inflammation dysregulated in ALI model. Moreover, ablation of the PTEN-YAP axis in macrophages results in reduced nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (NRF2) expression, a decrease in antioxidant gene expression, augmented levels of free radicals, lipid and protein peroxidation, heightened generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ultimately leading to increased apoptosis in MLE12 cells. Mechanistically, it is noteworthy that the deletion of myeloid PTEN promotes YAP translocation and regulates NRF2 expression, alleviating LPS-induced ALI via the inhibition of GSK3(3 and MST1 binding. Conclusions: Our study underscores the crucial role of the myeloid PTEN-YAP-NRF2 axis in governing oxidative stress and inflammation dysregulated in ALI, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for ALI.

AB  - CTP synthase (CTPS), the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo synthesis of CTP, assembles into a filamentous structure termed the cytoophidium. The Hippo pathway regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. The relationship of the nucleotide metabolism with the Hippo pathway is little known. Here, we study the impact of the Hippo pathway on the cytoophidium in Drosophila melanogaster posterior follicle cells (PFCs). We find that the inactivation of the Hippo pathway correlates with reduced cytoophidium length and number within PFCs. During the overexpression of CTPS, the presence of Hippo mutations also reduces the length of cytoophidia in PFCs. In addition, we observe that knocking down CTPS mitigates hpo (Hippo)-associated over-proliferation. In summary, our results suggest that there is a connection between the Hippo pathway and the nucleotide biosynthesis enzyme CTPS in PFCs.

AB  - Macropodus opercularis is an ornamental fish species endemic to China, with obvious sexual dimorphism in phenotype. To obtain the gene expression profile of the gonads of M. opercularis and explore its sex-related genes, six cDNA libraries were constructed from the sexually mature M. opercularis, and RNA-seq analysis was per -formed. The sequenced clean data were assembled by de novo splicing to generate 171,415 unigenes, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screening revealed that there were 41,638 DEGs in the gonads of M. opercularis. By comparing those DEGS in the ovary with the testis, we found 29,870 DEGs were upregulated and 11,768 DEGs were downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that GO terms related to cell cycle and gamete formation were enriched, and pathway signals related to sex differences, such as FoxO signalling pathway and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, were also detected. Reverse transcript fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) validation of 14 DEGs associated with sex differences showed that the RT-qPCR results were consistent with RNA-Seq analysis, and five genes, foxl2, sox3, foxo, sar1, cyp19a1, were significantly expressed in the ovaries. dmrt1, cyp11b, amh, sf1, sox9, gdf6, dmrt3, fstl1 and hsd11b2, a total of nine genes were significantly expressed in the testis. The results of this study provide a basis for the study of gonadal differentiation, developmental mechanisms and related functional genes in M. opercularis.

AB  - The light-sensitive albino tea plant can produce pale-yellow shoots with high levels of amino acids which are suitable to process high-quality tea. In order to understand the mechanism of the albino phenotype formation, the changes in the physio-chemical characteristics, chloroplast ultrastructure, chlorophyll-binding proteins, and the relevant gene expression were comprehensively investigated in the leaves of the light-sensitive albino cultivar 'Huangjinya' ('HJY') during short-term shading treatment. In the content of photosynthetic pigments, the ultrastructure of the chloroplast, and parameters of the photosynthesis in the leaves of 'HJY' could be gradually normalized along with the extension of the shading time, resulting in the leaf color transformed from pale yellow to green. BN-PAGE and SDS-PAGE revealed that function restoration of the photosynthetic apparatus was attributed to the proper formation of the pigment-protein complexes on the thylakoid membrane that benefited from the increased levels of the LHCII subunits in the shaded leaves of 'HJY', indicating the low level of LHCII subunits, especially the lack of the Lhcb1 might be responsible for the albino phenotype of the 'HJY' under natural light condition. The deficiency of the Lhcb1 was mainly subject to the strongly suppressed expression of the Lhcb1.x which might be modulated by the chloroplast retrograde signaling pathway GUN1 (GENOMES UNCOUPLED 1)-PTM (PHD type transcription factor with transmembrane domains)-ABI4 (ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4).

AB  - In this research, we compared the cognitive parameters of 2-, 7-, and 15-month-old mice, changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity and expression of genes involved in the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) signaling pathway. We showed an age-related decrease in the Nfe2l2 expression in the cerebral cortex, not in the hippocampus. At the same time, we find an increase in the mtDNA copy number in the cerebral cortex, despite the lack of an increase in gene expression, which is involved in the mitochondrial biogenesis regulation. We suppose that increase in mtDNA content is associated with mitophagy downregulation. We supposed that mitophagy downregulation may be associated with an age-related increase in the mtDNA damage. In the hippocampus, we found a decrease in the Bdnf expression, which is involved in the pathways, which play an essential role in regulating long-term memory formation. We showed a deficit of working and reference memory in 15-month-old-mice in the water Morris maze, and a decrease in the exploratory behavior in the open field test. Cognitive impairments in 15-month-old mice correlated with a decrease in Bdnf expression in the hippocampus, Nfe2l2 expression, and an increase in the number of mtDNA damage in the cerebral cortex. Thus, these signaling pathways may be perspective targets for pharmacological intervention to maintain mitochondrial quality control, neuronal plasticity, and prevent the development of age-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - Generalization, the process of applying knowledge acquired in one context to other contexts, often drives the expression of similar behaviors in related situations. At the cellular level, generalization is thought to depend on the activity of overlapping neurons that represent shared features between contexts (general representations). Using contextual fear conditioning in mice, we demonstrate that generalization can also occur in response to stress and result from reactivation of specific, rather than general context representations. We found that generalization emerges during memory retrieval, along with stress-induced abnormalities of septohippocampal oscillatory activity and acetylcholine release, which are typically found in negative affective states. In hippocampal neurons that represent aversive memories and drive generalization, cholinergic septohippocampal afferents contributed to a unique reactivation pattern of cFos, Npas4, and repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST). Together, these findings suggest that generalization can be triggered by perceptually dissimilar but valence-congruent memories of specific aversive experiences. Through promoting the reactivation of such memories and their interference with ongoing behavior, abnormal cholinergic signaling could underlie maladaptive cognitive and behavioral generalization linked to negative affective states.

AB  - Pomaces of sea buckthorn berry were usually side-products during the processing of juice. Due to a lack of an economical and effective extraction method, it was typically recognized as waste. For the purpose of resource utilization, the mechanochemical-assisted extraction (MCAE) method was applied to develop an ecofriendly extraction method and product with better pharmacology activity. The parameters were investigated through response surface methodology (RSM) design experiments. The processing conditions were optimized as follows: amount of Na2CO3 40%, ball-to-material rate 29:1 g/g, milling speed 410 rpm, milling time 24 min, extraction temperature 25 degrees C, extraction time 20 min and the solid-to-solution ratio 1:10 g/mL. Under these conditions, the yields of flavonoids from sea buckthorn pomaces were 26.82 +/- 0.53 mg/g, which corresponds to an increase of 2 times in comparison with that extracted by the heat reflux extraction method. Meanwhile, the hepatoprotective activity of sea buckthorn pomaces extracts was studied by the liver injury induced by ip injection of tetracycline. Biochemical and histopathological studies showed that biomarkers in serum and liver of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mice were significantly ameliorated when sea buckthorn flavonoids extracted by MCAE were used. Altogether, these results demonstrate that, as a green and efficient extraction, MCAE treatment could increase the extraction yield of sea buckthorn flavonoids, meanwhile it could exhibit significant activity of improving liver function. This research provided a new way to use pomaces of sea buckthorn as a functional food. It also has great value on the comprehensive utilization of nature's resources.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess the patterns of trace element and mineral accumulation in 21 medicinal plants collected in the Altai Mountains foothills. The levels of trace elements and minerals in Hippophae rhamnoides, Aronia melanocarpa, Sorbus aucuparia, Viburnum opulus, Rosa canina, Crataegus sanguinea (fruits), Chamaenerion angustifolium, Echinacea purpurea, Fagopyrum esculentum, Trifolium pratense, Origanum vulgare, Achillea millefolium, Mentha piperita (herbs), Plantago major, Salvia officinalis, Urtica dioica (leaves), Panax ginseng, Rhaponticum carthamoides, Eleuterococcus senticosus, and Taraxacum officinale (roots), and Matricaria recutita flowers were assessed using inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. Comparative analysis revealed that R. carthamoides roots accumulated the highest level of toxic trace elements (Al, Cd, Ni, Pb). C. angustifolium herbs and V. opulus fruits are characterized by the highest As and Sn levels, respectively. The highest content of essential trace elements and minerals was observed in H. rhamnoides fruits (Zn), V. opulus fruits (Cu), E. purpurea herbs (I, Mg), R. carthamoides roots (Fe), O. vulgare herbs (Mn), and M. recutita herbs (Se). In turn, R. canina fruits are characterized by the lowest levels of certain essential and toxic trace elements. Significant differences in B, Cr, Li, Si, and Sr content were also revealed. Discriminant analysis revealed complete discrimination of certain medicinal plants based on their trace element and mineral content. The obtained data indicate the potential usefulness of medicinal plants as sources of certain essential trace elements and minerals, as well as provides data for risk assessment of toxic trace element intake following administration of medicinal plants.

KW  - EXPRESSION
AB  - Adult neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) reside in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus throughout the lifespan of most mammalian species. In addition to generating new neurons, NSPCs may alter their niche via secretion of growth factors and cytokines. We recently showed that adult DG NSPCs secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is critical for maintaining adult neurogenesis. Here, we asked whether NSPC-derived VEGF alters hippocampal function independent of adult neurogenesis. We found that loss of NSPC-derived VEGF acutely impaired hippocampal memory, caused neuronal hyperexcitability and exacerbated excitotoxic injury. Conversely, we observed that overexpression of VEGF reduced microglial response to excitotoxic injury. We also found that NSPCs generate substantial proportions of total DG VEGF and VEGF disperses widely throughout the DG, both of which help explain how this anatomically-restricted cell population could modulate function broadly. These findings suggest that NSPCs actively support and protect DG function via secreted VEGF, thereby providing a non-neurogenic functional dimension to endogenous NSPCs.

AB  - The central nervous system (CNS) is capable of synthesizing steroids for modulating essential functions such as neurotransmission, neuroplasticity, and neuroinflammation. These locally synthesized steroids, called neurosteroids, are produced through the conversion of cholesterol into the major steroid precursor pregnenolone, followed by downstream metabolism to form various steroids such as progesterone and allopregnanolone. Given that changes in neurosteroids are implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, understanding the neurosteroidogenesis pathway is crucial. Recent studies have demonstrated an alternative pathway for the biosynthesis of pregnenolone, which is classically produced by CYP11A1 but was found instead to be made by CYP1B1 in human glial cells. However, numerous studies have demonstrated Cyp11a1 expression and activity in rodent brain tissue and brain cells. To elucidate whether species differences exist for the pregnenolone synthesis enzyme in human and rodent brains, we sought to directly compare the expression levels of CYP11A1 and CYP1B1 in human, rat, and mouse CNS tissues. We found that CYP1B1 mRNA expression was significantly higher than that of CYP11A1 in almost all CNS brain regions in human, rat, and mouse. The exception is in the mouse cerebral cortex, where Cyp11a1 RNA was more abundant than Cyp1b1. However, Cyp11a1 protein was clearly detectable in rodent CNS while completely undetectable in human brain. In contrast, the presence of CYP1B1 protein can be observed in both human and rodent brains. These results suggest that CYP1B1 is likely the dominant pregnenolone synthesis enzyme in the human brain, while rodent brains may use both Cyp11a1 and Cyp1b1.

AB  - Maternal nutrient intake influences the health of the offspring via microenvironmental systems in digestion and absorption. Maternal high fructose diet (HFD) impairs hippocampus-dependent memory in adult female rat offspring. Howe ver, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Maternal HFD causes microbiota dysbiosis. In this study, we find that the plasma level of butyrate, a major metabolite of microbiota, is significantly decreased in the adult female maternal HFD offspring. In these rats, GPR43, a butyrate receptor was downregulated in the hippocampus. Moreover, the expressions of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) were downregulated in the hippocampus. The decreases of these functional proteins were reversed by fructooligosaccharides (FOS, a probiotic) treatment in adulthood. Astrocytes are critical for energy metabolism in the brain. Primary astrocyte culture from female maternal HFD offspring indicated that GPR43 and the mitochondrial biogenesis were significantly suppressed, which was reversed by supplemental butyrate incubation. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was reduced in the HFD group and rescued by butyrate. Intriguingly, the nuclear histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) was enhanced in the HFD group, suggesting an inhibitory role of butyrate on histone deacetylase activity. Inhibition of HDAC4 effectively restored the OCR, bioenergetics, and biogenesis of mitochondria. Together, these results suggested that the impaired butyrate signaling by maternal HFD could underlie the reduced mitochondrial functions in the hippocampus via HDAC4-mediated epigenetic changes.

AB  - We studied changes in the expression of early genes in hippocampal cells in response to stimulation of the dorsal medial septal area (dMSA), leading to long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Rats under urethane anesthesia were implanted with stimulating electrodes in the ventral hippocampal commissure and dMSA and a recording electrode in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. We found that high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the dMSA led to the induction of long-term potentiation in the synapses formed by the ventral hippocampal commissure on the hippocampal CA1 neurons. One hour after dMSA HFS, we collected the dorsal and ventral hippocampi on both the ipsilateral (damaged by the implanted electrode) and contralateral (intact) sides and analyzed the expression of genes by qPCR. The dMSA HFS led to an increase in the expression of bdnf and cyr61 in the ipsilateral hippocampi and egr1 in the ventral contralateral hippocampus. Thus, dMSA HFS under the conditions of degeneration of the cholinergic neurons in the medial septal area prevented the described increase in gene expression. The changes in cyr61 expression appeared to be dependent on the muscarinic M1 receptors. Our data suggest that the induction of long-term potentiation by dMSA activation enhances the expression of select early genes in the hippocampus.

AB  - Of the 35 million people in the world suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD), up to half experience comorbid psychosis. Antipsychotics, used to treat psychosis, are contraindicated in elderly patients because they increase the risk of premature death. Reports indicate that the hippocampus is hyperactive in patients with psychosis and those with AD. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) can regulate dopamine system function, which is thought to underlie symptoms of psychosis. A viral-mediated approach was used to express mutated human genes known to contribute to AD pathology: the Swedish (K670N, M671L), Florida (I716V), and London (V717I) mutations of amyloid precursor protein and two mutations (M146L and L286V) of presenilin 1 specifically in the vHipp, to investigate the selective contribution of AD-like pathology in this region. We observed a significant increase in dopamine neuron population activity and behavioral deficits in this AD-AAV model that mimics observations in rodent models with psychosis-like symptomatologies. Further, systemic administration of MP-III-022 (a5-GABAA receptor selective positive allosteric modulator) was able to reverse aberrant dopamine system function in AD-AAV rats. This study provides evidence for the development of drugs that target a5-GABAA receptors for patients with AD and comorbid psychosis.

AB  - Mutations in the Ceramide Kinase-like (CERKL) gene cause retinal dystrophies, characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal neurons, which eventually lead to vision loss. Among other functions, CERKL is involved in the regulation of autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and metabolism in the retina. However, CERKL is nearly ubiquitously expressed, and it has been recently described to play a protective role against brain injury. Here we show that Cerkl is expressed in the hippocampus, and we use mouse hippocampal neurons to explore the impact of either overexpression or depletion of CERKL on mitochondrial trafficking and dynamics along axons. We describe that a pool of CERKL localizes at mitochondria in hippocampal axons. Importantly, the depletion of CERKL in the Cerkl(KD/KO) mouse model is associated with changes in the expression of fusion/fission molecular regulators, induces mitochondrial fragmentation, and impairs axonal mitochondrial trafficking. Our findings highlight the role of CERKL, a retinal dystrophy gene, in the regulation of mitochondrial health and homeostasis in central nervous system anatomic structures other than the retina.

AB  - We developed a metatranscriptomics method that can simultaneously capture the respiratory virome, microbiome, and host response directly from low biomass samples. Using nasal swab samples, we capture RNA virome with sufficient sequencing depth required to assemble complete genomes. We find a surprisingly high frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and coronavirus (CoV) in healthy children, and a high frequency of RSV-A and RSV-B co-detections in children with symptomatic RSV. In addition, we have identified commensal and pathogenic bacteria and fungi at the species level. Functional analysis revealed that H. influenzae was highly active in symptomatic RSV subjects. The host nasal transcriptome reveled upregulation of the innate immune system, anti-viral response and inflammasome pathway, and downregulation of fatty acid pathways in children with symptomatic RSV. Overall, we demonstrate that our method is broadly applicable to infer the transcriptome landscape of an infected system, surveil respiratory infections, and to sequence RNA viruses directly from clinical samples.

AB  - This study assessed the nutritional profile of camellia oil through its fatty acid composition, highlighting its high oleic acid content (81.4%), followed by linoleic (7.99%) and palmitic acids (7.74%), demonstrating its excellence as an edible oil source. The impact of beeswax (BW) and glycerol monolaurate (GML) on camellia oil oleogels was investigated, revealing that increasing BW or GML concentrations enhanced hardness and springiness, with 10% BW oleogel exhibiting the highest hardness and springiness. FTIR results suggested that the structure of the oleogels was formed by interactions between molecules without altering the chemical composition. In biscuits, 10% BW oleogel provided superior crispness, expansion ratio, texture, and taste, whereas GML imparted a distinct odor. In sausages, no significant differences were observed in color, water retention, and pH between the control and replacement groups; however, the BW group scored higher than the GML group in the sensory evaluation. The findings suggest that the BW oleogel is an effective fat substitute in biscuits and sausages, promoting the application of camellia oil in food products.

AB  - Chronic stress has become a predominant factor associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, in both human and animal models. Although multiple studies have looked at transcriptional changes after social defeat stress, these studies primarily focus on bulk tissues, which might dilute important molecular signatures of social interaction in activated cells. In this study, we employed the Arc-GFP mouse model in conjunction with chronic social defeat (CSD) to selectively isolate activated nuclei (AN) populations in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of resilient and susceptible animals. Nuclear RNA-seq of susceptible vs. resilient populations revealed distinct transcriptional profiles linked predominantly with neuronal and synaptic regulation mechanisms. In the vHIP, susceptible AN exhibited increased expression of genes related to the cytoskeleton and synaptic organization. At the same time, resilient AN showed upregulation of cell adhesion genes and differential expression of major glutamatergic subunits. In the PFC, susceptible mice exhibited upregulation of synaptotagmins and immediate early genes (IEGs), suggesting a potentially over-amplified neuronal activity state. Our findings provide a novel view of stress-exposed neuronal activation and the molecular response mechanisms in stress-susceptible vs. resilient animals, which may have important implications for understanding mental resilience.

AB  - We used an in vitro model of the human brain immune microenvironment to simulate hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) and treatment with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUMSCs) to address the transformation barriers of gene differences between animals and humans in preclinical research. A co-culture system, termed hNAME, consisted of human hippocampal neurons (N), astrocytes (A), microglia (M), and brain microvascular endothelial cells (E). Flow cytometry measured the apoptosis rates of neurons and endothelial cells. hNAME-neurons and endothelial cells experienced more severe damage than monolayer cells, particularly after 48 h and 24 h of reoxygenation (OGD48/R24). Western blotting identified neuroinflammatory response markers, including HIF-1 & alpha;, C1q, C3, TNF-& alpha;, and iNOS. Inflammatory factors originated from the glial chamber rather than the neurons and vascular endothelial chambers. A gradual increase in the release of inflammatory factors was observed as the OGD and reoxygenation times increased, peaking at OGD48/R24. The hNAME value was confirmed in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUMSCs). Treatment with hUMSCs resulted in a notable decrease in the severity of neuronal and endothelial cell damage in hNAME. The hNAME is an ideal in vitro model for simulating the immune microenvironment of the human brain because of the interactions between neurons, vessels, astrocytes, and microglia.

AB  - The demand of bone grafting is increasing as the population ages worldwide. Although bone graft materials have been extensively developed over the decades, only a few injectable bone grafts are clinically available and none of them can be extruded from 18G needles. To overcome the existing treatment limitations, the aim of this study is to develop ideal injectable implants from biomaterials for minimally invasive surgery. An injectable composite bone graft containing calcium sulfate hemihydrate, tetracalcium phosphate, and anhydrous calcium hydrogen phosphate (CSH/CaP paste) was prepared with different CSH/CaP ratios and different concentrations of additives. The setting time, injectability, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility were evaluated. The developed injectable CSH/CaP paste (CSH/CaP 1:1 supplemented with 6% citric acid and 2% HPMC) presented good handling properties, great biocompatibility, and adequate mechanical strength. Furthermore, the paste was demonstrated to be extruded from a syringe equipped with 18G needles and exerted a great potential for minimally invasive surgery. The developed injectable implants with tissue repairing potentials will provide an ideal therapeutic strategy for minimally invasive surgery to apply in the treatment of maxillofacial defects, certain indications in the spine, inferior turbinate for empty nose syndrome (ENS), or reconstructive rhinoplasty.

AB  - Fetalization associated with a delay in development and the preservation of the features of the embryonic structure of the brain dominates the ontogeny of salmonids. The aim of the present study was to comparatively analyze the distribution of the glial-type aNSC markers such as vimentin and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) and the migratory neuronal precursors such as doublecortin in the telencephalon subpallium of juvenile masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou, in normal conditions and at 1 week after an injury to the dorsal pallium. Immunohistochemical labeling of vimentin, GFAP, and doublecortin in the pallium of intact juvenile masu salmon revealed single cells with similar morphologies corresponding to a persistent pool of neuronal and/or glial progenitors. The study of the posttraumatic process showed the presence of intensely GFAP-labeled cells of the neuroepithelial type that form reactive neurogenic zones in all areas of the subpallial zone of juvenile masu salmon. A comparative analysis of the distribution of radial glia in the dorsal, ventral, and lateral zones of the subpallium showed a maximum concentration of cells in the dorsal part of subpallium (VD) and a minimum concentration in the lateral part of subpallium VL. An essential feature of posttraumatic immunolabeling in the masu salmon subpallium is the GFAP distribution patterns that are granular intracellular in the apical periventricular zone (PVZ) and fibrillar extracellular in the subventricular (SVZ) and parenchymal zones (PZ). In contrast to those in intact animals, most of the GFAP+ granules and constitutive neurogenic niches in injured fish were localized in the basal part of the PVZ. With the traumatic injury to the subpallium, the number of Vim+ cells in the lateral and ventral regions significantly increased. At 1 week post-injury, the total immunolabeling of vimentin cells in the PVZ was replaced by the granular pattern of Vim immunodistribution spreading from the PVZ to the SVZ and deeper parenchymal layers of the brain in all areas of the subpallium. A significant increase in the number of DC+ cells was observed also in all areas of the subpallium. The number of cells increased both in the PVZ and in the SVZ, as well as in the deeper PZ. Thus, at 1 week after the injury to the dorsal pallium, the number of DC, Vim, and GFAP expressing cells of the neuroepithelial type in the subpallium of juvenile masu salmon increased, and additionally GFAP+ radial glia appeared in VD, which was absent from intact animals.

AB  - Epileptogenesis is characterized by intrinsic changes in neuronal firing, resulting in hyperactive neurons and the subsequent generation of seizure activity. These alterations are accompanied by changes in gene transcription networks, first with the activation of early-immediate genes and later with the long-term activation of genes involved in memory. Our objective was to engineer a promoter containing binding sites for activity-dependent transcription factors upregulated in chronic epilepsy (EpiPro) and validate it in multiple rodent models of epilepsy. First, we assessed the activity dependence of EpiPro: initial electrophysiology studies found that EpiPro-driven GFP expression was associated with increased firing rates when compared with unlabeled neurons, and the assessment of EpiPro-driven GFP expression revealed that GFP expression was increased similar to 150x after status epilepticus. Following this, we compared EpiPro-driven GFP expression in two rodent models of epilepsy, rat lithium/pilocarpine and mouse electrical kindling. In rodents with chronic epilepsy, GFP expression was increased in most neurons, but particularly in dentate granule cells, providing in vivo evidence to support the "breakdown of the dentate gate" hypothesis of limbic epileptogenesis. Finally, we assessed the time course of EpiPro activation and found that it was rapidly induced after seizures, with inactivation following over weeks, confirming EpiPro's potential utility as a gene therapy driver for epilepsy.

AB  - Great effort has been devoted to the synthesis of novel multi-target directed tacrine derivatives in the search of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein we describe the proof of concept of MBA121, a compound designed as a tacrine-ferulic acid hybrid, and its potential use in the therapy of AD. MBA121 shows good b-amyloid (A beta) anti-aggregation properties, selective inhibition of human butyrylcholinesterase, good neuroprotection against toxic insults, such as A b 1-40, A beta(1-42), and H2O2, and promising ADMET properties that support translational developments. A passive avoidance task in mice with experimentally induced amnesia was carried out, MBA121 being able to significantly decrease scopolamine-induced learning deficits. In addition, MBA121 reduced the A b plaque burden in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in APP(swe)/PS1 (Delta E9) transgenic male mice. Our in vivo results relate its bioavailability with the therapeutic response, demonstrating that MBA121 is a promising agent to treat the cognitive decline and neurodegeneration underlying AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with progressive memory loss and the cognitive decline. AD is mainly caused by abnormal accumulation of misfolded amyloid 6 (A6), which leads to neurodegeneration via a number of possible mechanisms such as down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tropomyosin-related kinase B (BDNF-TRKB) signal-ing pathway. 7 ,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a TRKB agonist, has demonstrated potential to enhance BDNF-TRKB pathway in various neurodegenerative diseases. T o expand the capacity of flavones as TRKB agonists, two natural flavones quercetin and apigenin, were evaluated. With tryptophan fluorescence quenching assay, we illustrated the direct interaction between quercetin/ apigenin and TRKB extracellular domain. Employing A6 folding reporter SH-SY5Y cells, we showed that quercetin and apigenin reduced A6-aggregation, oxidative stress, caspase-1 and acetylcholinesterase activities, as well as improved the neurite out-growth. Treatments with quercetin and apigenin increased TRKB Tyr516 and Tyr817 and downstream cAMP-response-element binding protein (CREB) Ser133 to activate transcription of BDNF and BCL2 apoptosis regulator (BCL2), as well as reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic BCL2 associated X protein (BAX). Knockdown of TRKB counteracted the improvement of neurite outgrowth by quercetin and apigenin. Our results demonstrate that quercetin and apigenin are to work likely as a direct agonist on TRKB for their neuroprotective action, strengthening the therapeutic potential of quercetin and apigenin in treating AD.

AB  - Autophagy is a regulated mechanism of degradation of misfolded proteins and organelles in the cell. Neurons are highly differentiated cells with extended projections, and therefore, their functioning largely depends on the mechanisms of autophagy. For the first time in an animal model using immunohistochemistry, dot analysis, and qRT-PCR, the autophagy (macroautophagy) activity in neurons of two brain regions (hippocampus and neocortex) under normoxia and after exposure to hypoxia was studied. It was found that under normoxia, the autophagic activity was higher in the hippocampal neurons than in the neocortex of rats. In the hippocampus, the exposure of rats to hypoxia resulted in a decrease in the content of autophagy markers LC3 and p62, which was followed by activation of the autophagy-related gene expression. In the neocortex, no changes in these marker proteins were observed after the exposure to hypoxia. These data indicate that the neurons in the hippocampus and neocortex differ in the autophagy response to hypoxia, which may reflect the physiological and functional differences of the pyramidal cells of these brain regions and may to some extent account for the extreme vulnerability of the CA1 hippocampal neurons and relatively high resistance of the neocortical neurons to hypoxia.

AB  - Interleukin (IL)-22 is a potent mediator of inflammatory responses. The IL-22 receptor consists of the IL-22R alpha and IL-10R beta subunits. Previous studies have shown that IL-22R alpha expression is restricted to non-hematopoietic cells in the skin, pancreas, intestine, liver, lung, and kidney. Although IL-22 is involved in the development of inflammatory responses, there have been no reports of its role in brain inflammation. Here, we used RT-PCR, Western blotting, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical, and microarray analyses to examine the role of IL-22 and expression of IL-22R alpha in the brain, using the microglial cell line, hippocampal neuronal cell line, and inflamed mouse brain tissue. Treatment of BV2 and HT22 cells with recombinant IL-22 increased the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha, as well as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandin E2. We also found that the JNK and STAT3 signaling pathways play an important role in IL-22-mediated increases in inflammatory mediators. Microarray analyses revealed upregulated expression of inflammation-related genes in IL-22-treated HT22 cells. Finally, we found that IL-22R alpha is spontaneously expressed in the brain and is upregulated in inflamed mouse brain. Overall, our results demonstrate that interaction of IL-22 with IL-22R alpha plays a role in the development of inflammatory responses in the brain.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are usually generated by reprogramming differentiated cells through the introduction of specific transcription factors, but this is a difficult and inefficient process. Valproic acid (VPA) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that significantly improves the efficiency of iPSC generation. But its role and mechanism are still unclear.
   Methods and Results: We transduced Bactrian camel fetal fibroblasts (BCFFs) with retroviruses carrying defined factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC and EGFP; OSKMG) in the presence of VPA. Cells were collected (Day 7) and analyzed using RNA-seq technology. Afterwards, different groups of cells and transcriptomics results were detected by PCR and qRT-PCR technology. The results showed that VPA promoted the expression of the endogenous gene c-Myc and inhibited cell proliferation; at the same time, it promoted the expression of VEGF and other genes related to angiogenesis.
   Conclusions: When VPA is added to the culture medium, only the cells that have begun to reprogram can break the G2/M repression through the expression of the endogenous gene c-Myc, and use the nutrients and space in the culture dish to proliferate normally, which can achieve the purpose of directly improving the efficiency of reprogramming. Another new discovery for Bactrian camels, VPA significantly increased the expression of VEGFC and other genes, promoting the transformation of fibroblasts to endothelial cells (different from the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition process of other species) to accelerate the early induction of Bactrian camels iPSc process. Overall, this study proved the new mechanism of VPA in enhancing the induction of pluripotency from the transcriptome level.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonizes the nasal cavities of both healthy individuals and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with (CRSwNP) and without (CRSsNP) nasal polyps. Treatment-resistant S. aureus biofilms and intracellular persistence are common in CRS patients, requiring the expression of specific virulence factor genes to transition into these forms. We hypothesized that S. aureus isolates from non-diseased controls, CRSsNP patients, and CRSwNP patients would exhibit distinct virulence factor patterns contributing to persistence and intracellular survival in CRS patients. Nasal swabs from seventy-seven individuals yielded S. aureus cultures in eight non-diseased controls, eight CRSsNP patients, and five CRSwNP patients. Whole-genome sequencing analyzed stress, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence genes, including plasmids and prophages. Four virulence factor gene patterns emerged: a core set (hlgA, icaC, hlgB, hlgC, hld, and aur) present in all isolates, and accessory sets, including the enterotoxin gene cluster (seo, sem, seu, sei, and sen) and a partial/complete invasive virulence factor set (splE, splA, splB, lukE, and lukD) (p = 0.001). CRSwNP isolates exhibited incomplete carriage of the core set, with frequent loss of scn, icaC, and hlgA (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that S. aureus has clusters of virulence factors that may act in concert to support the survival and persistence of the bacteria, resulting in enhanced pathogenicity. This may manifest clinically with resistant disease and refractoriness to antibiotics.

AB  - Increasing numbers of animal studies have shown that repeat sevoflurane exposure during developmental stage may lead to long-term cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the exact pathogenesis remains unclear. Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) has been associated with cognitive decline in various neurological disorders. Here we found that the expression of IL-17A was up-regulated in hippocampus of sevoflurane exposed neonatal mice. Genetic deletion of IL-17A or inhibition of IL-17A improved behavioral function and down-regulated neuroinflammation related genes, interleukin 1n (IL-1n), interleukin 6 (IL-6), Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) in hippocampus of sevoflurane exposed neonatal mice. Moreover, negative regulation of IL-17A/Interleukin 17A receptor(IL-17RA) promoted the extracellular signal- regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and nucleation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding (CREB) in neurons of cognitive impaired mice. Knockdown of IL-17A in vivo identified neurons-localized IL-17A as a major factor in neuroinflammation and neurodevelopment. Collectively, our results suggested that IL-17A was required for the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory response and identify IL-17A as a potential therapeutic target for cognitive impairment exposed by general anesthetics during infancy.

AB  - Carvone, a natural monoterpene, has been identified in various plants, giving them a characteristic scent. Enantiomers (R-(-) and S-(+)) reveal specific biological activities that are successfully used in traditional medicine for their antifungal, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and anti-influenza properties. The presented paper is based on S-(+)-carvone, characterized by a specific caraway scent, which revealed rich biological activities both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate the potential anti-neurodegenerative activity of S-(+)-carvone, including in vitro experiments (butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory, neuro- and hepatotoxicity as well as neuro- and hepatoprotective activity), in vivo (memory acquisition, locomotor activity), and ex vivo (determination of S-(+)-carvone's level in tissues collected from mice). Results revealed the multidirectional character of S-(+)-carvone. It has been shown that S-(+)-carvone is capable of butyrylcholinesterase inhibition (40% for 0.025 mg applied onto the plate), and neuroprotection and hepatoprotection at selective concentrations against reactive oxygen species generation and lipid peroxidation along with non-hepatotoxicity character. Additionally, multiple-dose administration of the monoterpene at a dose of 100 mg/kg had a positive influence on memory acquisition. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the plasma and the brain showed that S-(+)-carvone can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the hippocampus (0.217 mu g/mg of tissue), a crucial part of the brain associated with cognition and mental functions.

TI  - Optogenetic stimulation of mouse Hoxb8 microglia in specific regions of the brain induces anxiety, grooming, or both
T2  - MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
LA  - English
KW  - AMYGDALA
AB  - Previously, we have shown that either disruption of the Hoxb8 gene or ablation of a microglial subpopulation, Hoxb8 microglia, results in mice exhibiting both chronic anxiety and OCSD-like behavior, compulsive pathological hair pulling (trichotillomania), to the point of showing lesions at the sites of overgrooming. Herein we show, that optogenetic stimulation of Hoxb8 microglia in specific regions of the brain induces elevated anxiety, grooming or both. Optogenetic stimulation of Hoxb8 microglia within the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) or the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) induces grooming, whereas stimulation of Hoxb8 microglia in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or central amygdala (CeA) produces elevated anxiety. Optogenetic stimulation of Hoxb8 microglia in the ventral CA1 region of the hippocampus (vCA1) induces both behaviors as well as freezing. In vitro we directly demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation of Hoxb8 microglia in specific regions of the brain activate neighboring neural activity through the induction of the c-fos-immediate early response. These experiments connect outputs from optogenetically stimulated Hoxb8 microglia, within specific regions of the brain, to the activation of neurons and neural circuits that in turn enable induction of these behaviors. These experiments suggest that Hoxb8 microglia are likely to be among, or the main, first responders to signals that evoke these behaviors. The same regions of the brain (DMS, mPFC, BLA, CeA and vCA1) have previously been defined at the neuronal level, by optogenetics, to control anxiety in mice. Intriguingly, the optogenetic experiments in microglia suggest that the two populations of microglia, canonical non-Hoxb8 and Hoxb8 microglia, function in opposition rather than in parallel to each other, providing a biological reason for the presence of two microglial subpopulations in mice.

AB  - In response to stressful events, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated, and consequently glucocorticoids are released by the adrenal gland into the blood circulation. A large body of research has illustrated that excessive glucocorticoids in the hippocampus exerts negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis through glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is critical for the homeostasis of the HPA axis. Maternal prenatal stress causes dysfunction of the HPA axis feedback mechanism in their offspring in adulthood. Here we report that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene knockout causes hyperactivity of the HPA axis without hippocampal GR deficiency. We found that the level of TERT in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus during the developmental stage determines the responses of the HPA axis to stressful events in adulthood through modulating the excitability of the dentate granular cells (DGCs) rather than the expression of GR. Our study also suggests that the prenatal high level of glucocorticoids exposure-induced hypomethylation at Chr13:73764526 in the first exon of mouse Tert gene accounted for TERT deficiency in the DG and HPA axis abnormality in the adult offspring. This study reveals a novel GR-independent mechanism underlying prenatal stress-associated HPA axis impairment, providing a new angle for understanding the mechanisms for maintaining HPA axis homeostasis.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis in cartilaginous fish remains a relatively unexplored area, particularly in terms of comparative analysis. This process, defined as the ability of specialized stem cells to generate new functional neurons, has gained prominence due to its relevance in neurodegenerative disease research and regenerative medicine. However, there is an ongoing discussion about when and where it first appeared. Evidence of adult neurogenesis in both teleosts and mammals highlights significant differences, such as the number of newly formed cells and the brain regions involved. Investigating additional cartilaginous fish species, which occupy a basal position in vertebrate phylogeny, could provide valuable insights into the ancient origins of this trait and potentially new general knowledge about the adult neurogenesis process. In this study, we combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to examine neurogenic activity in three brain regions-the telencephalon, mesencephalon, and cerebellum-of two batoid species: Raja asterias and Torpedo ocellata. Immunohistochemical methods were used to identify neurogenic cells by employing markers for cell proliferation (PCNA), mitosis (pH3), glial cells (S100B), and stem cells (Msi1). Additionally, in situ hybridization was performed to detect neural stem cell mRNA for Notch1, Notch3, and Sox2 in the telencephalon and mesencephalon of Raja asterias.

AB  - Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) constitute a diverse superfamily of NAD(P)+-dependent enzymes pivotal in oxidizing endogenous and exogenous aldehydes to carboxylic acids. Beyond metabolic roles, ALDHs participate in essential biological processes, including differentiation, embryogenesis and the DNA damage response, while also serving as markers for cancer stem cells (CSCs). Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the detoxification of lipid peroxidation by-products and metabolism of various aldehyde substrates. This study examines the potential role of ALDH1B1 in human lung adenocarcinoma and its association with the CSC phenotype. To this end, we utilized the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, engineered to stably express the human ALDH1B1 protein tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Overexpression of ALDH1B1 led to notable changes in cell morphology, proliferation rate and clonogenic efficiency. Furthermore, ALDH1B1-overexpressing A549 cells exhibited enhanced resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and cisplatin. Additionally, ALDH1B1 overexpression correlated with increased migratory potential and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mediated by the upregulation of transcription factors such as SNAI2, ZEB2 and TWIST1, alongside the downregulation of E-cadherin. Moreover, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis using data from 507 publicly available lung adenocarcinoma clinical samples revealed a significant correlation between ALDH1B1 and various molecules implicated in CSC-related signaling pathways, including Wnt, Notch, hypoxia, Hedgehog, retinoic acid, Hippo, NF-kappa Beta, TGF-beta, PI3K/PTEN-AKT and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. These findings provide insights into the role of ALDH1B1 in lung tumor progression and its relation to the lung CSC phenotype, thereby offering potential therapeutic targets in the clinical management of lung adenocarcinoma.

AB  - Camellia luteoflora is a rare and endangered plant endemic to China. It has high ornamental and potential economic and medicinal value, and is an important germplasm resource of Camellia. To understand the distributions and differences in metabolites from different parts of C. luteoflora, in this study, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to examine the types and contents of chemical constituents in five organs of C. luteoflora: roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. The results showed that a total of 815 metabolites were identified in the five organs and were classified into 18 main categories, including terpenoids (17.1%), amino acids (10.4%), flavonoids (10.3%), sugars and alcohols (9.8%), organic acids (9.0%), lipids (7.1%), polyphenols (4.8%), alkaloids (4.8%), etc. A total of 684 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) in five organs were obtained and annotated into 217 KEGG metabolic pathways, among which metabolic pathways, ABC transporters, the biosynthesis of cofactors, and the biosynthesis of amino acids were significantly enriched. In DEMs, flowers are rich in flavonoids, polyphenols, organic acids, and steroids; fruits are rich in amino acids, alkaloids, vitamins, and xanthones; stems are rich in lignans; and leaves have the highest relative content of phenylpropanoids, ketoaldehydic acids, quinones, sugars and alcohols, terpenoids, coumarins, lipids, and others; meanwhile, the metabolite content is lower in roots. Among the dominant DEMs, 58 were in roots, including arachidonic acid, lucidone, isoliquiritigenin, etc.; 75 were in flowers, including mannose, shikimic acid, d-gluconic acid, kaempferol, etc.; 45 were in the fruit, including pterostilbene, l-ascorbic acid, riboflavin, etc.; 27 were in the stems, including salicylic acid, d-(-)-quinic acid, mannitol, (-)-catechin gallate, etc.; there was a maximum number of 119 dominant metabolites in the leaves, including oleanolic acid, l-glucose, d-arabitol, eugenol, etc. In sum, the rich chemical composition of C. luteoflora and the significant differences in the relative contents of metabolites in different organs will provide theoretical references for the study of tea, flower tea, edible oil, nutraceuticals, and the medicinal components of C. luteoflora.

AB  - Fyn is a Src kinase that controls critical signalling cascades and has been implicated in learning and memory. Postsynaptic enrichment of Fyn underpins synaptotoxicity in dementias such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with Tau pathology (FTLD-Tau). The FLTD P301L mutant Tau is associated with a higher propensity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form biomolecular condensates. Expression of P301L mutant Tau promotes aberrant trapping of Fyn in nanoclusters within hippocampal dendrites by an unknown mechanism. Here, we used single-particle tracking photoactivated localisation microscopy to demonstrate that the opening of Fyn into its primed conformation promotes its nanoclustering in dendrites leading to increased Fyn/ERK/S6 downstream signalling. Preventing the auto-inhibitory closed conformation of Fyn through phospho-inhibition or through perturbation of its SH3 domain increased Fyn's nanoscale trapping, whereas inhibition of the catalytic domain had no impact. By combining pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that P301L Tau enhanced both Fyn nanoclustering and Fyn/ERK/S6 signalling via its ability to form biomolecular condensates. Together, our findings demonstrate that Fyn alternates between a closed and an open conformation, the latter being enzymatically active and clustered. Furthermore, pathogenic immobilisation of Fyn relies on the ability of P301L Tau to form biomolecular condensates, thus highlighting the critical importance of LLPS in controlling nanoclustering and downstream intracellular signalling events.

AB  - Prosaposin (PSAP) and progranulin (PGRN) are two lysosomal proteins that interact and modulate the metabolism of lipids, particularly sphingolipids. Alterations in sphingolipid metabolism have been found in schizophrenia. Genetic associations of PSAP and PGRN with schizophrenia have been reported. To further clarify the role of PSAP and PGRN in schizophrenia, we examined PSAP and PGRN levels in postmortem cingulate cortex tissue from healthy controls along with patients who had suffered from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder. We found that PSAP and PGRN levels are reduced specifically in schizophrenia patients. To understand the role of PSAP in the cingulate cortex, we used an AAV strategy to knock down PSAP in neurons located in this region. Neuronal PSAP knockdown led to the downregulation of neuronal PGRN levels and behavioral abnormalities. Cingulate-PSAP-deficient mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired prepulse inhibition, as well as intact locomotion, working memory, and a depression-like state. The behavioral changes were accompanied by increased early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1) and activity-dependent cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) levels in the sensorimotor cortex and hippocampus, regions implicated in circuitry dysfunction in schizophrenia. In conclusion, PSAP and PGRN downregulation in the cingulate cortex is associated with schizophrenia pathophysiology.

AB  - Altered arginine metabolism (including the polyamine system) has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of tauopathies, characterised by hyperphosphorylated and aggregated microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) accumulation in the brain. The present study, for the first time, systematically determined the time-course of arginine metabolism changes in the MAPT P301S (PS19) mouse brain at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 months of age. The polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine are critically involved in microtubule assembly and stabilization. This study, therefore, further investigated how polyamine biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes changed in PS19 mice. There were general age-dependent increases of L-arginine, L-ornithine, putrescine and spermidine in the PS19 brain (particularly in the hippocampus and parahippocampal region). While this profile change clearly indicates a shift of arginine metabolism to favor polyamine production (a polyamine stress response), spermine levels were decreased or unchanged due to the upregulation of polyamine retro-conversion pathways. Our results further implicate altered arginine metabolism (particularly the polyamine system) in the pathogenesis of tauopathies. Given the role of the polyamines in microtubule assembly and stabilization, future research is required to understand the functional significance of the polyamine stress response and explore the preventive and/or therapeutic opportunities for tauopathies by targeting the polyamine system.

AB  - The Japanese rhinoceros beetle (Trypoxylus dichotomus [Allomyrina dichotoma]) produces the lectins allo A-I and allo A-II, which have strong N-acetyllactosamine (Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc)-binding activity. It has been suggested that the two lectins are formed from three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma), with allo A-I comprising alpha and gamma subunits and allo A-II comprising beta and gamma subunits. Here, we determined the cDNA sequences of these subunits using both conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-cloning-sequencing and transcriptome-sequencing analyses. For the alpha and beta subunits, one gene (locus) for each was predicted, whereas for the gamma subunit, two types of cDNA sequences were obtained, which we named gamma 1 and gamma 2. These two types probably have distinct loci. Average nucleotide sequence identities among the subunits ranged from 87.6% (between alpha and gamma 1) to 92.6% (between gamma 1 and gamma 2), suggesting that they form a gene family. Although no homology was found between the sequences of allo A and other known lectin proteins in a protein database search, some unknown proteins containing the DUF3421 domain were identified. Those DUF3421 domain-encoding proteins are upregulated in the insect larval midgut. Thus, we infer that allo A genes also play an important role in larvae and that their lectin activity may have been obtained collaterally.

AB  - Background: Heart failure (HF) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and hippocampal dysfunction, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the role of microRNA (miRNA) networks in hippocampus-dependent memory recovery in a mouse model of HF. Methods: CaMKII delta C transgenic (TG) mice, a model for HF, were used to assess hippocampal function at 3 and 6 months of age. Memory performance was evaluated using hippocampus-dependent behavioral tasks. Small RNA sequencing was performed to analyze hippocampal miRNA expression profiles across both time points. Bioinformatic analyses identified miRNAs that potentially regulate genes previously implicated in HF-induced cognitive impairment. Results: We have previously shown that at 3 months of age, CaMKII delta C TG mice exhibited significant memory deficits associated with dysregulated hippocampal gene expression. In this study, we showed that these impairments, memory impairment and hippocampal gene expression, were no longer detectable at 6 months, despite persistent cardiac dysfunction. However, small RNA sequencing revealed a dynamic shift in hippocampal miRNA expression, identifying 27 miRNAs as "compensatory miRs" that targeted 73% of the transcripts dysregulated at 3 months but reinstated by 6 months. Notably, miR-181a-5p emerged as a central regulatory hub, with its downregulation coinciding with restored memory function. Conclusions: These findings suggest that miRNA networks contribute to the restoration of hippocampal function in HF despite continued cardiac pathology and provide an important compensatory mechanism towards memory impairment. A better understanding of these compensatory miRNA mechanisms may provide novel therapeutic targets for managing HF-related cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Aging leads to progressive decline in organ and tissue integrity and function, partly due to loss of proteostasis and autophagy malfunctioning. A decrease with age in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective type of lysosomal degradation, has been reported in various organs and cells from rodents and humans. Disruption of CMA recapitulates features of aging, whereas activating CMA in mice protects against age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, retinal degeneration and/or atherosclerosis. However, sex-specific and cell-type-specific differences in CMA with aging remain unexplored. Here, using CMA reporter mice and single-cell transcriptomic data, we report that most organs and cell types show CMA decline with age, with males exhibiting a greater decline with aging. Reduced CMA is often associated with fewer lysosomes competent for CMA. Transcriptional downregulation of CMA genes may further contribute to CMA decline, especially in males. These findings suggest that CMA differences may influence organ vulnerability to age-related degeneration.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is effective against treatment-resistant psychosis, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Conventional volumetry studies have revealed plasticity in limbic structures following ECT but with inconsistent clinical relevance, as they potentially overlook subtle histological alterations. Our study analyzed microstructural changes in limbic structures after ECT using MRI texture analysis and demonstrated a correlation with clinical response. 36 schizophrenia or schizoaffective patients treated with ECT and medication, 27 patients treated with medication only, and 70 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Structural MRI data were acquired before and after ECT for the ECT group and at equivalent intervals for the medication-only group. The gray matter volume and MRI texture, calculated from the gray level size zone matrix (GLSZM), were extracted from limbic structures. After normalizing texture features to HC data, group-time interactions were estimated with repeated-measures mixed models. Repeated-measures correlations between clinical variables and texture were analyzed. Volumetric group-time interactions were observed in seven of fourteen limbic structures. Group-time interactions of the normalized GLSZM large area emphasis of the left hippocampus and the right amygdala reached statistical significance. Changes in these texture features were correlated with changes in psychotic symptoms in the ECT group but not in the medication-only group. These findings provide in vivo evidence that microstructural changes in key limbic structures, hypothetically reflected by MRI texture, are associated with clinical response to ECT for psychosis. These findings support the neuroplasticity hypothesis of ECT and highlight the hippocampus and amygdala as potential targets for neuromodulation in psychosis.

AB  - Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) represents a serious and growing worldwide economic and healthcare burden. Almost 95% of current AD patients are associated with sAD as opposed to patients presenting with well-characterized genetic mutations that lead to AD predisposition, i.e., familial AD (fAD). Presently, the use of transgenic (Tg) animals overexpressing human versions of these causative fAD genes represents the dominant research model for AD therapeutic development. As significant differences in etiology exist between sAD and fAD, it is perhaps more appropriate to develop novel, more sAD-reminiscent experimental models that would expedite the discovery of effective therapies for the majority of AD patients. Here we present the oDGal mouse model, a novel model of sAD that displays a range of AD-like pathologies as well as multiple cognitive deficits reminiscent of AD symptomology. Hippocampal cognitive impairment and pathology were delayed with N-acetyl-cysteine (NaC) treatment, which strongly suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the drivers of downstream pathologies such as elevated amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tau. These features demonstrate a desired pathophenotype that distinguishes our model from current transgenic rodent AD models. A preclinical model that presents a phenotype of non-genetic AD-like pathologies and cognitive deficits would benefit the sAD field, particularly when translating therapeutics from the preclinical to the clinical phase.

AB  - Corpus cerebelli in juvenile chum salmon is a multiprojective region of the brain connected via afferent and efferent projections with the higher regions of the brainstem and synencephalon, as well as with multiprojection regions of the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. During the postembryonic development of the cerebellum in chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, the lateral part of the juvenile cerebellum gives rise to the caudomedial part of the definitive cerebellum, which is consistent with the data reported for zebrafish and mouse cerebellum. Thus, the topographic organization of the cerebellum and its efferents are similar between fish (chum salmon and zebrafish) and mammals, including mice and humans. The distributions of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAVs) after an injection of the base vector into the cerebellum have shown highly specific patterns of transgene expression in bipolar neurons in the latero-caudal lobe of the juvenile chum tectum opticum. The distribution of rAAVs in the dorsal thalamus, epithalamus, nucleus rotundus, and pretectal complex indicates the targeted distribution of the transgene via the thalamo-cerebellar projections. The detection of GFP expression in the cells of the epiphysis and posterior tubercle of juvenile chum salmon is associated with the transgene's distribution and with the cerebrospinal fluid flow, the brain ventricles and its outer surface. The direct delivery of the rAAV into the central nervous system by intracerebroventricular administration allows it to spread widely in the brain. Thus, the presence of special projection areas in the juvenile chum salmon cerebellum, as well as outside it, and the identification of the transgene's expression in them confirm the potential ability of rAAVs to distribute in both intracerebellar and afferent and efferent extracerebellar projections of the cerebellum.

AB  - Lyophilization is the leading storage technique for sporulating fungi. The genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium encompass sporulating species, many reported as hydrolase producers. Hydrolases have noteworthy commercial value; amylases account for 30% of all sales of hydrolases due to their use in industrial starch processing. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the surviving ability of filamentous fungal isolates that had remained lyophilized approximately 30 years and to assess their amylases production. The 57 fungal isolates were collected in Southern Brazil as contaminants in plants or petri plates containing primarily a starch-rich culture medium. A total of 34 fungal isolates were recovered, which belonged to the genera Aspergillus (9), Penicillium (8), Talaromyces (2), Fusarium (11), Rhinocladiella (1), Cladosporium (1), and Trichoderma (2). These isolates were identified at the species level using DNA barcoding. In the amylase production survey, isolates of the Aspergillus genus were the best producers, followed by isolates of the Penicillium and Fusarium genera. Some of the amylase producer species are well known, but some produce enzymes yet to be purified and characterized, such as and Fusarium oxysporum. In conclusion, we demonstrated the survival capability of several fungal species and the usefulness of fungal amylase production screening.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis, and the clinical drugs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are usually multi-drug combinations. Therefore, it is necessary to search for and find specific new bioactive agents against pancreatic cancer. Carabrone is a carabrane-type sesquiterpenolide extracted from Carpesium cernuum L., and this natural compound has been reported to be a potential anti-tumor agent. However, there are few reports on the function of carabrone related to anti-tumor activity in pancreatic cancer. Herein, cell experiments indicated that carabrone had anti-proliferation inhibition and anti-migration and anti-invasion activity against SW1990 cells. Furthermore, the tandem mass spectrometry and network pharmacology analysis showed that this activity may be related to the ferroptosis and Hippo signaling pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrated that carabrone exhibited prominent anti-pancreatic cancer activity and could be a promising agent against pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is the major intermediate filament III protein of astroglia cells which is upregulated in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here we reported that GFAP is truncated at both the C- and N-terminals by cytosolic protease calpain to GFAP breakdown products (GBDP) of 46-40K then 38K following pro-necrotic (A23187) and pro-apoptotic (staurosporine) challenges to primary cultured astroglia or neuron-glia mixed cells. In addition, with another pro-apoptotic challenge (EDTA) where caspases are activated but not calpain, GFAP was fragmented internally, generating a C-terminal GBDP of 20 kDa. Following controlled cortical impact in mice, GBDP of 46-40K and 38K were formed from day 3 to 28 post-injury. Purified GFAP protein treated with calpain-1 and -2 generates (i) major N-terminal cleavage sites at A-56*A-61 and (ii) major C-terminal cleavage sites at T-383*Q-388, producing a limit fragment of 38K. Caspase-6 treated GFAP was cleaved at D-78/R-79 and D-225/A-226, where GFAP was relatively resistant to caspase-3. We also derived a GBDP-38K N-terminal-specific antibody which only labels injured astroglia cell body in both cultured astroglia and mouse cortex and hippocampus after TBI. As a clinical translation, we observed that CSF samples collected from severe human TBI have elevated levels of GBDP-38K as well as two C-terminally released GFAP peptides (DGEVIKES and DGEVIKE). Thus, in addition to intact GFAP, both the GBDP-38K as well as unique GFAP released C-terminal proteolytic peptides species might have the potential in tracking brain injury progression.

AB  - Optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry is an important tool for investigating learning in vivo. Numerous approaches to pulse design have been employed to elicit desirable circuit and behavioral outcomes. Here, we systematically test the outcome of different single-pulse waveforms in a rate-based model of hippocampal memory function at the level ofmnemonic replay extension and de novo synaptic weight formation in CA3 and CA1. Lower-power waveforms with long forward or forward and backward ramps yield more natural sequence replay dynamics and induce synaptic plasticity that allows for more natural memory replay timing, in contrast to square or backward ramps. These differences between waveform shape and amplitude are preserved with the addition of noise in membrane potential, light scattering, and protein expression, improving the potential validity of predictions for in vivo work. These results inform future optogenetic experimental design choices in the field of learning and memory.

AB  - Fibrosis is a central pathway that drives progression of multiple chronic diseases, yet few safe and effective clinical antifibrotic therapies exist. In most fibrotic disorders, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-driven scarring is an important pathologic feature and a key contributor to disease progression. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are two closely related transcription cofactors that are important for coordinating fibrogenesis after organ injury, but how they are activated in response to tissue injury has, so far, remained unclear. Here, we describe NUAK family kinase 1 (NUAK1) as a TGF-beta-inducible profibrotic kinase that is up-regulated in multiple fibrotic organs in mice and humans. Mechanistically, we show that TGF-beta induces a rapid increase in NUAK1 in fibroblasts. NUAK1, in turn, can promote profibrotic YAP and TGF-beta/SMAD signaling, ultimately leading to organ scarring. Moreover, activated YAP and TAZ can induce further NUAK1 expression, creating a profibrotic positive feedback loop that enables persistent fibrosis. Using mouse models of kidney, lung, and liver fibrosis, we demonstrate that this fibrogenic signaling loop can be interrupted via fibroblast-specific loss of NUAK1 expression, leading to marked attenuation of fibrosis. Pharmacologic NUAK1 inhibition also reduced scarring, either when initiated immediately after injury or when initiated after fibrosis was already established. Together, our data suggest that NUAK1 plays a critical, previously unrecognized role in fibrogenesis and represents an attractive target for strategies that aim to slow fibrotic disease progression.

AB  - Insulin in the brain is a well-known critical factor in neuro-development and regulation of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. The abnormality of brain insulin signaling is associated with the aging process and altered brain plasticity, and could promote neurodegeneration in the late stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The precise molecular mechanism of the relationship between insulin resistance and AD remains unclear. The development of phosphoproteomics has advanced our knowledge of phosphorylation-mediated signaling networks and could elucidate the molecular mechanisms of certain pathological conditions. Here, we applied a reliable phosphoproteomic approach to Neuro2a (N2a) cells to identify their molecular features under two different insulin-resistant conditions with clinical relevance: inflammation and dyslipidemia. Despite significant difference in overall phosphoproteome profiles, we found molecular signatures and biological pathways in common between two insulin-resistant conditions. These include the integrin and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathways, and we further verified these molecular targets by subsequent biochemical analysis. Among them, the phosphorylation levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and Src were reduced in the brain from rodent AD model 5xFAD mice. This study provides new molecular signatures for insulin resistance in N2a cells and possible links between the molecular features of insulin resistance and AD.

AB  - During the antiretroviral era, individuals living with HIV continue to experience milder forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Viral proteins, including Tat, play a pivotal role in the observed alterations within the central nervous system (CNS), with mitochondrial dysfunction emerging as a prominent hallmark. As a result, our objective was to examine the expression of genes associated with mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain exposed to the HIV-1 Tat protein. We achieved this by performing bilateral stereotaxic injections of 100 ng of HIV-1 Tat into the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats, followed by immunoneuromagnetic cell isolation. Subsequently, we assessed the gene expression of Ppargc1a, Pink1, and Sirt1-3 in neurons using RT-qPCR. Additionally, to understand the role of Tert in telomeric dysfunction, we quantified the activity and expression of Tert. Our results revealed that only Ppargc1a, Pink1, and mitochondrial Sirt3 were downregulated in response to the presence of HIV-1 Tat in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, we observed a reduction in the activity of Tert in the experimental group, while mRNA levels remained relatively stable. These findings support the compelling evidence of dysregulation in both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons exposed to HIV-1 Tat, which in turn induces telomeric dysfunction.

AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are inhibited by many amidine and guanidine compounds. In this work, we studied the mechanisms of their inhibition by sepimostat-an amidine-containing serine protease inhibitor with neuroprotective properties. Sepimostat inhibited native NMDA receptors in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons with IC50 of 3.5 +/- 0.3 mu M at -80 mV holding voltage. It demonstrated complex voltage dependence with voltage-independent and voltage-dependent components, suggesting the presence of shallow and deep binding sites. At -80 mV holding voltage, the voltage-dependent component dominates, and we observed pronounced tail currents and overshoots evidencing a "foot-in-the-door" open channel block. At depolarized voltages, the voltage-independent inhibition by sepimostat was significantly attenuated by the increase of agonist concentration. However, the voltage-independent inhibition was non-competitive. We further compared the mechanisms of the action of sepimostat with those of structurally-related amidine and guanidine compounds-nafamostat, gabexate, furamidine, pentamidine, diminazene, and DAPI-investigated previously. The action of all these compounds can be described by the two-component mechanism. All compounds demonstrated similar affinity to the shallow site, which is responsible for the voltage-independent inhibition, with binding constants in the range of 3-30 mu M. In contrast, affinities to the deep site differed dramatically, with nafamostat, furamidine, and pentamidine being much more active.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of paranasal sinuses. This study is formulated to explore the roles of pro-inflammatory factors Chemerin and interleukin-17 (IL-17) in CRS. Patients suffering from CRS without/with nasal polyps (CRSsNP/CRSwNP), along with volunteers, were recruited. CRS rabbit models were constructed by Staphylococcus aureus infection and rabbits were injected with lentiviral vectors of short hairpin RNA-targeting Chemerin (shChemerin), followed by micro-computed tomography (CT) scan. Levels of Chemerin and IL-17 were determined, and histopathological lesions were observed in subjects and CRS rabbits. Correlations between Chemerin/IL-17 level and Lund-Mackay/Lund-Kennedy scores of subjects and the predictive value of Chemerin or IL-17 for CRS were analyzed. In CRS patients and rabbits, inflammatory degrees and the level of Chemerin/IL-17 were increased in pathological tissues or plasma, while Chemerin silencing alleviated CRS symptoms of CRS rabbits. Chemerin and IL-17 were mainly located in the immune cells of pathological tissues and presented the positive correlation with Lund-Mackay/Lund-Kennedy score of CRS patients. Also, they showed high predictive value for CRS. Micro-CT scan uncovered that CRS rabbits had increased bone remodeling, which was alleviated by Chemerin silencing. Collectively, Chemerin and IL-17 are potential predictors and Chemerin silencing alleviates inflammatory response and bone remodeling in chronic rhinosinusitis.

AB  - Cold stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting tea production. The planting of cold-resistant tea cultivars is one of the most effective measures to prevent chilling injury. However, the differences in cold resistance between tea cultivars remain unclear. In the present study, we perform a transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of Camellia sinensis var. "Shuchazao" (cold-tolerant, SCZ) and C. sinensis var. assamica "Yinghong 9" (cold-sensitive, YH9) during cold acclimation and analyze the correlation between gene expression and metabolite biosynthesis. Our results show that there were 51 differentially accumulated metabolites only up-regulated in SCZ in cold-acclimation (CA) and de-acclimation (DA) stages, of which amino acids accounted for 18%. The accumulation of L-arginine and lysine in SCZ in the CA stage was higher than that in YH9. A comparative transcriptomic analysis showed an enrichment of the amino acid biosynthesis pathway in SCZ in the CA stage, especially "arginine biosynthesis" pathways. In combining transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, it was found that genes and metabolites associated with amino acid biosynthesis were significantly enriched in the CA stage of SCZ compared to CA stage of YH9. Under cold stress, arginine may improve the cold resistance of tea plants by activating the polyamine synthesis pathway and CBF (C-repeat-binding factor)-COR (cold-regulated genes) regulation pathway. Our results show that amino acid biosynthesis may play a positive regulatory role in the cold resistance of tea plants and assist in understanding the cold resistance mechanism differences among tea varieties.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly heterogenic and malignant brain tumour with a median survival of 15 months. The initial identification of primary glioblastomas is often challenging. Coronin 1C (CORO1C) is a key player in actin rearrangement and cofilin dynamics, as well as enhancing the processes of neurite overgrowth and migration of brain tumour cells. Different bioinformatic databases were accessed to measure CORO1C expression at the mRNA and protein level in normal and malignant brains. CORO1C expression was observed in brain regions which have retained high synaptic plasticity and myelination properties. CORO1C was also expressed mainly within the hippocampus formation, including the Cornu Ammonis (CA) fields: CA1-CA4. Higher expression was also noticed in paediatric GBM in comparison to their adult counterparts. Pediatric cell populations were observed to have an increased log2 expression of CORO1C. Furthermore, 62 miRNAs were found to target the CORO1C gene. Of these, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-512-3p, hsa-miR-136-5p, hsa-miR-206, hsa-miR-128-3p, and hsa-miR-21-5p have shown to act as tumour suppressors or oncomiRs in different neoplasms, including GBM. The elevated expression of CORO1C in high grade metastatic brain malignancies, including GBM, suggests that this protein could have a clinical utility as a biomarker linked to an unfavorable outcome.

AB  - Elephant foot yams (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Denst.) Nicolson) are an important part of the diet in many parts of Asia. This study aims to analyse the physiochemical, phytochemicals, and In vitro antioxidant properties of different alcoholic and aqueous extracts. HPTLC and HPCL profile of ethanolic extract tubers of A. paeoniifolius was also investigated. Important secondary metabolites were detected through physicochemical analysis and phytochemical screening. In a laboratory, the antioxidant activity of A. paeoniifolius extracts was evaluated using standard free radical scavenging assays. HPLC testing showed that Gallic acid, Quercetin, and Rutin could be used to standardise A. paeoniifolius. The study's results showed that it would give information that could be used to identify and verify this medicinal plant correctly and may help prevent its adulteration. The extracts of A. paeoniifolius have the potential to be a powerful antioxidant that can get rid of free radicals. The parameters for characterising A. paeoniifolius described in this paper could be used as a quality control standard for this plant.

AB  - Cocaine is a widely used psychostimulant drug whose repeated exposure induces persistent cognitive/emotional dysregulation, which could be a predictor of relapse in users. However, there is scarce evidence on effective treatments to alleviate these symptoms. Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to be associated with improved synaptic function and cellular plasticity changes related to adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), resulting in cognitive enhancement. Therefore, EE could mitigate the negative impact of chronic administration of cocaine in mice and reduce the emotional and cognitive symptoms present during cocaine abstinence. In this study, mice were chronically administered with cocaine for 14 days, and control mice received saline. After the last cocaine or saline dose, mice were submitted to control or EE housing conditions, and they stayed undisturbed for 28 days. Subsequently, mice were evaluated with a battery of behavioural tests for exploratory activity, emotional behaviour, and cognitive performance. EE attenuated hyperlocomotion, induced anxiolytic-like behaviour and alleviated cognitive impairment in spatial memory in the cocaine-abstinent mice. The EE protocol notably upregulated AHN in both control and cocaine-treated mice, though cocaine slightly reduced the number of immature neurons. Altogether, these results demonstrate that EE could enhance hippocampal neuroplasticity ameliorating the behavioural and cognitive consequences of repeated administration of cocaine. Therefore, environmental stimulation may be a useful strategy in the treatment cocaine addiction.

AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that modulate innate immune responses and play essential roles in the pathogenesis of heart diseases. Although important, the molecular mechanisms controlling cardiac TLR genes expression have not been clearly addressed. This study examined the expression pattern of Tlr1, Tlr2, Tlr3, Tlr4, Tlr5, Tlr6, Tlr7, Tlr8, and Tlr9 in normal and disease-stressed mouse hearts. Our results demonstrated that the expression levels of cardiac Tlr3, Tlr7, Tlr8, and Tlr9 increased with age between neonatal and adult developmental stages, whereas the expression of Tlr5 decreased with age. Furthermore, pathological stress increased the expression levels of Tlr2, Tlr4, Tlr5, Tlr7, Tlr8, and Tlr9. Hippo-YAP signaling is essential for heart development and homeostasis maintenance, and YAP/TEAD1 complex is the terminal effector of this pathway. Here we found that TEAD1 directly bound genomic regions adjacent to Tlr1, Tlr2, Tlr3, Tlr4, Tlr5, Tlr6, Tlr7, and Tlr9. In vitro, luciferase reporter data suggest that YAP/TEAD1 repression of Tlr4 depends on a conserved TEAD1 binding motif near Tlr4 transcription start site. In vivo, cardiomyocyte-specific YAP depletion increased the expression of most examined TLR genes, activated the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and predisposed the heart to lipopolysaccharide stress. In conclusion, our data indicate that the expression of cardiac TLR genes is associated with age and activated by pathological stress and suggest that YAP/TEAD1 complex is a default repressor of cardiac TLR genes.

AB  - Essential for brain formation and protective against tauopathy, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is critical for neurogenesis and cognitive functions, while regulating steroid hormone biogenesis. As such, de novo mutations in ADNP lead to syndromic autism and somatic ADNP mutations parallel Alzheimer's disease progression. Furthermore, clinical trials with the ADNP fragment NAP (the investigational drug davunetide) showed efficacy in women suffering from the tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy and differentially boosted memory in men (spatial) and women (verbal), exhibiting prodromal Alzheimer's disease. While autism is more prevalent in boys and Alzheimer's disease in women, both involve impaired neurogenesis. Here, we asked whether ADNP sex-dependently regulates neurogenesis. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker of neurogenesis, we identified two-fold higher labeling in the hippocampal sub-ventricular zone of ADNP-intact male versus female mice. Adnp haplo-insufficient (Adnp+/-) mice or mice CRSIPR/Cas9-edited to present the most prevalent neurodevelopmental ADNP syndrome mutation, p.Tyr718* (Tyr) showed dramatic reductions in male BrdU incorporation, resulting in mutated females presenting higher labeling than males. Treatment with NAP compensated for the male reduction of BrdU labeling. Mechanistically, hippocampal RNAseq revealed male-specific Tyr down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response genes critical for sex-dependent organogenesis. Newly discovered mitochondrial accessibility of ADNP was inhibited by the Tyr718* mutation further revealing female-specific Tyr downregulation of mitochondrial ATP6. NAP moderated much of the differential expression caused by p.Tyr718*, accompanied by the down-regulation of neurotoxic, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes. Thus, ADNP is a key regulator of sex-dependent neurogenesis that acts by controlling canonical pathways, with NAP compensating for fundamental ADNP deficiencies, striding toward clinical development targeting the ADNP syndrome and related neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Hippotiscus dorsalis (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is a common pest that feeds on the stems of Moso bamboo. Therefore, investigating the molecular processes related to its fundamental physiology is important. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was employed to compare gene expression in different tissues of male and female adults. A total of 36,238 annotated unigenes were identified through the NR database and compared with those of other known species. Among these, Halyomorpha halys and Nezara viridula showed the highest homology with H. dorsalis, with a total similarity exceeding 86 %. The top significant differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with protein digestion, carbohydrates metabolism, as well as reproduce regulation between sexes. The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis across three different segments of each sex revealed some terms associated with detoxification such like IMP biosynthetic process and acetyl-CoA metabolic process. Additionally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis highlighted significant pathways related to glucose metabolism and pancreatic secretion. Further investigation of these DEGs, particularly in the calcium signaling pathway and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, is essential for understanding sugar metabolism and transport in phytophagous insects.

AB  - A breakthrough in cosmeceuticals by utilizing insects as major ingredients in cosmetic products is gaining popularity. Therefore, the interest in rare sources of ingredients, for instance, from the Oryctes rhinoceros beetle, can bring huge benefits in terms of turning pests into wealth. In this study, curcumin was chosen as the active ingredient loaded into chitosan-gold nanoparticles (CCG-NP). Curcumin is unstable and has poor absorption, a high rate of metabolism, and high sensitivity to light. These are all factors that contribute to the low bioavailability of any substance to reach the target cells. Therefore, chitosan extracted from O. rhinoceros could be used as a drug carrier to overcome these limitations. In order to overcome these limitations, CCG-NPs were synthesized and characterized. Chitosan was isolated from O. rhinoceros and CCG-NPs were successfully synthesized at 70 degrees C for 60 min under optimal conditions of a reactant ratio of 2:0.5 (0.5 mM HAuCl4: 0.1% curcumin). Characterizations of CCG-NP involved FTIR analysis, zeta potential, morphological properties determination by FE-SEM, particle size analysis, crystallinity study by XRD, and elemental analysis by EDX. The shape of the CCG-NP was round, its size was 128.27 d.nm, and the value of the zeta potential was 20.2 +/- 3.81 mV. The IC50 value for cell viability is 58%, indicating a mild toxicity trait. To conclude, CCG-NP is a stable, spherical, nano-sized, non-toxic, and homogeneous solution.

AB  - Schwann cells (SCs) are a highly plastic cell type capable of undergoing phenotypic changes following injury or disease. SCs are able to upregulate genes associated with nerve regeneration and ultimately achieve functional recovery. During the regeneration process, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell morphology play a cooperative, critical role in regulating SCs, and therefore highly impact nerve regeneration outcomes. However, the roles of the ECM and mechanotransduction relating to SC phenotype are largely unknown. Here, we describe the role that matrix stiffness and cell morphology play in SC phenotype specification via known mechanotransducers YAP/TAZ and RhoA. Using engineered microenvironments to precisely control ECM stiffness, cell shape, and cell spreading, we show that ECM stiffness and SC spreading downregulated SC regenerative associated proteins by the activation of RhoA and YAP/TAZ. Additionally, cell elongation promoted a distinct SC regenerative capacity by the upregulation of Rac1/MKK7/JNK, both necessary for the ECM and morphology changes found during nerve regeneration. These results confirm the role of ECM signaling in peripheral nerve regeneration as well as provide insight to the design of future biomaterials and cellular therapies for peripheral nerve regeneration.

AB  - The delayed behavioral response to chronic antidepressants depends on dynamic changes in the hippocampus. It was suggested that the antidepressant protein p11 and the chromatin remodeling factor SMARCA3 mediate this delayed response by inducing transcriptional changes in hippocampal neurons. However, what target genes are regulated by the p11/SMARCA3 complex to mediate the behavioral response to antidepressants, and what cell type mediates these molecular changes remain unknown. Here we report that the p11/SMARCA3 complex represses Neurensin-2 transcription in hippocampal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons after chronic treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). The behavioral response to antidepressants requires upregulation of p11, accumulation of SMARCA3 in the cell nucleus, and a consequent repression of Neurensin-2 transcription in these interneurons. We elucidate a functional role for p11/SMARCA3/Neurensin-2 pathway in regulating AMPA-receptor signaling in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, a function that is enhanced by chronic treatment with SSRIs. These results link SSRIs to dynamic glutamatergic changes and implicate p11/SMARCA3/Neurensin-2 pathway in the development of more specific and efficient therapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Kidney diseases characterized by glomerular epithelial cell proliferation are rare but often devastating, frequently leading to progressive scarring and renal failure. Ranging from autoimmune-induced crescentic glomerulonephritis to HIV infection-induced collapsing glomerulopathy, these diseases are triggered by a wide variety of insults and have generally been thought of as different entities. Here, using immunostaining and spatial transcriptomics, we profiled human kidney biopsies collected from patients with two of these diseases, collapsing glomerulopathy and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis-induced crescentic glomerulonephritis, to identify common disease-causing molecules. Although triggered by different insults, we identified abnormal hyperactivation of the transcription cofactors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in podocytes as a potential common driver of these diseases. To test this hypothesis, we genetically activated podocyte YAP and TAZ in cultured human cells and in mice by deleting the YAP and TAZ inhibitory large tumor suppressor kinases (LATSs). LATS deficiency in mouse podocytes induced a phenotypic transition in vitro, characterized by a highly distorted structure and an increase in matrix gene expression, mimicking many features of the podocytopathy seen in diseases characterized by glomerular epithelial proliferation. In mice, LATS-deficient podocytes orchestrated a profibrotic and pro-proliferative response in surrounding glomerular cells, a characteristic phenomenon of glomerular epithelial proliferative diseases. This response was attenuated when we also deleted podocyte YAP or TAZ in these mice. Together, our findings point to podocyte YAP-TAZ hyperactivation as a previously unrecognized and unifying driver of glomerular epithelial proliferative diseases.

AB  - The rapid and accurate detection of viral infections is of paramount importance, given their widespread impact across diverse demographics. Common viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and adenovirus contribute significantly to respiratory illnesses. The pathogenic nature of certain viruses, characterized by rapid mutations and high transmissibility, underscores the urgent need for dynamic detection methodologies. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) remains the gold-standard diagnostic tool. Its reliance on costly equipment, reagents, and skilled personnel has driven explorations of alternative approaches, such as catalytic DNA nanomachines. Diagnostic platforms using catalytic DNA nanomachines offer amplification-free nucleic acid detection without the need for protein enzymes and demonstrate feasibility and cost-effectiveness for both laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics. This study focuses on the development of multicomponent DNA nanomachines with catalytic proficiency towards a fluorescent substrate, enabling the generation of a fluorescent signal upon the presence of target nucleic acids. Specifically tailored variants are designed for detecting human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

AB  - The Hippo pathway plays crucial roles in governing various biological processes during tumorigenesis and metastasis. Within this pathway, upstream signaling stimuli activate a core kinase cascade, involving MST1/2 and LATS1/2, that subsequently phosphorylates and inhibits the transcriptional co-activators YAP and its paralog TAZ. This inhibition modulates the transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes, impacting cell proliferation, migration, and death. Despite the acknowledged significance of protein kinases in the Hippo pathway, the regulatory influence of protein phosphatases remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conducted the first gain-of-functional screen for protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) regulating the Hippo pathway. Utilizing a LATS kinase biosensor (LATS-BS), a YAP/TAZ activity reporter (STBS-Luc), and a comprehensive PTP library, we identified numerous novel PTPs that play regulatory roles in the Hippo pathway. Subsequent experiments validated PTPN12, a master regulator of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), as a previously unrecognized negative regulator of the Hippo pathway effectors, oncogenic YAP/TAZ, influencing breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. In summary, our findings offer valuable insights into the roles of PTPs in the Hippo signaling pathway, significantly contributing to our understanding of breast cancer biology and potential therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides L. polysaccharide was optimized with flash extraction by response surface design. The optimum process conditions were: rotation rate 5000 r/min, extraction time 15 s, extraction temperature 90 degrees C and liquid-to-material ratio 38 mL/g, the extraction yield was 15.28 +/- 0.02 %. HRP-1 and HRP-2 obtained by 40 % and 60 % graded alcohol precipitation were characterized. The results indicated that HRP-1 and HRP-2 both composed of mannose, ribose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose, arabinose with different molar ratio and the molecular weights were 380.59 kDa and 288.24 kDa, respectively. In addition, the in vitro antioxidant and immunoenhancement activities of HRP-1 and HRP-2 were analyzed, and the two fractions showed good free radical scavenging activity against (OH)-O-center dot, ABTS(center dot+), DPPH center dot, and extremely strong immunomodulatory activity against RAW264.7 cells. Indicating that flash extraction is suitable for extraction of HRP, the structural study of HRP provides a scientific theoretical basis for the development of Hippophae rhamnoides.

AB  - Fluoride can cause developmental neurotoxicity; however, the precise mechanism has yet to be determined. We aimed to explore the possible role and mechanism of fluoride-induced developmental neurotoxicity, specifically the significance of the lysosomal stress response. As an in vivo model, Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to sodium fluoride (NaF) from embryo to 2 months of age. We found that NaF caused autophagic flux blockage and apoptosis in the rat hippocampus. These results were validated in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells in vitro. In addition, in SH-SY5Y cells, NaF hindered autophagosome-lysosome fusion, decreased lysosomal degradation, and elevated lysosomal pH, which is the most prominent hallmark of a lysosomal stress response. Interestingly, rapamycin promoted autophagosome-lysosome fusion, effectively restoring autophagic flux and reducing apoptosis. Notably, bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal lumen alkalizer, unsurprisingly exacerbated the NaF-induced increase in lysosomal pH and decreased lysosomal degradability, as well as enhanced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that NaF exposure initiates excessive lysosomal stress response, resulting in elevated lysosomal pH, decreased lysosomal degradation, and blocked autophagic flux, which leads to neuronal apoptosis. Thus, the lysosomal stress response may be a promising target for the prevention and treatment of fluoride-induced developmental neurotoxicity.

AB  - Acute stress triggers plasticity of forebrain synapses as well as behavioral changes. Here we reveal that Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF) is a required downstream mediator of the stress response in mice, necessary for stress-induced synaptic potentiation in the ventral hippocampus and for an increase in anxiety-like behaviour. Acute stress is sufficient to activate microglia, triggering the long-term release of TNF. Critically, on-going TNF signaling specifically in the ventral hippocampus is necessary to sustain both the stress-induced synaptic and behavioral changes, as these could be reversed hours after induction by antagonizing TNF signaling. This demonstrates that TNF maintains the synaptic and behavioral stress response in vivo, making TNF a potential novel therapeutic target for stress disorders.

AB  - The ubiquitin-editing enzyme TNF alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) emerges protective roles in neurological disorder, such as cerebral trauma. However, the molecular mechanisms of TNFAIP3 in epilepsy are not very clear. Hereon, the epileptic mouse models and BV2 microglial cellular models were established by kainic acid (KA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) respectively. We found that TNFAIP3 was highly expressed in the hippocampus of epileptic mice. Besides, TNFAIP3 overexpression relieved the spatial learning and memory, reduced the hot plate latency, as well as inhibited neuronal apoptosis in KA-treated mice. In vivo and in vitro experiments indicated that inflammation, a key characteristic of epilepsy, was inhibited by TNFAIP3 upregulation, as evidenced by the downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta and inducible NO synthase (iNOS), along with the decreased levels of NLRP3 inflammasome, which could activate inflammation. Collectively, we infer that TNFAIP3 relieves neuronal injury in epilepsy by suppressing inflammation.

AB  - To identify novel risk genes and better understand the molecular pathway underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD), whole-exome sequencing was performed in 215 early-onset AD (EOAD) patients and 255 unrelated healthy controls of Han Chinese ethnicity. Subsequent validation, computational annotation and in vitro functional studies were performed to evaluate the role of candidate variants in EOAD. We identified two rare missense variants in the phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A) gene in individuals with EOAD. Both variants are located in evolutionarily highly conserved amino acids, are predicted to alter the protein conformation and are classified as pathogenic. Furthermore, we found significantly decreased protein levels of PDE11A in brain samples of AD patients. Expression of PDE11A variants and knockdown experiments with specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for PDE11A both resulted in an increase of AD-associated Tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple epitopes in vitro. PDE11A variants or PDE11A shRNA also caused increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, protein kinase A (PKA) activation and cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation. In addition, pretreatment with a PKA inhibitor (H89) suppressed PDE11A variant-induced Tau phosphorylation formation. This study offers insight into the involvement of Tau phosphorylation via the cAMP/PKA pathway in EOAD pathogenesis and provides a potential new target for intervention.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by cycles of decreased blood oxygen saturation followed by reoxygenation due to transient apnea. Cognitive dysfunction is a complication of OSAS, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (IH) to model OSAS, and cognitive function and hippocampal gene expression were analyzed. Three groups were maintained for 28 days: an IH group (oxygen alternating between 10 and 21% in 2 min cycles, 8 h/day), sustained hypoxia group (SH) (10% oxygen, 8 h/day), and control group (21% oxygen). Behavioral tests and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis were performed. While Y-maze test results showed no differences, the IH group demonstrated impaired memory and learning in passive avoidance tests compared to control and SH groups. RNA-seq revealed coordinated suppression of mitochondrial function genes and oxidative stress response pathways, specifically in the IH group. RT-qPCR showed decreased Lars2, Hmcn1, and Vstm2l expression in the IH group. Pathway analysis showed the suppression of the KEAP1-NFE2L2 antioxidant pathway in the IH group vs. the SH group. Our findings demonstrate that IH induces cognitive dysfunction through suppression of the KEAP1-NFE2L2 antioxidant pathway and downregulation of mitochondrial genes (Lars2, Vstm2l), leading to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular basis underlying OSAS-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - The C. luuana Orel & Curry (TD3), C. furfuracea (Merr.) Cohen-Stuard (TD4), C. bidoupensis Truong, Luong & Tran (TD6), C. sinensis (L.) Kuntze (TD7), and C. kissii var. spp (TD8), have been traditionally used as a health-promoting beverage by local people in Ta Dung, Dak Nong. Despite their potential health benefits, further scientific data on biological and phytochemical properties of these plants is needed. To address this issue, this study was conducted to investigate phytochemical and biological properties of five Camellia species extracts, using DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging, copper chelating (Cu-chelator), and tyrosinase inhibition (TI), alpha-amylase (Al-AI), and alpha-glucosidase (Al-GI) analyses. As results, ten compounds were identified using UPLC method, in which catechins (mainly EGCG and catechin (Cat)), were the most prevalent, and followed by chlorogenic acid (ChlA), quercitrin (Querci), rutin, and quercetin (Querce). Additionally, multiple factor analysis (MFA) also revealed that TD7, TD3, and TD4 containing high TPC, TFC, high concentrations of EGCG, ChlA, and caffeine were responsible for their high DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging activities, as well asTI, Al-AI and Al-GI. Furthemore, TD6 and TD8, possessing elevated levels of Apig, Querci, Rutin, Querce, Cat, and EA, exhibited a high Cu-chelator property, but a weak enzyme inhibition. From all above-mentioned results, the antioxidative and enzyme inhibitory potentials of Camellia species extracts collected in Dak Nong province in Vietnam were scientifically demonstrated paving a pathway to develop health supplement in further studies.

AB  - Epilepsy is characterized by hypersynchronous neuronal discharges, which are associated with an increased cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen and ATP demand. Uncontrolled seizure activity (status epilepticus) results in mitochondrial exhaustion and ATP depletion, which potentially generate energy mismatch and neuronal loss. Many cells can adapt to increased energy demand by increasing metabolic capacities. However, acute metabolic adaptation during epileptic activity and its relationship to chronic epilepsy remains poorly understood. We elicited seizure-like events (SLEs) in an in vitro model of status epilepticus for eight hours. Electrophysiological recording and tissue oxygen partial pressure recordings were performed. After eight hours of ongoing SLEs, we used proteomics-based kinetic modeling to evaluate changes in metabolic capacities. We compared our findings regarding acute metabolic adaptation to published proteomic and transcriptomic data from chronic epilepsy patients. Epileptic tissue acutely responded to uninterrupted SLEs by upregulating ATP production capacity. This was achieved by a coordinated increase in the abundance of proteins from the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation system. In contrast, chronic epileptic tissue shows a 25-40% decrease in ATP production capacity. In summary, our study reveals that epilepsy leads to dynamic metabolic changes. Acute epileptic activity boosts ATP production, while chronic epilepsy reduces it significantly.
