AB  - Along its route through the agro-food system nitrogen (N) can be wasted, heightening diverse environmental problems. Geopolitical instabilities affect prices of N fertilisers and livestock feed, challenging production systems and increasing their need to reduce N waste. The analysis of N flows is essential to understanding the agroenvironmental performance of agro-food systems to detect leakages and to design strategies for reducing N pollution while producing feed and food. Sectorial analyses can mislead conclusions, prompting the need for integrated approaches. We present a multiscale analysis of N flows for the 1990-2015 period to identify both the strengths and weaknesses of the Spanish agro-food system. We constructed N budgets at three system scales, namely crop, livestock and the agro-food system, and at two spatial scales: national and regional (50 provinces). The big picture shows a country with increasing crop (575 to 634 GgN/yr) and livestock (138 to 202 GgN/yr, edible) production and nitrogen use efficiency improvements, especially for certain crop and livestock categories. Nevertheless, this falls short of reducing agricultural surpluses (812 GgN/yr) and external dependency, which is closely related to the externalisation of certain environmental impacts (system NUE, from 31 % to 19 % considering externalisation). The regional picture shows the contrasted operation between provinces, assigned to three agro-food system categories: fuelled by synthetic fertiliser (29 provinces), grassland inputs to livestock (5 provinces) or the net import of feed (16 provinces). Regional specialisation on crop or livestock production was reinforced, hampering good recirculation of N through livestock feed from regional cropland and their N fertilisation by regional livestock excretion. We conclude that pollution and external dependency need to be further reduced in Spain. To do so, the big picture of the full system is paramount but must be adapted to the regional particularities.

AB  - Background: Every year, over 40 million people sustain mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) which affects the glucocorticoid stress pathway and synaptic plasticity. Ketamine, a multimodal dissociative anesthetic, modulates the stress pathway and synaptic plasticity. However, the effects of post-mTBI ketamine administration on plasma stress hormones and brain synaptic plasticity are largely unknown. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with indwelling jugular venous catheters sustained mTBI with the Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) in a single session (3 impacts x 1.5 J). One hour later, rats received intravenous (IV) ketamine (0, 10, or 20 mg/kg, 2 h). Catheter blood samples were collected for plasma corticosterone and progesterone assays. Brain tissue sections were double-labeled for presynaptic synapsin-1 and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). Utilizing the Synaptic Evaluation and Quantification by Imaging Nanostructure (SEQUIN) workflow, super-resolution confocal images were generated, and synapsin-1, PSD-95, and synaptic density were quantified in the CA1 of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Results: IV ketamine infusion produced biphasic effects on corticosterone levels: a robust elevation during the infusion followed by a reduction after the infusion. CHIMERA injury elevated progesterone levels at post-injury day (PID)-1 and reduced synaptic density in the CA1 at PID-4, regardless of ketamine infusion. Ketamine infusion increased synaptic density in the mPFC at PID-4. Conclusions: Mild TBI and IV ketamine modulate the stress pathway and synaptic plasticity in the brain. Further research is warranted to investigate the functional outcomes of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on stress pathways and neuroplasticity following mTBI.

AB  - Feeding high starch diet is a common practice to increase milk production and similarly feeding sugars helps in improving milk fats. However, the extent to which trade-off between dietary starch and sugar content is possible for optimal milk production and fats is not fully explored in lactating Nili Ravi buffaloes. Twelve multiparous early-lactating NiliRavi buffaloes (52 +/- 37 d in milk, mean +/- SD) received 3 treatments in a 3 x 3 Latin square design and each period consisted of 28 d. The dietary treatments contained starch and sugars in the following manner: 1) 28.7% starch, 2.61% sugar; 2) 25.9 % starch, 4.29% sugar; 3) 22.9% starch, 5.73% sugar on DM basis. All dietary treatments were iso-nitrogenous. Replacing dietary starch with sugar increased milk fat content, milk fat yield and 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM) linearly by 7.29, 13.8 and 11.9% respectively, however, milk yield was not affected by treatments. Similarly, energy-corrected milk (ECM) was also increased by 10.3% by the replacement of dietary starch with sugar. Body weight increased by 2% linearly, whereas, the body condition score remained unaffected as sugar replaced starch. There was a linear increase in plasma cholesterol concentrations, whereas plasma urea nitrogen, glucose, and triglyceride concentrations remained unaffected by increasing sugar. The marginal efficiency of NEL consumed for milk yield, 4% FCM and ECM increased linearly with increasing sugar. Feeding diets containing 22.9% starch and 5.37% sugar increased milk fat content, fat yield, and body weight of NiliRavi buffalo without impacting on milk production and blood metabolites. Using sugar as a substitute for starch could be a practical option for producers without negatively impacting production.

AB  - Gall-inducing insects are highly specialized herbivores as they have the ability to control and redirect the development of host plants to obtain food and shelter. The distribution of galls on plants can be influenced by seasonality and phenological events, which determines the reproductive success of these insects. The species Manihot caerulescens Pohl (Euphorbiaceae) has a great diversity of gall-inducing insects in the Cerrado of Western Bahia. Our study aimed to (1) study the fauna associated with M. caerulescens Pohl (Euphorbiaceae) and (2) evaluate the phenological events of this host plant species. We performed gall collections between July 2018 and June 2020 and monitored 30 individuals of the host species to study the phenology in the Serra da Bandeira, Bahia, Brazil. The emerged insects in the laboratory were mounted on permanent slides and identified. We found galls on the stems, leaves and inflorescences. Stem galls were induced by lepidopterans (Alucitidae), and leaf and inflorescence galls by Iatrophobia brasiliensis Rubsaamen, 1915 (Cecidomyiidae). Further, we showed that I. brasiliensis preferentially induced galls on the leaves, however during the dry season, galls were induced on the inflorescences. Although the induction of galls on the leaves by I. brasiliensis has already been reported in the literature, here for the first time we record the presence of galls on the inflorescences induced by the same gall-inducing species. Our study constitutes an important contribution towards the knowledge of the insect-plant interaction between M. caerulescens and I. brasiliensis in the Cerrado of Bahia.

AB  - Simple Summary The 22nd chromatography component (F22) of the Fasciola gigantica excretory-secretory products (FgESP) shows better diagnostic value than the FgESP, but its immunomodulatory function and potential as a molecular vaccine candidate are unknown. Thus, the effect of F22 on the mitogen-induced proliferation of buffalo peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the innate immune response was preliminarily studied, and its components were also explored. The results indicated that F22 significantly decreased the proliferation of PBMCs stimulated with mitogen. Two hundred and sixteen were identified as components of the F22, and these included eighty-six proteins present in more than one pathway and some with robust immunomodulatory ability. Further studies should be performed to investigate the immunomodulatory function of F22 in the adaptive immune response, and the components of F22 can be further studied as potential vaccine candidate molecules. The 22nd chromatography component (F22) of the Fasciola gigantica excretory-secretory products (FgESP) shows better diagnostic value than the FgESP, and diagnostic methods based on F22 have also been established. Thus, exploring its immunomodulatory function and potential as a molecular vaccine candidate is attractive. In the present study, the effect of F22 on the mitogen-induced proliferation of buffalo peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the innate immune response was preliminarily studied using the FgESP as a control. PBMCs were incubated with concanavalin A (ConA) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at optimal (1 mu g/well) or suboptimal (0.25 mu g/well) doses coupled with FgESP and F22 at different doses (1-16 mu g/well). Cell proliferation was then assessed by microenzyme reaction colorimetry (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay). In addition, the components of F22 were also explored by mass spectrometry and then subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to infer their functions. The results indicated that FgESP decreased the proliferation of PBMCs stimulated with ConA and PHA at specific doses, whereas F22 significantly decreased the proliferation of PBMCs stimulated with ConA and PHA at both optimal and suboptimal doses (p < 0.05). Two hundred and sixteen proteins were identified in F22, and these included 86 proteins that could be assigned to more than one pathway and some with robust immunomodulatory ability. Further studies should be performed to investigate the immunomodulatory function of F22 in the adaptive immune response, and the components of F22 can be further studied as potential vaccine candidate molecules.

AB  - Transport-related vibrations (TV) compromise the quality of conventionally stored (17 degrees C) boar semen, but knowledge about TV effects after 5 degrees C transport is insufficient. This study evaluates the effects of TV after novel 5 degrees C transport compared to a 17 degrees C control. Ejaculates of 18 fertile Pi & eacute;train boars, diluted in a split sample procedure using Androstar Premium (R) (AP, 5 degrees C storage) or Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS, 17 degrees C storage), were subjected to transport simulation using a laboratory shaker IKA MTS 4. The timing was set according to the respective processing protocols: for 17 degrees C BTS samples, TV simulation was performed the day of collection, 5 degrees C AP samples were subjected to TV the day after collection following completion of the established cooling curve to 5 degrees C. Six samples per ejaculate were exposed to different TV durations (0 h, 3 h, or 6 h) to evaluate the effect on sperm quality (progressive motility (PM), thermo-resistance test (30 and 300 min incubation at 38 degrees C (TRT30/TRT300)), mitochondrial activity (MITO), plasma membrane and acrosome integrity (PMAI)). Generalized linear mixed models revealed TV (P = 0.021) and storage time (P < 0.001) dependent declines in PM. Direct, pairwise comparisons revealed that 5 degrees C samples are not affected by TV (P(3 h vs. 6 h transport) = 1.0; P(0 h vs. 6 h transport) = 1.0). They therefore showed superior quality maintenance after TV compared to 17 degrees C samples (P(3 h vs. 6 h transport) = 0.025; P(0 h vs. 6 h transport) < 0.001). Concluding, low-temperature transport is possible without significant semen quality loss and with better quality maintenance than standard transport.

AB  - The Camellia oil tree (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is an important nonwood forest species in China, and the majority of its cultivars are late-acting self-incompatibility (LSI) types. Although several studies have examined the mechanism of LSI, the process is quite complicated and unclear. In this study, pollen tube growth and fruit setting of two Camellia oil tree cultivars Huashuo (HS) and Huajin (HJ) were investigated after non and self-pollination, and transcriptomic analysis of the ovaries was performed 48 h after self-pollination to identify the potential genes implicated in the LSI of Camellia oil trees. The results showed that the fruit set of HS was significantly higher than that of HJ after self-pollination. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that plant hormone signal transduction, the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, and Ca2+ signaling were mainly contributed in the LSI of reaction of Camellia oil tree. Moreover, nine RNase T2 genes were identified from the transcriptome analysis, which also showed that CoRNase7 participated in the self-incompatibility reaction in HS. Based on phylogenetic analysis, CoRNase6 was closely related to S-RNase from coffee, and CoRNase7 and CoRNase8 were closely related to S-RNase from Camellia sinensis. The 9 RNase T2 genes successfully produced proteins in prokaryotes. Subcellular localization indicated that CoRNase1 and CoRNase5 were cytoplasmic proteins, while CoRNase7 was a plasma membrane protein. These results screened the main metabolic pathways closely related to LSI in Camellia oil tree, and SI signal transduction might be regulated by a large molecular regulatory network. The discovery of T2 RNases provided evidence that Camellia oil tree might be under RNase-based gametophytic self-incompatibility.

AB  - The corn leafhopper Dalbulus maidis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is a serious maize pest widely distributed on the American continent. This is the most common leafhopper feeding on corn crops in Argentina and Brazil, causing major economic losses due to its capability to transmit important pathogens, such as corn stunt spiroplasma, and considerably decreasing crop yield. One way to increase crop yield is to elevate fertilizing doses of nitrogen and phosphorus, although this could translate into an increase in pest populations, since changes in host plant quality makes them more attractive to herbivorous insects, positively influencing their population dynamics. This study aims to assess the oviposition preference and the olfactory response of D. maidis to corn plants subject to three levels of nitrogen fertilization (100 ppm, 200 ppm and 300 ppm). Olfactory response was evaluated in a static-air four-way olfactometer using maize plants with different nitrogen fertilization levels as odor sources. Additionally, plants with different nitrogen fertilization levels were offered to females in a multiple-choice assay to assess their oviposition preference. The olfactory response of D. maidis was influenced by nitrogen fertilization, as females oriented toward plants treated with high fertilization levels. Similarly, oviposition preference assays showed that D. maidis females preferred to lay its egg in plants with high fertilization levels. The results herein reported could contribute to the design of integrated pest management strategies that promote balance between crop fertilization to improve yield and insect vector management.

AB  - During the Miocene Epoch, radiation of merychippine equids may have coincided with a transitional North American habitat of forests with patches of open grassland, and merychippine diet may reflect this diverse environment. Dental calculus on teeth of extinct herbivores like Merychippus can incorporate a long-term dietary record in the form of plant microfossils, such as phytoliths and fibers. In the present study, the purpose was to test dental calculus as a measure of paleodiet in equids by identifying and comparing Merychippus paleodiet constituents among preliminary sample groups. Calculus samples obtained from seven isolated Barstovian age Merychippus teeth from sites in Nebraska, Oregon, and Maryland, USA contained plant microfossils that were identified to categories based upon morphological characteristics. Grass silica short-cell phytoliths of BOP clade, C3-pathway subfamilies were most frequent, comprising 45-57% of all calculus samples. Microfossils from woody taxa were also present in all assemblages (18-29%). Softwood tracheary elements and sedge grass phytoliths (Family Cyperaceae) were significantly more frequent in Merychippus from the Maryland site. The combined presence of hardwood and grass microfossils from each Merychippus specimen indicates a mixed browse/grass diet that included C-3 grasses, supporting recent micro- and mesowear analyses. Some significant differences among these preliminary samples suggest that calculus is a valid means to compare diet among regions. Within a broader context, this type of study can generalize aspects of the Merychippus paleoenvironment and stands as an evaluation for using microfossils from dental calculus as a means for diet determination.

AB  - Mesothelial cells cover the surface of the internal organs and the walls of body cavities, facilitating the movement between organs by secretion of a lubricating fluid. Upon injury, mesothelial cells undergo a mesothelial-mesenchymal transition (MMT) and give rise to myofibroblasts during organ fibrosis, including in the liver. Although transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) was shown to induce MMT, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying MMT remain to be clarified. In the present study, we examined how the extracellular environment, soluble factors, and cell density control the phenotype of liver mesothelial cells by culturing them at different cell densities or on hydrogels of different stiffness. We found that TGF-beta 1 does not fully induce MMT in mesothelial cells cultured at high cell density or in the absence of fetal bovine serum. Extracellular lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) synergistically induced MMT in the presence of TGF-beta 1 in mesothelial cells. LPA induced nuclear localization of WW domain-containing transcription regulator1 (WWTR1/TAZ) and knockdown of Taz, which suppressed LPA-induced MMT. Mesothelial cells cultured on stiff hydrogels upregulated nuclear localization of TAZ and myofibroblastic differentiation. Knockdown of Taz suppressed MMT of mesothelial cells cultured on stiff hydrogels, but inhibition of TGF-beta 1 signaling failed to suppress MMT. Our data indicate that TAZ mediates MMT induced by TGF-beta 1, LPA, and a stiff matrix. The microenvironment of a stiff extracellular matrix is a strong inducer of MMT.

AB  - The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) is one of the most widespread explanations for the success of invasive species. It proposes that introduced plants are released from phytophages and pathogens in their secondary ranges, facilitating their expansion. However, literature reviews show conflicting results, and empirical support for the hypothesis remains limited. In this study, based on the flora of the Central European part of Russia (2550 species), we tested whether native, alien, and invasive species differ in the number of known natural enemies (herbivores and pathogens). The number of natural enemies was assessed at the genus and family levels using the Plant Parasites of Europe database. We found no significant differences in the number of natural enemies between native and alien plant species, nor between alien and invasive ones. Moreover, plants' genera and families that include invasive species were characterized by a higher number of native species, which contradicts ERH expectations and supports the preadaptation hypothesis. The proportion of invasive species within a genus was positively correlated with the total number of species in that genus globally, possibly reflecting the influence of phylogenetic and ecological diversity on invasion likelihood. These results highlight the limited explanatory power of the Enemy Release Hypothesis and emphasize the need to consider multiple additional factors when analyzing the success of alien species.

AB  - Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) has high water-use efficiency (WUE) and is widely recognized to have evolved from C3 photosynthesis. Different plant lineages have convergently evolved CAM, but the molec-ular mechanism that underlies C3-to-CAM evolution remains to be clarified. Platycerium bifurcatum (elk -horn fern) provides an opportunity to study the molecular changes underlying the transition from C3 to CAM photosynthesis because both modes of photosynthesis occur in this species, with sporotrophophyll leaves (SLs) and cover leaves (CLs) performing C3 and weak CAM photosynthesis, respectively. Here, we report that the physiological and biochemical attributes of CAM in weak CAM-performing CLs differed from those in strong CAM species. We investigated the diel dynamics of the metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome in these dimorphic leaves within the same genetic background and under identical environ-mental conditions. We found that multi-omic diel dynamics in P. bifurcatum exhibit both tissue and diel ef-fects. Our analysis revealed temporal rewiring of biochemistry relevant to the energy-producing pathway (TCA cycle), CAM pathway, and stomatal movement in CLs compared with SLs. We also confirmed that PHOSPHOENOLPYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE KINASE (PPCK) exhibits convergence in gene expression among highly divergent CAM lineages. Gene regulatory network analysis identified candidate transcription factors regulating the CAM pathway and stomatal movement. Taken together, our results provide new in-sights into weak CAM photosynthesis and new avenues for CAM bioengineering.

AB  - Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide synthesized in the hypothalamic nuclei that modulates both behavioral and reproductive functions, associated with the increased neurosteroid synthesis in the brain. Therefore, the present study tested the hypothesis that manipulation of central neurosteroid levels could affect oxytocin synthesis and release in non-pregnant and pregnant sheep under both basal and stressful conditions. In Experiment 1, luteal-phase sheep were subjected to a series of intracerebroventricular (icv.) infusions of allopregnanolone (AL, 4 x 15 mu g/60 mu L/30 min) for 3 days. In Experiment 2, pregnant animals (4th month) received a series of infusions of the neurosteroid synthesis blocker, finasteride (4 x 25 mu g/60 mu L/30 min), conducted for 3 days. In non-pregnant sheep AL alone was shown to differentially modulate OT synthesis in basal conditions, and strongly inhibit OT response to stress (p < 0.001). In contrast, in pregnant animals, basal and stress-induced OT secretion was significantly (p < 0.001) increased during finasteride infusion compared to controls. In conclusion, we showed that neurosteroids were involved in the control of OT secretion in sheep, particularly under stress and pregnancy conditions and are part of an adaptive mechanism which is responsible for protecting and maintaining pregnancy in harmful situations.

AB  - Termites are believed to have evolved in a way that optimizes their foraging efficiency, which involves both searching for food and transporting it efficiently. Although the search efficiency has been well-studied through tunnel pattern analysis, transport efficiency has received limited attention due to the challenges of directly observing behavior that is highly influenced by environmental conditions. In this study, we introduce an individual-based model to simulate transport behavior and examine transport efficiency (E) by considering the tunnel surface irregularities and curvature, which are critical environmental factors. The model is characterized by four control variables: tunnel curvature (k(1)), termite stopping time at irregularity sites (k(2)), irregularity distribution (k(3)), and irregularity density (k(4)). The simulation results indicate that as k(1) increases, E decreases, while k(3) has little impact on E. The impact of k(4) on E is decisive; when k(4) <= 6, an increase in k(4) results in increased traffic jam frequency and a faster reduction in E. However, when k(4) > 6, the jamming frequency is not significantly affected, reducing the decrease in E. k(2) strongly contributes to reducing E without significantly affecting the frequency. In the discussion section, we explore potential mechanisms that termites use to maintain transport efficiency in heterogeneous soils, and discuss how to improve the model to better reflect real-termite systems.

AB  - Industrialization has made the world increasingly unstable, subjecting plants to various constraints. As a consequence, plants are constantly experiencing biological, environmental, and climatic constraints, necessitating defense mechanisms to ensure their survival. Plants are vulnerable to various biotic factors, including insects, pathogens (bacterial, fungal, viral, and nematodes), weeds, and herbivores. They also face different abiotic and climate change challenges such as drought (regulated by genes like GH3, DREB, ZIFL1;3, etc), salinity, heavy metals, metalloids, ultraviolet radiations (UV), ozone (O3), low and high temperature (chilling/ cold/freezing/heat), carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and flooding/hypoxia/anoxia. Different transcriptional factors, such as KNOX1, PYK10, and NRP1, regulate these abiotic and climate change stresses. Different phytohormones such as auxin (regulated by components AUX/IAA3, PIN, indole-glucosinolate, indole3-acetaldoxine), gibberellin (key elements involved in the synthesis and signaling such as DELLA, GA3ox, RhHB1), cytokinin (signaling through ARR5), ethylene (involved transcription factors like AP2/ERF), abscisic acid (signaling regulated through SnRK2), salicylic acid, jasmonic acid (regulated by JAZ1/TIFYIOA), brassinosteroids, nitric oxide, and strigolactones (synthetic precursor being GR24) control plants' maturation in normal and stressed conditions by regulating various metabolic and physiological plant activities. Phytohormonal interactions and their synergy are often assessed by different techniques and assays such as CRISPR/ Cas9, ELISA, RIA, luciferase, GAL4, and mEmerald GFP. Their synthesis and signaling are regulated by various genes (such as YUCCA1, YUCCA5, GA3ox, etc), transporters (PIN, such as PIN, ABCB, NPF, etc), and receptors (such as PLY4, PLY5, BZR1/BES1, MYC2, etc) and have different precursors such as L-arginine, L-tryptophan, phenylalanine, linolenic acid, S-adenosylmethionine, geranylgeranyl diphosphate. This review comprehensively analyses the breakthrough in phytohormones and their signaling in regulating plants' growth and maturation. Their significance in combating the biotic, abiotic, and climate change stresses, improving stress adaptation to identify novel strategies enhancing plant resilience, sustainable agriculture, and ensuring food security.

AB  - In the frame of sustainable farming systems to decrease chemical fertilizers use and protect the environment , organic fertilization regimes hold potential as an alternative strategy to supply essential nutrients to crops. A field trial was conducted to sort out the most superior fertilization regime for boosting sunflower production and quality under semi-arid conditions. Treatments included chemical fertilizer (Cf) (80 kg N ha(-1) and 80 kg P205 ha(-1)), manure from sheep barn manure (MSB) (5161 kg ha(-1)), manure from cattle barn (MCB) (4878 kg ha(-1)), liquid manure from cattle barn (LMCB) (27580 kg ha(-1)) and vermicompost (VCm) (4000 kg ha(-1)), while a control treatment was kept for comparison purpose. The randomized complete block design (RCBD) with regular arrangement was implied to execute the experiment having three replications. The results exhibited that MSB outperformed rest of fertilization regimes for plant height and leaf number. In contrast, the maximum 1000 seed weight and seed yield were recorded by LMCB. The MCB remained unmatched for protein content, while no significant effect of fertilization regimes was recorded for oil content. Regarding chemical composition, control exhibited the maximum palmitic and stearic acids, while MSB gave the highest arachidic acid

AB  - Context The adipose tissue produces adipokines - hormones essential to many biological functions, including reproduction.Aims We hypothesised that resistin, one of the adipokines, is present in the blood plasma, uterine luminal flushings (ULF) and uterus of pigs during the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy, and that resistin influences uterine steroidogenesis.Methods This study aimed to determine the expression of resistin in the porcine endometrium and myometrium during the cycle and pregnancy by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot (WB). The adipokine concentrations in blood plasma and ULF were defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The impact of resistin on progesterone (P4) and oestradiol (E2) secretion and steroidogenic enzyme proteins' expression were determined by radioimmunoassay and WB, respectively. The effect of resistin on protein kinase B (Akt) protein phosphorylation was determined by WB.Key results The study's results identified the resistin gene and protein expression in the porcine endometrium and myometrium. Moreover, the expression of adipokine in the uterus, its concentrations in the blood plasma and ULF, and its impact on the endometrial P4 and E2 production, are dependent on the hormonal milieu related to the phase of the cycle and/or period of pregnancy. Furthermore, resistin enhances the phosphorylation of the Akt signaling pathway.Conclusions The current findings suggest that resistin may control the steroidogenesis process in the porcine endometrium and could be an important regulator of pig reproduction.Implications In the long-term perspective, the results obtained in this study may help improve farm animal breeding.

AB  - As a member of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family, PPARG has been reported to be involved in glucolipid metabolism in various species. However, the function of PPARG in estradiol (E2) synthesis, apoptosis, and proliferation in goat ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) is unclear. In this study, we found that goat PPARG was expressed in GCs of all grades of follicles, and localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of GCs. Transfection of small interfering RNA-PPARG2 (si-PPARG2) decreased E2 synthesis and the abundances of HSD3B and CYP19A1 mRNA and protein. It also promoted cell apoptosis with significant increases in the ratio of BAX/BCL-2 and Caspase3 mRNA and protein. Meanwhile, cell cycle was inhibited by si-PPARG2 transfection, accompanied by decreased mRNA levels of CDK4, CKD6, MYC, CCND1, CCND2, PCNA, and CCNB, increased mRNA level of P53, and decreased protein levels of CDK4, MYC, and CCND1. Furthermore, PPARG interference affected the mRNA and protein abundances of CREB as well as the phosphorylation of CREB but not PKA. In conclusion, our data suggest that PPARG plays an important role in regulating E2 synthesis, cell apoptosis, and proliferation of goat GCs, including the CREB expression and phosphorylation. These results provide evidences for the in-depth study of PPARG in the regulation of goat GCs function.

AB  - Camellia sinensis cv. 'Yanling Huayecha' (YHC) is an albino-green chimaeric tea mutant with stable genetic traits. Here, we analysed the cell ultrastructure, photosynthetic pigments, amino acids, and transcriptomes of the albino, mosaic, and green zones of YHC. Well-organized thylakoids were found in chloroplasts in mesophyll cells of the green zone but not the albino zone. The albino zone of the leaves contained almost no photosynthetic pigment. However, the levels of total amino acids and theanine were higher in the albino zone than in the mosaic and green zones. A transcriptomic analysis showed that carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis showed differences among the different zones. Metabolite and transcriptomic analyses revealed that (1) downregulation of CsPPOX1 and damage to thylakoids in the albino zone may block chlorophyll synthesis; (2) downregulation of CsLHCB6, CsFdC2 and CsSCY1 influences chloroplast biogenesis and thylakoid membrane formation, which may contribute to the appearance of variegated tea leaves; and (3) tea plant variegation disrupts the balance between carbon and nitrogen metabolism and promotes the accumulation of amino acids, and upregulation of CsTSI and CsAlaDC may enhance L-theanine synthesis. In summary, our study provides a theoretical basis and valuable insights for elucidating the molecular mechanisms and promoting the economic utilization of variegation in tea.

AB  - Simple Summary People's demand for meat consumption has transformed from quantity to quality. The rearing condition is one of the factors affecting meat quality. However, the effects of different rearing conditions on the production of Chinese indigenous pig breeds are still barely understood. In this study, Heigai pigs (a Chinese indigenous pig breed) were raised in the indoor feeding farm and the grazing farm to investigate the effects of different rearing conditions on carcass traits, meat quality and the compositions of fatty acid and amino acid. Grazing farm pigs tended to increase shear force, while significantly increasing the saturated fatty acid ratio and decreasing the unsaturated fatty acid ratio to alter the composition of fatty acids of longissimus thoracis et lumborum. The present study provides an experimental reference for regulating the production of superior meat quality pork of Chinese local breed pigs. The present study evaluates the influence of captivity and grazing rearing conditions on the carcass traits, meat quality and fatty acid profiles of Heigai pigs. Ten Heigai pigs with market weight were randomly selected from both the indoor feeding farm and outdoor grazing farm groups (FF and GF; five pigs per group) for measuring production performance. The results showed that the shear force of longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) in the GF group tended to increase (p = 0.06), and triglyceride and cholesterol contents in LTL and psoas major muscle (PMM) of the GF group significantly increased and decreased, respectively (p < 0.05). The proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA) was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the GF group. Meanwhile, the ratios of unsaturated fatty acid (UFA), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and the content of flavor amino acid of the LTL in the GF group were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The GF upregulated the expression of MyHC-IIb and lipogenic genes, such as GLUT4 and LPL (p < 0.05), in LTL and PMM, but downregulated the expression of MyHC-I, MyHC-IIa, PPAR gamma and leptin (p < 0.05). In conclusion, these results suggested that the different rearing conditions can alter the meat qualities by mediating the muscle fiber type and lipid metabolism of Heigai pigs.

AB  - Forensic entomology is concerned with the study of arthropods that assist in criminal investigations. Among them, necrophagous beetles (Coleoptera) play a crucial role as they are found in all stages of decomposition of corpses, which makes them valuable for forensic analysis. Accurate species identification is crucial for the effective use of entomological evidence. Efficient, cost-effective, and rapid methods are essential for this purpose. In the present study, we developed a novel assay that enables simple, inexpensive, and rapid identification of necrophagous beetle species. Using two primer sets targeting the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene and analyzing the resulting SYBR Green I melting curves, we were able to identify fourteen beetle species: Aleochara curtula (Goeze, 1777), Anoplotrupes stercorosus (Scriba, 1791), Creophilus maxillosus (Linnaeus, 1758), Dermestes undulatus (Brahm, 1790), Hister unicolor (Linnaeus, 1758), Margarinotus brunneus (Fabricius, 1775), Necrodes littoralis (Linnaeus, 1758), Nicrophorus investigator (Zetterstedt, 1824), Ontholestes murinus (Linnaeus, 1758), Oiceoptoma thoracicum (Linnaeus, 1758), Philonthus cognatus (Stephens, 1832), Saprinus planiusculus (Motschulsky, 1849), Silpha tristis (Illiger, 1798), and Thanatophilus rugosus (Linnaeus, 1758). Data on the melting temperature of the amplicon can be obtained within 60-90 min after DNA extraction. This study expands the understanding of the species composition of necrophagous Coleoptera, which is crucial for forensic entomology methods based on insect succession. Furthermore, it provides the first comprehensive data on necrophagous beetles in the vicinity of Kampinos National Park.

AB  - Pork is one of the proteins of greatest demand worldwide. This study has evaluated the environmental sustainability of pig production by applying the life cycle assessment methodological framework. The system boundaries include feed production, pig production, slaughtering, and slaughterhouse by-product management. Within this context, three scenarios have been proposed: the first related to the management of slaughter by-products in an open dump, the second contemplates a model for using these by-products in a rendering plant, and a third where the environmental burden of slaughterhouse co-products is portioned according to economic allocation. The primary data collected correspond to the period of 2019 for the facilities of a producer in a coastal province of Ecuador. Three functional units were used- "1 kg of pig carcass at the slaughterhouse gate ", "1 kg pig live weigh at the farm gate ", and "1 kg of feed at the plant gate ". The impact categories included were global warming, fossil depletion, marine eutrophication, ozone layer depletion, particulate matter formation, photochemical oxidation formation, and terrestrial acidification. The results revealed that the production of ingredients for feed is the largest contributor to the environmental burden of pig and pork. The rendering of slaughter by-products that avoid the production of other fats and proteins results in a lower environmental impact than the other scenarios in almost all categories.

AB  - Gray wolf (Canis lupus) dietary behavior can be highly variable; prey species for wolves span a range of ungulates to the consumption of smaller animals. While prey species for wolves are well documented, carcass utilization within and between wolf populations is less understood. This paper examines a modern population of wolves from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) with dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) to gauge utilization of bone resources, or durophagy, across biological, physical, social, geographical, and temporal variables. Results indicate gradation in durophagous behavior among GYE wolves does not correlate with sex, intra-population body size (as inferred from skeletal and soft tissue measurements), pack association, or age class. Together, findings suggest that feeding ecologies for wolves are not specific to these factors. We also found that antemortem tooth breakage rates are not positively correlated with dental microwear textures that infer durophagy. We further compare dental microwear measures with previously published data from Alaskan wolves, who were collected decades before the GYE wolf sample. Results imply elevated carcass exploitation in the contemporary GYE wolf population sample. If minimal inter-population differences are assumed, data presented here show dietary behaviors of North American gray wolves have changed over the past fifty years, indicating a possible long-term trend that may be linked to decreased winter severity and climate change.

AB  - Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO2) concentrations can alter the carbon:nitrogen ratio and palatability of host plants for herbivorous insects, but rhizobacteria likely mitigate the alteration and influence physiological adaptation of insects. In this study, we conducted transcriptomic analysis of maize (Zea mays) response to Azotobacter chroococcum (AC) inoculation under eCO2 conditions in contrast to ambient CO2 (aCO2), and studied the effects of plant-defense change of maize under eCO2 on the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata. Results showed that there were 16, 14, 16 and 135 differentially expressed genes that were associated with plant-defense response in maize leaves between aCO2-CK and aCO2-AC, eCO2-CK and eCO2-AC, aCO2-CK and eCO2-CK, aCO2AC and eCO2-AC, respectively. Moreover, A. chroococcum inoculation and eCO2 influenced plant hormone signal transduction of maize. Interestingly, A. chroococcum inoculation significantly decreased the contents of JA (jasmonic acid) and JA-Ile (isoleucine conjugate of JA) in leaves, but eCO2 markedly increased contents of JA-Ile, JA and SA (salicylic acid). Compared to aCO2, eCO2 significantly decreased activity of protective enzyme (catalase), and increased activities of digestive (lipase and protease), protective (peroxidase) and detoxifying enzymes (carboxylesterase, Mixed-functional oxidase and glutathione s-transferase), prolonged developmental time, and decreased survival rate and body weight of larvae (P < 0.05). A. chroococcum inoculation significantly increased the activity of protective enzyme (catalase), and decreased the activities of detoxifying enzymes (carboxylesterase, glutathione s-transferase and mixed-functional oxidase), thus increased the growth rate and body weight of larvae in comparison with no-inoculation of A. chroococcum (P < 0.05). The indices of M. separata were significantly correlated with the foliar contents of JA, JA-Ile and SA (|r| = 0.44-0.85, P < 0.05), indicating that A. chroococcum inoculation altered the physiological adaptation of M. separata under eCO2 by disturbing defense substances in maize. Our results in understanding effects of A. chroococcum inoculation on maize resistance to herbivorous insects will be valuable for agricultural pest control in the future at eCO2 conditions.

AB  - Tick-borne relapsing fever spirochetes of genus Borrelia thrive in enzootic cycles involving Ornithodoros spp. (Argasidae) mainly, and rodents. The isolation of these spirochetes usually involves a murine model in which ticks are fed and the spirochetes detected in blood several days later. Such an experiment also demonstrates that a given species of tick is competent in the transmission of the bacteria. Here, soft ticks Ornithodoros octodontus were collected in Northern Chile with the objective to experimentally determine its capacity to transmit a Borrelia sp. detected in a previous study. Two Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) were used to feed nymphs and adults of O. octodontus and the spirochetes in blood were inspected by dark-field microscopy and nested PCR. Although spirochetes were not seen in blood, DNA was detected in only one animal 11 days after the ticks were fed. Genetic sequences of Borrelia flaB, clpX, pepX, recG, rplB, and uvrA genes retrieved from DNA extraction of positive blood were employed to construct two phylogenetic analyses. On the one hand, the flaB tree showed the Borrelia sp. transmitted by O. octodontus clustering with Borrelia sp. Alcohuaz, which was previously detected in that same tick species. On the other hand, concatenated clpX-pepX-recG-rplB-uvrA demonstrated that the characterized spirochete branches together with "Candidatus Borrelia caatinga", a recently discovered species from Brazil. Based on the genetic profile presented in this study, the name "Candidatus Borrelia octodonta" is proposed for the species transmitted by O. octodontus. The fact that spirochetes were not observed in blood of guinea pigs, may reflect the occurrence of low spirochetemia, which could be explained because the susceptibility of infection varies depending on the rodent species that is used in experimental models. Although the vertebrate reservoir of "Ca. Borrelia octodonta" is still unknown, Octodon degus, a rodent species that is commonly parasitized by O. octodontus, should be a future target to elucidate this issue.

AB  - In this study, the relationship between RORA 23bp indel genotype and allele frequency with twin pregnancy, fertility, live weight and milk yield in 106 female Akkaraman ewes raised in Elazig province was investigated. In the study conducted in Elazig province, 10ml milk was collected from 106 Akkaraman sheep and DNA was extracted from these milk. In RORA 23bp indel genotype frequency, DD genotype was found more than ID and II genotypes and RORA 23bp indel in allele frequency, the D allele was found to be higher than the I allele. In both the first and second parity, the twinning rate was found to be lower. In both the first and second parity, the twinning rate was higher in the DD genotype, and it was observed that this genotype prominated middle livestock weight and milk yield. According to the results of our study, mutations in the RORA gene, which is a gene affecting reproductive efficiency in sheep, do not have a positive effect on fertility and twinning rate in Akkaraman sheep. To sum, this study provided theoretical references for the comprehensively research of the function of RORA gene and the breeding of Akkaraman Sheep. The 23-bp indel variants can be considered as molecular markers for litter size of sheep for marker-assisted selection breeding.

AB  - The activity of Lipoptena cervi has intensified in Poland in recent years. The population genetics of this ectoparasite in Poland has never been described in the literature. The objectives of this study were to investigate the population genetics of L. cervi in selected regions of Poland, to evaluate molecular differences between L. cervi populations, and to determine phylogenetic relationships with other L. cervi sequences obtained in previous studies. In 2019, louse flies were sampled in natural mixed forests in five Polish voivodeships. Seven samples of L. cervi were collected from each voivodeship, and a total of 35 insects were analyzed molecularly. In the first step, Lipoptena spp. were identified to species level under a stereoscopic microscope. A fragment of the rRNA 16S gene was used as a marker to identify L. cervi by the PCR assay. The sequences were assigned accession numbers MT337409 to MT337416. A total of eight haplotypes were identified, two of which were dominant. In the obtained sequences, intraspecific pairwise genetic distances varied between 0.000 and 0.0496 (m = 0.0135; SD = 0.0149; SE = 0.0006; V = 110.11). Mean interpopulation diversity was d = 0.0135 (SE = 0.0027). The acquired nucleotide sequences were highly similar to the sequences from the Czech Republic (MF495940, AF322437), Lithuania (MN889542-MN889544) and Poland (MF541726-MF541729). The similarity with GenBank sequences ranged from 97.24% to 100%. This study revealed two dominant haplotypes of L. cervi in Poland, MT337410 and MT337413. Fragments of the analyzed sequences were detected in only one voivodeship. These findings suggest that the two dominant sequences are the oldest sequences that gave rise to the locally identified haplotypes. The lack of significant correlations with the sequences obtained in regions situated west of the research sites suggests the presence of other genetic populations in Europe.

AB  - Social behaviours are fundamental to gregarious animals and a dynamic force driving social structures, conflicts and cooperation. As a personality trait, sociability is defined as the individual reaction to the presence or absence of conspecifics and the motivation to associate with them. Research on sociability has been scarce compared to other personality traits, thus limiting our understanding of individual social behaviours which could potentially reflect it. To tackle this issue, we used a comprehensive approach, combining individual testing and Social Network Analysis. We designed a Novel Peer Test (NPT) to investigate sociability towards an unfamiliar conspecific. We conducted the NPT on 80 male domestic pigs at 6 weeks of age divided into 5 replicated groups over time. Each pig was confronted with an unfamiliar conspecific, separated by a fence in a familiar environment. To complement the NPT, we performed established personality tests, including an Open Field Test, Novel Object Test, Human Approach Test. All tests were repeated after two weeks. Pigs' social interactions in the home pen were recorded and used for Social Network Analysis, and the associated weighted degree and betweenness centrality were calculated. Through Principal Component Analysis, we found that the NPT highlighted pigs' motivation to interact with an unfamiliar conspecific, hence an aspect of sociability, and independently from novelty seeking. Additionally, the NPT may be a suitable personality test given that the behavioural profiles of the pigs were consistent over time. Pigs' network positions in the home pen for non-agonistic interactions did not predict behaviours in the NPT. Specifically, there were no links between nosing and play during the NPT and nosing and play in the home pen. This may be due to the different contexts, as the social interactions occurred dyadically with an unfamiliar conspecific during the NPT while the social networks are based on unrestrained social interactions with a group of familiar pen-mates. In contrast, walking close to the fence separating the focal and novel pig during the NPT was predicted by agonistic interactions in the home pen. This behaviour is ambiguous to interpret since it additionally loaded on the extracted sociability trait, thus, it could be driven by sociability and/or aggression. Understanding pigs' sociability will have implications for their welfare, highlighting the need for an adequate social environment to properly express different levels of sociability.

AB  - In North America, the rodent-borne hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is predominantly caused by the Sin Nombre virus, typically associated with the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus. Utilizing data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) hantavirus program, we assessed factors that may influence the spatial and temporal distribution of hantavirus in rodent populations across the United States. Between 2014 and 2019, the NEON hantavirus program conducted 104,379 small mammal captures and collected 14,004 blood samples from 49 species at 45 field sites. Our study identified 296 seropositive samples across 15 rodent species, including 8 Peromyscus species. We describe six new species with hantavirus seropositive samples not previously reported as hantavirus hosts. The highest number of seropositive samples was obtained from Pe. maniculatus (n = 116; 2.9% seroprevalence), followed by Peromyscus leucopus (n = 96; 2.8%) and Microtus pennsylvanicus (n = 33; 4.2%). Hantavirus seroprevalence showed an uneven spatial distribution, with the highest seroprevalence found in Virginia (7.8%, 99 seropositive samples), Colorado (5.7%, n = 37), and Texas (4.8%, n = 19). Hantavirus seropositive samples were obtained from 32 sites, 10 of which presented seropositive samples in species other than Pe. maniculatus or Pe. leucopus. Seroprevalence was inconsistent across years but showed intra-annual bimodal trends, and in Pe. maniculatus and Pe. leucopus, the number of captures correlated with seroprevalence in the following months. Seroprevalence was higher in adult males, with only one seropositive sample obtained from a juvenile Peromyscus truei. Higher body mass, presence of scrotal testes, and nonpregnant status were associated with higher seropositivity. The NEON dataset, derived from a multiyear and structured surveillance system, revealed the extensive distribution of hantavirus across broad taxonomic and environmental ranges. Future research should consider winter season surveillance and continued analyses of stored samples for a comprehensive spatiotemporal study of hantavirus circulation in wildlife. Global changes are expected to affect the dynamics of rodent populations by affecting their availability of resources and demography and, consequently, may modify transmission rates of rodent-borne zoonotic pathogens such as hantavirus. This study can be considered a baseline to assess hantavirus patterns across host taxa, geographies, and seasons in the United States.

AB  - Interactions and co-evolution between plants and herbivorous insects are critically important in agriculture. Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most severe insect of rice, and the biotypes adapt to feed on different rice genotypes. Here, we present genomics analyses on 1,520 global rice germplasms for resistance to three BPH biotypes. Genome-wide association studies identified 3,502 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 59 loci associated with BPH resistance in rice. We cloned a previously unidentified gene Bph37 that confers resistance to BPH. The associated loci showed high nucleotide diversity. Genome-wide scans for trans-species polymorphisms revealed ancient balancing selection at the loci. The secondarily evolved insect biotypes II and III exhibited significantly higher virulence and overcame more rice varieties than the primary biotype I. In response, more SNPs and loci evolved in rice for resistance to biotypes II and III. Notably, three exceptional large regions with high SNP density and resistance-associated loci on chromosomes 4 and 6 appear distinct between the resistant and susceptible rice varieties. Surprisingly, these regions in resistant rice might have been retained from wild species Oryza nivara. Our findings expand the understanding of long-term interactions between rice and BPH and provide resistance genes and germplasm resources for breeding durable BPH-resistant rice varieties.

AB  - Background: Deer placenta extract (DPE), rich in bioactive macromolecules, promotes regenerative effects in both normal and damaged cells. However, effective delivery of these macromolecules through the skin remains a challenge. Objectives: To investigate the potential of DPE in regenerating hair cells and to develop a nanoniosome (NS) and microspicule (MS) formulation as a promising transfollicular delivery system. Methods: The bioactivity of DPE was assessed in human follicle dermal papilla (HFDP) cells, including cells damaged by chemotherapy. The NS-MS formulation was designed to deliver biomacromolecules from DPE into skin and hair follicles. Results: DPE at 2000 mu g/mL exhibited no cytotoxicity and significantly enhanced proliferation in both normal and cisplatin-treated HFDP cells. The DPE-loaded NSs displayed nanovesicles with a uniform size distribution and a negative surface charge. When incorporated into the MS gel, NS-MS demonstrated a synergistic effect, significantly enhancing the transdermal and transfollicular delivery of macromolecular protein into the skin layers and hair follicles. Conclusions: DPE promoted hair cell proliferation and facilitated the recovery of hair cells damaged by chemotherapy, especially when formulated into the NS-MS system, which effectively delivered bioactive macromolecules to the target site. This suggests its potential role in promoting hair regrowth.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigated the effects of fermented bamboo powder as a new feed ingredient by replacing wheat bran in swine diets. The results indicated that there were no negative effects on the growth performance, and that it exerted beneficial effects on promoting serum biochemical and immune indices, as well as modulating the fecal microbiota of pigs, when the wheat bran was replaced by fermented bamboo powder at 5% or 10% in the control diets. These results suggest that the fermented bamboo powder could be one potential fiber-rich ingredient for growing-finishing pigs. This experiment aimed to investigate the effects of fermented bamboo powder (FBP) on the growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, immunoglobulins and inflammatory cytokines, and fecal microbial composition of growing-finishing pigs. A total of 108 barrows (initial body weight, 56.30 +/- 0.55 kg) were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments in a 75 d trial, including a control (CON) diet and two FBP supplementation diets. The CON diet was formulated to three-phase diets according to the body weight of pigs, and the FBP diets were formulated used 5.00% (FBP1) or 10.00% (FBP2) FBP to replace the wheat bran in the CON diet, respectively. The results showed that there were no influences on growth performances between the CON diet and FBP addition diets, whereas the 5% FBP addition decreased the feed:gain of pigs compared to the pigs fed the FBP2 diet from d 0-75 (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the FBP addition increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) content in serum (linear, p < 0.05), and pigs fed the FBP1 diet had greater HDLC and IgA contents in serum than those in the pigs fed the CON diet (p < 0.05). Microbial analysis showed that the FBP addition diets decreased the abundance of Spirochaetes, and the FBP2 diet increased the abundance of Firmicutes more than the CON diet (p < 0.05). In addition, the pigs fed the FBP2 diet increased the abundance of uncultured_bacterium_f_Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, Prevotellaceae_UCG-003, Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group, and Lactobacillus more than the CON group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the FBP supplementation to the diet had no negative effects on the growth performance and exerted beneficial effects on promoting serum biochemical and immune indices, as well as modulating the fecal microbiota of pigs. Therefore, these results showed that the fermented bamboo powder could be one potential fiber-rich ingredient for growing-finishing pigs, and that the recommended addition proportion in the growing-finishing pigs' diet is 5%.

AB  - IntroductionPregnant women may need to undergo non-obstetric surgery under general anesthesia owing to medical needs, and pregnant women frequently experience sleep disturbances during late gestation. Preclinical studies demonstrated that maternal isoflurane exposure (MISO) or maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) contributed to cognitive impairments in offspring. Research studies in mice have revealed that SD can aggravate isoflurane-induced cognitive deficits. However, it remains unclear whether MSD aggravates MISO-induced cognitive deficits in offspring. The purpose of this research was to explore the combined effects of MSD and MISO on offspring cognitive function and the role of neuroinflammation and synaptic function in the process of MSD + MISO.MethodsPregnant mice were exposed to 1.4% isoflurane by inhalation for 4 h on gestational day (GD) 14. Dams were then subjected to SD for 6 h (12:00-18:00 h) during GD15-21. At 3 months of age, the offspring mice were subjected to the Morris water maze test to assess cognitive function. Then the levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers and synaptic function-related proteins were assessed using molecular biology methods.ResultsThe results of this study demonstrated that MISO led to cognitive dysfunction, an effect that was aggravated by MSD. In addition, MSD exacerbated the maternal isoflurane inhalation, leading to an enhancement in the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and a reduction in the hippocampal levels of IL-10, synaptophysin, post-synaptic density-95, growth-associated protein-43, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.ConclusionOur findings revealed that MSD aggravated the cognitive deficits induced by MISO in male offspring mice, and these results were associated with neuroinflammation and alternations in synaptic function.
   Maternal sleep deprivation aggravated the cognitive deficits induced by maternal isoflurane exposure in male offspring mice, and these results were associated with neuroinflammation and alternations in synaptic function. image

AB  - Pre-slaughter conditions and their effects on carcass quality have been largely addressed for pigs of 90-100 kg live weight, while few studies consider the effects of pre-slaughter conditions on the quality of the carcasses obtained from heavy pigs intended for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) production. A total of 1680 heavy pigs were transported in 72 batches from a farm to a commercial abattoir on 16 different days, avoiding mixing unfamiliar animals. Slaughterhouse conditions, animal behaviors, and human-animal interactions were annotated at unloading and during the race toward the stunning cage. Carcass lesions on the rear, middle, and shoulder parts of the carcasses were scored. The prevalence of carcasses with severe lesions was 6.92%, 11.87%, and 6.83%, for the rear, middle, and shoulder parts, respectively. Among the pre-slaughter events, waiting before unloading and improper handling practices at the abattoir were the major factors affecting carcass lesion severity. Lairage pen space allowance was also found to affect severe rear and shoulder lesions, and the batches that were transported in the trailer had an increased prevalence of severe shoulder lesions. Our results suggest waiting time before unloading should be shortened as much as possible, and educational programs to train operators for more careful management of animals in the abattoir are greatly required to avoid improper animal handling practices.

AB  - The energy demand of buildings is currently central to the generation of greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels for energy. As energy demand increases, it is critical to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. Several architectural studies have shown that building orientation is one of the primary factors that affect building performance. However, there are still many misaligned buildings where energy costs are higher than when standard methods are used. To address this discrepancy, a research study was conducted using different building profiles. Simulations were conducted as part of the research to link a building's orientation to performance measures, such as energy use intensity (EUI), cooling load, and heating load. In addition, the impacts of solar heat gain and ventilation air exchange values on building energy performance at various orientations were demonstrated. Although building orientation affects building energy performance, the study shows that not all factors related to building efficiency are equally influenced by orientation, and the effects vary by climate zone and building size. Energy efficiency and optimization are timely topics that require further study and exploration. This study discussed the effect of a building's orientation on its energy usage and performance using optimization techniques. Research methodology can be employed to determine the optimum orientation of buildings. The simulation was performed for two warm and cold climate zones using IES VE and Rhino/Honeybee tools. It is shown that the orientation of the building does not have a significant effect on the energy use intensity (EUI).Graphical abstractGlobal energy transition scenario

AB  - The cold climates in autumn and winter threatens human health. The aim of this study was to reveal the effects of prolonged cold exposure on the liver and pancreas based on GLP-1R signaling, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ferroptosis by Yorkshire pig models. Yorkshire pigs were divided into the control group and chronic cold stress (CCS) group. The results showed that CCS induced oxidative stress injury, activated Nrf2 pathway and inhibited the expression of GLP-1R in the liver and pancreas (P < 0.05). The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway was activated in the liver and pancreas, accompanied by the enrichment of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha during CCS (P < 0.05). Moreover, the kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1), X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha) expression in the liver and pancreas was up-regulated during CCS (P < 0.05). In addition, CCS promoted the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) expression and inhibited the ferritin H (FtH) expression in the liver. Summarily, CCS promotes inflammation, ER stress and apoptosis by inhibiting the GLP-1R signaling and inducing oxidative stress, and exacerbates the risk of ferroptosis in the liver and pancreas.

AB  - Prey often induce antipredator behaviors when balancing food acquisition against safety. The starvation-predation hypothesis (SPH) posits that, during food shortages, the risk of starvation requires prey to forego antipredator behavior to increase feeding rates. Such shifts in antipredator behavior may further increase the risk of predation and therefore kill rates by predators. We tested the SPH and its consequences for kill rates in a single large prey, single large predator system. In the Argentine Andes, we evaluated whether risk avoidance by vicunas (Vicugna vicugna) decreased during periods of food scarcity. From three years of GPS relocations collected simultaneously from vicunas and pumas (Puma concolor), resource selection functions revealed that vicunas increased their exposure to pumas during nongrowing seasons by reducing the avoidance of canyons and increasing selection for meadows, both of which offer more food of higher quality than relatively safe plains. However, and despite vicunas becoming more risk-prone during nongrowing seasons, kill rates by pumas did not change between growing and nongrowing seasons. Contrary to evidence from mesocosm experiments, relaxation of antipredator behavior by prey did not translate into increased kill rates by predators. Our results enhance understanding of the interplay between food limitation and predator-prey interactions within ecosystems and may improve ecologists' ability to predict when and where behaviorally mediated trophic cascades are more likely to occur.

AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is one of the most frequent bacterial agents associated with food-borne outbreaks in Europe. In humans, the infection can lead to life-threatening diseases. Domestic and wild animals can har-bor STEC, and ruminants are the main STEC reservoirs, although asymptomatic. In the present study we have charac-terized STEC from wildlife (wild boar (n = 56), red deer (n = 101), red fox (n = 37) and otter (n = 92)). Cultivable STEC (n = 52) were isolated from 17% (n = 49) of the faecal samples. All the isolates were non-O157 STEC encoding stx1 (n = 2; 4%) and/or stx2 genes (n = 51; 98%). Only one strain (2%) isolated from red fox had an antibiotic resis-tant phenotype. However, when the normalized resistance interpretation of epidemiological cutoffs (NRI ECOFFs) were used, 23% (n = 12) of the strains were non-wildtype to at least one of the antibiotics tested. After analysis by pulsed -field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 20 strains were selected for whole genome sequencing and belonged to the fol-lowing serotypes: O27:H30 (n = 15), O146:H28 (n = 2), O146:H21 (n = 1), O178:H19 (n = 1), and O103:H2 (n = 1). In addition to stx, all strains encode several virulence factors such as toxins, adhesins, fimbriae and secretion sys-tems, among others. All sequenced genomes carried several mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as prophages and/or plasmids. The core genome and the phylogenetic analysis showed close evolutionary relationships between some of the STEC recovered from wildlife and strains of clinical origin, highlighting their pathogenic potential. Over-all, our results show the zoonotic potential of STEC strains originating from wildlife, highlighting the importance of monitoring their genomic characteristics following a One Health perspective, in which the health of humans is related to the health of animals, and the environment.

AB  - Geraniol is one of the most abundant aromatic compounds in fresh tea leaves and contributes to the pleasant odor of tea products. Additionally, it functions as an airborne signal that interacts with other members of the ecosystem. To date, the regulation of the geraniol biosynthesis in tea plants remains to be investigated. In this study, a correlation test of the content of geraniol and its glycosides with gene expression data revealed that nudix hydrolase, CsNudix26, and its transcription factor, CsbHLH133 are involved in geraniol biosynthesis. In vitro enzyme assays and metabolic analyses of genetically modified tea plants confirmed that CsNudix26 is responsible for the formation of geraniol. Yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase reporter, and EMSA assays were used to verify the binding of CsbHLH133 to the CsNudix26 promoter. Overexpression of CsbHLH133 in tea leaves enhanced CsNudix26 expression and geraniol accumulation, whereas CsbHLH133 silencing reduced CsNudix26 transcript levels and geraniol content. Interestingly, CsbHLH133-AS, produced by alternative splicing, was discovered and proved to be the primary transcript expressed in response to various environmental stresses. Furthermore, geraniol release was found to be affected by various factors that alter the expression patterns of CsbHLH133 and CsbHLH133-AS. Our findings indicate that distinct transcript splicing patterns of CsbHLH133 regulate geraniol biosynthesis in tea plants in response to different regulatory factors.

AB  - Plants produce an astonishingly diverse array of specialized metabolites. A crucial step in understanding the origin of such chemodiversity is describing how chemodiversity manifests across the spatial and ontogenetic scales relevant to plant-biotic interactions. Focusing on 21 sympatric species of Psychotria and Palicourea sensu lato (Rubiaceae), we describe patterns of specialized metabolite diversity across spatial and ontogenetic scales using a combination of field collections, untargeted metabolomics, and ecoinformatics. We compare alpha, beta, and gamma diversity of specialized metabolites in expanding leaves, unripe pulp, immature seed, ripe pulp, mature seed, and fine roots. Within species, fruit tissues from across ontogenetic stages had >=alpha diversity than leaves, and <=beta diversity than leaves. Pooled across species, fruit tissues and ontogenetic stages had the highest gamma diversity of all organs, and fruit tissues and ontogenetic stages combined had a higher incidence of organ-specific mass spectral features than leaves. Roots had <=alpha diversity than leaves and the lowest beta and gamma diversity of all organs. Phylogenetic correlations of chemical distance varied by plant organ and chemical class. Our results describe patterns of specialized metabolite diversity across organs and species and provide support for organ-specific contributions to plant chemodiversity. This study contributes to the growing understanding within plant evolutionary ecology of the biological scales of specialized metabolite diversification. Future studies combining our data on specialized metabolite diversity with biotic interaction data and experiments can test existing hypotheses on the roles of ecological interactions in the evolution of chemodiversity.

AB  - Vernalization requirement is an integral component of flowering in winter-type plants. The availability of winter ecotypes among Camelina species facilitated the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for vernalization requirement in Camelina sativa. An inter and intraspecific crossing scheme between related Camelina species, where one spring and two different sources of winter-type habit were used, resulted in the development of two segregating populations. Linkage maps generated with sequence-based markers identified three QTLs associated with vernalization requirement in C. sativa; two from the interspecific (chromosomes 13 and 20) and one from the intraspecific cross (chromosome 8). Notably, the three loci were mapped to different homologous regions of the hexaploid C. sativa genome. All three QTLs were found in proximity to Flowering Locus C (FLC), variants of which have been reported to affect the vernalization requirement in plants. Temporal transcriptome analysis for winter-type Camelina alyssum demonstrated reduction in expression of FLC on chromosomes 13 and 20 during cold treatment, which would trigger flowering, since FLC would be expected to suppress floral initiation. FLC on chromosome 8 also showed reduced expression in the C. sativa ssp. pilosa winter parent upon cold treatment, but was expressed at very high levels across all time points in the spring-type C. sativa. The chromosome 8 copy carried a deletion in the spring-type line, which could impact its functionality. Contrary to previous reports, all three FLC loci can contribute to controlling the vernalization response in C. sativa and provide opportunities for manipulating this requirement in the crop.

AB  - Automatic building extraction from high-resolution remotely sensed data is a major area of interest for an extensive range of fields (e.g., urban planning, environmental risk management) but challenging due to urban morphology complexity. Among the different methods proposed, the approaches based on supervised machine learning (ML) achieve the best results. This paper aims to investigate building footprint extraction using only high-resolution raster digital surface model (DSM) data by comparing the performance of three different popular supervised ML models on a benchmark dataset. The first two methods rely on a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature descriptor and a classical ML (support vector machine (SVM)) or a shallow neural network (extreme learning machine (ELM)) classifier, and the third model is a fully convolutional network (FCN) based on deep learning with transfer learning. Used data were obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) and cover the urban areas of Vaihingen an der Enz, Potsdam, and Toronto. The results indicated that performances of models based on shallow ML (feature extraction and classifier training) are affected by the urban context investigated (F1 scores from 0.49 to 0.81), whereas the FCN-based model proved to be the most robust and best-performing method for building extraction from a high-resolution raster DSM (F1 scores from 0.80 to 0.86).

AB  - The study of sperm subpopulations spans three decades. The origin, meaning, and practical sig-nificance, however, are less clear. Current technology for assessing sperm morphology (CASA-Morph) and motility (CASA-Mot) has enabled the accurate evaluation of these features, and there are many options for data classification. Subpopulations could occur as a result of the stage of development of each spermatozoon in the subpopulation. Spermatogenesis might contribute to the production of these subpopulations. Insights from evolutionary biology and recent molecular research are indicative of the diversity among male gametes that could occur from unequal sharing of transcripts and other elements through cytoplasmic bridges between spermatids. Sperm cohorts exiting the gonads would contain different RNA and protein contents, affecting the spermatozoon physiology and associations with the surrounding environmental milieu. Subse-quently, these differences could affect how spermatozoa interact with the environmental milieu (maturation, mixing with seminal plasma, and interacting with the environmental milieu, or female genital tract and female gamete). The emergence of sperm subpopulations as an outcome of evolution, related to the reproductive strategies of the species, genital tract structures, and copulatory and fertilization processes. This kind of approach in determining the importance of sperm subpopulations in fertilization capacity should have a practical impact for conducting reproductive technologies, inspiring and enabling new ways for the more efficient use of sper-matozoa in the medical, animal breeding, and conservation fields. This manuscript is a contri-bution to the Special Issue in memory of Dr. Duane Garner.

AB  - The study aimed to determine the optimal ratio for the mixture of forage cactus and corn stover silage, emphasizing the evaluation of fermentative profile, microbial populations, dry matter losses, chemical composition, and aerobic stability. A completely randomized design with four treatments and five replications was employed in this study. Treatments included varying proportions of forage cactus in corn stover at ensiling (0%, 10%, 20%, and 40% of fresh matter). After a 100-day fermentation period, the assayed variables underwent regression analysis. Forage cactus inclusion led to linear dry matter and ether extract reductions, with crude protein showing a negative quadratic effect (p < 0.05). The pH and water-soluble carbohydrates exhibited negative quadratic effects with the increasing proportion of forage cactus (p < 0.05). Lactic and acetic acids exhibited quadratic effects, reaching their peaks at approximately 20% forage cactus (p < 0.05). Lactic acid bacteria demonstrated a linear decrease, while yeasts/molds displayed a negative quadratic effect (p < 0.05). Dry matter losses followed a quadratic pattern, with the minimum values observed at 20% forage cactus (p < 0.05). Additionally, the inclusion of forage cactus significantly enhanced aerobic stability (p < 0.05). The incorporation of 20% forage cactus into corn stover silage markedly improved its quality.

AB  - The nutraceutical milk of goat in agrobased countries is at risk of contamination with pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus. The current study was designed to investigate prevalence of pathogenic strains of S. aureus, assessment of risk factors, and in-vitro antibiogram of non-biofilm producing S. aureus (nbpSA) and biofilm positive S. aureus (bpSA) from mastitic goats. The purposive sampling technique was applied to collect n=200 milk samples from different regions of goat populated areas of district Faisalabad Pakistan. Using surf field mastitis test, collected milk samples were screened for subclinical mastitis at the spot for subsequent identification of pathogenic strains of S. aureus through microbiological examination in the laboratory. Non-probability statistical tools conferred 42% (84/200, CI=35.37-48.93) prevalence of subclinical mastitis, 38.1% S. aureus (32/84, CI=28.45-48.79), 15.6% MRSA (5/32, CI=6.87-31.76), 46.9% haemolytic S. aureus (15/32, CI=30.87-63.56) and 34.4 % biofilm producing S. aureus (11/32, CI=20.41-51.69). Earthen floor type (OR=1.75, p=0.0996), poor drainage system (OR=7.33, p=0.002), pond as source of drinking water (OR=2.05, p=0.179), stall feeding (OR=7.27, p<0.001), 4-6 years of age of goat (OR=4.2, p=0.0874), and teat injury (OR=13.74, p<0.001) were potential risk factors for subclinical mastitis. The in-vitro findings of current study revealed 100% sensitivity of S. aureus against gentamicin, oxytetracycline, amoxicillin, and linezolid while 80% of biofilm negative S. aureus (nbpSA) showed sensitivity against amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. None of the isolate from bpSA and nbpSA was resistant against linezolid, gentamicin, and oxytetracycline in this study. bpSA were highly resistant against amoxicillin and vancomycin. The study found higher prevalence of pathogenic strains of S. aureus, higher number of potential risk factors, and diversified responses to antibiotic.

AB  - Contamination with arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) is a global concern impairing resilience of organisms and ecosystems. Proximity to emission sources increases exposure risk but remoteness does not alleviate it. These toxic elements are transported in atmospheric and oceanic pathways and accumulate in organisms. Mercury accumulates in higher trophic levels. Brown bears (Ursus arctos), which often live in remote areas, are long-lived omnivores, feeding on salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and berries (Vaccinium spp.), resources also consumed by humans. We measured blood concentrations of As, Cd, Hg and Pb in bears (n = 72) four years and older in Scandinavia and three national parks in Alaska, USA (Lake Clark, Katmai and Gates of the Arctic) using high-resolution, inductively-coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry. Age and sex of the bears, as well as the typical population level diet was associated with blood element concentrations using generalized linear regression models. Alaskan bears consuming salmon had higher Hg blood concentrations compared to Scandinavian bears feeding on berries, ants (Formica spp.) and moose (Alces). Cadmium and Pb blood concentrations were higher in Scandinavian bears than in Alaskan bears. Bears using marine food sources, in addition to salmon in Katmai, had higher As blood concentrations than bears in Scandinavia. Blood concentrations of Cd and Pb, as well as for As in female bears increased with age. Arsenic in males and Hg concentrations decreased with age. We detected elevated levels of toxic elements in bears from landscapes that are among the most pristine on the planet. Sources are unknown but anthropogenic emissions are most likely involved. All study areas face upcoming change: Increasing tourism and mining in Alaska and more intensive forestry in Scandinavia, combined with global climate change in both regions. Baseline contaminant concentrations as presented here are important knowledge in our changing world.

AB  - Patients diagnosed with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, suffer from disorganized speech. The disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) protein pathway is considered a risk factor for the development of several psychiatric disorders and plays an important role in the dysregulation of dopamine (DA), which in turn plays an important role in the regulation of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rats. Moreover, the DISC1 protein pathway has been identified as a cause of social anhedonia, that is, a decrease in the drive for social interactions. USVs transmit specific affective information to other rats, with 50-kHz calls indicating a positive affective state in rats. Dysregulation of the dopaminergic system impacts the qualitative and quantitative features of USVs, such as duration, peak frequency, and the call rate. In this study, we thus used a well-established transgenic DISC1 (tgDISC1) rat line to investigate whether the neural (decreased DA levels in the dorsal striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus (HPC)) and behavioral (social anhedonia) features of tgDISC1 rats could be manifested through the modulation of their 50-kHz USVs. Analyses of three features (call rate, duration, and peak frequency) of all 50-kHz revealed no significant differences between groups, suggesting decreased DA levels in the dorsal striatum and amygdala, and HPC may affect social interaction but leave 50-kHz USV production intact.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Lipoptenafortisetosa is an invasive, hematophagous insect, which lives on cervids and continues to spread across Europe. The species originated from the Far East and eastern Siberia. Besides wild animals, these ectoparasites can attack humans, companion animals, and livestock. These insects may also play a role in transmitting infectious diseases. The objective of this study was to confirm the presence of L. fortisetosa in north-eastern Poland and to characterize the examined population with the use of molecular methods. Deer keds were collected from six natural forests in the region of Warmia and Mazury. DNA of L. fortisetosa was extracted and subjected to molecular studies. Two species of deer keds (Lipoptena cervi and L. fortisetosa) were obtained in each location during field research. There were no differences in the sex distribution of these two ectoparasite species. During the research, more L. cervi than L. fortisetosa specimens were obtained. The studied insects were very closely related to specimens from Lithuania, the Czech Republic, and Japan. Our study indicates various ectoparasite lineages, and such research contributes to the improvement of basic knowledge on the distribution, genetic structure, and variability of the invasive ked fly L. fortisetosa.
   Recent years have witnessed an increase in the population of Lipoptena fortisetosa in Central Europe. The genetic profile of this ectoparasite has not been studied in Poland to date. The aim of the present study was to confirm the presence of L. fortisetosa in north-eastern Poland and to characterize the examined population with the use of molecular methods. Deer keds were collected between June and July 2019 in six natural, mixed forests. A fragment of the rRNA 16S gene was used as a marker to identify L. fortisetosa by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA samples were sequenced in the last step. Six new locations of L. fortisetosa were confirmed. No significant differences were observed in the sex ratios of L. cervi and L. fortisetosa (L. cervi p-value = 0.74; L. fortisetosa p-value = 0.65). Significant differences were noted between the total size of L. cervi and L. fortisetosa populations (p-value < 0.001). The similarity to GenBank sequences ranged from 95.56% to 100%. The obtained nucleotide sequences were very closely related to L. fortisetosa sequences from Lithuania, the Czech Republic, and Japan. Molecular analyses revealed considerable genetic diversity, which could indicate that various ectoparasite lineages have spread throughout Europe.

AB  - Information on the annual variability in abundance and growth of juvenile groundfish can be useful for predicting fisheries stocks, but is often poorly known owing to difficulties in sampling fish in their first year of life. In the Western Gulf of Alaska (WGoA) and Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) ecosystems, three species of puffin (tufted and horned puffin, Fratercula cirrhata, Fratercula corniculata, and rhinoceros auklet, Cerorhinca monocerata, Alcidae), regularly prey upon (i.e., "sample") age-0 groundfish, including walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogramma, Gadidae) and Pacific cod (Gadus microcephalus, Gadidae). Here, we test the hypothesis that integrating puffin dietary data with walleye pollock stock assessment data provides information useful for fisheries management, including indices of interannual variation in age-0 abundance and growth. To test this hypothesis, we conducted cross-correlation and regression analyses of puffin-based indices and spawning stock biomass (SSB) for the WGoA and EBS walleye pollock stocks. For the WGoA, SSB leads the abundance of age-0 fish in the puffin diet, indicating that puffins sample the downstream production of the WGoA spawning stock. By contrast, the abundance and growth of age-0 fish sampled by puffins lead SSB for the EBS stock by 1-3 years, indicating that the puffin diet proxies incoming year class strength for this stock. Our study indicates connectivity between the WGoA and EBS walleye pollock stocks. Integration of non-traditional data sources, such as seabird diet data, with stock assessment data appears useful to inform information gaps important for managing US fisheries in the North Pacific.

AB  - Vanadium titanium magnetite (VTM) is a valuable resource, with blast furnace (BF) ironmaking being the primary process for its reduction to produce pig iron. However, during this process, an increased proportion of VTM leads to a surge in slag viscosity, which can severely disrupt stable BF operation. In this study, the modeling of the VTM reduction process is developed for the first time. This model is based on a recently developed BF process model. It incorporates a structure-based viscosity model to establish the relationship between liquid viscosity, temperature, and chemical composition. Additionally, the reduction of Ti and the effects of its reactant, Ti(C,N), on the viscosity are considered. The model is applied to simulate an industrial-scale BF, successfully capturing the significant increase in the liquid viscosity induced by the TiC and TiN precipitation. The study also investigates the effect of TiO2 content in slag, a key parameter that is closely monitored in BF operations. The results, consistent with BF practice, reveal that an increase in TiO2 content in slag negatively impacts BF operations, resulting in a higher gas pressure drop, a more severe potential flooding phenomenon, a reduced top gas utilization factor, and a lower liquid temperature. This work extends the capabilities of the CFD process model to simulate BF operations involving VTM, facilitating control and optimization for better efficiency and reliability.

AB  - Although rodents are arguably the easiest animals to use for studying brain function, relying on them as model species for translational research comes with its own set of limitations. Here, we propose sheep as a practical large animal species to use for in vivo brain function studies performed in naturalistic settings. We conducted proof-of-principle deep brain electrophysiological recording experiments using unrestrained sheep during behavioral testing. Recordings were made from cortex and hippocampus, both while sheep performed goal-directed behaviors (two-choice discrimination tasks) and across states of vigilance, including sleep. Hippocampal and cortical oscillatory rhythms were consistent with those seen in rodents and non-human primates, and included cortical alpha oscillations and hippocampal sharp wave ripple oscillations (-150 Hz) during immobility and hippocampal theta oscillations (5-6 Hz) during locomotion. Recordings were conducted over a period of many months during which time the animals participated willingly in the experiments. Over 3,000 putative neurons were identified, including examples whose activity was modulated by task, speed of locomotion, spatial position, reward and vigilance states, and one whose firing rate was potentially modulated by the sight of the investigator. Together, these experiments demonstrate that sheep are excellent experimental animals to use for longitudinal studies requiring a large-brained mammal and/or large-scale recordings across distributed neuronal networks. Sheep could be used safely for studying not only neural encoding of decision-making and spatial-mapping in naturalistic environments outside the confines of the traditional laboratory but also the neural basis of both intra-and inter-species social interactions.

AB  - Sub-estrus is a condition when buffaloes do not display behavioural estrus signs, despite being in estrus and causes a delay in conception and increases the service period. The present study describes the effect of synthetic prostaglandin (PGF(2 alpha)) alone and in combination with trace minerals on the follicular and corpus luteum (CL) dynamics, serum estradiol (E-2) and progesterone (P-4) concentration correlating estrus response and pregnancy outcome in sub-estrus buffaloes during the breeding season. A total of 50 sub-estrus buffaloes, identified through ultrasonography (USG) examination, were randomly allocated into three groups, viz. T1 (Synthetic PGF(2 alpha), Inj. Cloprostenol 500 mu g, i.m, n = 17), T2 (Synthetic PGF(2 alpha) + Trace mineral supplementation, Inj. Stimvet 1 mL/100 kg body weight, i.m., n = 17) and control (untreated; n = 16). Following treatment, 100% of sub-estrus buffaloes were induced estrus in the T1 and T2 groups, while only 18.75% were induced in the control. The CL diameter and serum P-4 concentration were significantly lower at post-treatment, whereas the pre-ovulatory follicle (POF) size and serum E-2 concentration were significantly higher in the T1 and T2 groups as compared to the control (p < .05). The buffaloes of the T2 group had a greater proportion of moderate intensities estrus than those of T1. Moreover, the proportion of buffaloes conceived in the T1 and T2 were 41.2% and 52.95%, respectively. The larger POF diameter and higher serum E-2 concentration were associated with intense intensity estrus and higher conception rate (66.7%) in sub-estrus buffaloes. Similarly, CL regression rate, POF size and serum E-2 concentration were relatively higher in the buffaloes conceived as compared to those not conceived. It is concluded that synthetic PGF(2 alpha) in combination with trace minerals induces moderate to intense intensities estrus in a greater proportion of sub-estrus buffaloes and increases the conception rate during the breeding season. Moreover, behavioural estrus attributes correlating follicle and luteal morphometry, serum E-2 and P-4 concentration could be used to optimise the breeding time for augmenting the conception rate in sub-estrus buffaloes.

AB  - Understanding the views of those working along the value chain reliant on livestock is an important step in supporting the transition towards more sustainable farming systems. We recruited 31 delegates attending the Pig Welfare Symposium held in the United States to participate in one of six focus group discussions on the future of pig farming. Each of these six group discussions was subjected to a thematic analysis that identified four themes: (1) technical changes on the farm; (2) farm and industry culture; (3) the farm-public interface; and (4) sustainability. The results of this study illustrate the complexity and diversity of views of those working along the associated value chain within the swine industry. Participants spent the majority of their time discussing current challenges, including technical challenges on the farm and public perception of pig farms. Participants were more hesitant to discuss future issues, but did engage on the broader issue of sustainability, focusing upon economic and environmental aspects.

AB  - The heavy metal, cadmium (Cd) is an increasingly serious issue in agricultural ecosystems, mediating bottom-up effects on plants, herbivores and natural enemies. We measured how Cd modifies interactions between tomato Solanum lycopersicum, western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis, and the predatory bug Orius sauteri by examining Cd effects on the growth of tomato, the fitness of western flower thrips, and the survival and behavior of predators. The photosynthetic parameters of Pn (net photosynthetic rate), Gs (stomatal conductance), Ci (intercellular CO2 concentration), and Tr (transpiration rate) of tomato plants significantly decreased with the increase of Cd concentration. The total survival number of western flower thrips fed on tomato plants treated with different concentrations of Cd was significantly lower than that of the control, and sex ratios (female/male) gradually increased with the increase of Cd concentration. The numbers of thrips predated by O. sauteri on tomato plants treated with high concentrations of Cd (2.0 or 4.0 mg/L) were significantly reduced by the second day. Cadmium was accumulated and bioconcentrated in the roots, stems, leaves of tomato plants, and transferred to F. occidentalis, and O. sauteri. Cadmium translocated in significant quantities from roots to the stems and leaves of tomato plants, and from the tomato leaf to F. occidentalis. However, there was minimal (non-significant) transfer of Cd from F. occidentalis to O. sauteri. The presence of Cd significantly reduced the growth of tomato plants, the fitness of F. occidentalis, and the predation efficiency of O. sauteri. Collectively, Cd can mediate bottom-up effects on tomato, thrip, and predatory bug along food chain, potentially interrupting pest biological control in tomato in heavy metal-contaminated ecosystems.

AB  - Simple Summary Recently, global interest in goat milk and goat milk products has increased, due to their high nutritional value and better amino acid composition and fatty acid profile compared to cow milk. Moreover, the more favorable fatty acid composition of these foodstuffs (such as increased long-chain n-3 fatty acids) has significant implications on the reduction of human health problems and is increasingly important for consumers as a result. One of the common ways to enhance the foodstuffs via long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is to enrich animal diets with fishmeal, fish oil, or marine algae. Marine algae are a source of long-chain n-3 PUFA, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is essential for human nutrition because it is able to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and it has antihaemolytic properties. Conversely, marine algae supplementation is linked to some adverse effects, such as decreased dry matter intake and milk yield, and results in milk fat depression in dairy animals and influences the flavour of their milk. This study evaluated low-level marine algae supplementation in goat milk, whey, and cheese composition, and the fatty acid profile of goat milk and cheese as well as the sensory profile of goat milk. In this report, daily supplementation of 5 g/head of marine algae significantly influenced the recovery of fat and protein in curd, whey, and cheese composition. In addition, marine algae supplementation markedly improved the concentrations of beneficial fatty acids in milk and cheese without negative effects on milk flavour. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of the low level of Schizochytrium limacinum marine algae (daily 5 g per animal) on the milk, cheese, and whey composition; fatty acid profile of milk and cheese; and the sensory profile of goat milk using an e-nose device. Thirty Alpine goats were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (C, n = 15)-fed grass with daily 600 g concentrate and the experimental group (MA, n = 15) who received the same forage and concentrate supplemented with 5 g/head/day marine algae. Animals were kept indoors and the investigation period lasted 52 days, including the first six weeks as the period of adaptation and the last 10 days as the treatment period. During the adaptation period, bulk milk samples from each group were collected once a week (0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 d), while during the treatment period (10 days), bulk milk samples from each group were taken every day, and cheese samples were processed from bulk milk each day from both groups. Marine algae supplementation had no negative effect on milk composition. In contrast, the marine algae inclusion significantly elevated the fat and protein content of whey and the protein content of cheese, as well as the recovery of fat and protein in the curd, while increasing the cheeses' moisture content on a fat-free basis. The marine algae supplementation significantly increased the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the rumenic acid (CLA c9t11) concentrations and decreased the n-6/n-3 ratio in the milk and cheese. There were no significant differences between the C and the MA group with regard to the sensory profiles of the milk. It can be concluded that the milk obtained from goats given daily supplementation of 5g of MA has a fatty acid profile more beneficial to human health, without any negative effects on the milk's aromatic components.

AB  - To address increasing water demands in expanding cities, many aquifers in Mexico are overexploited and deplete. The resulting land subsidence often combines with ground faulting/fracturing and damage to infrastructure. This study provides the longest Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) survey ever undertaken for the Aguascalientes Valley, aimed to constrain its structurally-controlled subsidence process and the induced risk. 275 ERS-1/2 1996-2002, ENVISAT 2003-2010 and Sentinel-1 2014-2020 C-band SAR images are processed with change detection, differential Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) methods. Aguascalientes notably expanded over the last four decades, as revealed by Seasat 1978 L-band SAR, Landsat 1985-2010 and Sentinel-2 2020 optical imagery. The observed subsidence pattern involves alluvial/fluvial deposits within the N-S trending graben. Maximum settlement rates are -14 cm/year in 1996, -10 cm/year in 2000-2010 and over -12 cm/year in 2015-2020. An acceleration (-0.70 cm/year(2)) is recorded in 2015-2020 close to recently developed industrial plants and housing districts. Satellite estimates agree with in-situ observations, static GPS surveying and continuous GPS monitoring data. Rough correlation is found with piezometric level drop rates, whereas aquifer thickness plays a stronger role in the subsidence process. While these outcomes align with the existing literature, this InSAR survey: (i) unveils previously unknown E-W deformation affecting two N-S oriented bands within the valley, with up to similar to +/- 3 cm/year in 2015-2020 towards its center; (ii) identifies zones of sagging and hogging with horizontal strain (epsilon) of up to 0.05-0.1%; (iii) retrieves differential rates reaching 6-8 cm/year and angular distortions (beta) of 1/500 along the Oriente fault; and (iv) investigates the statistical distribution of, beta across field surveyed faults and fissures, and marks areas with potentially yetunmapped ground discontinuities. A new surface faulting risk matrix embedding beta and epsilon is therefore proposed to estimate subsidence impact on properties and population. Given its scale-dependency, the risk assessment provides a lower bound to the percentage of urban areas at risk within the Aguascalientes state: at least 2% of the urban areas were at high and very high risk in 2003-2010 (involving similar to 12,000 properties and similar to 39,000 inhabitants), but this increased to 6% in 2015-2020 (similar to 25,600 properties, similar to 85,200 inhabitants). The evidence of a subsidence process evolving spatially and temporally highlights the need for continuous updating of hazard information.

AB  - This study examined the impact of curcumin nanomicelles (CNM) supplementation on transitioning ewes and their offspring. Thirty-two crossbred pregnant ewes [Ile-de-France x (Dalagh x Romanov)], confirmed to carry twins, were randomly assigned to a control group (CTRL) or a treatment group receiving 40 mg of CNM per ewe per day. Supplementation began before and continued after delivery. We assessed various parameters, including growth performance, metabolic health, inflammatory markers, hematological profiles, immunoglobulin levels, antioxidant status, and greenhouse gas emissions. CNM supplementation improved growth in both ewes and lambs, consistent with curcumin's known metabolic effects. Significant reductions in inflammatory markers were observed in both ewes and lambs, with decreased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios indicating reduced systemic inflammation. Increased levels of IgG and IgA in both ewes and lambs suggested improved immune competence. Antioxidant biomarkers indicated better management of oxidative stress, with some benefits extended to offspring. CNM had varying effects on methanogen populations and nitrous oxide emissions. It significantly reduced methanogen numbers postpartum, but had no significant effect pre-partum. A slight increase in N2O emissions was observed before delivery, but was not sustained after delivery. These results underscore the complex interactions of metabolic, immunological, and environmental factors influenced by CNM supplementation during the transition period. More research is needed to refine supplementation strategies, evaluate longterm effects, and explore ways to mitigate increased greenhouse gas emissions while preserving health benefits.

AB  - Structural plasticity is critical for the functional diversity of neurons in the brain. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most commonly used model for multiple sclerosis (MS), successfully mimicking its key pathological features (inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss, and gliosis) and clinical symptoms (motor and non -motor dysfunctions). Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of synaptic plasticity in EAE pathogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the features of behavioral alteration and hippocampal structural plasticity in EAE-affected mice in the early phase (11 days post -immunization, DPI) and chronic phase (28 DPI). EAE-affected mice exhibited hippocampus-related behavioral dysfunction in the open field test during both early and chronic phases. Dendritic complexity was largely affected in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) and CA3 apical and dentate gyrus (DG) subregions of the hippocampus during the chronic phase, while this effect was only noted in the CA1 apical subregion in the early phase. Moreover, dendritic spine density was reduced in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 apical/basal and DG subregions in the early phase of EAE, but only reduced in the DG subregion during the chronic phase. Furthermore, mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (Il1 beta, Tnf alpha, and Ifn gamma) and glial cell markers (Gfap and Cd68) were significantly increased, whereas the expression of activity -regulated cytoskeletonassociated protein (ARC) was reduced during the chronic phase. Similarly, exposure to the aforementioned cytokines in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons reduced dendritic complexity and ARC expression. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons also showed significantly reduced extracellular signal -regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation upon treatment with proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these results suggest that autoimmune neuroinflammation alters structural plasticity in the hippocampus, possibly through the ERK-ARC pathway, indicating that this alteration may be associated with hippocampal dysfunctions in EAE.

AB  - Insulin of pancreatic origin enters the brain where several regions express a high density of insulin receptors. Functional studies of brain insulin signaling have focused predominantly on hypothalamic regulation of appetite and hippocampal regulation of learning. Recent studies point to involvement of nucleus accumbens (NAc) insulin signaling in a diet-sensitive response to glucose intake and reinforcement of flavor-nutrient learning. The present study used NAc shell microinjection of an insulin inactivating antibody (InsAb) to evaluate effects on the microstructure of licking for flavored 6.1% glucose. In both male and female rats, InsAb had no effect on the number of lick bursts emitted (a measure of motivation and/or satiety), but decreased the size of lick bursts (a measure of reward magnitude) in a series of five 30 min test sessions. This effect persisted beyond microinjection test sessions and was shown to depend on previous flavored glucose consumption under InsAb treatment rather than InsAb treatment alone. This suggests learning of diminished reward value and aligns with the previous finding that InsAb blocks flavor-nutrient learning. Specificity of the InsAb effect for nutrient reward was indicated by failure to affect any parameter of licking for flavored 0.25% saccharin solution. Finally, maintenance of rats on a 'Western' diet for twelve weeks produced a decrease in lick burst size for glucose in male rats, but an increase in lick burst size in females. Possible implications of these results for flavor-nutrient learning, maladaptive consequences of NAc insulin receptor subsensitivity, and the plausible involvement of distinct insulin regulated mechanisms in NAc are discussed.

AB  - During buzz pollination, bees use vibrations to remove pollen from flowers. Vibrations at the natural frequency of pollen-carrying stamens are amplified through resonance, resulting in higher amplitude vibrations. Because pollen release depends on vibration amplitude, bees could increase pollen removal by vibrating at the natural frequency of stamens. However, few studies have characterized the natural frequencies of stamens and compared them to the frequencies of buzz-pollinating bees. We use laser Doppler vibrometry to characterize natural frequencies of stamens of six morphologically diverse, buzz-pollinated, heterantherous Solanum taxa and compare the frequency of bumblebee buzzes produced on two Solanum spp. with different natural frequencies. We found that stamen morphology and plant identity explain variation in their natural frequency. The natural frequencies of the stamens in the studied Solanum taxa fell between 45 and 295 Hz; in five out of six taxa the frequencies were < 190 Hz, which only partly overlaps floral vibrations of buzz-pollinating bees. We show that captive bumblebees produce vibrations at a frequency of 345 Hz and do not change their floral vibrations to match the natural frequency of the visited flowers. Our results suggest that pollen release induced by vibrating stamens at their natural frequencies might only play a role in a subset of buzz pollination interactions.

AB  - Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) marks the critical transition from reliance on maternal transcripts to the initiation of embryonic transcription early in development. Despite extensive characterization in model species, the regulatory framework of ZGA in sheep remains poorly defined. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (Smart-seq2) to in vivo- and in vitro-derived sheep embryos at the 8-, 16-, and 32-cell stages. Differential expression analysis revealed 114, 1628, and 1465 genes altered in the 8- vs. 16-, 16- vs. 32-, and 8- vs. 32-cell transitions, respectively, with the core pluripotency factors SOX2, NANOG, POU5F1, and KLF4 upregulated during major ZGA. To uncover coordinated regulatory modules, we constructed a weighted gene co-expression network using WGCNA, identifying the MEred module as most tightly correlated with developmental progression (r = 0.48, p = 8.6 x 10-14). The integration of MERed genes into the STRING v11 protein-protein interaction network furnished a high-confidence scaffold for community detection. Louvain partitioning delineated two discrete communities: Community 0 was enriched in ER-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, transmembrane transport, and cytoskeletal dynamics, suggesting roles in membrane protein processing, secretion, and early signaling; Community 1 was enriched in G2/M cell-cycle transition and RNA splicing/processing, indicating a coordinated network for accurate post-ZGA cell division and transcript maturation. Together, these integrated analyses reveal a modular regulatory architecture underlying sheep ZGA and provide a framework for dissecting early embryonic development in this species.

AB  - Simple Summary Phenotypic variability within and between populations can be assessed using morphometric traits. Therefore, this study investigated morphological differences between different goat populations in two distinct agroecological zones of Burkina Faso. Based on 18 linear body measurements and body weight of the 511 adult female animals sampled, no strict distinction was found between the two populations, meaning that these populations are genetically close. Based on body size, four groups were identified representing the two main breeds expected in these areas (Djallonke and Mossi), their crosses, and the crossbred between Mossi type and the third main breed (Sahelian type) of the country. These different goat morphotypes are the results of farmers breeding practices, specifically uncontrolled mating but also intentional crossbreeding in the search for traits of interest. In Burkina Faso, goats are the second most numerous ruminant livestock population, with almost exclusively indigenous breeds being reared in extensive production systems in various agroecological zones. This study was carried out to understand the morphological variation of local goat breeds in the Sudano-Sahelian and Sudanian agroecological zones. A total of 511 adult female animals belonging to two presumed populations (Mossi breed in Sudano-Sahelian zone and Djallonke breed in Sudanian zone) were sampled and body weight as well as a range of linear body measurements, following FAO guidelines, were recorded. The least squares means of body measurements of indicated that Sudano-Sahelian goats have significantly (p < 0.001) larger body measurements than Sudanian goats. Furthermore, relative high variability of the two populations in morphometric traits was observed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) suggested structure between Mossi breed on one side and Djallonke on the other side, but no strict separation was observed, suggesting that gene flow is occurring among the different populations. A dispersion map with four clusters was built based on the first two factors. The least square means of body measurements ranked the four groups from small to large body size, namely Djallonke, Mossi x Djallonke, Mossi, and Sahelian x Mossi. Gene flow from Sahelian goat into other populations of the country, based on migration of the Fulani ethnic group from the Sahel into areas with Mossi and Djallonke breeds, could explain this configuration and confirms the continuous erosion of genetic identity of these two local breeds. The sustainable use of these adapted local goat genetic resources calls for the promotion of sustainable genetic improvement using participatory breeding approaches.

AB  - Sustainable, effective management of crapemyrtle bark scale, Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae (Kuwana), a non-native pest from Asia, probably will include biological control. Before this strategy can be implemented it is necessary to examine relative abundance and distribution of arthropod species associated with the scale in the area targeted for biological control. In Texas, crapemyrtle ecology from two varietal groups of crapemyrtle trees (Lagerstroemia spp.) were surveyed in Tarrant and Brazos counties during six consecutive seasons in 2018-2019. A rich arthropod community was discovered. Most common predators were spiders, coccinellids, and chrysopids. Insects of the families Eriococcidae, Aphididae, and Thripidae were common herbivores on Lagerstroemia spp. Insects in the order Psocodea were consistently recovered, and numerous phytophagous and mycophagous mites also were collected. The herbivores constitute a reservoir of alternative prey for generalist predators that also might feed on A. lagerstroemiae. A seasonal Shannon index was calculated at each location. Values differed depending on season and location. A food web was constructed to illustrate direct and indirect effects of predators on A. lagerstroemiae in Texas. This approach is meant to identify gaps in species occurrence and abundance for release of natural enemies that could lead to effective and sustainable biological control. Common biological control agents such as coccinellids and chrysopids were recovered during the course of the survey. Scale predators found in previous studies such as Chilcorus cacti (L.), Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) and Hyperaspis spp. were also found in this study. This was the first study to systematically survey for A. lagerstroemiae parasitoids in the U.S., and no parasitoids of A. lagerstroemiae were recovered. This indicates a classical biological control program featuring non-native parasitoid introductions is worth investigating.

AB  - Junegrass (Koeleria macrantha (Ledeb.) Schult.) is a cool-season wheatgrass fodder plant whose vegetative form grows during early spring in the rangelands of Turkey. Due to their natural growth in dry pastures, especially in sheep grazing meadows, it has shown great potential to support the breeding of pastures in these rangelands. For this study, junegrass seeds have been collected from 47 different locations of the KOP region in 2015. In 2017 and 2018, an experiment was conducted in the greenhouse of the Department of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, where collected seeds were grown. Leaf length, leaf width, leaf color, the number of the tiller, bunch diameter, and hay yield of all the experimental genotypes were determined as part of the morphological parameters. The KC-17 population had the maximum leaf length of 11.87 cm whereas the KC-43 population had the maximum leaf width (i.e. 2.60 mm). In the molecular part, the genetic distance amongst populations according to the ISSR based dendrogram was between 0.61 and 0.87. It was determined that the KC-1 and KC-2 populations showed a large genetic similarity. The KC-18 and FR populations were connected externally to the dendrograms and were found to have a closer genetic relationship with the KC-45 population. When comparing the morphological and molecular dendrograms, there was a clear difference between the two. The results obtained from this preliminary study on phenotypic and molecular characterization of junegrass genotypes are beneficial for the further improvement of the species as an important forage crop for Turkish rangelands.

AB  - Cherry laurel is one of the most important cherry species and naturally grown in Black sea region in Turkey. Its fruits are sold at high price in local markets in northern parts of Turkey. Cherry laurel fruits are very perishable with a limited shelf life due to a high metabolic activity and susceptibility to mechanical damage and microbial attack. The effect of edible coatings (EC) based on caseinat, Semperfresh and lecithin on the fruit quality, bioactive content and antioxidant activity of cherry laurel fruits stored at 4 +/- 1 degrees C for 15 days was evaluated. The EC fruits compared with uncoated fruits in terms of weight loss, brix, color, pH, titratable acidity, reducing sugar, total sugar, sucrose, total phenolic content, DPPH-IC50, ABTS-IC50, total yeast-mold count, number of total mesophilic aerobic bacteria and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). Results showed that Semperfresh coating was more promising on titratable acidity (0.26%), pH (4.63), invert sugar (11.77 g/100 g), total sugar (11.96 g/100 g) and sucrose (0.13 g/100 g), caseinat coating was found more promising for count of total yeast-mold count (2.93 log kob/g) and total mesophilic aerobic bacteria (3.44 log kob/g) and lecithin coating was more promising in terms of weight loss (6.77%). For radical scavenging activity and total phenolic content, Semperfresh was found more useful. Thus, caseinat, Semperfresh and lecithin showed to be a promising alternative in prolonging shelf life and preserving the quality of cherry laurel.

The few available phylogenetic analyses indicate that some genera are not monophyletic and that species richness in the group is underestimated. One genus that presents both problems are the stocky and short-legged dwarf deer, Pudu. As currently understood, it includes 2 species, the Northern pudu, Pudu mephistophiles from Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia; and the Southern pudu, P. puda, from southern Chile and nearby Argentina. Here, by means of qualitative and quantitative morphologic analysis and the assessment of genetic variation, we showed that 2 distinct species are encompassed by the current concept of P. mephistophiles. The typical form distributes north of the Huancabamba Depression from northernmost Peru to the north (Ecuador and Colombia), while the other distributes south of the Huancabamba Depression and is a Peruvian endemic. As no name is available for the last one, we describe and name it here. This is the first living cervid species described in the 21st century and the first from the New World in over 60 years. Additionally, as the Southern Pudu (the type species of Pudu) is not sister to the 2 northern pudu species, we revalidate the genus Pudella to allocate the latter 2 species.
   Here, we describe a new species of stocky and short-legged pudu from the Peruvian Andes. This is the first cervid species described in the 21st century and the first from the New World in over 60 years. Additionally, we revalidate the genus Pudella to allocate the new species and its sister species P. mephistophila.
   Distintos aspectos de la sistematica y taxonomia de la tribu de ciervos neotropicales Odocoileini, que incluye un conjunto de 18 especies vivas reconocidas actualmente que se engloban en siete generos, siguen sin estar resueltos. Los pocos analisis filogeneticos disponibles indican que algunos generos no son monofileticos y que la riqueza del grupo esta subestimada. Uno de los generos que presenta ambos problemas es el genero de ciervos pequenos y patas cortas Pudu. Con base en la clasificacion actual, este incluye dos especies, Pudu mephistophiles distribuido en Peru, Ecuador y Colombia y P. puda distribuido en el sur de Chile y areas cercanas de Argentina. Este estudio mediante analisis morfologicos cualitativo y cuantitativo y la evaluacion de la variacion genetica, muestra que el concepto actual de P. mephistophiles engloba a dos especies distintas. La forma tipica se distribuye al norte de la Depresion de Huancabamba desde el extremo norte de Peru hacia el norte (Ecuador y Colombia), mientras que la segunda se distribuye al sur de la Depresion de Huancabamba y es endemica de Peru. Como no hay nombre disponible para esta ultima, aqui la nominamos y describimos formalmente. Esta es la primera especie viviente de cervido descrita en el siglo XXI y la primera del Nuevo Mundo en mas de 60 anos. Ademas, como el pudu del sur (la especie tipo de Pudu) no es hermano de las dos especies de pudu del norte, revalidamos el genero Pudella para colocar a las dos ultimas especies.

AB  - Transportation of live sheep is a relatively important part of the meat sheep industry, and the generation of transportation stress seriously threatens the organism health of live sheep as well as the quality of lamb meat. In this study, we selected Lake sheep, one of the edible sheep breeds, as the meat sheep research object, analyzed the actual needs of meat sheep transportation bio-sensing and modeling evaluation, and built a systematic bio-signal detection, processing and modeling method from bio-signal sensing, core waveform extraction to feature parameter estimation using wearable meat sheep physiological dynamic sensing and continuous monitoring of transportation environment sensors, and used modern spectrum estimation methods to judge and strip the target signal waveform from it to achieve accurate sensing and acquisition of transport key parameters. We also use modern spectral estimation methods to determine and extract the target signal waveforms from them, and achieve accurate sensing and acquisition of transport key parameters. Based on this, a qualitative stress assessment method based on external performance and a graded prediction model for transportation stress of meat sheep are constructed, and a predictive analysis and estimation management mechanism of stress level based on genetic algorithm optimized reverse artificial neural network is realized. Using a qualitative stress assessment method based on external manifestations, we established stage-specific classification rules for monitoring data in the transportation environment of meat sheep.The artificial neural network with optimized parameters based on the classification rules applying genetic algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time and efficient stress level prediction management mechanism for meat sheep transportation. The graded prediction model of meat sheep transportation stress was established by GA-BPNN and compared with the BP neural network optimized by particle swarm algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm and ant colony algorithm. The best optimization effect of GA was obtained, and the average prediction accuracy of the model could reach 89.81%. Finally, it achieves to improve the transportation reliability, reduce the transportation risk, and solve the problems of inefficient meat sheep transportation supervision and quality control.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep predation by wild dogs has serious production and animal welfare implications. By monitoring changes in the behaviour of sheep, on-animal sensors are an option for detecting wild dogs and alerting producers to their presence. This study identified differences in the daily distance travelled of sheep when in the presence and absence of a wild dog and highlights the potential for on-animal sensors to be used as a monitoring and management tool for wild dog detection. In Australia, wild dogs are one of the leading causes of sheep losses. A major problem with managing wild dogs in Australia's rangeland environments is that sheep producers are often unaware of their presence until injuries or deaths are observed. One option for earlier detection of wild dogs is on-animal sensors, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking collars, to detect changes in the behaviour of sheep due to the presence of wild dogs. The current study used spatio-temporal data, derived from GPS tracking collars, deployed on sheep from a single rangeland property to determine if there were differences in the behaviour of sheep when in the presence, or absence, of a wild dog. Results indicated that the presence of a wild dog influenced the daily behaviours of sheep by increasing the daily distance travelled. Differences in sheep diurnal activity were also observed during periods where a wild dog was present or absent on the property. These results highlight the potential for on-animal sensors to be used as a monitoring tool for sheep flocks directly impacted by wild dogs, although further work is needed to determine the applicability of these results to other sheep production regions of Australia.

AB  - Simple Summary Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan parasite with worldwide distribution, infecting cattle, goats and other kinds of warm-blooded animals. However, specific medicines for the prevention or treatment of Neospora caninum are still limited. This study is aimed at selecting a potential immunoprotective antigen of N. caninum and evaluating the adjuvant function of interleukin (IL)-18 in mice or goats; NcSRS2, NcSRS17 and NcSRS52 from the SRS superfamily were considered to be targets. The results reveal that the recombinant proteins NcSRS2, NcSRS17 and NcSRS52 can all induce humoral and cellular immune responses, and NcSRS17 showed itself to be a promising new antigen candidate. IL-18 had a certain immunoenhancing effect in both experimental animal mice and intermediate host goats and could be used as an adjuvant. Neosporosis is caused by Neospora caninum (N. caninum), which mainly infects cattle and goats and severely threatens the animal industry. In this study, the inhibitory effects of polyclonal antiserum anti-NcSRS17, NcSRS2 and NcSRS52 were explored. Cytokines in mice or goat serum were detected after immunization. After infection, the survival of mice was recorded. The pathological changes and parasite loads were observed and detected in tissues. The results showed that anti-NcSRS2, NcSRS17 and NcSRS52 antibodies all inhibit the invasion and proliferation of N. caninum. The IFN-gamma level in the NcSRS17 group was higher than that in the NcSRS2 and NcSRS52 groups, and higher in the NcSRS2-mIL-18 group than in the NcSRS2 group. The survival rates of mice were 16% in the positive control group, 67% in the SRS52 group, 83% in the SRS2 and mIL-18 groups and 100% in the SRS17 and SRS2-mIL-18 groups. Goats immunized with NcSRS17-gIL-18 developed high levels of IL-4, IL-12 and IFN-gamma compared with those immunized with NcSRS-17. Parasite loads in the brains of animals in the NcSRS17 and NcSRS17-gIL-18 groups were significantly reduced, and were significantly lower in the NcSRS17-gIL-18 group (p <= 0.01). This study indicates that SRS17 may be an antigen candidate for vaccine development against neosporosis, and IL-18 can enhance the immune protective efficiency of antigen candidates.

AB  - BACKGROUND Nursing mom can regulate the gut microbiome succession in offspring. However, it remains unclear whether these effects are long-term and what effect it has on the growth performance of piglets. This study aimed to develop a cross-fostering model of piglets and investigate the effect of maternal environment on gut microbiota, even the growth performance of the offspring, and if this effect could be maintained in the long term. RESULTS Four groups of piglets were generated as follows (n = 12): Duroc piglets nursed by their birth mom (Dd) or Yorkshire sows (Yd), Yorkshire piglets nursed by Duroc sows (Dy) or their birth mom (Yy). The study found that cross-fostering improved the growth performance of piglets for a long time. The gut microbiota of piglets was mainly determined by the breeds of nursing moms before weaning, and it was more and more influenced by their breeds after weaning, but the influence of birth mom breeds still existed. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis and Spearman correlation analysis showed that Sutterella, Butyricimonas and Alistipes, which were affected by nursing mom before weaning, had a strong positive correlation with the growth performance of piglets before weaning. Candidatus_Soleaferrea and Treponema, which were affected by both nursing mom and piglet breed after weaning, were significantly negatively correlated with the growth performance of piglets long after weaning. CONCLUSION Our results revealed that both the breeds of piglets and their birth moms influence the gut microbiota of piglets for a long time, even after weaning. Additionally, this effect might be related to the growth performance of piglets. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Simple Summary The manipulation of ruminal ecology and fermentation to improve feed efficiency and reduce nitrogen excretion in ruminants is a pertinent goal for animal nutritionists. The fruits of Terminalia chebula Retz. are a rich source of phytonutrient compounds, which are attractive as rumen modifiers since these compounds are natural substances. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Terminalia chebula meal (TCM) supplementation on digestibility, rumen fermentation, nitrogen utilization, and protozoal population in goats. The findings indicated that the inclusion of TCM could improve rumen fermentation efficiency and N balance while reducing the protozoal population. As a result, TCM could be used as a plant source for the rumen enhancement of small ruminants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Terminalia chebula meal (TCM) supplementation on digestibility, rumen fermentation, nitrogen utilization, and protozoal population in goats. Eight goats with an initial body weight (BW) of 13 +/- 3.0 kg were randomly assigned according to a double 4 x 4 Latin square design to receive different levels of TCM supplementation at 0, 8, 16, and 24 g/kg of total dry matter (DM) intake, respectively. The goats were fed with concentrate diets at 13 g/kg BW, while rice straw was used as a roughage source, fed ad libitum. The results revealed that the feed intake and the apparent digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were similar among the treatments (p > 0.05). However, crude protein (CP) digestibility decreased significantly (p < 0.05) when supplemented with TCM at 24 g/kg of total DM intake (p < 0.05). The addition of TCM did not change the ruminal pH and blood urea nitrogen concentrations (p > 0.05), whereas the concentration of NH3-N at 4 h post feeding was reduced with the inclusion of TCM at 16 and 24 g/kg of total DM intake. The total numbers of bacteria were enhanced by the addition of TCM, while the protozoal population, in both entodiniomorph and holotrich, was reduced (p < 0.05). The supplementation of TCM did not change the concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA), acetic acid, or butyric acid, while the propionic acid concentration at 4-h post feeding increased significantly, especially when supplemented at 16 g/kg of total DM intake (p < 0.05. In addition, urinary nitrogen (N) excretion decreased, while fecal N excretion, N absorption, N retention, and the proportion of N retention to N intake increased with the inclusion of TCM at all levels. In summary, the inclusion of TCM could improve rumen fermentation efficiency and N balance without having an adverse effect on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and rumen ecology; however, the protozoal population decreased. Therefore, this study suggests that TCM (16 g/kg of total DM intake) could be used as a plant source for rumen enhancement in goats fed a diet based on rice straw without having an adverse effect on feed intake or nutrient digestion. However, further studies on the production of types of meat and milk that have a long-term feeding trial should be carried out.

AB  - Different floral traits mediate interactions between plants and their visitors. Capitates Glandular Trichomes (CGT) can attract or repel visitors, particularly arthropods. In Helianthus annuus L., CGTs are located at the distal ends of the anther appendages. This study aimed to determine whether the presence of CGTs influences the behaviour of diurnal floral visitors under field conditions by comparing genotypes with high and low CGT density per anther, while maintaining similar phenotypic characteristics. The analysis accounted for three random variables-floral developmental stages (R5.3, R5.6, and R6), daytime ranges (morning, midday, and afternoon), and two flowering seasons- to better understand variations in CGT mediated floral arthropod interactions. Key recorded species included Astylus atromaculatus (Blanchard) (Coleoptera Melyridae), Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera Apidae), and species from the Thomisidae family representing herbivores, pollinators, and insect-predators, respectively. The genotype with a high CGT density received fewer herbivore visits and more pollinator visits compared with the genotype with a low CGT density. Predators did not exhibit genotype-related differences but reduced bee presence by 20% probably due to Thomisidae spiders preying on bees. Furthermore, the inclusion of random variables enhanced the models. Herbivore abundance varied significantly between flowering seasons, while pollinator abundance fluctuated across the daytime ranges. Both herbivores and pollinators also showed variations in abundance across the reproductive stages, likely influenced by the proportion of disc floret phenophases and the CGTs' secretory stage. This study underscores the importance of CGTs as a key morphological feature with potential implications for plant reproduction, justifying broader, more extensive investigations. It also emphasizes the necessity of considering multiple factors in plant- arthropod interactions research.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic substance that pollutes the environment with multiple organs. Long-term exposure to Cd can cause fibrosis in the lungs and other organs of animal body. This article explored the effects of subacute Cd exposure on pig liver fibrosis, as well as the polarization of microRNA (miRNA) and M1/M2 macrophages during this process. Based on the establishment of the pig subacute CdCl2 exposure model, we used immunofluorescence staining, Masson staining, qRT-PCR and western blotting to conduct further research. The results showed that Cd exposure can increase the expression of miRNA-21, decrease the expression of TGF-beta and SMAD7, increase the expression of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, cause the M1/M2 imbalance and the increase of M1 polarization. Meantime, it causes the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6), and causes an imbalance in the expression of TIMP1, MMP2, and MMP9, which are related to the degree of fibrosis. And the expression of alpha-SMA, COL1 and COL3 were up-regulated. In the pig, these results indicate that liver fibrosis caused by subacute CdCl2 exposure is induced by the M1 polarization of macrophages through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activated by miRNA-21 signaling pathway. These research results not only enrich the theoretical basis and reference value of Cd toxicology research, but also provide new references and new research ideas for comparative medicine.

AB  - ETS1, an important member of the ETS transcription factor family, is involved in a variety of physiological processes in living organisms, such as cell development, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and is thought to be associated with embryonic development and reproduction. However, the polymorphism of ETS1 has been rarely studied, and its potential impact on the formation of reproductive traits in sheep remains unclear. Here, we first analyzed polymorphisms of ETS1 in a population of 382 small-tailed Han sheep with a lambing number record using the Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) technique. The results showed the presence of a SNP locus rs161611767 (T > C) in the 3 & PRIME;UTR of ETS1. The association analysis showed the lambing number of first, second and third parity in the individuals with the CC genotype (2.51 & PLUSMN; 0.108, 2.51 & PLUSMN; 0.179, 1.27 & PLUSMN; 0.196) was higher than that of individuals with the TT genotype (1.79 & PLUSMN; 0.086, 1.56 & PLUSMN; 0.102, 0.56 & PLUSMN; 0.100) (P < 0.05). Then, molecular biotechnologies were used to investigate the effects of the EST1 rs161611767 mutant locus on host gene expression in sheep and the underlying mechanism of its effect on sheep reproduction. The RT-qPCR results showed that the expression of ETS1 was higher in individuals with the CC genotype than in those with the TT genotype (P < 0.05). The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the luciferase activity of ETS1 in sheep with the TT genotype was decreased compared to CC genotype (P < 0.05), confirming the existence of EST1 rs161611767 in the 3 & PRIME;UTR as a functional SNP. Given that the 3 & PRIME;UTR is an important regulatory region of gene transcription and translation, we performed bioinformatics prediction and confirmed that the SNP rs161611767 of ETS1 was a direct functional target of miR-216a-3p using dual luciferase activity assay, and the binding ca-pacity of allele T was stronger than that of allele C. Subsequently, the cell transfection results showed that miR-216a-3p suppressed the endogenous expression of ETS1 in sheep primary granulosa cells (GCs). Finally, CCK-8, EdU, WB detection of marker proteins and flow cytometry were used to detect the effects of miR-216a-3p on GCs viability and proliferation/apoptosis, respectively. The results showed that miR-216a-3p inhibited the prolifer-ation of GCs while promoting apoptosis of GCs. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the SNP rs161611767 of ETS1 is associated with lambing number in small-tailed Han sheep, and miR-216a-3p can act as a regulatory element binding to the T mutation in rs161611767 to regulate ETS1 expression and affect GCs development, which may indirectly affect the number of lambs in sheep. These studies provide evidence for the involvement of ETS1 polymorphisms in sheep reproduction and are expected to provide new insights to elucidate the molecular genetic mechanisms of lambing traits in sheep.

AB  - Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is an emblematic species with several recognized subspecies. Two reindeer subspecies are present in Norway: the wild and semi-domestic European tundra reindeer (R. tarandus tarandus) in continental Norway, and Svalbard reindeer (R. tarandus platyrhynchus) endemic to this archipelago. The main aim of this paper is to give a descriptive and quantified analysis of the modern wild reindeer morphological diversity. The morphometric variation was quantified, based on 262 adult specimens of both sexes, by both linear measurements, analysed through log shape ratio computed from post-cranial bones and teeth measurements, and landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks based geometric morphometrics (GMM) to quantify molars size and shape. All anatomical parts (teeth, metatarsals, metacarpals) highlighted differences between the continental and insular subspecies. Our main results pointed out morphometrics characteristics of nowadays reindeer subspecies, like differences in proportions between the size of metapodials or lower cheek teeth with the body size, that could be of great interest for archaeozoological research.

AB  - Invasive mammalian herbivores can have significant unwanted impacts on indigenous ecosystems and production landscapes. Their impacts are often mitigated using sustained lethal control or eradication. If eradication is the chosen option, it is critical to confirm where the pest population is distributed and prove that eradication has been achieved following the removal intervention. This form of pest management requires robust and quantitative estimates of surveillance. We compared the detection probabilities, derived surveillance system sensitivities (under standardized conditions), and cost of surveillance for four survey methods for invasive Bennett's wallabies (Notamacropus rufogriseus) in South Island, New Zealand: helicopter surveys with observers, helicopter surveys using a thermal imaging camera, a ground hunter with detector dogs, and camera traps. We found camera traps and ground hunters with dogs were the most sensitive surveillance methods (82% and 45% chance of detecting a wallaby assuming full search coverage of a 100-ha area, respectively) and were most cost-effective (62% and 85% cheaper than helicopter surveys with observers, respectively). However, although these methods are useful for surveying small areas (similar to 1000 ha or less), capacity and time issues make them impractical for surveying large areas. The helicopter-based methods will likely be more suitable for monitoring large areas (e.g., 10,000-50,000 ha) that need to be completed more rapidly than could be achieved using ground-based methods. The model that we used for evaluating detection probability and surveillance sensitivity for different survey methods is highly applicable for managing a wide range of mammalian pests and confidently declaring their absence from an area.

AB  - Triclosan (TCS) is a highly effective broad-spectrum antibacterial agent; however, the specific roles of TCS in oocyte maturation remain poorly understood. This research investigated the influence of TCS on biologically active processes during the in vitro maturation of porcine oocytes. Our results demonstrated that TCS significantly decreased the maturation rate of porcine oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner and impaired cumulus expansion. These detrimental effects were mediated by the disruption of mitochondrial function and distribution, leading to oxidative stress characterized by an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a decrease in the expression of the antioxidant enzymes SOD2 and GSH, reduced ATP production, and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m). We also observed interference with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) distribution, disturbances in Ca2+ homeostasis, and fluctuations in ER stress, as evidenced by reduced expression of ER stress-related proteins. Furthermore, TCS exposure induced autophagy, as indicated by the levels of SQSTM1 (P62) and LC3-II. Additionally, TCS increased apoptosis rates, corresponding with a downregulation of Bcl-2 expression. Collectively, our findings suggest that exposure to TCS can impair cytoplasmic function, thereby affecting oocyte quality.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution in soil can impact the relationships between plants and their natural enemies. Enemy attack from herbivores and pathogens is predicted to be lower in metal-contaminated areas such as mine sites. However, whether this is the case is remains to be tested. It is also unknown how defense traits differ in polluted sites compared to adjacent sites. To address this gap in knowledge, we compared the standing leaf damage in populations of two invasive and five native plant species at the abandoned Jiuhua copper mine and an adjacent site. We also compared physical and chemical defense traits of the populations. Herbivory on four plant species was significantly lower in a copper mine than in an adjacent site. Overall, plants growing in the mine were more physically and chemically defended than plants growing adjacent to the mine. Copper hyperaccumulator species (Cynodon dactylon and Kummerowia stipulacea) increased defense levels in the mine for only one of the traits. In contrast, defenses were higher in the mine site for most traits relative to their respective adjacent populations in the non-hyperaccumulator species. Our results suggest that the damage herbivores inflict on plants may be strongly influenced by how plants respond to stressors in mine site environments, such as metal pollution. Metal hyperaccumulation and increased non-elemental defenses may be alternate responses used by plants to simultaneously deal with metal pollution and natural enemies in contaminated sites.

AB  - This study presents an evaluation of seventeen newly produced recombinant trivalent chimeric proteins (containing the same immunodominant fragment of SAG1 and SAG2 of Toxoplasma gondii antigens, and an additional immunodominant fragment of one of the parasite antigens, such as AMA1, GRA1, GRA2, GRA5, GRA6, GRA7, GRA9, LDH2, MAG1, MIC1, MIC3, P35, and ROP1) as a potential alternative to the whole-cell tachyzoite lysate (TLA) used in the detection of infection in small ruminants. These recombinant proteins, obtained by genetic engineering and molecular biology methods, were tested for their reactivity with specific anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies contained in serum samples of small ruminants (192 samples of sheep serum and 95 samples of goat serum) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The reactivity of six recombinant trivalent chimeric proteins (SAG1-SAG2-GRA5, SAG1-SAG2-GRA9, SAG1-SAG2-MIC1, SAG1-SAG2-MIC3, SAG1-SAG2-P35, and SAG1-SAG2-ROP1) with IgG antibodies generated during T. gondii invasion was comparable to the sensitivity of TLA-based IgG ELISA (100%). The obtained results show a strong correlation with the results obtained for TLA. This suggests that these protein preparations may be a potential alternative to TLA used in commercial tests and could be used to develop a cheaper test for the detection of parasite infection in small ruminants.

AB  - Chronic stress can affect brain function through various mechanisms, leading to the development of anxiety disorders. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is a classic model of chronic stress. This study evaluated the effects of different durations of CUMS on anxiety-like behavior, inflammation, and tryptophan metabolism in C57BL/6N mice. The results of behavioral assessments showed that after 3 and 4 weeks of CUMS exposure, the mice exhibited significant decreases in open arms ratio and time ratio in the elevated plus maze (EPM), prolonged latency in the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT), and reduced transitions in the light/dark box (LDB), all indicative of anxiety-like behavior. The inflammatory factors expressions were quantified using qPCR, showing that pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers began to rise following 1-2 weeks of CUMS exposure. After 3 weeks of stress, TNF-alpha significantly increased, TGF-beta levels started to decrease, and by 4 weeks of CUMS, Arg-1 expression also declined. In terms of tryptophan metabolism, 5-HT content in the hippocampus of the mice began to decrease after 3 weeks of CUMS, while the levels of neuroprotective kynurenic acid (KYNA) continued to rise. Concurrently, neurotoxic substances, including 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and quinolinic acid (QA), accumulated; after 4 weeks of CUMS, the KYNA content also started to decline. In conclusion, CUMS exposure for 3-4 weeks in male C57BL/6 N mice induces anxiety-like behavior alongside the occurrence of inflammatory responses and disturbances in tryptophan metabolism. These findings highlight the complex interplay between stress, inflammation, and metabolic pathways in the etiology of anxiety-related behaviors.

AB  - The balanced application of organic and chemical fertilizers is essential for maintaining soil fertility and crop productivity. To optimize nitrogen (N) balance and maize yield through integrated pig slurry and straw mulching management, a split-plot field experiment was conducted in Northeast China. The study included two straw treatments (straw mulching, S; no straw, NS) and three substitution levels of pig slurry for chemical fertilizer (0%, 20%, and 40%; denoted as M0, M20, and M40). Parameters evaluated included N balance, maize biomass, soil available N, and the mineral N to TN ratio (mineral-N/TN), measured across 0-100 cm at key maize growth stages. Results showed that pig slurry substitution significantly increased soil DON, mineral N, and mineral-N/TN in the topsoil (0-20 cm) at the maize seeding stage and decreased mineral-N/TN at the maize milk (10-40 cm) and maturity (80-100 cm) stages. Meanwhile, straw mulching reduced NH4+-N accumulation in the 0-10 cm of topsoil at the seeding stage, decreased NO3--N in the 0-40 cm soil layer from the jointing to maturity stages, and lowered the mineral-N/TN ratio in the topsoil, thereby mitigating the risk of N leaching. Notably, the combination of pig slurry substitution and straw mulching slightly increased DON and NO3--N in the topsoil while significantly reducing the mineral-N/TN in the deep soil layer at the seeding and milk stages. Pig slurry substitution significantly improved maize yield, N uptake, and N use efficiency (NUE). The highest maize yield (14,628 kg ha-1) was observed in the S-M20 treatment, representing a 19% increase compared to NS-M0. N balance analysis indicated that pig slurry substitution alone increased maize yield and N uptake but depleted soil N, whereas straw mulching maintained N surplus. The findings highlight that combining pig slurry with straw mulching optimizes soil N availability and improves sustainable N management and crop productivity in agroecosystems.

AB  - As primary producers, plants play a central role in mediating interactions across trophic levels. Although plants are the primary food source for herbivorous insects, they can protect themselves from herbivore damage. Many plants produce toxic compounds that directly reduce herbivore feeding, but plants also protect themselves indirectly by attracting natural enemies of the attacking herbivore through volatile signaling. These so-called tritrophic interactions have historically been documented aboveground in aerial plant parts but are also known to occur belowground in root systems. In addition to herbivores, plants directly interact with other organisms, which can influence the outcomes of tri-trophic interactions. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are symbiotic soil microbes that colonize the roots of plants and facilitate nutrient uptake. These microbes can alter plant chemistry and subsequent resistance to herbivores. Few studies, however, have shown how AMF affect tri-trophic interactions above- or belowground. This study examines how AMF colonization affects the emission of root volatiles when plants are under attack by western corn rootworm, a problematic pest of corn, and subsequent attraction of entomopathogenic nematodes, a natural enemy of western corn rootworm. Mycorrhizal fungi increased rootworm survival but decreased larval weight. Differences were detected across root volatile profiles, but there was not a clear link between volatile signaling and nematode behavior. Nematodes were more attracted to non-mycorrhizal plants without rootworms and AMF alone in soil, suggesting that AMF may interfere with cues that are used in combination with volatiles which nematodes use to locate prey.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many physiological processes such as signal transduction, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Many studies have shown that miRNAs can regulate the process of follicular development. Our previous studies found that the expression of miR-29c-5p in buffalo atretic follicles was much higher than that in healthy follicles, suggesting that this miRNA may participate in the process of buffalo follicular atresia. In this study, we aim to explore to the role and molecular mechanisms of miR-29c-5p on the functions of buffalo granulosa cells (GCs). GCs cultured in vitro were transfected with miR-29c-5p mimics and its inhibitor, respectively, and it was found that the mimics significantly increased the apoptotic rate of GCs. They also inhibited the proliferation of GCs and the secretion of steroid hormones. The effect of the inhibitor was opposite to that of the mimics. MiR-29c-5p was subsequently shown to target the inhibin subunit beta A, (INHBA). Overexpression of INHBA could promote the production of activin A and inhibin A, and then reverse the effect of miR-29c-5p on buffalo GCs. In conclusion, these results suggest that miR-29c-5p promotes apoptosis and inhibits proliferation and steroidogenesis by targeting INHBA in buffalo GCs. This may ultimately promote atresia in buffalo follicles.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Selenium (Se)-enriched habitats have led to chronic selenosis, seriously affecting the health and survival of Procapra przewalskii (P. przewalskii). Our targets were to explore the molecular mechanisms of chronic selenosis and to look for a new way to protect endangered species. The mineral contents of soils, grass, blood, and muscle were analyzed. The biochemical indices, antioxidant capability, and immune function were also investigated. The analyses of proteomics and metabolomics were also carried out. The results showed that the Se contents in the muscle and blood of P. przewalskii, and the soil and grass in the Se-enriched habitats were significantly higher than those in healthy pastures. The P. przewalskii in the Se-enriched habitats showed symptoms of anemia, decreased antioxidant capability, and low immune function. A total of 44 differential proteins and 36 differential metabolites were screened by analyzing their proteomics and metabolomics. These differential proteins and metabolites were involved in glycolysis pathway, amino acid biosynthesis, carbon metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and energy metabolism. In particular, phenylalanine metabolism was the common pathway of proteomics and metabolomics, which was an important finding in studying the mechanism of chronic selenosis in animals. This study will help us to further understand the mechanism of chronic selenosis in P. przewalskii, and it provides a scientific basis for the protection of endangered species in Se-enriched habitats.

AB  - Camphor oil (EO) and its main component (i.e. d-camphor) form specific terpenoid defences in camphor trees, Cinnamomum camphora. However, an emerging insect pest, Pagiophloeus tsushimanus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) has recently caused serious damage to this intractable plant species, which is largely elusive. To investigate the mechanism underlying the tolerance of this weevil to host-specific terpenoid defences, we carried out the bioassays, RNA-seq, and RT-qPCR analysis based on a simulated diet environment with EO or d-camphor exposure. First, a hormetic response (a highly generalized dose-response phenomenon in toxicology) in the larval overall performance was observed in terpenoid-feeding individuals. Then, genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and cuticular protein (CP) were induced by both EO and d-camphor exposures using comparative transcriptome, suggesting that this weevil could deploy the dual mechanism (i.e. CYP450-mediated metabolic resistance and CP-mediated cuticular resistance) to counter host terpenoid defences. Furthermore, temporal expression of CYP450 and CP genes under a low dose of d-camphor exposure indicated that there was a trade-off relationship between the inductions of CYP450 and CP genes. We speculate that the dual mechanism of terpenoid tolerance in this specialist is an essential precondition for the hormetic response in larval growth and development, ultimately contributing to its successful colonization on camphor trees. Additionally, we found a few genes related to glucose transport, juvenile hormone, and odorant binding were fine-tuned under terpenoid exposures. Taken together, our study will open new avenues for understanding insect-plant coevolutionary adaptation and developing durable control strategies for this insect pest.

AB  - Simple Summary The milk production traits of goats are economically important. In the Czech Republic, goat milk is processed directly on farms and distributed as cheese. Although goat breeding is not a main focus of animal production in the Czech Republic, it is essential for the agricultural sector. A group of 14 SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) within four candidate genes (ACACA, BTN1A1, LPL, and SCD) were analysed in two Czech dairy goat breeds, White Shorthaired (WSH) goats and Brown Shorthaired (BSH) goats. The SNPs were significantly associated with milk-production traits (daily milk yield, protein, and fat percentage) and somatic cell count. This information may be useful for marker-assisted selection or related techniques to increase the accuracy of selection. Milk production is influenced by many factors, including genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Animal health, especially udder health, is usually evaluated by the number of somatic cells. The present study described the effect of polymorphisms in the ACACA, BTN1A1, LPL, and SCD genes on the daily milk yield, fat, and protein percentages and somatic cell count. In this study, 590 White Shorthaired (WSH) and Brown Shorthaired (BSH) goats were included. SNP genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP and multiplex PCR followed by SNaPshot minisequencing analysis. The linear mixed model with repeated measurement was used to identify the genetic associations between the studied genes/SNPs and chosen traits. All selected genes were polymorphic in the tested goat populations and showed significant associations with milk traits. Only BTN1A1 (SNP g.599 A > G) showed a significant association with the somatic cell score. After Bonferroni correction, a significant effect of LPL g.300G > A on daily milk yield and fat percentage, LPL g.185G > T on protein percentage, and LPL G50C, SCD EX3_15G > A, and SCD EX3_68A > G on fat percentage was found. The importance of environmental factors, such as the herd-year effect, month of milking, and lactation order on all milk performance indicators was confirmed.

AB  - Livestock agriculture in sub-Sahara region is the most important industry that represents a considerable portion of the overall GDP of the region. Livestock activities in the region are conducted using traditional methods, and animal production is primarily reliant on the availability of natural forage. This paper introduces a modified mathematical model for plant-herbivore interactions to explore the influence of environmental factors on livestock production. The model incorporates seasonal variation in plant growth rate, and makes use of the soil moisture data obtained from satellite observations for regions with different soil structure and climate. The non-autonomous model is analysed for positivity, as well as for existence and uniqueness of solutions. Additionally, essential threshold values for co-existence are derived.

To validate the results of the mathematical analysis, numerical simulations are executed, and the temporal profiles of plant biomass and livestock density are also presented for benchmark parameters.. The numerical solution of the problem is used to study the plant-livestock interaction dynamics and the corresponding livestock production level under different scenarios. In this regard, the effect of adaptation in dry regions, variation in soil moisture amount, effect of harvest rate at various representative grid-cells are numerically investigated. The study shows that planting and adapting more resilient plant species in relatively dry regions can increase the livestock production in the region. Moreover, an increase in the soil moisture is counter productive in the wet regions, while it favours the regions with medium and dry soil moisture. It is also shown that the yield in livestock production can be managed by carefully selecting the harvest (off-take) rate corresponding to the climatic variations.

AB  - Simple Summary: Infectious disease control in livestock is often motivated by food safety concerns and economic impact. However, most diseases also affect animal welfare. We established an approach to quantify the welfare effect of infectious diseases in cattle (three diseases) and pigs (two diseases). A "suffering score" was established based on the aggregation of severity, duration, and frequency of clinical entities of the diseases. The resulting suffering scores were then used to compare the welfare impact of the different diseases and for comparison to other common welfare hazards. For example, the approach suggested that bovine viral diarrhoea and paratuberculosis are more severe for cattle than infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. In pigs, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome has a much bigger welfare impact than Aujeszky's disease, assuming all diseases remain endemic.<br>Control of infectious diseases in livestock has often been motivated by food safety concerns and the economic impact on livestock production. However, diseases may also affect animal welfare. We present an approach to quantify the effect of five infectious diseases on animal welfare in cattle (three diseases) and pigs (two diseases). We grouped clinical manifestations that often occur together into lists of clinical entities for each disease based on literature reviews, and subsequently estimated "suffering scores" based on an aggregation of duration, frequency, and severity. The duration and severity were based on literature reviews and expert knowledge elicitation, while frequency was based mainly on estimates from the literature. The resulting suffering scores were compared to scores from common welfare hazards found under Danish conditions. Most notably, the suffering scores for cattle diseases were ranked as: bovine viral diarrhoea and infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis > infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and for pigs as: porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome > Aujeszky's disease. The approach has limitations due to the limited data available in literature and uncertainties associated with expert knowledge, but it can provide decision makers with a tool to quantify the impact of infections on animal welfare given these uncertainties.

AB  - Despite the ubiquity of odours in mammals, few studies have documented the natural olfactory abilities of many 'non-model' species such as the Asian elephant. As Asian elephants are endangered, we may apply odours to more effectively manage threatened populations. We implemented a habituation-discrimination paradigm for the first time in Asian elephants to test the ability of elephants to discriminate between unfamiliar male elephant urine, hypothesizing that elephants would successfully distinguish non-musth from musth urine and also distinguish identity between two closely related individuals. We conducted two bioassay series, exposing three female and three male zoo-housed elephants to the same urine sample (non-musth urine in the first series, and urine from an unfamiliar individual in the second) over 5 days. On the sixth day, we simultaneously presented each elephant with a novel sample (either musth urine or urine from a second unfamiliar individual) alongside the habituated urine sample, comparing rates of chemosensory response to each sample to indicate discrimination. All elephants successfully discriminated non-musth from musth urine, and also urine from two unfamiliar half-brothers. Our results further demonstrate the remarkable olfactory abilities of elephants with promising implications for conservation and management.

AB  - Peach-potato aphids, Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera:Aphididae), and cabbage aphids, Brevicoryne brassicae Linnaeus (Hemiptera:Aphididae), are herbivorous insects of significant agricultural importance. Aphids can harbour a range of non-essential (facultative) endosymbiotic bacteria that confer multiple costs and benefits to the host aphid. A key endosymbiont-derived phenotype is protection against parasitoid wasps, and this protective phenotype has been associated with several defensive enodsymbionts. In recent years greater emphasis has been placed on developing alternative pest management strategies, including the increased use of natural enemies such as parasitoids wasps. For the success of aphid control strategies to be estimated the presence of defensive endosymbionts that can potentially disrupt the success of biocontrol agents needs to be determined in natural aphid populations. Here, we sampled aphids and mummies (parasitised aphids) from an important rapeseed production region in Germany and used multiplex PCR assays to characterise the endosymbiont communities. We found that aphids rarely harboured facultative endosymbionts, with 3.6% of M. persicae and 0% of B. brassicae populations forming facultative endosymbiont associations. This is comparable with endosymbiont prevalence described for M. persicae populations surveyed in Australia, Europe, Chile, and USA where endosymbiont infection frequencies range form 0-2%, but is in contrast with observations from China where M. persicae populations have more abundant and diverse endosymbiotic communities (endosymbionts present in over 50% of aphid populations).

AB  - Plants have evolved mechanisms to survive herbivory. One such mechanism is the induction of defences upon attack that can operate intergenerationally. Cool-season grasses (sub-family Pooideae) obtain defences via symbiosis with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes (genus Epichloe) and can also show inducible responses. However, it is unknown whether these herbivore-induced responses can have intergenerational effects. We hypothesized that herbivory by aphids on maternal plants induces the intergenerational accumulation of endophyte-derived defensive alkaloids and resistance intensification in the progeny. We subjected mother plants symbiotic or not with Epichloe occultans, a species known for its production of anti-insect alkaloids known as lolines, to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Then, we evaluated the progeny of these plants in terms of loline alkaloid concentration, resistance level (through herbivore performance), and shoot biomass. Herbivory on mother plants did not increase the concentration of lolines in seeds but it tended to affect loline concentration in progeny plants. There was an overall herbivore-induced intergenerational effect increasing the endophyte-conferred defence and resistance. Symbiotic plants were more resistant to aphids and had higher shoot biomass than their non-symbiotic counterparts. Since maternal herbivory did not affect the loline concentrations in seeds, the greater resistance of the progeny could have resulted from an inherited mechanism of epigenetic regulation. It would be interesting to elucidate the origin of this regulation since it could come from the host or the fungal symbiont. Thus, endophyte-driven differential fitness between symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants might be higher as generations pass on in presence of herbivores.

AB  - Folic acid is vital for DNA synthesis and methylations through one-carbon (C1) metabolism. Thus, it is essential for cell division during embryonic development. Although the oocytes contain endogenous pool of folates for development, the present study investigated the effect of external folic acid supplementation on oocyte maturation, blastocyst development and the expression of folate transporters as well as folate metabolism enzymes in oocytes and pre-implantation embryos of goat. Immature goat oocytes, matured in maturation medium comprising different folic acid concentrations (0, 10, 50, 100 and 150 mu M), were in vitro fertilized and cultured. Cumulus expansion markers (PTX3 and PTGS2) in cumulus cells were highly upregulated after 50 mM folic acid supplementation indicating higher degree of maturation. Supplementation of 50 mM folic acid during oocyte maturation resulted in significantly higher blastocyst production rate, reduction in intracellular ROS levels as well as upregulation of the transcripts for folate transporters and key folate-methionine cycle enzymes in comparison to control. The present study demonstrates the existence of active folate-methionine cycle in oocytes and preimplantation goat embryos. Supplementation of 50 mM folic acid in maturation medium improves oocyte maturation, the blastocyst production rate, reduces ROS production as well as upregulate the expression of FOLR1 and folate metabolism enzyme, MTR.

AB  - E2F3 is an important member of E2F transcription factors and has been involved in carcinogenesis. So far, little is known on porcine E2F3. Here, we cloned the complete coding sequence (CDS) of E2F3b and identified seven alternatively spliced transcripts in pigs using molecular biology technique for the first time. The CDS of the canonical transcripts (named V1) of porcine E2F3b is 1023 bp in length, and showed 93.35% and 90.62% identities with the homologues from human and mouse, respectively. The splicing variants were produced by exon skipping, alternative 5? and 3? splice sites alone or in combination. Minigene analysis showed that the splicing of porcine E2F3b is complicated. E2F3b isoforms are expressed in all tissues studied with high level in spleen and muscle. Both of isoforms V1 and 2, containing functional domains of E2Fs, were localized throughout cells. No functional nuclear localization sequence and export signal were characterized through site-directed mutagenesis analysis, although their existence was predicted by bioinformatic methods. The results increase our knowledge of E2F3b mRNA diversity and provide basis for in-depth functional research.

AB  - To evaluate the analgesic and physiological effects of electroacupuncture (EA) and medetomindine in domestic goats. Thirty healthy goats (aged 1-2 years and body weight 22 +/- 3.17 kg) were divided into five groups (6 goats/group). Group 1 animals were considered as a control; groups 2 and 3 animals were given 5 mu g kg(-1) and 20 mu g kg(-1) medetomidine IM respectively; group 4 animals were stimulated with EA for 30 mins and group 5 animals were given EA in combination with 5 mu g kg(-1) medetomidine IM. The pain threshold in groups 2 and 3 animals were increased significantly (p< 0.05) at 15 to 60 mins compared to group 1. Group 5 animals showed increase (p< 0.05) in the pain threshold at 15 to 60 mins compared to animals in group 2 and group 4. Goats in groups 2 and 3 showed decrease (p< 0.05) in heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure and rectal temperature, whereas animals in group 5 showed less effect on these physiological parameters. Furthermore, goats in group 5 did not have any effect on blood cell count, serum chemistry, or liver health status. The combination of EA plus 5 mu g kg(-1) medetomidine produced adequate antinociception with minimal physiological alteration suggesting that, an effective strategy for clinical observation and minor surgical procedures in domestic goats.

AB  - An outbreak of Cacosceles newmannii (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) was detected for the first time on sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) in 2015 in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Although primary host plants of this native species remain unknown, these are central to testing hypotheses concerning the outbreak.
   We hypothesized that this species has undergone a host plant shift (i.e. a feeding association with a novel host plant).
   We compared delta C-13 and delta N-15 ratios of adult beetles retrieved from South African museum collections, collected between 1891 and 2016 (n = 23; 'pre-outbreak'), with samples from infested fields in 2017 (n = 9, 'post-outbreak') and in 2019 (n = 23, 'post-outbreak'), as well as diverse, plausible host plants (n = 42 samples across 10 species) from infested fields and surrounding patches of indigenous and commercial forest vegetation. We used Bayesian isotope mixing models to infer the relative contribution of the different plants to the diet of C. newmannii.
   Pre-outbreak, C-3 plants contributed strongly to the larval diet, whereas post-outbreak, C-4 plants were the largest component of their diet. There was some indication of C-4 plants contributing to their diet pre-outbreak.
   Our results suggest that the outbreak of this polyphagous beetle was not a dramatic host shift but rather a rapid increase in the proportion of C-4 plants already in their diet.
   We concluded that plants from the families Fabaceae and Poaceae are the most likely host plants of this species. Nevertheless, the drivers of this rapid outbreak on sugarcane remain poorly determined and should be the focus of future research.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) can affect health and growth performance of pigs, resulting in significant economic losses in swine production. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of glycyrrhizic acid combined with compound probiotics, i.e. Enterococcus faecalis plus Saccharomyces cerevisiae (GAP) on improving growth per-formance, intestinal health and its fecal microbiota composition change of piglets challenged with DON. A total of 160 42-day-old weaned piglets (Landrace x Large White) were used and the experimental period was 28 d. The results showed that supplementing GAP in the diet significantly improved the growth performance of piglets challenged with DON and alleviate DON-induced intestinal damage by reducing ALT, AST and LDH concen-trations in serum, increasing the morphological parameters of jejunum, and decreasing DON residues in serum, liver and feces. Moreover, GAP could significantly decrease the expressions of inflammation and apoptosis genes and proteins (IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, COX-2, Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase 3), and increase the expressions of tight-junction proteins and nutrient transport factor genes and proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-1, ASCT2 and PePT1). In addition, it was also found that GAP supplementation could significantly increase the diversity of gut microbiota, maintain microbial flora balance and promote piglet growth by significantly increasing the abundance of beneficial bacterium such as Lactobacillus and reducing the abundance of harmful bacterium such as Clos-tridium_sensu_stricto_1. In conclusion, GAP addition to piglet diets contaminated with DON could significantly promote the health and growth performance of piglets though alleviating DON-induced hazards. This study provided a theoretical basis for the application of GAP to alleviate DON toxicity for animals.

AB  - Simple Summary Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) causes high mortality in sheep and goats leading to negative social, cultural, and economic impacts on farmers who keep small ruminants. Since 2019, Burkina Faso has been implementing a national strategy to eliminate PPR. After two years of mass vaccination of small ruminants with significant resources invested, very little is known about the cost of vaccination and how it is distributed along with the different nodes of the vaccine distribution chain. This study aimed to fill this gap to inform decision-making in the allocation of the limited resources that are available. The results show that the cost of vaccination of a small ruminant is XOF 169 (USD 0.3) and XOF 103 (USD 0.18) if the vaccination is carried out by public and private vaccinators, respectively. Field activities and personnel bear the highest cost share. These results will inform a better resource allocation to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of small ruminants vaccination against PPR. Every year the government organizes country-wide vaccination campaigns targeting peste des petits ruminants (PPR) for small ruminants (sheep and goats). Despite the heavy investment in vaccination, no study has either rigorously estimated or described the cost of vaccine delivery. This study aimed to fill this gap by assessing and describing the cost of delivery of vaccines against PPR using the 2020 vaccination campaign data. The microcosting approach based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to construct comprehensive multiyear plans (cMYP) for human immunization programs was used. The cost data is presented for the public and private vaccine delivery channels separately and analyzed using three approaches considering activity lines, inputs, and nature of cost (fixed versus variable). Results show that the unit cost of vaccinating a sheep or goat is estimated at XOF 169 (USD 0.3) and XOF 103 (USD 0.18) through the public and private channels, respectively. Using the activity line framework, we found that the field activities including charges for vaccinator, cost of vaccination materials, and field transportation account for more than 50% of the vaccination cost. In terms of inputs, the personnel cost is the most significant contributor with 65%. Fixed costs are higher in the public sector with up to 46% compared to the private sector which is estimated to take 26% of the cost. This study informs veterinary services' investment decision options for a better allocation of resources in implementing PPR and other small ruminant disease control efforts in Burkina Faso and the Sahel.

AB  - Sarcoptic mange, caused by Sarcoptes scabiei, has been reported in various wildlife species, with the potential to impact populations. While it has been documented in some wildlife species and domestic animals, it has not been previously reported in wild boars in South Korea. In March and April 2022, skin samples from nine wild boars and one raccoon dog with suspected sarcoptic mange were submitted to the NIWDC. These samples were tested and confirmed the presence of S. scabiei in six wild boars and one raccoon dog. Genetic analysis of the cox-1 gene from mites indicated that the gene was identical and belonged to the same haplotype in both host species. Serological survey of 658 wild boars, collected from March 2022 to February 2023, revealed a nationwide seroprevalence of 5.47%. The highest seroprevalence was in Gyeongsangnam-do (9.82%); however, regional differences in seroprevalence across the country were not statistically significant, suggesting the disease may be endemic across South Korea. Seroprevalence was highest in spring (16.84%), likely due to increased contact during winter. This study provides fundamental data on the genetic characteristics and distribution of S. scabiei mites in South Korean wild boars, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance to prevent further spread.

AB  - Simple Summary: The fat component of sheep milk exhibits significant variability. While nutrition is widely acknowledged as the main factor affecting fat yield and fatty acid profile in ruminants' milk, genetic factors also contribute to this variation at breed and individual levels. This study aimed to examine the impact of genotypes and feed integration on milk quality in Valle del Belice sheep. To achieve this aim, two polymorphic lipogenic genes (DGAT1 and SCD) and the impact of two dietary supplementations (carob pulp and barley grain) were investigated. Carob pulp, a local agro-industrial by-product rich in carbohydrates and tannins, was selected due to its potential to positively affect ruminant metabolism, suggesting a viable and sustainable alternative for ruminant feeding from economic and environmental perspectives. The genotype at the DGAT1 locus significantly affected both the milk urea content and milk fatty acid composition. The carob pulp supplementation, compared to barley, increased the fat percentage but worsened the milk fatty acid profile in terms of healthy properties. The interaction between genotypes and diet was not evident.
   Abstract: The nutritional value of sheep's milk and its derivatives is influenced by the lipid fraction, which is affected by diet and genetics. This study aimed to explore the genetic variations in the DGAT1 and SCD genes and assessed the impact of the DGAT1 genotype on milk quality in Valle del Belice sheep, considering diet supplementation with carob pulp and barley grain. Among the potentially polymorphic sites, only DGAT1 g.127 C > A and SCD g.87 C > A showed variability. The DGAT1 genotype did not significantly impact milk yield and composition, except for higher urea content in the CA genotypes than in the CC ones. Carob pulp increased the milk fat content compared to barley grain. Genetic variation in DGAT1 was associated with changes in the milk fatty acid profile; specifically, the CA genotype exhibited higher levels of short-chain fatty acids and lower levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to the CC genotype. Carob pulp supplementation increased saturated fatty acids and reduced unsaturated fractions, leading to milk with higher atherogenic and thrombogenic indices. No significant interaction was found between genotype and diet. This study provides insights into the genetic and dietary factors influencing sheep's milk composition. Further research is needed to understand the impact of these genetic variations on milk production and composition, as well as to determine optimal levels of carob pulp for improving fat percentage and promoting sustainable sheep breeding practices.

AB  - Background In nature and in cultivated fields, plants encounter multiple stress factors. Nonetheless, our understanding of how plants actively respond to combinatorial stress remains limited. Among the least studied stress combination is that of flooding and herbivory, despite the growing importance of these stressors in the context of climate change. We investigated plant chemistry and gene expression changes in two heirloom tomato varieties: Cherokee Purple (CP) and Striped German (SG) in response to flooding, herbivory by Spodoptera exigua, and their combination. Results Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in tomato plants subjected to flooding and/or herbivory included several mono- and sesquiterpenes. Flooding was the main factor altering VOCs emission rates, and impacting plant biomass accumulation, while different varieties had quantitative differences in their VOC emissions. At the gene expression levels, there were 335 differentially expressed genes between the two tomato plant varieties, these included genes encoding for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamoyl-CoA-reductase-like, and phytoene synthase (Psy1). Flooding and variety effects together influenced abscisic acid (ABA) signaling genes with the SG variety showing higher levels of ABA production and ABA-dependent signaling upon flooding. Flooding downregulated genes associated with cytokinin catabolism and general defense response and upregulated genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and gibberellin biosynthesis. Combining flooding and herbivory induced the upregulation of genes including chalcone synthase (CHS), PAL, and genes encoding BAHD acyltransferase and UDP-glucose iridoid glucosyltransferase-like genes in one of the tomato varieties (CP) and a disproportionate number of heat-shock proteins in SG. Only the SG variety had measurable changes in gene expression due to herbivory alone, upregulating zeatin, and O-glucosyltransferase and thioredoxin among others. Conclusion Our results suggest that both heirloom tomato plant varieties differ in their production of secondary metabolites including phenylpropanoids and terpenoids and their regulation and activation of ABA signaling upon stress associated with flooding. Herbivory and flooding together had interacting effects that were evident at the level of plant chemistry (VOCs production), gene expression and biomass markers. Results from our study highlight the complex nature of plant responses to combinatorial stresses and point at specific genes and pathways that are affected by flooding and herbivory combined.

AB  - The prevalence of stasis on macroevolution has been classically taken as evidence of the strong role of stabilizing selection in constraining morphological change. Rates of evolution calculated over longer timescales tend to fall below the expected under genetic drift, suggesting that directional selection signals are erased at longer timescales. Here, we investigated the rates of morphological evolution of the skull in a fossil lineage that underwent extreme morphological modification, the glyptodonts. Contrary to what was expected, we show here that directional selection was the primary process during the evolution of glyptodonts. Furthermore, the reconstruction of selection patterns shows that traits selected to generate a glyptodont morphology are markedly different from those operating on extant armadillos. Changes in both direction and magnitude of selection are probably tied to glyptodonts' invasion of a specialist-herbivore adaptive zone. These results suggest that directional selection might have played a more critical role in the evolution of extreme morphologies than previously imagined.

AB  - The present study aimed to determine the effect of cat seminal plasma and purified llama ovulation-inducing factor (beta-NGF) on ovarian activity in queens. Queens (n = 6) were used for all the treatments in a crossover design with an interval time between treatments of three interestrus intervals. Forty-eight hours after the detection of an estrus vaginal cytology, queens were given cat seminal plasma (subcutaneous or intramuscular), purified llama ovulation-inducing factor (15 or 35 mu g), hCG (75 UI), saline, or were mated with a male. A total of 192 estrous cycles were observed. Estrus length and serum estradiol concentration were 6 +/- 1 days (range 2-10 d) and 38 pg/mL (range 10-75 pg/mL), respectively. Queens mated and given hCG showed higher serum progesterone concentration and longer interestrus interval (47 +/- 5 d) than that of controls (10 +/- 3 d). Sixty-seven percent of queens (4/6) treated with subcutaneous cat seminal plasma, and 17% of those treated with purified llama beta-NGF showed high serum progesterone concentrations along with prolonged interestrus. However, intramuscular administration of cat seminal plasma produced interestrus intervals similar to controls (15 +/- 5 d) and basal serum progesterone concentration (<0.50 ng/mL). This study demonstrates that the subcutaneous administration of cat seminal plasma induced ovulation in queens. Therefore, molecules present in cat seminal plasma, contribute to the induction of ovulation in queens. Identifying those molecules will improve the knowledge of queen's reproductive physiology. Also, it could offer a physiologic alternative to induce ovulation in queens when reproductive biotechnologies are used. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study reports the copro-prevalence of giardiasis in sheep and cattle populations of nomadic communities in Multan-Pakistan. For this purpose, a total of 184 faecal samples were collected from cattle (n = 92) and sheep (n = 92) raised by the nomads. All samples were analyzed by using species-specific ELISA kits for the detection of copro-antigen of Giardia duodenalis. Results showed that the overall prevalence of giardiasis was 21.20%, whereas, in sheep and cattle, the prevalence rates were 19.18% and 23.91%, respectively. Age, clinico-physical status and drinking water source showed significant association (P < 0.05) with giardiasis in both sheep and cattle. Breed, history of gastrointestinal problems and routine vaccination were also significant (P < 0.05) risk factors in sheep but not in cattle. Deworming history had a significant association (P < 0.05) with giardiasis in cattle population only. Conversely, sex, herd size, farmers' educational status, feeding pattern, physiological status, contact with wildlife and Giardia-susceptible animals and hygienic condition of housing facility showed non-significant association (P > 0.05) with giardiasis. In conclusion, the cattle and sheep raised by the nomads are infected with giardiasis and may pose a serious threat to susceptible animal and human populations in their surrounding regions.

AB  - Oocytes are exposed to various stressors during in vitro maturation (IVM). Antioxidant supplementation during IVM can mitigate oxidative stress. We investigated the effects of supplementing IVM medium with novel flavonoid-enriched antioxidant nanoformulations, namely, EMD-300 (R) and EMP3-H200 (R), on oocyte IVM and analyzed the expression of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and pluripotency genes in buffalo. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) obtained from buffalo ovaries were matured in IVM medium supplemented with either EMD-300 (R) or EMP3-H200 (R) at 0.5% and 1.0% for 22 h. Following IVM, nuclear maturation, gene expression, and the levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were analyzed. Nuclear maturation was lower (p < 0.001) for the 1.0% EMD-300 (R) group than other groups. The expressions of the GPX4, SOD, CAT, and ATF6 genes were lower (p < 0.05) in the 0.5% EMD-300 (R) and EMP3-H200 (R) groups than in the control. OCT4 gene expression was higher (p < 0.05) for the treated groups than control group. The level of TAC in spent IVM medium was higher for the 0.5% EMD-300 (R) and EMP3-H200 (R) groups than for the control. However, the MDA concentrations were lower. In conclusion, supplementing IVM medium with EMD-300 (R) or EMP3-H200 (R) at 0.5% improved nuclear maturation of buffalo oocytes better than 1.0%. Our findings suggest that these compounds had antioxidant effects, which assures their ability in protecting oocytes against oxidative stress.

AB  - Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is produced by activated T cells and play important role in immune response against antigen. It acts in both autocrine and paracrine manner. It can stimulate B cells and various other phagocytic cells like monocytes, lymphokine-activated killer cells and natural killer cells. Acting in autocrine fashion, IL-2 protein plays a crucial role in proliferation of T cells. IL-2 triggers the release of pro and anti- inflammatory cytokines by activating several pathways. In present study, exon 1 of IL-2 gene of four local Pakistani breeds (Dera Din Panah, Beetal, Nachi and Kamori) was amplified by using reported ovine IL-2 primers. Amplified products of 4 breeds of goat were bidirectionally sequenced to decipher polymorphisms. Only a single substitution (T -> A) was found in non-coding region of IL-2 gene. Comparison of IL-2 gene sequence of all four breeds with other goat breeds showed high similarity in sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of our local breeds with other mammals showed that IL-2 was highly variable. This high substitution rate could be due to changed selective pressure. These rapid changes may also lead to the changes in the functions of immune system.

AB  - Spatiotemporal causal inference methods are needed to detect the effect of interventions on indirectly measured epidemiological outcomes that go beyond studying spatiotemporal correlations. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) causes neurological degeneration and eventual death to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Wisconsin. Targeted culling involves removing deer after traditional hunting seasons in areas with high CWD prevalence. The evaluation of the causal effects of targeted culling in the spread and growth of CWD is an important unresolved research and CWD management question that can guide surveillance efforts. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) can be used to mechanistically model the underlying spatiotemporal dynamics of wildlife diseases, like CWD, allowing researchers to make inference about unobserved epidemiological quantities. These models indirectly regress spatiotemporal covariates on diffusion and growth rates parameterizing such PDEs, obtaining associational conclusions. In this work we develop an innovative method to obtain causal estimators for the effect of targeted culling interventions on CWD epidemiological processes using an inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted technique by means of marginal structural models embedded in the PDE fitting process. Additionally we establish a novel scheme for sensitivity analysis under unmeasured confounder for testing the hypothesis of a significant causal effect in the indirectly measured epidemiological outcomes. Our methods can be broadly used to study the impact of spatiotemporal interventions and treatment exposures in the epidemiological evolution of infectious diseases that can help to inform future efforts to mitigate public health implications and wildlife disease burden.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is an underlying cause of childhood neurological disease secondary to the crucial role of mitochondria in proper neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that chronic intrauterine hypoxia (HPX) induces mitochondrial deficits by altering mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in the fetal brain. Pregnant guinea pigs were exposed to either normoxia (NMX, 21%O-2) or HPX (10.5%O-2) starting at 28-day (early onset, EO-HPX) or 50-day (late onset, LO-HPX) gestation until term (65 days). Near-term male and female fetuses were extracted from anesthetized sows, and mitochondria were isolated from excised fetal forebrains (n = 6/group). Expression of mitochondrial complex subunits I-V (CI-CV), fission (Drp-1), and fusion (Mfn-2) proteins was measured by Western blot. CI and CIV enzyme activities were measured by colorimetric assays. Chronic HPX reduced fetal body wts and increased (P < 0.05) brain/body wt ratios of both sexes. CV subunit levels were increased in EO-HPX males only and CII levels increased in LO-HPX females only compared to NMX. Both EO- and LO-HPX decreased CIV activity in both sexes but had no effect on CI activity. EO-HPX increased Drp1 and decreased Mfn2 levels in males, while LO-HPX had no effect on either protein levels. In females, both EO-HPX and LO-HPX increased Drp1 but had no effect on Mfn2 levels. Chronic HPX alters abundance and activity of select complex subunits and shifts mitochondrial dynamics toward fission in a sex-dependent manner in the fetal guinea pig brain. This may be an underlying mechanism of reduced respiratory efficiency leading to disrupted metabolism and increased vulnerability to a second neurological injury at the time of birth in HPX fetal brains.

AB  - Consumption of pollination reward by felonious means in a plant species can influence the foraging behavior of its pollinator and eventually the reproductive success. So far, studies on this aspect are largely confined to interaction involving plant-pollinators and nectar robbers or thieves. However, a foraging guild in such interactions may also include floral herbivores or florivores. There is a paucity of information on the extent to which nectar larcenists may influence the foraging behavior of the pollinator and reproductive fitness of plants in the presence of a florivore. We investigated various forms of larceny in the natural populations of Aerides odorata, a pollinator-dependent and nectar-rewarding orchid. These populations differed in types of foraging guild, the extent of larceny (thieving/robbing), which can occur with or without florivory, and natural fruit-set pattern. The nectariferous spur of the flower serves as an organ of interest among the foraging insects. While florivory marked by excision of nectary dissuades the pollinator, nectar thieving and robbing significantly enhance visits of the pollinator and fruit-set. Experimental pollinations showed that the species is a preferential outbreeder and experiences inbreeding depression from selfing. Reproductive fitness of the orchid species varies significantly with the extent of floral larceny. Although nectar thieving or robbing is beneficial in this self-compatible species, the negative effects of florivory were stronger. Our findings suggest that net reproductive fitness in the affected plant species is determined by the overarching effect of its breeding system on the overall interacting framework of the foraging guild.

AB  - The Anthropocene is marked by a dramatic biodiversity decline, particularly affecting the family Rhinocerotidae. Three of five extant species are listed as Critically Endangered (Sumatran, Javan, black rhinoceros), one as Vulnerable (Indian rhinoceros), and only one white rhino (WR) subspecies, the Southern white rhinoceros (SWR), after more than a century of successful protection is currently classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN, while numbers again are declining. Conversely, in 2008, the SWR's northern counterpart and second WR subspecies, the Northern white rhinoceros (NWR), was declared extinct in the wild. Safeguarding these vanishing keystone species urgently requires new reproductive strategies. We here assess one such strategy, the novel in vitro fertilization program in SWR and - for the first-time NWR - regarding health effects, donor-related, and procedural factors. Over the past 8 years, we performed 65 procedures in 22 white rhinoceros females (20 SWR and 2 NWR) comprising hormonal ovarian stimulation, ovum pick-up (OPU), in vitro oocyte maturation, fertilization, embryo culture, and blastocyst cryopreservation, at an efficiency of 1.0 +/- 1.3 blastocysts per OPU, generating 22 NWR, 19 SWR and 10 SWR/NWR hybrid blastocysts for the future generation of live offspring.

AB  - Background: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are gaining attention for their potential applications in healthcare. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of various LLMs in detecting hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA) using only patient-reported data collected via a structured questionnaire, without prior medical consultation. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted at an orthopaedic outpatient clinic specialized in hip and knee OA treatment. A total of 115 patients completed a paper-based questionnaire covering symptoms, medical history, and demographic information. The diagnostic performance of five different LLMs-including four versions of ChatGPT, two of Gemini, Llama, Gemma 2, and Mistral-Nemo-was analysed. Model-generated diagnoses were compared against those provided by experienced orthopaedic clinicians, which served as the reference standard. Results: GPT-4o achieved the highest diagnostic sensitivity at 92.3 %, significantly outperforming other LLMs. The completeness of patient responses to symptom-related questions was the strongest predictor of accuracy for GPT-4o (p < 0.001). Inter-model agreement was moderate among GPT-4 versions, whereas models such as Llama-3.1 demonstrated notably lower accuracy and concordance. Conclusions: GPT-4o demonstrated high accuracy and consistency in diagnosing OA based solely on patient- reported questionnaires, underscoring its potential as a supplementary diagnostic tool in clinical settings. Nevertheless, the reliance on patient-reported data without direct physician involvement highlights the critical need for medical oversight to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Further research is needed to refine LLM capabilities and expand their utility in broader diagnostic applications.

AB  - The present study is the first of its kind being reported for an indigenous sheep breed of Pakistan with objectives to (a) assess the diagnostic efficacy of a human-based "serum hemolysis reference palette" for sheep serum, (b) deduce normal reference intervals (RIs) for hemoglobin (Hb) and bilirubin, and (c) devise a novel serum color chart for on-field estimation of Hb and bilirubin through color matching of sheep serum. Apparently, healthy Sipli sheep (n = 130) were bled twice attaining whole blood and serum samples (n = 260). The study animals were grouped on the basis of gender, that is, males (n = 51) and females (n = 79) and age, that is, G1 (up till 1 year) (n = 41), G2 (from 1 to 2 years) (n = 46), and G3 (from 2 to 3 years) (n = 43). None of the 260 serum samples of the sheep matched the color given on the human-based "hemolysis reference palette." The G1 animals revealed marked variation in their serum color. Hence, on the basis of RIs, the serum samples (n = 178) of adult sheep (G2 and G3) showing three main color bands were used in devising a novel serum Hb and bilirubin estimation chart for adult sheep serum. In conclusion, the human-based serum hemolysis palette is not valid for sheep serum. The RIs attained in the study could provide a yardstick for assessment of health in indigenous sheep breeds whereas the serum color chart may be of value in estimating Hb and bilirubin in a quick, reliable, and cheaper way for the resource-poor settings of the world.

AB  - Rare-cold-inducible 2 (RCI2) genes are involved in plant response to abiotic stresses. In this study, we report the functional role of a Camelina RCI2, CsRCI2D, in plant salt stress response. The localization of CsRCI2D was observed in the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes by confocal analysis in tobacco leaf and western blot analysis in Camelina. The full length CsRCI2D cDNA clone was not able to complement the salt sensitivity of ospmp3 lacking the PMP3 gene. However, a C-terminal tail deleted CsRCI2D cDNA was able to restore the level of salt tolerance to that of WT. CsRCI2D-overexpressing Camelina showed better germination rate and seedling growth. CsRCI2D overexpression decreased Na+ accumulation in both roots and shoots but increased K+ accumulation in the shoots under salt stress. Furthermore, CsRCI2D-overexpressing Camelina displayed lower H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) upon salt stress. Under normal growth condition, CsRCI2D-overexpressing Camelina showed higher transcript levels of all antioxidant genes (CsCuSODs, CsMnSOD1, CsFeSODs, CsCATs, CsAPX1, and CsGR), whereas salt stress significantly induced all antioxidant genes in WT. These results indicate that salt-upregulated CsRCI2D plays a positive role in Camelina seed germination and seedling growth under salt stress by maintenance of ion homeostasis and modulating the expression of antioxidant-related genes.

AB  - This study aimed at the performance evaluation of a closed flock of Marwari sheep and also to study the effect of accumulated inbreeding on the growth traits using a linear mixed model methodology. The data generated for 39 years (1981 to 2020) on Marwari sheep maintained at ICAR-Central Sheep & Wool Research Institute, Arid Region Campus (CSWRI, ARC), Bikaner, Rajasthan, India were used for analysis on growth traits. The overall least-squares means (LSM) of live weights at birth (BWT), weaning (3MWT), 6 months (6MWT), 9 months (9MWT) and 12 months (12MWT) were observed to be 3.02 +/- 0.01, 14.30 +/- 0.04, 20.12 +/- 0.05, 23.68 +/- 0.06 and 26.39 +/- 0.07 kg, respectively. Overall LSM for average daily gain from birth to 3 months (ADG1), 3 to 6 months (ADG2) and 6 to 12 months (ADG3) were 125.44 +/- 0.40, 67.37 +/- 0.40 and 35.83 +/- 0.29 g/day, respectively. Kleiber ratio (KR) from birth to 3 months (KR1), 3 to 6 months (KR2), and 6 to 12 months (KR3) were 16.78 +/- 0.02, 6.58 +/- 0.04 and 3.05 +/- 0.02, respectively. Results revealed a 4.36, 25.83, 36.33, 31.50 and 28.99% improvement in the live weights since the inception of the improvement programme. This is also reflected by a significant effect of sire on all the growth traits. The estimate of inbreeding in the flock was 1.55%. Highly inbred animals were 5.13% (>5% Fi). The study revealed the non-significant effect of inbreeding level on all growth traits except for BWT and KR3. For BWT, inbreeding classes had variation; however, a negative effect was not seen. The inbreeding class (>5% Fi) was reduced by 0.05 units for KR3 as against its preceding class. Dam's age at lambing and weight influenced the birth weight and subsequent weights. The study concluded that the selection programme of Marwari sheep is in the right direction; however, regular monitoring of inbreeding is necessary and factors affecting growth must be monitored to attain better growth rates in the nucleus.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent years, several studies have been carried out to optimize milking efficiency in Murciano-Granadina goats, but to our knowledge there are no experiments combining different milking parameters (system vacuum, pulsation rate and pulsator ratio) in two different height level milking machines. In two short experiments, testing different combinations of the parameters mentioned, milk fractioning, milking efficiency, teat end status and animal welfare were analyzed. Results showed that the height of the milking machine pipes can have an influence on which parameters are most optimal for milking efficiency and animal welfare in the milking of Murciano-Granadina goats. The Murciano-Granadina goat breed has been described as a slow milking breed. As milking machine parameters can affect milk extraction in terms of yield and time employed, two experiments of one-month duration were performed with 88 goats in Latin square design to find the best combination of these parameters. One of them was carried out in a mid-line milking machine and one in a low-line milking machine. For each of them, two vacuum levels (36 and 40 kPa), two pulsation rates (90 and 120 cycles/min) and two pulsator ratios (50 and 60%) were used and milking efficiency, sanitary status of the mammary gland, milk cortisol, and teat end status were evaluated. Results showed that in milking machines installed in mid- and low-line, the use of 40 kPa system vacuum, 60% pulsator ratio and 90 or 120 cycles/min pulsation rate achieved optimum milking fractioning and efficiency. In the case of low-level milking machines, a similar combination with 36 kPa not only showed worse milking fractioning values, but also provided better values of teat end status and cortisol level.

AB  - Eagle rays, cownose rays and manta rays (order Myliobatiformes) have a slender tail that can be longer than the animal's body length, but its function and structure are unknown. Using histology, immunohistochemistry and three-dimensional imaging with micro-computed tomography scans, we describe the anatomy and function of the tail in Rhinoptera bonasus, the cownose ray. The tail is an extension of the vertebral column with unique morphological specializations. Along the tail behind the barb, vertebral centra are absent and neural and haemal arches fuse to form a solid mineralized structure that we describe for the first time and term caudal synarcual, which imparts passive stiffness to the tail, reducing bending. Two lateral line canals connected to an extensive tubule network extend along both sides of the tail. Tubules branch from the lateral line canal toward the dorsal and ventral tail surfaces, opening to the surrounding water via pores. A continuous neuromast is located within each lateral line canal, maintaining an uninterrupted structure along the entire tail. The complex lateral line mechanosensory system in the tail of R. bonasus supports the hypothesis that the tail functions like a hydrodynamic sensory antenna and may play an important role in their behavioural and functional ecology.

AB  - Anti-aging is one of the top goals in the field of health care and aesthetics. Anti-aging cosmetics derived from nature are oriented to long-term development, bringing safety to users and being environmentally friendly. The aim of this study was to develop an anti-aging cosmetic formulation process based on coconut oil in combination with deer antler stem cell extract. The results show that the presence of deer antler stem cell extract added to the foundation made the serum product highly stable and helped improve skin aging significantly after 2 weeks of use. The skin site where the serum product was applied showed a smooth and elastic skin surface, with very few fine lines and shallow wrinkles. Serum reduced the number of wrinkles (48.09% compared to commercial serum (ME) and 60.31% compared to positive control (PC)), reduced skin recovery time (39.31% compared to ME and 67.1% of PC) after two weeks of use. After 2 weeks of use, collagen density increased 10.18% compared to ME and 63.76% compared to control. Epidermal thickness increased by 106.1% compared to PC and 121.7% compared to ME.

AB  - In this study, 24 h quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) in Taiwan at the ranges of day 1 (0-24 h), day 2 (24-48 h), and day 3 (48-72 h) by a cloud-resolving model are examined using categorical statistics, targeted mainly for the most-rainy 24 h from 10 typhoon cases between 2010 and 2015, following two earlier studies that evaluated the overall performance for all the typhoons that hit Taiwan from 2010 to 2012 and through 2015. In the selected examples with a peak amount of 322 to 1110 mm, the QPFs by the model (with a grid size of 2.5 km) are shown to be of very high quality for two typhoons (Soulik and Soudelor), and fairly good quality for three cases (Fanapi, Megi, and Fung-Wong) up to day 3 and for four others (Saola, Kong-Rey, Nanmadol, and Tembin) within day 2, respectively. The results are more variable for the one remaining case of Matmo, also impressive on day 1 but degraded at longer ranges. Overall, the quality of the QPFs ranges from excellent to satisfactory for all the typhoons studied as the threat score can achieve 0.2 at thresholds fairly close to the observed peak amount in some typhoons, or at least about half of it in most others. Since the majority of the typhoons produced the greatest rainfall amounts over the mountains in Taiwan due to the topographic effect, in agreement with many previous studies, the QPF skills by the model, often extending into high thresholds, as demonstrated, suggest that heavy rainfall from typhoons in Taiwan is generally of high predictability if and when the model has an adequate resolution.

AB  - In tropical forests, herbivore damage is one of the main causes of seedling mortality. However, along with seed size, the resources herbivores provide are an important factor in a seedling's response to selection pressure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of seed size and artificially-induced herbivory on the functional traits of Ceiba aesculifolia seedlings. To do this, we established four levels of foliar damage: 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% (n = 270), and a control treatment (no damage; n = 60). Foliar damage treatments were conducted 60 days after germination. These treatments were applied to seedlings developing from seeds of three different sizes. The response variables were growth, some foliar traits, and seedling biomass. Seedlings from small seeds showed higher growth rates in terms of height (0.44 +/- 0.02 cm month(-1)), diameter (0.24 +/- 0.01 mm month(-1)), and foliar production (9.1 +/- 0.19 leaves), as well as higher total dry weight (8.5 +/- 0.03 g) and larger leaf area (49.3 +/- 1.9 cm(2)) than those from medium and large seeds. Seedlings from large and medium seeds showed higher root:stem ratio values than seedlings from small seeds (p < 0.05). Foliar damage was found to have an effect on dry weight. The total biomass of seedlings with 75% damage was considerably smaller than that of seedlings with 10% damage. Chlorophyll content was found to be related to the interaction between seed size and foliar damage, and it was lower in seedlings from medium seeds and 50% damage than in those from small seeds with the same level of damage and large seeds with 75% damage. In short, seed size had a significant effect on growth traits. Contrary to our expectations, seedlings from small seeds showed the best performance in terms of height, biomass, number of leaves, and foliar area.

AB  - Musk is a scarce and precious medical resource secreted by male forest musk deer (FMD). Current research to promote musk secretion in FMD has used almost exclusively hormone injections, but this approach can be detrimental to the health of FMD. In order to conserve this endangered species as much as possible while increasing the production of musk, this study first used bioinformatics methods to predict the function of quercetin, a flavonoid that promotes testosterone (T) production and prevents late-onset male hypogonadism. On the basis of good prediction effect, different concentrations of quercetin were added to the diet of FMD. The results showed that quercetin could change the levels of T, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol, and regulate the structure of intestinal microorganisms and musk microorganisms of FMD. Moreover, there is a correlation among musk components, hormones, intestinal microorganisms, and musk microorganisms, which indicates that the production of musk may be regulated by these three at the same time, and the addition of quercetin with 800 mg per kg diet could significantly increase the yield of muscone (P < 0.05), the most effective ingredient in musk. In addition, quercetin decreased the high level of cortisol during musk secretion, which may relieve the stress on FMD in this process. This may help to protect the health of FMD. Combined with the results of software prediction, we finally proposed a possible mechanism for the complex process of musk secretion in FMD with a view to providing ideas for further studies.

AB  - Runs of heterozygosity (ROHet) and homozygosity (ROH) harbor useful information related to traits of interest. There is a lack of investigating the effect of ROHet and ROH on reproductive success and the loss of reproduction in mammals. Here, we detected and characterized the ROHet and ROH patterns in the genomes of Chinese indigenous pigs (i.e., Jinhua, Chun'an, Longyou Black, and Shengxian Spotted pigs), revealing the similar genetic characteristics of indigenous pigs. Later, we highlighted the underlying litter traits-related ROHet and ROH using association analysis with linear model in these four indigenous pig breeds. To pinpoint the promising candidate genes associated with litter traits, we further in-depth explore the selection patterns of other five pig breeds (i.e., Erhualian, Meishan, Minzhu, Rongchang, and Diqing pigs) with different levels of reproduction performance at the underlying litter traitsrelated ROHet and ROH using FST and genetic diversity ratio. Then, we identified a set of known and novel candidate genes associated with reproductive performance in pigs. For the novel candidate genes (i.e., CCDC91, SASH1, SAMD5, MACF1, MFSD2A, EPC2, and MBD5), we obtained public available datasets and performed multi-omics analyses integrating transcriptome-wide association studies and comparative single-cell RNA-seq analyses to uncover the roles of them in mammalian reproductive performance. The genes have not been widely reported to be fertility-related genes and can be complementally considered as prior biological information to modify genomic selections models that benefits pig genetic improvement of litter traits. Besides, our findings provide new insights into the function of ROHet and ROH in mammals. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Cryopreservation induces capacitation-like (cryo-capacitation) changes, similar to natural capacitation, and affects the fertility potential of post-thawed sperm. The molecular mechanism of sperm cryo-capacitation during cryopreservation remains unknown. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have been reported to be involved in cryo-capacitation of post-thawed sperm and regulation of sperm motility, capacitation, and chemotaxis. In this study, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 7 (PTPN7) was positively targeted by piR-121380 after a dual luciferase assay. The mRNA expression of PTPN7 and piR-121380 was significantly decreased (p < 0.01); however, PTPN7 protein was significantly increased (p < 0.01) in post-thawed boar sperm. Furthermore, E1RK1/2 phosphorylation was reduced during cryopreservation. Six hours after transfection with piR-121380 mimic and inhibitor, the phosphorylation of ERK2 was significantly increased and decreased (p < 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, the highest and lowest total sperm motility, forward motility, and capacitation rate were observed after piR-121380 mimic and inhibitor treatments, respectively. The concentration of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) showed no significant difference after transfection with either piR-121380 mimic or inhibitor at 1, 3, and 6 h. In conclusion, we demonstrated that piR-121380 modulates ERK2 phosphorylation by targeting PTPN7, which induces sperm cryo-capacitation, and eventually affects the motility and fertility potential of post-thawed sperm.

AB  - Context. Testicular blood flow (TBF) is crucial for testicular function. The pattern of TBF in Shiba goats indicates seasonal variations. Aims. This study aimed to investigate the effect of diurnal variations on TBF, testis volume (TV), testicular echogenicity, and reproductive hormones in goats over a 24-h period. Methods. In three trials that went for three consecutive days each, 12 bucks were scanned using Triplex ultrasonography to assess the TV, pixel intensity of testicular echotexture (PIX), and Doppler indices of TBF (resistive index: RI and pulsatility index: PI) in four-time points a day (at 6.00, 12.00, 18.00, and 00.00 h). Concomitantly, the changes in circulating FSH, LH, inhibin, testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), cortisol, and melatonin were assessed. Key results. Results revealed diurnal alterations in the calculated RI of TBF and the PIX of testicular parenchyma (P < 0.05). Lower RI values of the TBF were observed at 6.00 h compared to other time points. There were significant diurnal alterations in the levels of FSH (P < 0.05), LH (P < 0.05), T (P < 0.0001), E2 (P < 0.0001), cortisol (P < 0.0001), and melatonin (P < 0.0001). FSH attained a higher concentration at 18.00 h compared to 12.00 h. Concentrations of LH were significantly higher at 06.00 h compared to those at 18.00 h. Concentrations of T were significantly higher at 6.00 compared to other time points. E2 showed higher concentrations at 6.00 h and 00.00 h compared to 12.00 h and 18.00 h. On the contrary, concentrations of cortisol were significantly higher at 12.00 h and 18.00 h compared to 06.00 h and 00.00 h. The highest concentrations of melatonin were observed at 00.00 h compared to other time points, while the lowest concentrations were at 12.00 h. Conclusions. Diurnal rhythm induces significant changes in TBF, testicular PIX, and circulating FSH, LH, T, E2, cortisol, and melatonin over the 24-h day. Implications. The outcomes of the study are reflected in the advisability of monitoring the TBF at a fixed time a day to avoid the circadian rhythm effect.

AB  - Recent studies have speculated that some snakes developed white venters to avoid overheating caused by highly radiative soil and rocks. Here, we present the scale-embedded porous nanostructures through which some snake species of the genus Bitis achieve such whiteness. Our analysis reveals nanopores causing scattering underneath the external surface of the white ventral scales of Bitis rubida and Bitis armata. Such nanopores are not present in the scales of Bitis parviocula, Bitis arietans and Bitis rhinoceros that appear transparent or translucent to the naked eye. White ventral scales with nanopores reflect up to 40% of light in the visible regime. The reflection, however, decreases for longer wavelengths and drastically reduces in the infrared. In contrast, a much lower, almost constant reflection around 8% between 250 and 2500 nm is observed for the transparent or translucent ventral scales without nanopores. Our study demonstrates that some snake species of the genus Bitis utilize a light-scattering network of nanopores underneath their external surfaces to create white ventral scales.

AB  - Performance traits are tightly linked to the fitness of organisms. However, because studies of variation in performance traits generally focus on just one or several closely related species, we are unable to draw broader conclusions about how and why these traits vary across clades. One important performance trait related to many aspects of an animal's life history is bite-force. Here, we use a clade-wide phylogenetic comparative approach to investigate relationships between size, head dimensions and bite-force among lizards and tuatara (lepidosaurs), using the largest bite-force dataset collated to date for any taxonomic group. We test four predictions: that bite-force will be greater in larger species, and for a given body size, bite-force will be greatest in species with acrodont tooth attachment, herbivorous diets, and non-burrowing habits. We show that bite-force is strongly related to body and head size across lepidosaurs and, as predicted, larger species have the greatest bite-forces. Contrary to our other predictions, tooth attachment, diet and habit have little predictive power when accounting for size. Herbivores bite more forcefully simply because they are larger. Our results also highlight priorities for future sampling to further enhance our understanding of broader evolutionary patterns.

AB  - This study aimed to detect intracellular trehalose in boar sperm that were cryopreserved with liposomes and conduct an analysis of its effects on some characteristics of thawed sperm, including rheological properties. First, soybean lecithin cholesterol-based liposomes were produced and characterized in the presence of 300 mM trehalose. Next, semen samples were frozen in two freezing media: a control medium with 300 mM trehalose and an experimental medium supplemented with 300 mM trehalose and 10% liposomes, both of which were thawed and then studied to ascertain their integrity, motility, rheological response, and trehalose quantities by testing two methods of spermatic lysis via high-performance liquid chromatography with an evaporative light-scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD). The results found spherical liposomes measuring 357 nm that were relatively stable in an aqueous medium and had an entrapment efficiency of 73%. An analysis of the cryopreserved ejaculates showed that their viability and motility did not significantly differ between groups (P > 0.05). The viscous response of the samples was influenced by the extracellular medium rather than by the freezing-thawing process, which resulted in a loss of interaction between the cells and cryoprotectants. Finally, intracellular trehalose levels were determined using HPLC-ELSD, with no differences observed (P > 0.05) when comparing both sperm lysis methods. The use of liposomes with trehalose appears to be a promising option for boar semen cryopreservation, with a marked effect on rheological properties. The proposed HPLC-ELSD method was effective for measuring trehalose in cryopreserved cell samples.

AB  - Potential improvements in crop yield and soil properties following the application of biochar derived from wood and bamboo, pig manure (PM), and mineral fertilizers in acid soils (Dystrudepts) of North Eastern Hill Region of India are studied. The treatments comprise of T1: Control (no addition of biochar and nutrients), T2: Recommended dose fertilizers (RDF) @ 20 kg N ha-1, 40 kg P ha-1 and 30 kg K ha-1, T3: RDF + 2.5 t ha-1 wood biochar (WB), T4: RDF + 5.0 t ha-1 WB, T5: RDF + 2.5 t ha-1 bamboo biochar (BB), T6: RDF + 5.0 t ha-1 BB, T7: RDF + 2.0 t ha-1 PM, T8: RDF + 2.0 t ha-1 PM + 2.5 t ha-1 WB, T9: RDF + 2.0 t ha-1 PM + 5.0 t ha-1 WB, T10: RDF + 2.0 t ha-1 PM + 2.5 t ha-1 BB, T11: RDF + 2.0 t ha-1 PM + 5.0 t ha-1 BB, in randomized block design which was replicated thrice. The study found that adding biochar, along with PM and RDF, was most effective for improving soil organic carbon, available nutrients, and exchangeable bases. The combined application of mineral fertilizers with manure and biochar also effectively ameliorates soil acidity. The combined application also noticeably improves soil microbial activity compared to sole mineral fertilizer applications and the control. The beneficial effects of biochar, and PM on soil properties are visible in the improved seed and stover yield of ricebean across two seasons.

AB  - Effective management of invasive species requires collaboration across a range of stakeholders. These stakeholders exhibit diverse attributes such as organisation types, operational scale, objectives, and roles within projects. Identifying the diverse attributes of stakeholders is beneficial for increasing collaboration success while minimising potential conflicts among multiple stakeholders when managing invasive species across landscapes. Despite the increasing number of studies on connections among stakeholders, there is little understanding of the diverse attributes of stakeholders involved in invasive species management. This is a notable gap because the diversity of stakeholders is one of the significant factors that can influence collaboration success. To bridge this knowledge gap, we used a social network approach to identify the attributes of stakeholders that influence their participation in collaborations using a case study of invasive wild pig (Sus scrofa) management in Queensland, Australia. Our findings suggest that even though the overall stakeholder network was diverse, the stakeholder network at the project level exhibited a lack of diversity on average, particularly regarding the scale of operation and type of organisation. In other words, stakeholders are highly likely to form ties in projects involving other stakeholders from similar types of organisations or operational scales. We suggest that targeting a greater diversity of stakeholders across types of organisations and scales of operations might enhance the success of collaborative invasive species management.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination is a long-term global problem for human health and the environment. Due to their hazardous properties and high risks to humans and the environment, certain PFAS such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were phased out by their main manufacturers in the first decade of the 2000s and have been regulated on a regional and international scale by the Stockholm Convention. So far, the effectiveness of PFAS management-defined as the sum of all regulatory and voluntary actions-is not well understood. We conducted a comprehensive time trend analysis with samples from the German Environmental Specimen Bank dating back to the 1980s and early 1990s. These samples covered human samples (blood plasma) as well as samples from the terrestrial (deer liver), freshwater (bream muscle/liver, mussel soft tissue) and coastal environment (herring gull eggs). The aim of this study was to statistically assess the change points (CPs) of exposure and to quantify the changes before and after the CP in comparison with the evolving PFAS management. The analysis revealed remarkably similar CP estimates across human and environmental matrices investigated. The results show that the maximum concentrations of PFOS were already reached before (late 1990s) the announcement of the phase-out by their main manufacturer. These results are similar for all PFSA tested and indicate an earlier shift to PFAS substitutes than previously assumed. For PFCAs, CPs were generally later (mid-2000s to late 2000s), possibly due to later regulatory action on PFCAs and their preceding production shifts, respectively. In general, regulatory actions were introduced around 10 to 15 years after the respective CPs, which indicates market shifts for PFAS in anticipation of compound specific regulatory measures and not as a reaction to them and demonstrates the need for faster regulatory actions to effectively protect humans and the environment.

   Camel livestock is a significant sector of agriculture in Pakistan. Punjab Marecha is the camel breed more diffuse for their production characteristics. In fact, this camel breed is well adapted to the desert ecosystem, tolerating elevated temperatures and dehydration. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of water deprivation on milk production performance in Marecha camels during the summer. Twelve she-camels in the early lactation stage were included. After seven days, camels were divided into three groups: Group 1 (G1) having access to water once a day, Group 2 (G2) having access once every 4 days, and Group 3 (G3) having access once every 6 days. Milk production and daily dry matter were decreased in camels deprived of water for 6 days. The results of the current study suggest that the camel is a productive animal even when subjected to water deprivation; however, its feed intake and milk production are decreased.
   Twelve lactating healthy Marecha she-camels in the early lactation stage during the summer at Camel Breeding and Research Station Rakh-Mahni (Pakistan) were included. All animals were fed with Medicago sativa and Cicer arientinum ad libitum and divided into three groups in relation to the access to water, after a period of seven days of adaptation to experimental conditions. Group 1 (G1) was considered as control having access to water once every day; Group 2 (G2) had access once every 4 days, while Group 3 (G3) had access once every 6 days. The duration of the study was 60 days with an adaptation period to experimental conditions of 7 days before the onset of the study. Dry matter intake (DMI) was calculated on a dry matter basis. On average the ambient temperature and relative humidity during the trial were 39-41 degrees C and 55-63%, respectively. The DMI, water intake, milk production, and body weight changes were affected (p < 0.001) during various watering regimes. The mean values of water intake were found to be 82.94 +/- 1.34 L higher in G3 than G1 and G2.

AB  - The biological parameters of Necrobia rufipes (DeGeer, 1775) are estimated under controlled temperature and relative humidity. The adults, collected from industrial canine food at a supermarket in Campina Grande, state of Paraiba, Brazil, were taken to the Laboratory of Insect Systematics and Bioecology at the Universidade Estadual da Paraiba, in order to ascertain the matrix creation. The individuals were placed in boxes with hermetic sealing, each containing 20 adults, and were fed a diet of 1.8 g of fish flour, a slice of bacon, and four dog food pellets. A total of 160 eggs were individualized in the plastic recipient in a base of paper filter, covered with voil tissue, and secured with an elastic cord. The containers were placed in a B.O.D. camera at temperatures of 20, 24, 28, and 32 degrees C and relative humidity of 70%. The larvae received a diet composed of 0.45 g of fish flour, a slice of bacon, and dog food pellet. The development of phases was monitored daily. The life cycle from egg to adult was completed in four temperatures and encompassed four larval instars. The development speed at all stage phases was affected by temperature. Higher thermal conditions increase development speed and consequently reduce the duration of the immature and adult stages. The development of N. rufipes was completed at 20 and 32 degrees C, two temperatures that are not considered optimal for insect development. The fact that N. rufipes is a pest of storage grains, however, may explain why this insect is able to tolerate and develop under suboptimal temperatures.

AB  - Simple Summary Proteomic analysis of normal and poorly motile buffalo sperm indicates that the formation of poorly motile buffalo sperm is associated with inefficient energy metabolism, decreased sperm protamine proteins, a lack of motility-related proteins, and changes in tail structural proteins. The results provide clues for finding molecular mechanisms for poor motility of buffalo sperm. The acquisition of mammalian sperm motility is a main indicator of epididymal sperm maturation and helps ensure fertilization. Poor sperm motility will prevent sperm cells from reaching the fertilization site, resulting in fertilization failure. To investigate the proteomic profiling of normal and poorly motile buffalo spermatozoa, a strategy applying liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry combined with tandem mass targeting was used. As a result, 145 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in poorly motile spermatozoa (fold change > 1.5), including 52 upregulated and 93 downregulated proteins. The upregulated DEPs were mainly involved in morphogenesis and regulation of cell differentiation. The downregulated DEPs were involved with transport, oxidation-reduction, sperm motility, regulation of cAMP metabolism and regulation of DNA methylation. The mRNA and protein levels of PRM1 and AKAP3 were lower in poorly motile spermatozoa, while the expressions of SDC2, TEKT3 and IDH1 were not correlated with motility, indicating that their protein changes were affected by transcription or translation. Such changes in the expression of these proteins suggest that the formation of poorly motile buffalo spermatozoa reflects a low efficiency of energy metabolism, decreases in sperm protamine proteins, deficiencies in motility-related proteins, and variations in tail structural proteins. Such proteins could be biomarkers of poorly motile spermatozoa. These results illustrate some of the molecular mechanisms associated with poorly motile spermatozoa and provide clues for finding molecular markers of these pathways.

AB  - Molluscs have produced an extensive fossil record, owing to the prevalence of robust biomineralized shells among this clade. By contrast, most other components of molluscan anatomy are seldom preserved. Importantly, little is known of the evolutionary history of the unique molluscan feeding apparatus-the radula. A scarcity of fossil radulae has hampered our understanding of the ancestral condition, and of the dietary ecology of early molluscs. The handful of known fossil radulae all point to early molluscs as simple deposit feeders that obtained food via rasping or scraping. This study reports microscopic radulae preserved as 'small carbonaceous fossils' (SCFs) from Cambrian (Stage 4-Wuliuan, approximately 514-504.5 Ma) strata of Sweden. These rare fossil radulae offer novel insights into the feeding anatomy and ecology of early molluscs. Each radula comprises a uniseriate arc of (<= 10) blade-shaped teeth, fringed by a slicing keel. This distinctive morphology is strikingly convergent with the radulae of extant sacoglossan heterobranch gastropods-such radulae are specially adapted for piercing the cell walls of green algal tissues to enable suctorial feeding on the cytoplasm contents. Discovery of analogous Cambrian radulae demonstrates this specialized form of herbivory had already evolved among molluscs more than half a billion years ago.

AB  - Colistin has broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria and has been considered as the last-resort treatment for multiantibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria infections in human. And it is also world widely utilized as a veterinary medicine for the promotion of growth, prevention and control of diseases in livestock and poultry. Extensive use of colistin in husbandry results in the introduction of large amounts of colistin to the surrounding environment via animals' urine and feces, potentially inducing the prevalence of colistin resistance bacteria and the impact of the ecological environment. The study investigated the adsorption, desorption and degradation of colistin in soils using high sensitivity UPLC-MS/MS assays. An MS based assay was established to directly determine colistin in the soil. It was observed that the moderate adsorption affinity of colistin to the three soils with adsorption strength (1/n) ranging from 0.6897 to 1.3333. Colistin exhibited the highest adsorption affinity to the sandy loam, followed by the sand and loam. Despite of different characteristics of three soils, the adsorption capacity of the three soils was comparable. The adsorption of colistin to the three types of soils analyzed was irreversible. The degradation experiments showed that the degradation of colistin in the sandy loam was relatively slow with a degradation half-life in a range of 13.2-29.7 days when colistin was applied to the sandy loam at a level of 10 similar to 40 mu g/g. The degradation of colistin occurred in the mixture of the sandy loam and feces recovered from the colistin treated broiler as well. 25% of colistin remained in the mixture under environmental conditions after 14 days. Composting the sandy loam by directly covering the soil surface with colistin treated broilers' feces resulted in the introduction of colistin to the sandy loam. Colistin was observed in both the topsoil from the contact surface and sandy loam samples collected 20 cm below the contact surface. The understanding of adsorption-desorption behaviors, degradation and mobility of colistin in soils might offer insights into the potential impact of colistin on the emergence and prevalence of resistant bacteria and the ecological environment.

AB  - Pulmonary vascular remodeling and inflammation play an important role in the hypoxic-induced lung diseases. Our previous investigations showed that peptide from yak milk residues could alleviate inflammation. In this study, our results suggest that peptide (LV) from yak milk residues peptide had protective effect of lung in the animal models of hypoxic-induced lung injury. LV Gavage could improve pulmonary vascular remodeling in the lung tissues of hypoxic mice. A comprehensive analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics revealed that 5KETE, 8,9-EET, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1a might be potential targets to prevent lung injury in the hypoxic mice. These metabolites can be regulated by MAPK/VEGF and inflammatory pathways. Our data indicated that LV treatment could inhibit apoptosis and inflammation via Nrf2/NF- kappa B/MAPK/PHD-2 pathway and protected hypoxic-induced lung epithelial cells injury. Taken together, our results suggest that LV provides a novel therapeutic clue for the prevention of hypoxia-induced lung injury and inflammation -related lung diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary Livestock production needs to be improved to ensure global food security and meet the growing demand for food. A sheep's gestation length (the period from conception to birth) is usually about 150 days. We have discovered a novel sheep breed in Chitral, Pakistan, whose individuals may gestate for a relatively shorter period, i.e., 100 days, and yet can give birth to normal lambs. To explore the underlying genetic causes for this unique character we used DNA markers. This approach helped us identify some contrasting genetic variations among short-gestating (Kari-S) and long-gestating (Kari-L) Kari ewes. Two of the total 31 targeted DNA sites demonstrated an association with gestation length in Kari sheep. Following an in-depth analysis and further confirmation in other sheep breeds, these DNA sites may be linked to genes controlling gestating length in sheep. The findings from this study may open ways for faster sheep reproduction with reduced cost. Kari sheep inhabiting the Chitral district of Pakistan show variation in gestation length. In this study, we have analyzed the genetic differences between the three subtypes of Kari sheep (based on variation in gestation length) using microsatellite markers. Kari sheep samples were collected from their breeding tract and were characterized for gestation length and genetic diversity using microsatellite markers. A total of 78 Kari ewes were grouped into three categories based on gestation length (GL), i.e., Kari-S (with a shorter GL), Kari-M (with a medium GL), and Kari-L (with a longer GL). DNA from these samples was used to amplify 31 ovine-specific microsatellite loci through PCR. Of the total 78 Kari specimens, 24 were grouped in Kari-S (GL = 100.7 +/- 1.8), 26 were from the Kari-M subtype (GL = 123.1 +/- 1.0), and 28 were Kari-L (GL = 143.8 +/- 1.5). Microsatellite analysis revealed an association of genotypes at two marker sites (MAF214 and ILSTS5) with variation in GL. A total of 158 alleles were detected across the 22 polymorphic loci with an average of 7.18 alleles per locus. Unique alleles were found in all three subtypes. The highest number of unique alleles was observed in Kari-L (15), followed by Kari-S (10) and Kari-M (8). The results indicated that Kari-S is a genetically distinct subtype (with higher genetic differentiation and distance) from Kari-M and Kari-L. The genetic uniqueness of Kari-S is important for further exploration of the genetic basis for shorter gestation length, and exploitation of their unique values.

AB  - In this study, a model for the spread of cyst echinococcosis with interventions is formulated. The disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model are calculated. The control reproduction number R-c for the model is derived, and the global dynamics are established by the values of R-c. The disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if and only if R-c < 1. For R-c > 1, using Volterra-Lyapunov stable matrices, it is proven that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential parameters in the dynamics of CE is carried out. To establish the long-term behaviour of the disease, numerical simulations are performed. The impact of control strategies is investigated. It is shown that, whenever vaccination of sheep is carried out solely or in combination with cleaning or disinfecting of the environment, cyst echinococcosis can be wiped out.

AB  - Anxiety is a state of mind with some fear that affects physical health by disrupting neurotransmission and hormonal control. Both diet (inadequate and unhealthy dietary patterns) and environment (social and financial factors) trigger its progression; therefore, diet is considered to have a significant involvement in its prevention or adjunct therapy. A unique nutrient profile and bioactive ingredients are seen in fruits to provide health outcomes beyond nutritive properties. The relaxing potential of such fruits is attributed to the functional nature and therapeutic ingredients i.e., catecholamines, myricetin, quercetin, betalains, etc. that enhance the efficiency of hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolic pathways. This review presented certain fruits having positive associations with mental health and anxiety amelioration. Various types of research evidenced the anxiolytic effect of certain fruits through clinical trials. Among them, berries, opuntia, and black pepper also have shown anxiety- relieving effects in clinical studies by restoring antioxidant enzymes, hormonal modulations, and managing neurotransmitters. Citrus species are loaded with flavonoids which are involved in the expression of GABA (Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid) to calm the nervous system. Some other fruits also potentiate memory and cognition when taken in ample amounts owing to their secondary metabolites. Thus, the incorporation of such fruits into a regular diet has been found to have a significant impact on mental well-being and brain health.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the influence of the addition of autolyzed brewer's yeast on the productivity and the health status of weaned pigs. A scientific and economic experiment was conducted at the Agricultural Institute - Shumen with 2 groups of 21 pigs in each group, or a total of 42 weaned pigs of the Danube white breed. The pigs were reared in raised pens of 7 pigs in a pen, 3 pens in a group. The animals were equalized by live weight, sex and origin. The experiment started at 9.385-9.464 kg of live weight and ended when it reached 28.95-30.786 kg. In the compound feed of the pigs in the experimental group, the 3% of the soybean meal was replaced with added autolyzed brewer's yeast. The inclusion of autolyzed brewer's yeast (replacing 3% of soybean meal in the compound feed) in weaned pigs (9.385- 9.464 kg to 28.95-30.786 kg lw) of the Danube White breed indicated a tendency for higher daily gain by 8.82% and lower feed conversion ratio per kg gain by 6.93%. Addition of autolyzed brewer's yeast leads to optimization of lipid metabolism and changes some hematological parameters within physiological reference values.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eliciting host plant resistance using plant hormones such as jasmonates has the potential to protect seeds and seedlings against insect pests; however, several hurdles exist for adapting it for pest management. This includes determining a dose that promotes resistance without limiting plant growth, an application method that growers could use, and ensuring the plants are responsive in the abiotic conditions when the pest occurs. In laboratory and field assays, we tested if treating corn seeds with multiple concentrations of methyl jasmonate would reduce the preference of ovipositing seed corn maggot adults and the performance of larvae feeding on seeds.
   RESULTS: We found that corn seeds soaked in aqueous 0.2 mM methyl jasmonate solution showed marginally lower seedling growth, but the adult oviposition preference was similar to 60% lower on these seeds compared to control water-soaked seeds. Seeds that were treated with methyl jasmonate using a conventional polymer-based seed coating showed no effect on seedling growth but reduced adult oviposition preference. In no-choice bioassays with adult flies, we found reduced oviposition on seeds soaked with aqueous methyl jasmonate compared to controls. Larval survival to pupation was also lower in methyl jasmonate-treated seeds. Lastly, the methyl jasmonate-induced resistance also occurred at the lower temperatures typical of the spring soil conditions when this fly is most damaging.
   CONCLUSION: Methyl jasmonate seed treatment in aqueous solution or using conventional polymer-based technology, has the potential to deter adult oviposition and reduce maggot performance in spring temperature conditions with minor effects on seed germination and growth.

AB  - IntroductionTreatment strategies for depression based on interventions for glucose and lipid metabolism disorders are receiving increasing attention. Investigating the mechanism of their antidepressant effect and exploring new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers have attracted increasing attention. Dulaglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, has been reported to alleviate cognitive deficits and neuronal damage. However, the antidepressant effect of dulaglutide and, especially, the underlying mechanism are still poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the underlying biomarkers of depression and potential modulatory targets of dulaglutide in chronic mild stress (CMS) mice.MethodsSixty mice were randomly divided into a control group (CON group), a CMS+Vehicle group (CMS+Veh group), a CMS+0.3 mg/kg dulaglutide group (Low Dula group), and a CMS+0.6 mg/kg dulaglutide group (High Dula group). Numerous behavioral tests, mainly the open field test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test, were applied to evaluate the potential effect of dulaglutide treatment on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to chronic stress. Furthermore, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was utilized to investigate the associated mechanisms of dulaglutide treatment.ResultsThree weeks of dulaglutide treatment significantly reversed depressive-like but not anxiety-like behaviors in mice exposed to chronic stress for 4 weeks. The results from the metabolomics analysis showed that a total of 20 differentially expressed metabolites were identified between the CON and CMS+Veh groups, and 46 metabolites were selected between the CMS+Veh and High Dula groups in the hippocampus of the mice. Comprehensive analysis indicated that lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism were disrupted in model mice that experienced depression and underwent dulaglutide therapy.ConclusionThe antidepressant effects of dulaglutide in a CMS depression model were confirmed. We identified 64 different metabolites and four major pathways associated with metabolic pathophysiological processes. These primary data provide a new perspective for understanding the antidepressant-like effects of dulaglutide and may facilitate the use of dulaglutide as a potential therapeutic strategy for depression.
   In this article, the antidepressant effects of dulaglutide in a CMS depression model were confirmed. We identified a total of 20 differentially metabolites between the CON and CMS+Veh groups and 46 metabolites between the CMS+Veh and High Dula groups in the hippocampus of mice. Four major pathways, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism, were ultimately determined to be associated with metabolic pathophysiological processes. image

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a powerful tool for identifying the spatial and temporal presence and density of species in a range of aquatic habitats. The analysis of eDNA has a wide range of application, one of which may be to inform of Fasciola hepatica infection risk on pastures based on the detection of its eDNA as well as that of its intermediate snail host, Galba truncatula eDNA. Here, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays were developed to detect the eDNA of F. hepatica, and its intermediate snail host, G. truncatula in water samples collected from pastures grazed by cattle and/or sheep. Environmental factors associated with species presence, as detected via an eDNA survey, were identified using zero-inflated linear mixed models. Sixty-four habitats were sampled across six farms in Ceredigion, Wales, UK, with ddPCR and qPCR identifying 42 and 33 habitats to be positive for G. truncatula eDNA, respectively. G. truncatula eDNA was significantly less likely to be detected in habitats fully shaded by trees, those that contained black or dark brown soils and habitats that contained deep water pools (p < 0.05). Significantly higher G. truncatula eDNA concentrations were observed in habitats that tend to dry up during Summer (i.e., temporary habitats) (p < 0.05). ddPCR also identified five habitats to be positive for F. hepatica eDNA; however, questions remain regarding the utility of F. hepatica eDNA detection due to a lack of specificity toward infective F. hepatica larval stages. The results of this study inform of factors which influences G. truncatula distribution and ecology on pastures and also provided practical information for farmers to aid F. hepatica control in their flocks and herds.

AB  - This research was conducted to examine the seasonal fluctuations in the ability to remediate nutrients of Mentha longifolia in eutrophic waterbodies through biomass harvesting and estimating its potential use as animal feed. Samples of plants, water, and sediment were collected seasonally from six eutrophic and three freshwater sites. In the eutrophic waterbody, the highest fresh and dry biomass (47.9 and 22.4 g/m(2), respectively) was recorded in summer, while the lowest (23.6 and 9.5 g/m(2)) was recorded in autumn. The aboveground parts had the highest concentrations of Na, K, and Ca (212.3, 327.2, and 16.7 mg/kg) during autumn, while the highest N concentration (24.4 mg/kg) was recorded during summer. The roots in the eutrophic waterbody had substantially higher concentrations of Na, N, Ca, P, and Mg (183.8, 11.1, 11.4, 7.4, and 1.9 mg/kg) compared to those in the roots of the freshwater Nile (165.2, 3.6, 13.4, 5.6, and 0.8 mg/kg). The wild mint's aboveground tissues removed the highest amounts of Na, K, Ca, P, and Mg (4.5, 6.4, 363.0, 152.4, and 47.1 g/m(2)) during spring, while the highest N removal (437.7 g/m(2)) occurred during summer. The total digestible nutrients (TDN) of the wild mint above-and below-ground portions exceeds 50.0% of the breeding cattle's dietary needs. Moreover, the metabolized energy (ME: 1.6-2.2 Mcal/kg) was close to the requirements for breeding cattle and sheep. The best time to harvest wild mint to remediate Na, K, Ca, P, and Mg from eutrophic wetlands is spring, while summer is optimal for removing N and using the biomass as fodder.

AB  - We have investigated the occurrence, distribution, and biomagnification of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in two tropical lakes (Asejire and Eleyele) of Southwestern Nigeria, with contrasting urban intensities. Over an 8-month period, we sampled sediment and fish species (Clarias gariepinus: CIG; Oreochromis niloticus: ON; Coptodon guineensis: CG; Sarotherodon melanotheron: SM) across trophic levels, and analyzed various PFAS congeners, in addition to a select group of toxicological responses. While herbivores (SM) and benthic omnivores (CIG) at Asejire exhibited elevated levels of PFBS and PFOS, the pelagic omnivores (ON) showed a dominance of PFOS, PFDA, PFHxDA and EtFOSE in the muscle. At the Eleyele urban lake, PFAS patterns was dominated by PFBS, EtFOSE, PFPeS, PFOcDA and PFOS in the herbivores (SM, CG), EtFOSE, PFOS and PFBS in the pelagic omnivore (ON) and benthic omnivore (ClG). The estimated biomagnification factor (BMF) analysis for both lakes indicated trophic level increase of PFOS, PFUnA and PFDA at the suburban lake, while PFOS and EtFOSE biomagnified at the urban lake. We detected the occurrence of diSAMPAP and 9CL-PF3ONS, novel compounds not commonly reported, in PFAS studies at both lakes. The studied toxicological responses varied across trophic groups in both lakes with probable modulations by environmental conditions, trophic structure, and relative PFAS exposures in the lakes. The present study documents, for the first time in Nigeria, or any other African country, the role of urbanization on contaminant load into the environment and their implications for contaminant dynamics within the ecosystem and for aquatic food safety.

AB  - Simple Summary The bioavailability of dietary zinc (Zn) in pigs is of importance for the Zn supply to the pig but also for Zn excretion through manure to the environment. The bioavailability of added Zn may differ according to the source of Zn applied but is also affected by other dietary components. The aim of this study was to determine biomarkers of Zn bioavailability (Zn digestibility and serum Zn status) following six different sources of Zn added at 100 mg/kg feed (two of the sources were also provided at 1000 mg/kg) and their effect on the productivity and faecal consistency score in piglets 0-3 weeks after weaning day 28. The digestibility of Zn on day 14 post-weaning was negative for all six Zn sources when added at 100 mg Zn/kg, indicating insufficient Zn supply. The Zn digestibility at 100 mg Zn/kg was affected by the Zn source but was not lower for traditional inorganic Zn oxide and Zn sulphate compared with processed inorganic or chelated organic sources of Zn. However, there were no differences in the serum Zn status, feed intake, gain or probability of diarrhoea depending on the Zn source when supplied at 100 mg/kg. The bioavailability of dietary zinc (Zn) in pigs may differ according to the Zn source and is affected by other components in the diet. The aim was to determine the biomarkers of Zn bioavailability (apparent total tract digestibility of Zn and serum Zn status) following six different sources of added Zn and their effect on the performance and faecal consistency score in piglets 0-3 weeks after weaning on day 28. The sources of Zn were Zn oxide (ZnO), Zn sulfate (ZnSO4), porous ZnO, Zn-glycinate, amino acid-bound Zn and hydroxy covalent-bound Zn added at 100 mg/kg (ZnO and ZnSO4 also added at 1000 mg/kg), in a total of eight treatments (n = 12/treatment). Pigs were individually housed, and titanium dioxide was included as an indigestible marker in the feed. The digestibility of Zn on day 14 post-weaning was negative for all six Zn sources at 100 mg Zn/kg, indicating insufficient Zn supply. The digestibility of Zn differed according to the Zn source, but the digestibility of Zn from ZnO and ZnSO4 did not differ between processed inorganic or chelated organic sources of Zn. However, the differences in Zn digestibility between Zn sources were not reflected as differences in the serum Zn status, feed intake, gain or probability of diarrhoea.

AB  - Soybean isoflavones (SIFs), a group of secondary metabolites, have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hormone-like activities. Supplementation with SIFs in the diet was reported to promote lactation performance in ruminants. The present study was performed to further decipher the effect of various concentrations of SIFs on growth and slaughter performance, serum parameters, meat quality, and ruminal microbiota in fattening goats. After a two-week acclimation, a total of 27 5-month-old Guanzhong male goats (18.29 +/- 0.44 kg) were randomly assigned to control (NC), 100 mg/d SIF (SIF1), or 200 mg/d SIF (SIF2) groups. The experimental period lasted 56 days. The weight of the large intestine was greater (p < 0.05) in the SIF1 and SIF2 groups compared with the NC group. Meat quality parameters indicated that SIF1 supplementation led to lower (p < 0.05) cooking loss and shear force (0.05 < p < 0.10). The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that SIF1 supplementation led to lower (p < 0.05) proportions of Papillibacter and Prevotellaceae_UCG-004 but greater (p < 0.05) CAG-352 abundance in the rumen; these responses might have contributed to the improvement in production performance. In conclusion, meat quality and ruminal microbiome could be manipulated in a positive way by oral supplementation with 100 mg/d of SIFs in fattening goats. Thus, this study provides new insights and practical evidence for the introduction of SIFs as a novel additive in goat husbandry.

AB  - BackgroundHybridization is generally considered an important creative evolutionary force, yet this evolutionary process is still poorly characterized in karst plants. In this study, we focus on natural hybridization in yellow Camellia species, a group of habitat specialists confined to karst/non-karst habitats in southwestern China.ResultsBased on population genome data obtain from double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing, we found evidence for natural hybridization and introgression between C. micrantha and C. flavida, and specifically confirmed their hybrid population, C. "ptilosperma". Ecophysiological results suggested that extreme hydraulic traits were fixed in C. "ptilosperma", these being consistent with its distinct ecological niche, which lies outside its parental ranges.ConclusionThe identified hybridization event is expected to have played a role in generating novel variation during, in which the hybrid population displays different phenological characteristics and novel ecophysiological traits associated with the colonization of a new niche in limestone karst.

AB  - The coordination of respiration and swallowing is a life-critical function in infants. Varying volume and rate of milk delivery changes swallowing frequency and bolus volume but any impact on swallow-respiration coordination is unknown. Five infant pigs were filmed with simultaneous high speed videofluoroscopy and plethysmography while feeding from an automatic system delivering milk across a range of volumes and frequencies. Swallow inspiration delay, respiratory cycle duration, and distribution of inspiratory and expiratory swallows were calculated. At constant volume, there were more inspiratory phase swallows when frequency increased. At high constant frequency, increasing volume changed swallow-respiration coordination patterns, with increased occurrence of inspiratory phase swallows. Respiratory cycle duration did not change in response to changes in oral milk delivery. These results suggest that the observed pattern of expiratory swallowing in infants is achieved primarily by regulation of milk intake, not modulation of respiratory patterns by oral sensation.
   We tested the effect of modulating volume and frequency of milk delivery on swallow-respiration coordination in infant pigs. Respiratory rate did not change, resulting in more frequent inspiratory phase swallows as swallow rate increased.

AB  - Pig bedding biochar (PBBC) and Cd-enriched Perilla frutescens were used for joint remediation of Cd-contaminated soil. Cd-contaminated soil was treated with different concentration of PBBC. The physiological and biochemical indicators of P. frutescens was evaluated under different Cd stress, including biomass, antioxidant system. Meanwhile Cd bioavailability, enzyme activity and nutrient bioavailability of the soil were monitored. Results revealed that PBBC at 1 % and 5 % levels led to decreased diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-extractable Cd (DTPA-Cd) content in soil by 19.09 %-20.05 % and 30.10 %-47.08 %, respectively. Moreover, PBBC promoted the transformation of exchangeable Cd (EXC-Cd) into a more stable form, enhanced soil enzymes (peroxidase, acid phosphatase, urease, and sucrase) activities, and alleviated P. frutescens 's oxidative stress. PBBC increased its biomass, consequently enhancing Cd accumulation in the plant's, thereby improving Phytoextraction rate (PER). 1 % PBBC showed the best effect, with a total biomass increased 21.42 %-26.94 %, PER was enhanced by 39.83 %-54.82 %.

AB  - Salinity and sodicity greatly influences ongoing physical processes in soils. Organic matter may rehabilitate physical and mechanical properties of soils. Vermicompost as an amendment influences moisture-related parameters including consistency (plastic - PL and liquid limit - LL) and compaction. This study was conducted on soils (sandy-clay-loam) treated with different salinity levels (0.58 (control - irrigation water quality, tap water), 4 and 8 dS m(-1)) to investigate the effects of different vermicompost doses (0% (control), 2.5% and 5% w/w) on soil consistency limits and compaction. The pot experiment was carried out in a total of 27 pots, i.e. 3 (vermicompost doses) x 3 (salinity levels) x 3 (number of replicates). For Proctor compaction properties, maximum dry bulk density (MDD) reduced and optimum water contents (OWC) increased with increasing vermicompost doses under different salinity levels (p < .01). Increasing vermicompost doses under the lowest salinity level (0.58 dS m(-1)) yielded increasing optimum water contents for control (LL = 35.93% and PL = 25.85%). Optimum water contents were determined as 42.19% (LL) and 29.93% (PL) for 2.5% vermicompost dose and as 47.33% (LL) and 36.01% (PL) for 5% vermicompost dose under the lowest salinity level. LL, PL, OWC and MDD were significantly affected by vermicompost x salinity interactions. The highest maximum dry bulk density (1.92 g cm(3)) and the lowest optimum water contents (13.50%) were obtained from 0% vermicompost under the 8 dS m(-1) NaCl level. Mean weight diameter (MWD) values ranged from 0.690 mm for 0% VC treatment under high Na salt level (8 dS m(-1) NaCl) to 0.821 mm for 5% VC treatment under lowest Na salt level (0.58 dS m(-1) NaCl). The correlations between aggregate stability (particle size group 1-2 mm) and optimum water content were 0.647*, 0.587* and 0.598* as compared to correlations of -0.512*, -0.470*, and -0.617** between aggregate stability (particle size group 1-2 mm) and maximum dry bulk density for the 0, 4 and 8 dS m(-1) NaCl levels, respectively. MWD was positively correlated with OWC (0.386*) and negatively correlated with MDD (-0.385*). The greatest (2.39%) and the lowest (0.32%) soil organic matter values were respectively observed in 5% VC under the lowest salinity level (0.58 dS m(-1)) and 0% VC with at high Na salt level (8 dS m(-1) NaCl). It was concluded that vermicompost reduced compaction-induced damage in soils.

AB  - Maize is the most important staple crop in the world; 1.15 billion tons were produced in 2019. Insect herbivores cause significant damage for maize production, and as a result, global pesticide use has increased over the last 20 years causing severe environmental degradation and negative impacts on human health. Today, there is a trend toward including more sustainable management practices that are less harmful to biodiversity and human health. One such a practice is the use of natural enemies to regulate pest populations using conservation biocontrol or introduction of biocontrol agents. These practices have been in place for several decades in different cultivation systems and regions throughout the world, however; information about the effects of more sustainable management practices on maize production is scarce. We conducted an expert assessment to evaluate whether there are any general trends or consensus about the importance of biocontrol for maize production globally. We compiled information from 70 experts from 28 different countries using an online survey. Of those surveyed, 91% of experts agreed that biocontrol was important for maize production regardless the type of maize they study, the final harvest destination or crop use, or management regime. Using the information obtained, we identify several opportunities for engaging with farmers in order to use biocontrol as a tool toward agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Benign theileriosis, caused by the members of the Theileria orientalis complex, can develop fatal clinical outbreaks characterized by acute respiratory manifestation in stressful conditions. This report describes the molecular diagnosis and clinical management of a recently transported buffalo calf with severe Theileria buffeli infection and associated acute pneumonia. A five-month-old male buffalo calf having an inter-state travel history three days back was presented with pyrexia, anorexia, weakness, mucoid rhinorrhoea, dyspnoea and diarrhoea from the day of procurement. The history and physical examination revealed a clinical presentation similar to shipping fever. Whereas, severe parasitemia of Theileria spp. with anaemia, thrombocytopenia and granulopenia were evident on laboratory investigation. The Theileria spp. infection was confirmed by PCR method using specific primers and the authentication was made by detailed sequence analysis. The small subunit rRNA was amplified using universal apicomplexan primers and the phylogenetic analysis was carried out for further characterisation. The animal was stabilized by steroid nebulization therapy and the specific chemotherapy was instigated using buparvaquone and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination. Supportive medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, antidiarrhoeals and vitamins were provided symptomatically. The animal showed a good response to therapy and recovered from parasitemia by day 10 and the molecular clearance was later confirmed on day 70 of therapy. The present case of Theileria buffeli infected buffalo calf with acute respiratory signs points towards the possible hemoparasitic outbreaks in transport-stressed animals with the signs of shipping fever-associated syndrome.

AB  - Plants are equipped with various defensive attributes against herbivores, including volatile and nonvolatile compounds. In maize plants, benzoxazinoids mediate resistance against some herbivores, with the most abundant being (2R)-2-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA-Glc), and its corresponding aglucone 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA). Both compounds have been shown to interfere in the larval development of generalist herbivores but are less effective on specialist, that is, grass-feeding, herbivores. Using a Brazilian population of Spodoptera frugiperda, we investigated (i) the level of constitutive benzoxazinoids in Neotropical maize genotypes, that is, Zapalote Chico, Mirt 2A, Sintetico Spodoptera, L3, BRS 4103 and BRS 1040 (ii) the effect of S. frugiperda herbivory on benzoxazinoid levels in these genotypes and (iii) the impact of the genotypes on the development of S. frugiperda larvae. The results showed that the six maize genotypes produce different levels of benzoxazinoids, with Mirt 2A and BRS 1040 producing constitutively higher levels of HDMBOA-Glc and DIMBOA-Glc respectively compared to the other genotypes. When feeding on BRS 1040 and Mirt 2A, S. frugiperda larvae took an additional week to pupate, but this effect does not affect larval survival, what was the same and high on all the genotypes (>70%). Furthermore, production of DIMBOA-Glc and HDMBOA-Glc in these genotypes was suppressed, suggesting that S. frugiperda larvae can alter maize defence plant responses. In summary, our results demonstrate that Neotropical maize genotypes produce varying levels of benzoxazinoids, genotypes respond differently to S. frugiperda herbivory and S. frugiperda is able to cope with secondary metabolite-based defence in Neotropical maize.

AB  - Simple Summary This research investigates the influence of limited human socialization on the socio-cognitive abilities and interactions with unfamiliar individuals of a selected group of domesticated dogs and goats. Both dogs and goats were raised and kept under conditions with limited human socialization, and their behavior was examined through the "impossible task" paradigm. Dogs exhibited higher interaction frequencies with human experimenters compared to goats, indicating a potential inclination for engaging with humans. However, no significant differences were observed in interaction duration and latency, underscoring the intricate nature of these interactions. This study underscores the necessity of considering the multifaceted aspects of social behavior and cognition, especially within domesticated animals characterized by diverse behavioral ecologies and domestication histories.Abstract The study aimed to explore how limited human socialization affects the socio-cognitive abilities and interactions with unfamiliar individuals of a selected group of domesticated dogs and goats. These animals were raised and kept under conditions characterized by limited human socialization, and their behavior was assessed using the "impossible task" paradigm. The study found that dogs, with a history of cooperative interactions and human companionship, exhibited more frequent social engagement with human experimenters in the experimental setting than goats, traditionally domesticated for utilitarian purposes. However, differences in interaction duration and latency were not significant, highlighting the complexity of these interactions. The results suggest that domestication history and behavioral ecology play significant roles in shaping animals' willingness to engage with humans. However, this study acknowledges limitations, such as the specific population studied, and calls for further research with larger and more diverse samples to generalize these findings. Understanding the interplay between domestication history, behavioral ecology, and human socialization could provide insights into the complex factors influencing animal-human interactions and cognitive behaviors, with implications for animal welfare and human-animal relationships.

AB  - Intensive livestock production has been increasing, and has resulted in the emission of more than seven teragram per year of ammonia (NH3) in China in recent years. However, little is known about the fate of the emitted NH3, especially the dry deposition of NH3 in the environs of intensive animal farms. In this study, the spatial and temporal variations of NH3 deposition in the environs of an intensive fattening pig farm were investigated in the central south of China. NH3 concentrations were measured at sites situated 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 m in the downwind direction from the farm each month from July 2018 to June 2019. The NH3 deposition was calculated based on a bidirectional NH3 exchange model. The monthly NH3 emissions from the pig farm were estimated based on the breeding stock. The annual average NH3 concentrations ranged from 1200 to 14 mu g m(-3) at the downwind sites within 500 m of the pig farm, exhibiting exponential decay as distance increased. Strong seasonality in NH3 deposition was observed, with the highest season being in the summer and lowest in the winter, and air temperature was found to be an important factor affecting this seasonal variation. The estimated monthly total dry deposition within 500 m of the pig farm ranged from 92 to 1400 kg NH3-N mo(-1), which accounted for 4.1%-14% of the total monthly NH3 emissions from the pig farm. The estimated total NH3 emissions and NH3 deposition from the pig farm were 63 000 kg NH3-N yr(-1) and 5400 kg NH3-N yr(-1), respectively, with the annual average ratio of NH3 deposition to NH3 emission being 8.6%. This study found NH3 deposition around intensive pig farms is high, and determined it as a significant fate of the NH3 emitted from pig farms.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is the most important factor that affects soil quality. In arid areas, lack of SOM causes a major problem and farmers need to add organic amendments to restore the soil quality. Organic waste composting is an efficient and sustainable way to produce organic resource for soil amendment. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of compost derived from co-composting of date palm residues with goat manure to ameliorate soil quality in arid region in the southeast of Tunisia. Palm tree wastes were co-composted with goat manure (1/3 v:v) for 120 days. Chemical properties and structural changes of humic acids (HA) during the composting process were investigated using physicochemical and spectroscopic analyses: spectroscopic ultraviolet/visible (UV) analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. HA fractions extracted from different steps of composting process were monitored by measuring humification ratios C-HA/C-FA and E-4/E-6. Soil was amended with produced compost and manure during 3 months, and soil property evolution was evaluated using chemical and spectroscopic analyses. Results revealed that the date palm compost displayed neutral pH, a C/N ratio of about 12 and high levels of nutrients. FTIR spectra of HA extracted from produced compost and manure showed the abundance of aromatic structures with a high condensation and polymerization confirmed by a low E-4/E-6 ratio related to the increase in polymerization and polycondensation and a high C-HA/C-FA humification rate that improved the elevation of the humification degree. The application of the produced palm compost in soil improved soil quality by increasing levels of SOM and nutrients and showed a marked improvement of humification rate. The FTIR spectra of soil HA showed a clear increase in aromatic structures that improved soil stability. The input of palm compost is an efficient way to ameliorate arid soil quality by supplying highly humified organic matter restitution.

AB  - Oxygen is a prominent element in the well-being of humans, but also responsible for causing tissue damage. The oxygen molecule gets reduced to form a highly reactive oxygen species due to various metabolic events happening in the host. The generated free radicals could react with other biomolecules like protein, lipid, carbohydrate and nucleic acid to impart severe diseases and disorders. Antioxidants could effectively block the oxidation process by neutralizing the produced free radicals. Hence, the present study aims to validate the potent antioxidant activities of Couroupita guianensis Aubl. using goat liver slices that could serve as an in vivo simulated in vitro model. The methanolic extract and the alkaloid fraction of both leaves and flowers of C. guianensis Aubl. were prepared and their enzymatic and non -enzymatic antioxidant activities were evaluated. Hydrogen peroxide was used as a standard free radical throughout the experiments in all the treatment groups. The results have envisaged that the plant has enormous antioxidant activities in oxidatively stressed goat liver slices to combat various oxidative stress -related diseases and disorders. Conclusively, the in vitro model system to explore the antioxidant profiles will eventually mitigate the sacrifice of animals by exactly mimicking the in vivo conditions for research endeavors.

AB  - Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a secondary metabolite of some Aspergillus species that contaminate the agricultural commodities intended for animal and human consumption. The present in vivo study aimed to evaluate activated charcoal (AC) for its ability to reduce AFB1-induced immune suppressive effects in broiler chickens. One-day-old broiler chicks were divided into 12 groups (n = 30) and raised until 42 days of age. One control group was offered basal broiler feed. Three AFB1 groups were kept on AFB1-contaminated basal broiler feed (0.1, 0.2, and 0.6 mg/kg AFB1, respectively), whereas two AC groups were offered AC-added basal broiler feed (2.5 and 5.0 g/kg AC, respectively). Six combination groups were maintained on a combination of different doses of AFB1 and AC. The immune protective efficacy of AC was assessed by anti-sheep RBC's antibodies, phagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system, phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P)-induced cutaneous basophil response, and histopathological and morphometric analysis of lymphoid organs. Dietary exposure to AFB1 alone resulted in dose-dependent suppression of immune responses and degenerative and necrotic changes in the bursa of Fabricius and thymus. The dietary addition of AC reduced the toxic effects of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg dietary AFB1 on immune responses and histological lesion on lymphoid organs; however, at higher dietary level of AFB1 (0.6 mg AFB1/kg), the dietary addition of AC was not effective to prevent the immunotoxic effects. The results of this study suggested that dietary inclusion of AC has the ability to prevent immunotoxic effects induced by AFB1 at lower dietary contaminations levels in broiler chickens.

AB  - This study assessed the distribution of heavy metals in the gills, kidney, and liver, correlated with the severity of histopathological changes, of three fish species with different feeding habitats (Barbus barbus, Squalius cephalus, and Chondrostoma nasus) from the Crisul Negru river, Romania. The levels of copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in fish tissues were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Histopathology and the expressions of TNF-alpha and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Our data suggest a significant correlation between the bioconcentration level of metals and structural changes. The carnivorous species was the most affected compared to the omnivorous and herbivorous ones, and the most affected organ was the kidney. Moreover, the correlation of tissue damage with the PCNA and TNF-alpha expression levels revealed that the herbivorous species presented less extended lesions, likely due to higher activated repair mechanisms and lower levels of inflammation. In conclusion, our data and the subsequent statistical analysis suggest that feeding behavior could be correlated with the histopathological alterations and might be used for a more profound evaluation of aquatic environment safety and analysis of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Classical biological control of weeds is a strategy for managing invasive plants, reassociating coevolved herbivores with their hosts in weeds' adventive ranges. A modified open field test was conducted to assess the ecological host range of two biological control agents, Floracarus perrepae Knihinicki & Boczek (Prostigmata: Eriophyidae) and Neomusotima conspurcatalis (Warren) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), on nontarget ferns. These biological control agents are released to aid in the management of Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br. (Lygodiaceae), an invasive fern that has had detrimental effects on ecosystems in south and central Florida. We examined nontarget ferns at four sites in Florida for evidence of biological control agent presence/damage, which would be an indication of an expanded ecological host range compared to the physiological host range determined during quarantine studies. The sites were visited multiple times between July 2021 and March 2023, and ferns were examined for evidence of feeding, larval presence, and oviposition. Neither agents nor indicators of their presence were observed on nontarget species. The mite F. perrepae was observed at the three sites on the eastern coast but failed to establish itself at the location on the western coast. In contrast, N. conspurcatalis was found at all locations, although its presence was not consistent across sites over time. Population monitoring indicated both agents were present in sufficient numbers to enable observation of spillover effects, but none were observed. This ecological host range testing validated the predicted physiological host ranges for the two biological control agents, confirming their high specificity to the target fern as observed during laboratory host range testing.

AB  - The fuel cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) between Uranium-Zirconium-based metallic fuel and cladding materials during in-pile service is one of the most constraining phenomena affecting the performance of this fuel system. In this study, we investigated the effect of temperature and burnup on the FCCI development in two U-10 wt.% Zr (U-10Zr) fuel samples with HT-9 cladding irradiated as part of the MFF-3 irradiation test in the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF). One sample achieved a burnup of 13.1 at.% and operated with an average inner cladding temperature of 530 degrees C, while the other achieved a burnup of 8.5 at.% and was subjected to an average inner cladding temperature of 615 degrees C. Automated scanning electron microscopy (SEM) back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging of entire fuel cross-sections and SEM energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis on specific fuel-cladding interface regions successfully provided a comprehensive characterization of the depth and type of interaction happening under different irradiation conditions. Our analysis shows that FCCI development on both fuel and cladding side is strongly influenced by the inner cladding temperature and, to some extent, the formation and integrity of Zr-rich layers between the fuel and cladding, while the impact of burnup and power is negligible. Measured FCCI thicknesses were compared to BISON simulations using both an empirical model based upon legacy data from the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR II) irradiations and a mechanistic model currently under development for the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program, showing satisfactory agreement. Nonetheless, this comparison supports the need for additional microstructural characterization in intermediate ranges of temperature, power, and burnups in prototypic-length pins.

AB  - Paddy soil is an important terrestrial carbon (C) pool. Understanding the impact of organic amendments on soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization pathways is critical for the accurate estimation of C storage potential and SOM stability in paddy soil. However, the impact of organic matter amendment on plant- and microbe-derived C distribution within different SOM fractions, i.e., particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral -associated organic matter (MAOM), remains poorly understood. To address the knowledge gap, five fertilization treatments were selected from a 40 -year field experiment: no fertilizer (CK), inorganic NPK fertilizer (NPK), inorganic NPK combined with green manure (GM), inorganic NPK combined with green manure and pig manure (GM+PM), and inorganic NPK combined with green manure and rice straw (GM+RS). The application of organic amendments increased total SOC content through promotion of POM formation. Organic amendments increased both microbe- and plant-derived C contents in POM, and the GM+PM treatment had the greatest impact. In MAOM, organic amendments only altered the proportions of plant- and microbe-derived C, particularly increasing the proportions of bacterial-derived C. Organic amendments also led to the accumulation of less decomposed plant-derived C (C type lignin phenols) in POM, while more decomposed plant-derived C (V type lignin phenols) was stabilized within MAOM. The major factors driving microbe- and plant-derived C fraction distribution varied between the POM and MAOM fraction, i.e., C/N ratio of the exogenous organic materials was the dominant factor in POM, whereas DON and DOC were the primary factors in MAOM. The results of the present study enhance our understanding of the SOC stabilization pathways under organic amendments in paddy soil and offer insights into potential effective soil emissions and fertility management strategies.

AB  - Insect herbivores can regulate their food intake by mixing food sources with different nutrient content, but face the resulting challenge of ingesting various plant secondary metabolites. How insects deal with toxins in a complex nutrient environment is unclear. Here we investigated the influence of a classic plant secondary metabolite, allyl glucosinolate (sinigrin), and its hydrolyzed product allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), on the development of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) when fed on diets with different protein-to-carbohydrate (p : c) ratios. We also examined the effects of these toxins on larval biochemistry, by chemically analyzing the frass produced by insects feeding on the different diets. As expected, AITC had a greater negative effect than sinigrin on H. armigera life-history traits. However, AITC at low concentration appeared to have a positive effect on some traits. Both sinigrin and AITC-induced detoxification activity in the gut, and the reaction was related to diet protein concentration. High-protein diets can provide the required free amino acid, especially cysteine, needed for the detoxification process. The nutrient content of the diet influences how plant secondary metabolites are handled, and the use of artificial diets in experiments investigating the metabolic fate of plant secondary compounds needs to be carefully evaluated.

AB  - Introduction: Altered signaling or function of acetylcholine (ACh) has been reported in various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy among others. Many neurons that release ACh also co-transmit the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) at synapses in the hippocampus, striatum, substantia nigra, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Although ACh transmission is crucial for higher brain functions such as learning and memory, the role of co-transmitted GABA from ACh neurons in brain function remains unknown. Thus, the overarching goal of this study was to investigate how a systemic loss of GABA co-transmission from ACh neurons affected the behavioral performance of mice.Methods: To do this, we used a conditional knock-out mouse of the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) crossed with the ChAT-Cre driver line to selectively ablate GABA co-transmission at ACh synapses. In a comprehensive series of standardized behavioral assays, we compared Cre-negative control mice with Cre-positive vGAT knock-out mice of both sexes.Results: Loss of GABA co-transmission from ACh neurons did not disrupt the animal's sociability, motor skills or sensation. However, in the absence of GABA co-transmission, we found significant alterations in social, spatial and fear memory as well as a reduced reliance on striatum-dependent response strategies in a T-maze. In addition, male conditional knockout (CKO) mice showed increased locomotion.Discussion: Taken together, the loss of GABA co-transmission leads to deficits in higher brain functions and behaviors. Therefore, we propose that ACh/GABA co-transmission modulates neural circuitry involved in the affected behaviors.

AB  - Tea gray blight is one of the most serious foliar diseases of tea tree, caused by the plant-pathogenic fungus Pseudopestalotiopsis theae, which can affect production and quality of tea worldwide. We generated a highly contiguous, 50.41-Mbp genome assembly (N-50 = 1.30 Mbp) of P. theae strain CYF27 by combining PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. We identified a total of 15,626 gene models, of which 1,038 genes encode putative secreted proteins. The high-quality genome assembly and annotation resource reported here will be useful for the study of fungal infection mechanisms and pathogen-host interaction.

AB  - The aim was to study the complementary effect between cereals and pulses on protein quality. The values for the digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) in cooked cereals and pulses, given alone, and blends of cooked cereals and pulses, were determined. True ileal digestibility (TID) values of amino acids for adult humans were obtained. It is difficult to determine ileal amino acid digestibility in humans directly, and for this reason, the growing pig is often used to obtain such values, as a preferred animal model. Seven growing pigs fitted with a T-cannula at the terminal ileum were allotted to a 7 x 6 incomplete Latin square with seven semi-synthetic diets (cooked mung bean, adzuki bean, millet, adlay, mung bean + millet, adzuki bean + adlay, and an N-free diet) and six 7-day periods. The mean TID values for crude protein differed significantly (p < 0.05), with millet having the highest digestibility (89.4%) and the adzuki bean/adlay mixture having the lowest (79.5%). For lysine, adzuki bean had the highest TID (90%) and millet had the lowest (70%). For the mean of all the amino acids, there was a significant (p < 0.05) effect of diet, with the TID ranging from 72.4% for the adzuki bean/adlay mixture to 89.9% for the adzuki beans. For the older child, adolescent, and adult, the DIAAS (%) was 93 for mung beans, 78 for adzuki beans, 22 for millet, 16 for adlay, and 66 for mung beans + millet, and 51 for adzuki beans + adlay. For mung beans, valine was first-limiting, and the SAA for adzuki beans, while lysine was first-limiting for the other foods. Chinese traditional diets, containing both cereals and pulses, are complementary for most, but not all of the indispensable amino acids.</p>

AB  - Soil salinization is a serious threat to the ecological environment and sustainable agricultural development in the arid regions of northwest China. Optimal soil salinization amelioration methods were eagerly explored under different soil salinity levels. Sesbania and hairy vetch are salt-tolerant plants, and green manure improved the saline environment. In this study, two leguminous halophytic crops, sesbania (Sesbania cannabina) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), were planted under different salinity levels, combined with three saline soil improvement measures, namely gravel mulching, manure application, and straw returning. No improvement measures and no salinity treatment was set as the control (CK). This study was conducted to analyze the effects of soil salinization improvement measures on the growth and ion uptake of sesbania and hairy vetch as biological measures under different soil salinity levels. Sesbania under manure application absorbed the highest soil Na+ (2.71 g kg-1) and Cl- (2.66 g kg-1) amounts at a soil salinity of 3.2 g kg-1, which was 14.7% and 10.95% higher than under gravel mulching and straw returning, respectively. Na+ and Cl- absorption of hairy vetch under manure application reached the highest value of 1.39 g kg-1 and 1.38 g kg-1 at a soil salinity of 1.6 g kg-1, which was 24.46% and 22.31% higher than under gravel mulching and straw returning, respectively. Plant height and stem diameter as well as root growth and development of sesbania and hairy vetch were limited at soil salinities greater than 1.6 g kg-1 and 0.8 g kg-1. Overall, sesbania and hairy vetch effectively absorbed both soil Na+ and Cl- under manure application, thus regulating soil salinity and reducing soil salinization. However, soil salinity levels greater than 3.2 g kg-1 and 1.6 g kg-1 not only weakened the ionic absorption capacity but also inhibited the growth and development of sesbania and hairy vetch. This study provides evidence that soil salt ion absorption by sesbania and hairy vetch is promoted effectively, ameliorating soil salinity, under manure application as compared to under gravel mulching and straw returning.

AB  - Chronic sleep disturbances (CSDs) including insomnia, insufficient sleep time, and poor sleep quality are major public health concerns around the world, especially in developed countries. CSDs are major health risk factors linked to multiple neurodegenerative and neuropsychological diseases. It has been suggested that CSDs could activate microglia (Mg) leading to increased neuroinflammation levels, which ultimately lead to neuronal dysfunction. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying CSD-mediated microglial activation remain mostly unexplored. In this study, we used mice with three-weeks of sleep fragmentation (SF) to explore the underlying pathways responsible for Mg activation. Our results revealed that SF activates Mg in the hippocampus (HP) but not in the striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFc). SF increased the levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the HP. In vitro mechanism studies revealed that CRH activation of Mg involves galectin 3 (Gal3) upregulation and autophagy dysregulation. CRH could disrupt lysosome membrane integrity resulting in lysosomal cathepsins leakage. CRHR2 blockage mitigated CRH-mediated effects on microglia in vitro. SF mice also show increased Gal3 levels and autophagy dysregulation in the HP compared to controls. Taken together, our results show that SF-mediated hippocampal Mg activation involves CRH mediated galectin 3 and autophagy dysregulation. These findings suggest that targeting the hippocampal CRH system might be a novel therapeutic approach to ameliorate CSD-mediated neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Mucins are the major proteins that distributed on the intestinal mucosa layer and protect the intestine from pathogens infection. The composition of intestinal mucin O-glycans can affect the health of the gastrointestinal tract in pigs. Porcine intestinal mucosa is widely used as the main raw material of heparin extraction. The heparin extraction residues rich in mucins were usually wasted. The structure of mucin derived O-glycans in porcine intestinal mucosa are currently unknown. In this study, we isolated the mucins from the heparin extraction residues and profiled the O-glycans. After heparin extraction, mucin was digested with trypsin, and separated by strong anion exchange chromatography. The mucin derived O-glycans were release by alkaline beta elimination, and analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-porous graphitized carbon-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (UPLC-PGC-FTMS/MS). Thirty five kinds of O-glycans were identified, most of which were Core 3-derived glycans. In particular, the O-glycans containing sialic acid Neu5Ac accounted for 71.93% of the total O-glycans, which were different from that of other species, including mouse intestine, fish intestine, and porcine colon. The high content sialylated mucin may explain its effect in biological processes. Furthermore, the immunological activity results indicated that the porcine intestinal mucin could promote phagocytosis and proliferation without any cytotoxic effects, which may aid in the development of immunomodulators.

AB  - Vitrification of sperm by direct contact with liquid nitrogen is increasing in popularity as an alternative to conventional (slow) freezing. Although slow freezing is very challenging in boar sperm cryopreservation, this is currently the standard method used. We compared vitrification in "pearls" and in "mini straws" using the in vitro fertilization media Porcine Gamete Media with 0.3 M sucrose with the standard (slow) method used to preserve boar sperm. Both vitrification methods reduced the viability of the sperm sample more than slow freezing (42.2 +/- 4.3% total motility and 71.4 +/- 2.3% alive), however, both protocols allowed for the successful recovery of the sperm samples. By comparing two different methods of vitrification and two different methods of post-thaw preparation we were able to determine the optimal vitrification-thaw protocol for boar sperm. When comparing pearls and mini-straws, the smaller liquid volume associated with pearls had a positive effect on the survivability of the samples, reducing sperm DNA damage (1.2 +/- 0.2% vs. 5.1 +/- 0.1.7%) and preserving motility (26.15 +/- 2.8% vs 9.39 +/- 0.9%) after thawing. In conclusion, the pearl method was the most suitable of the vitrification techniques for use with boar sperm.

In the Andean Patagonian forest, an eco-region dominated by trees of the Nothofagaceae family, it is common to find the leaf-tying larvae Perzelia arda consuming seeds and leaves of several species of Nothofagus genus. The pattern of damage caused by P. arda in these forests varies from year to year and even within seasons. We hypothesise that this phenomenon may be related to an increase in the ambient temperature of this region. The purpose of this work was to determine the host plant preferences of P. arda among four species of Nothofagus genus and to evaluate whether temperature influences the feeding behaviour of the larvae. We first evaluated the food preferences of P. arda by means of two-choice tests, using leaves of N. alpina, N. obliqua, N. antarctica and N. pumilio as stimuli. Secondly, we evaluated the effect of three levels of temperature on herbivory. Our results demonstrated that P. arda feed on and equally choose the four species of host plants studied. Temperature influenced the feeding behaviour of the larvae; high levels of consumption of N. obliqua occurred at 6 degrees C and differed for the other host plant suggesting that consumption also depends on the type of food resource. In conclusion, the feeding behaviour of P. arda depends on a complex interaction between host plant and abiotic conditions. Further studies are required for a better understanding about the use of resources by this native insect, as well as the ecological consequences.

AB  - The process of learning in birds has been extensively studied, with a focus on species such as pigeons, parrots, chickens, and crows. In recent years, the zebra finch has emerged as a model species in avian cognition, particularly in song learning. However, other cognitive domains such as spatial memory and associative learning could also be critical to fitness and survival, particularly during the intensive juvenile period. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of cognitive studies on zebra finches, with a focus on domains other than song learning. Our findings indicate that spatial, associative, and social learning are the most frequently studied domains, while motoric learning and inhibitory control have been examined less frequently over 30 years of research. All of the 60 studies included in this review were conducted on captive birds, limiting the generalizability of the findings to wild populations. Moreover, only two of the studies were conducted on juveniles, highlighting the need for more research on this critical period of learning. To address this research gap, we propose a high-throughput method for testing associative learning performance in a large number of both juvenile and adult zebra finches. Our results demonstrate that learning can occur in both age groups, thus encouraging researchers to also perform cognitive tests on juveniles. We also note the heterogeneity of methodologies, protocols, and subject exclusion criteria applied by different researchers, which makes it difficult to compare results across studies. Therefore, we call for better communication among researchers to develop standardised methodologies for studying each cognitive domain at different life stages and also in their natural conditions.

AB  - Studying the gut microbiome can provide valuable insights into animal health and inform the conservation management of threatened wildlife. Gut microbiota play important roles in regulating mammalian host physiology, including digestion, energy metabolism and immunity. Dysbiosis can impair such physiological processes and compromise host health, so it is essential that the gut microbiome be considered in conservation planning. The southern greater glider (Petauroides volans) is an endangered arboreal marsupial that faced widespread habitat fragmentation and population declines following the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season. This study details baseline data on the gut microbiome of this species. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from scats collected from individuals inhabiting burnt and unburnt sites across southeastern Australia and sequenced to determine bacterial community composition. Southern greater glider gut microbiomes were characterised by high relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, which is consistent with that reported for other marsupial herbivores. Significant differences in gut microbial diversity and community structure were detected among individuals from different geographic locations. Certain microbiota and functional orthologues were also found to be significantly differentially abundant between locations. The role of wildfire in shaping southern greater glider gut microbiomes was shown, with some significant differences in the diversity and abundance of microbiota detected between burnt and unburnt sites. Overall, this study details the first data on greater glider (Petauroides) gut microbiomes, laying the foundation for future studies to further explore relationships between microbial community structure, environmental stressors and host health.

AB  - Mexico has a rich history and significant expertise in biological control and is a megadiverse country and center of crop domestication. The latter two features are particularly relevant to classical biological control because megadiverse countries are frequent locations for biological control problems, and crop domestication centers are regular sources of biological control solutions for other regions. Aside from species richness, Mexican megadiversity implies a diversity of environments in which numerous non-native crops, particularly susceptible to invasive pests, are cultivated (e.g., citrus, coffee, sugarcane). Also, many crops originating from Mexico are cultivated worldwide (e.g., maize, chili pepper, avocado) and associated herbivores and pests in Mexico frequently become invasive pests elsewhere. We reviewed six case studies in which Mexico was either a stage for biological control of invasive pests on introduced and native crops, or a source of biological control solutions for invasive pests of Mexican crops elsewhere. First, we reviewed biological control efforts in Mexico targeting coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei), pink hibiscus mealybug (Maconellicoccus hirsutus), and Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri). Second, we reviewed potential solutions for classical biological control of native Mexican pests in other regions: fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in Africa, Asia, and Oceania; false carmine cochineal scale (Dactylopius opuntiae) in the Mediterranean; and pepper weevil (Anthonomus eugenii) in Canada and Europe. We concluded by discussing how Mexico, and megadiverse and center of crop domestication countries, generally, are rich sources of experiences and solutions for managing invasive pests worldwide.

AB  - The genus Baccharis (Asteraceae) comprises over 440 species distributed along North and South America. Some species of this genus have remarkable invasiveness, and one of these species is the South American shrub Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. Most of the introductions of non-indigenous species are held indirectly through trade, so it is believed that this species could become invasive worldwide with a particular interest in the North American continent because of the increasing sale of products derived from honey to this continent. The resin extracted from B. dracunculifolia is the leading source for preparing the green propolis produced in Southeastern Brazil. Thus, the main objective of this work is to apply an approach based on distribution modeling to investigate possible areas of high environmental suitability for B. dracunculifolia in the North American continent and the potential to the entire globe using current and two future scenaries. Our results show many areas of environmental suitability for B. dracunculifolia. This species can invade over 33 countries distributed into five continents, including North America, some of the most critical parts of the southern USA, and large areas in Mexico. Since the best way of countering biological invasions is prevention, we propose that the introduction of this species should be monitored.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of an alone or in combination quillaja saponin (QS) and fructooligosaccharide (FOS) on the growth performance, nutrient utilisation, faecal microbial and faecal noxious gas emissions in growing pigs. A total of 100 pigs (Landrace x Yorkshire x Duroc); weighted 23.83 +/- 1.95 kg, were selected and randomly allocated to 4 treatments with 5 replicates per group and 5 pigs per replicate according to the initial body weight and sex. The experimental treatments were as follows: (1) basal diet (Ctrl); (2) Ctrl + 0.2% QS; (3) Ctrl + 0.10% FOS; (4) Ctrl + 0.2% QS + 0.10% FOS (QSFOS). The experiment period lasted for 56 days. Pigs fed a diet supplemented with QS, FOS and QSFOS resulted in an increase (p < 0.05) in body weight (BW) on days 28 and 56, (p < 0.05) average daily gain and average daily feed intake during days 28-56 and 50-56, as well as improved apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM (dry matter) and N (Nitrogen) during day 56 compared with Ctrl. The faecal Lactobacillus counts were increased and a reduction (p < 0.05) in faecal Escherichia coli (E. coli) counts and ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from the faeces was observed from pigs fed QS, FOS and QSFOS supplemented diets compared with those fed a Ctrl diet. In conclusion, dietary QS, FOS and QSFOS supplementation have beneficial effects on growth performance, nutrient utilisation, faecal microbial and noxious gas emissions in growing pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary: Lowering the slaughter age of sheep is an indispensable measure to improve the quality of meat reaching the market and to increase the per capita consumption of this type of protein. Sheep meat production systems on pasture are less costly alternatives and associating them with supplementation strategies to reduce costs may be the path to consolidate the productive chain of sheep meat. We assessed intermittent supplementation (every day or every other day) in sheep managed with Masai grass and found no effect of said grass on nutrient intake, performance, intake behavior, carcass characteristics, or meat quality. However, it was seen that the strategy reduces the cost of producing 1 kg of meat by 15%, which encourages us to recommend the application of that nutritional strategy.
   This study aimed to assess nutrient intake, performance, intake behavior, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of sheep managed on Masai grass pastures along with intermittent concentrate supplementation, in addition to the economic impacts of applying that strategy. A sample of 24 Santa Ines sheep (12 males and 12 females) was kept for 80 days on Panicum maximum cv. Massai pastures and was supplemented daily or every other day. The voluntary intake of dry matter and nutrients was estimated. Mean daily weight gain and total weight gain were calculated and intake behavior parameters were assessed. The males were slaughtered and the weight and yield of the carcasses and meat cuts were assessed. The meat was analyzed for cooking losses, shear force, and color. The gross margin of the system was estimated from the difference between total income and operational cost. No effect was seen of the interaction between supplementation frequency and sex for any parameter assessed (p > 0.05). Intermittent supplementation of Santa Ines sheep managed with Masai grass is recommended since the strategy does not impact nutrient intake, performance, intake behavior, carcass characteristics, or meat quality, but lowers the costs of producing 1 kg of meat by 15%.

AB  - Background: Vascular dementia (VaD), a significant cognitive disorder, is caused by reduced cerebral blood flow. Unraveling the metabolic heterogeneity and reprogramming in VaD is essential for understanding its molecular pathology and developing targeted therapies. However, the in situ metabolic regulation within the specific brain regions affected by VaD has not been thoroughly investigated, and the therapeutic mechanisms of Erigeron breviscapus injection (EBI), a traditional Chinese medicine, require further elucidation. Purpose: To investigate the region-specific metabolic alterations in a VaD rat model, explore the therapeutic effects of EBI at a microregional level, identify the key metabolic pathways and metabolites involved in VaD, and elucidate how EBI modulates these pathways to exert its therapeutic effects. Methods: Air-flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI), a novel technique, was employed to investigate the metabolic changes in the brain microregions. We used a bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model to induce VaD in rats. Network analysis and network pharmacology were used to assess the local metabolic effects of the EBI treatment (3.6 mL/kg/day for 2 weeks). Results: The EBI treatment significantly ameliorated the neurological deficits in VaD rats. AFADESI-MSI revealed 31 key metabolites with significant alterations in the VaD model, particularly within the pathways related to neurotransmitter metabolism, redox homeostasis, and osmoregulation. The metabolic disturbances were primarily observed in the striatum (ST), pyriform cortex (PCT), hippocampus (HP), and other critical brain regions. The EBI treatment effectively reversed these metabolic imbalances, especially in neurotransmitter metabolism, suggesting its potential in mitigating VaD-related cognitive decline.

AB  - This study analyzed physiological and molecular characteristics associated with the resistance to aging or anti-senescence in Camellia oleifera Abel. Trees over 100 years old (ancient trees) were compared with those about 30 years old (mature trees). Total chlorophylls, chlorophyll a/b ratio, and hydrogen peroxide concentrations in ancient tree leaves were significantly higher than in their counterparts. Significantly higher activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase were detected in ancient tree leaves. Nine Chl a/b-binding protein genes, 15 antioxidant enzyme genes, 21 hormone-related genes, and 301 stress-related genes were upregulated, and 42 protein-degradation genes were downregulated in ancient tree leaves. By increasing chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzyme activities and regulating the ageing-related genes expression, ancient C. oleifera leaves maintained remarkable vitality. Although further research is needed, our study may shed some light on how ancient C. oleifera trees can resist ageing and sustain their healthy growth.

AB  - Simple Summary There is an increasing interest in measuring biomarkers from saliva, as samples can be obtained noninvasively. This is particularly true in pigs where blood sampling is technically complicated and stressful. In pigs, studies regarding how the absorbent material used for collection affects analytical results are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the material used for saliva collection can affect the results of analyses for the different types of biomarkers that can be measured in the saliva of pigs. In this report, polypropylene sponges gave higher sample saliva volumes and, in some salivary analytes, provided different values compared with cotton rolls. Therefore, it can be concluded that the type of material used can influence the results of saliva analysis.
   The use of saliva as a biological sample from pigs is of high practical interest because blood collection from pigs is difficult and stressful. In this study, the influence of two different materials, a cotton roll and a polypropylene sponge, in porcine saliva collection was evaluated. For this purpose, the effect of the material used for sampling was evaluated in a panel of 13 analytes, including those related to stress (cortisol and oxytocin), inflammation and immunity (adenosine deaminase, haptoglobin and myeloperoxidase), redox homeostasis (the cupric reducing ability of saliva, the ferric reducing activity of saliva, and the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), and sepsis (procalcitonin), as well as other routine analytes related to metabolism and different tissues and organs, such as lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, urea, and total protein concentration. The polypropylene sponge provided a higher sample volume than the cotton roll. Although the results of some salivary analytes were equivalent for both materials, other analytes, such as creatine kinase, haptoglobin and total proteins, showed significant differences depending on the material used for saliva collection. Therefore, the type of material used for salivary collection in pigs should be considered when interpreting the results of analyses of the salivary analytes.

AB  - Stress that can occur at different levels of a person's life can cause and exacerbate various diseases. Oxidative stress and inflammation underlie this process at the cellular level. There is an urgent need to identify new and more effective therapeutic targets for the treatment of stress-induced behavioral disorders and specific drugs that affect these targets. Isatis tinctoria L. is a herbaceous species in the Brassicaceae family. Due to its potential antioxidant, nitric oxide- (NO-) inhibiting, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, I. tinctoria could be used to treat depression, anxiety, and stress resistance. Hence, the present study is aimed at delineating whether administration of I. tinctoria leaf extract may improve stress-induced disorders in mice. A set of four behavioral tests was selected that together are suitable for phenotyping acute restraint stress-associated behaviors in mice, namely locomotor activity, social integration, dark/light box, and splash tests. The plasma and brains were collected. A brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, corticosterone, NO, reactive oxygen species levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power were measured. In mice stressed by immobilization, decreased locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and contact with other individuals were observed, as well as increased oxidative stress and increased levels of nitric oxide in the brain and plasma C-reactive protein. A single administration of I. tinctoria leaf extract was able to reverse the behavioral response to restraint by a mechanism partially dependent on the modulation of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and NO reduction. In conclusion, Isatis tinctoria hydroalcoholic leaf extract can reduce stress-induced behavioral disturbances by regulating neurooxidative, neuronitrosative, and neuroimmune pathways. Therefore, it could be recommended for further research on clinical efficacy in depression and anxiety disorder treatment.

AB  - The most widely used feed ingredients in the world are fishmeal and soybean, which, despite having high-quality digestible protein and good fat content, are considered environmentally unsustainable and increasingly expensive. This issue also involves the guinea pig, a very important animal protein source for people in Andean regions in South America. Here we investigate the substitution of soybean meal with 50% and 100% black soldier fly larvae meal in the guinea pig diet and its effects on meat quality (fatty acid profile, amino acid profile, water-holding capacity, pH, proximal composition, and color). The results showed no differences in the protein content and amino acid profile of meat nor in the n-6:n-3 and P/S ratios, but did show an increment in the desirable fats (mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids) in the guinea pigs fed with black soldier fly larvae meal. All the other analyzed parameters showed no differences among the diets tested. These results suggest that total replacement of soybean meal with black soldier fly larvae meal in guinea pig nutrition is feasible since meat quality was maintained or improved.

AB  - With climate change, abiotic and biotic stresses such as drought and herbivory are predicted to further diminish agricultural productivity. Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merrill), a crop of global economic importance, is vulnerable to both. However, the interactive effects of drought and herbivory on soybeans haven't been explored, especially through the lens of physiological and phytohormonal changes. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis from 114 published studies, further reduced to 31 after removing redundancy, with data on physiological (photosynthesis and stomatal conductance) and phytohormonal traits (jasmonic acid [JA] and salicylic acid [SA]) of soybeans under drought, herbivory, and their combination. With existing studies so far, we show that drought has negative impacts on soybean photosynthesis and stomatal conductance whereas herbivory has negative effects on photosynthesis but neutral effects on stomatal conductance. And the effects of drought and herbivory on phytohormones had opposite effects, with JA levels increasing. To our understanding, this is the first meta-analysis assimilating studies to understand the combined impacts of drought and herbivory on soybean physiological and phytohormonal changes. We also put forward potential questions and avenues for further research in expanding our understanding about the regulatory pathways and consequences of other abiotic and biotic stressors in agroecosystems.

AB  - In this article, we present a predator-prey model for Florida panthers (FL panthers), white-tailed deer (deer) and cattle in Florida. The model is used to construct the following four policy scenarios: (a) joint management of all three species (Scenario 1); (b) a target population size of FL panthers of 240 individuals (Scenario 2); (c) a target population size of FL panthers equal to the carrying capacity (Scenario 3); and (d) a target population size of FL panthers of zero (Scenario 4) (Scenario 4). We parameterized the model for FL panthers, deer and cattle in Florida, which enables us to obtain empirical results for the population, harvest and net benefit of all three species under each policy scenario. When comparing Scenarios 1 and 2, the total net benefit of all three species is only slightly higher in the former case. Under Scenarios 3 and 4, the net benefit of deer changes significantly compared to Scenario 1, while the effect on the net benefit of cattle is minor. When comparing Scenario 1 and an actual situation, we find that the optimal population of FL panthers is only slightly higher than the actual population.
   Land-based carnivores can be a valuable natural resource. The optimal and actual population of Florida panthers (FL panthers) in Florida is close to a policy target on 240 individuals. The population of white-tailed deer in Florida is highly dependent on the population of FL panthers. The population of cattle in Florida is almost independent of the population of FL panthers.

AB  - This study was aimed at determining mainly the concentrations of As and other metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, V and Zn) in samples of feed, soil, plants and foods (fish, chicken, goat and cow meat) grown and consumed in six areas of Niger Delta, Nigeria (Choba, Khana, Trans Amadi, Eleme, Uyo and Yenagoa). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) models were used for identifying groups of variables (i.e., elements) based on the loadings and groups of samples (i.e., plants, soil, fish, meet, feed) according to the scores that contributed most to the environmental pollution in each Nigerian area. In Choba and Khana sites, the results showed a cluster of elements like As, Pb, V and Zn, mostly associated with samples of goat and cow meat, as well as soils, and separated from another cluster of metals composed by Cu and Hg with different origin. In Trans Amadi area, a clustering of As, Cd and V was found associated to different types of meat (chicken, goat, and cow) located in the opposite side of Cu and Hg, which correlated to plants and soil. In Eleme, the strongest loadings were obtained for V and Zn associated with soil and meat (goat and cow) samples and separated from As and Cd. Finally, in Uyo and Yenagoa, dominant elements were As, Cu, Pb and Zn, with proximity to cow and goat liver samples, while Cd and V corresponded to a different pollution pattern. Lead intake trough meat and fish consumption for adults and children were much higher than the tolerable limits set by international organizations. The results of this study should allow a better understanding of the complex phenomenon of metal pollution in the feed-to-food chain and human health in Nigeria, which should help to manage a pollution reduction strategy and give priorities of research and monitoring.

AB  - This study presents a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) of pork production in Germany, focusing on pig farming, slaughtering, and processing. The objective is to identify key stages in the production process that contribute most to environmental burdens and explore strategies for mitigation. Seven case studies are analysed, with primary data collected, and evaluated using the functional unit of 1 kg of product. The case studies include four pig farms: one breeding and rearing farm (BRE), one rearing and fattening farm (FAT), and two integrated farms (PIG 1, PIG 2). These farms cover feed production, manure management, and energy generation via biogas, where applicable. One slaughterhouse (SLA) and two processing facilities (PRO 1, PRO 2) complete the analysis. Environmental impacts are evaluated in three categories: global warming, acidification, and eutrophication. Compared to existing studies, global warming impacts are lower, while acidification and eutrophication impacts vary, with PIG 2 showing higher levels. The impacts of SLA are comparable or lower than those in the literature. Across all farming stages, feed production is the dominant contributor to environmental impacts, while energy consumption and waste treatment are key factors in slaughtering and processing. Sensitivity analyses examine variations in feed and energy inputs, and scenario analyses explore alternative feed composition, biogas use, and renewable energy integration. Results suggest biogas production reduces global warming and eutrophication impacts but increases acidification. Introducing economic allocation for feed by-products slightly raises overall burdens, and transitioning energy supply to renewable sources at the slaughterhouse improves environmental performance.

AB  - Simple Summary Eotetranychus kankitus (Acari: Tetranychidae) is an important pest of citrus and occurs mainly in Oriental and Palearctic areas. E. kankitus often coexists with Panonychus citri or Phyllocoptruta oleivora (Acari: Tetranychidae, Eriophyidae), resulting in a pest complex that is extremely difficult to control. As adaptable organisms, insects and mites respond differently to environmental changes, especially to changes in temperature that may occur as a result of climate warming. In this study, E. kankitus was used as a test organism to see how temperature affects development time, survival rate and fecundity. We used the bootstrap-match technique to construct the life-table parameters. The results showed that oviposition was highest at 20-25 degrees C, while growth rate was highest at 25-30 degrees C. Although the optimal temperature for growth differs among spider mite species, the species-specific thermal constants could also be used as a potential indicator of the distribution and abundance of arthropods. Eotetranychus kankitus (Acari: Tetranychidae) is an important pest of citrus. Assessing life history parameters is crucial to developing an ecologically sound pest management program. Of the many factors that affect life history parameters of herbivorous insects and mites, temperature has the greatest influence on development rate and reproductive potential. We investigated the effects of temperatures from 15 to 40 degrees C on the demographic parameters of E. kankitus under a long-day (16:8 (L:D) h) photoperiod. The egg-to-adult development time of E. kankitus decreased as the temperature increased from 15 to 32.5 degrees C. At 35 degrees C, the female laid eggs that died at the larval stage. The estimated lower thermal thresholds (t(0)) were 11.01 and 10.48 degrees C, and the thermal constants (K) were 190.67 and 188.63 degree-days for egg-to-adult females and egg-to-adult males, respectively. The intrinsic optimal temperatures (T-o) for development were 21.79 and 21.74 degrees C, respectively. The bootstrap-match technique was used in the construction of the life table paramaters. The net reproductive rate (R-0) decreased as temperature increased from 20 to 30 degrees C, but the lowest rate was observed at 15 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) increased from 0.0299 day(-1) at 15 degrees C to 0.1822 day(-1) at 30 degrees C. These findings provide a critical theoretical basis for predicting the occurrence of E. kankitus populations under climate warming and for developing appropriate control strategies.

AB  - This study focused on how adding ionic liquids (IL) affects composting humification. During the warming and thermophilic phases, addition of IL increased precursors content, and increased the polymerization of humus (HS) at later stages. Furthermore, the final HS and humic acid (HA) content of experimental groups (T) groups 129.79 mg/g and 79.91 mg/g were higher than in control group (CK) 118.57 mg/g and 74.53 mg/g, respectively (p < 0.05). IL up-regulated the gene abundance of metabolism for carbohydrate and amino acid (AA), and promoted the contributions of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, which affected humification. The redundancy analysis (RDA) results showed that the citrate-cycle (TCA cycle)(ko0020), pentose phosphate pathway (ko00030), pyruvate metabolism (ko00620), glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (ko00630), propanoate metabolism (ko00640), butanoate metabolism (ko00650) positively correlated with HA and HI. HA and humi-fication index (HI) positively correlated with AA metabolic pathways, and fulvic acid (FA) was negatively correlated with these pathways. Overall, metabolism for carbohydrate and AA metabolism favored compost humification. ILs improved metabolism for carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, thus enhancing humification.

AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), owing to irrigation using untreated swine wastewater, in vegetable-cultivated soils around swine farms poses severe threats to human health. Furthermore, at the field scale, the remediation of such soils is still challenging. Therefore, here, we performed field-scale experiments involving the cultivation of Brassica pekinensis in a swine wastewater-treated soil amended with composted pig manure, biochar, or their combination. Specifically, the ARG and mobile genetic element (MGE) profiles of bulk soil (BS), rhizosphere soil (RS), and root endophyte (RE) samples were examined using high-throughput quan-titative polymerase chain reaction. In total, 117 ARGs and 22 MGEs were detected. Moreover, we observed that soil amendment using composted pig manure, biochar, or their combination decreased the absolute abundance of ARGs in BS and RE after 90 days of treatment. However, the decrease in the abundance of ARGs in RS was not significant. We also observed that the manure and biochar co-application showed a minimal synergistic effect. To clarify this observation, we performed network and Spearman correlation analyses and used structure equation models to explore the correlations among ARGs, MGEs, bacterial composition, and soil properties. The results revealed that the soil amendments reduced the abundances of MGEs and potential ARG-carrying bacteria. Additionally, weakened horizontal gene transfer was responsible for the dissipation of ARGs. Thus, our results indicate that composted manure application, with or without biochar, is a useful strategy for soil nutrient supplementation and alleviating farmland ARG pollution, providing a justification for using an alternative to the common agricultural practice of treating the soil using only untreated swine wastewater. Additionally, our re-sults are important in the context of soil health for sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Contextual fear conditioning is a protocol used to assess associative learning across species, including fish. Here, our goal was to expand the analysis of behavioral parameters that may reflect aversive behaviors in a contextual fear conditioning protocol using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) and to verify how such parameters can be modulated. First, we analyzed the influence of an aversive stimulus (3 mild electric shocks for 5 s each at frequencies of 10, 100 or 1000 Hz) on fish behavior, and their ability to elicit fear responses in the absence of shock during a test session. To confirm whether the aversive responses are context-dependent, behaviors were also measured in a different experimental environment in a test session. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of dizocilpine (MK-801, 2 mg/kg, i.p.) on fear-related responses. Zebrafish showed significant changes in baseline activity immediately after shock exposure in the training session, in which 100 Hz induced robust contextual fear responses during the test session. Importantly, when introduced to a different environment, animals exposed to the aversive stimulus did not show any differences in locomotion and immobility-related parameters. MK-801 administered after the training session reduced fear responses during the test, indicating that glutamate NMDA-receptors play a key role in the consolidation of contextual fear-related memory in zebrafish. In conclusion, by further exploring fear-related behaviors in a contextual fear conditioning task, we show the effects of different shock frequencies and confirm the importance of context on aversive responses for associative learning in zebrafish. Additionally, our data support the use of zebrafish in contextual fear conditioning tasks, as well as for advancing pharmacological studies related to associative learning in translational neurobehavioral research.

AB  - Simple Summary We propose a new model, YOLOv5-SA-FC, for efficient pig population detection and counting in intelligent breeding. Traditional manual methods are slow and inaccurate. Our model incorporates shuffle attention (SA) and Focal-CIoU (FC) for an improved performance. SA enhances feature extraction without adding parameters, and FC reduces the sample imbalance impact. Our experiments show that YOLOv5-SA-FC achieves a 93.8% mean average precision (mAP) and 95.6% count accuracy, outperforming other methods by 10.2% and 15.8% in pig detection and counting. This validates its effectiveness in intelligent pig breeding.Abstract The efficient detection and counting of pig populations is critical for the promotion of intelligent breeding. Traditional methods for pig detection and counting mainly rely on manual labor, which is either time-consuming and inefficient or lacks sufficient detection accuracy. To address these issues, a novel model for pig detection and counting based on YOLOv5 enhanced with shuffle attention (SA) and Focal-CIoU (FC) is proposed in this paper, which we call YOLOv5-SA-FC. The SA attention module in this model enables multi-channel information fusion with almost no additional parameters, enhancing the richness and robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, the Focal-CIoU localization loss helps to reduce the impact of sample imbalance on the detection results, improving the overall performance of the model. From the experimental results, the proposed YOLOv5-SA-FC model achieved a mean average precision (mAP) and count accuracy of 93.8% and 95.6%, outperforming other methods in terms of pig detection and counting by 10.2% and 15.8%, respectively. These findings verify the effectiveness of the proposed YOLOv5-SA-FC model for pig population detection and counting in the context of intelligent pig breeding.

AB  - Pigs are extensively used for biomedical research as animal models given their similarities to humans including size, arterial capacity, and cutaneous structure. While their size also allows for the use of clinically available anesthesia equipment (for example, endotracheal tubes and ventilators), anecdotes exist with respect to stress reactions after exposure to volatile anesthetics. Over 3 mo at our institution, 11 pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) exposed to isoflurane anesthesia during 2 research protocols were euthanized after exhibiting clinical signs of malignant hyperthermia, including hyperthermia, hypercapnia, skeletal muscle rigidity, dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. This group was composed of intact Yorkshire/Landrace crosses (68 to 91 kg) purchased from a research breeder. While malignant hyperthermia is caused by a mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1), another unnamed porcine stress syndrome is caused by a dystrophin defect. We analyzed the incidence of the RYR1 mutation and a dystrophin variant in 9 of the originally clinically affected pigs and in 56 subsequent pigs. All animals tested negative for the RYR1 mutation, while the dystrophin variant was found in 2 out of 7 clinical (28.6%) and 22 out of 46 (47.8%) subsequently tested female pigs. Creatine kinase, indicative of muscle damage, was slightly elevated at baseline in dystrophin variant-positive carriers, albeit not significantly. However, for the original clinically affected pigs, the increase in body temperature while under anesthesia was significantly greater in dystrophin variant-positive carriers (7.9 +/- 0.8 degrees C) compared with noncarriers (5.2 +/- 0.6 degrees C, P = 0.046). Taken together, we describe the suspected involvement of a dystrophin variant as one of the genetic etiologies in an unnamed condition that has been anecdotally experienced by pig researchers but not reported. We propose naming this condition volatile anesthesia porcine stress syndrome (VAPSS), which is an umbrella term that includes multiple genetic origins, the most well-known of which is malignant hyperthermia stress syndrome in pigs. Identifying other etiologies for VAPSS has implications for genetic and clinical screening to improve welfare in pigs bred for biomedical research and agricultural purposes.

AB  - Simple Summary: As the global population continues to grow and the demand for unique meat flavor increases, goat meat has emerged as a sustainable choice for meat consumption. However, improving goat meat production and quality has become a pressing challenge for the industry. The PLEC gene has multiple regulatory effects on muscle development. Our previous study revealed that the PLEC gene in Leizhou black goats has numerous structural variations. In this study, three CNVs were identified in 417 Leizhou black goats. PLEC CNV-1 showed a significant association with chest circumference, body weight, carcass weight, the cross-sectional area of the longissimus dorsi lumbar muscle, and shear stress (p < 0.05). The gain type is significantly associated with PLEC expression in muscle (p <0.01). These findings suggest that PLEC CNV-1 plays a key role in the growth and muscle development of Leizhou black goats, highlighting its potential as a valuable molecular marker for genetic improvement in goat breeding programs.
   The plectin (PLEC) gene is crucial in regulating muscle development and maintaining the cytoskeleton. An abnormal expression of PLEC can lead to muscle atrophy and muscular dystrophy. In a previous study, we found that Leizhou black goats exhibit abundant structural variations in the PLEC gene. However, the genetic effects of these variations on growth traits and meat quality in goats are not fully understood. In this study, three PLEC copy number variations (CNVs) were identified in a population of 417 Leizhou black goats, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology. Population distribution analysis revealed a high abundance of various types of these three CNVs. PLEC mRNA was found to be highly expressed in muscle tissue and remained consistently high from 1 month to 24 months after birth. Specifically, the gain type of CNV-1 (chr14: 81056401-81064800) showed a significant association with PLEC mRNA expression in muscle tissue (p < 0.01). The sequence of CNV-1 in PLEC shares similarities with three domain superfamilies associated with muscle development and skin disease. Furthermore, there were significant differences in chest circumference, body weight, carcass weight, the cross-sectional area of the longissimus dorsi lumbar muscle, and shear stress between different types of CNV-1 (p < 0.05). Notably, goats with the CNV-1 gain type demonstrated better phenotypic values compared to those with loss and normal types. These findings suggest that PLEC CNV-1 could play a crucial role in the growth and muscle development of Leizhou black goats, making it a potential marker for assisted selection in goat breeding.

AB  - The low capacity of degraded soils to provide phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) to plants makes cultivation unviable in these areas. Biochar can increase nutrients availability and improve the physical conditions of soil to maintain their availability over time, including within soil macroaggregates, where P and K are less susceptible to losses. The aim of this study is to understand, how biochar application can change P and K availability in aggregates of degraded soils. The experiment is carried out under controlled conditions following the factorial scheme 2 x 3 x 5 x 2 + 4, corresponding to two classes of soil, three biochars produced from different raw materials (including stems of elephant grass, EGB, and two types of agricultural wastes: eucalypt stalks, ESB, and sugarcane bagasse, SBB), five rates of biochar, two times and four control treatments. At the end of each time, soil aggregates are divided into two classes by size (macroaggregates and microaggregates) and then P and K availability are measured. The results show that biochar can be a powerful tool to increase P and K availability in soil aggregates. EGB is the most efficient biochar to increase P and K availability, followed by SBB and ESB biochars.

AB  - Historically, behaviour of zoo housed species during hours of limited staff and visitor presence has been poorly studied, largely due to the lack of appropriate technology. Advances in digital monitoring equipment and facility design by European elephant holders has given researchers scope to accurately evaluate behaviour for this species over 24 hrs. Various behavioural indicators of welfare have now been identified for zoo housed elephants; however the relationship between resting behaviour and welfare experience has been an area highlighted to require additional research. Lying rest is a potential positive welfare indicator for this species, with studies suggesting that engagement in lying rest can be used to monitor both psychological and physiological wellbeing. Throughout this work we aim to give insights into the behaviour of individual Asian elephants at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo, specifically between the hours of 16:00 and 10:00. In addition to presenting the activity budgets of our study individuals during these times, we explore individual engagement in resting behaviour. Furthermore, we evaluate the social associations of our study group during rest. We provide evidence that unrelated individuals can form strong associations with conspecifics when resting and show that life history is a factor to consider when evaluating social compatibility between group members. Finally, we demonstrate the positive role that calves and juvenile individuals can play in facilitating meaningful associations between group members during rest. Our study highlights the importance of evaluating behaviour during understudied time periods in order to obtain a holistic view of individual welfare, further emphasising the importance of adopting an evidence-based approach to management for this species in zoos.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) from infested plants are exploited by parasitoid wasps as cues to search for host habitat. However, uninfested (intact) and infested plants are often intermingled in nature, and how volatiles released by intact plants affect host-searching behavior in natural habitats remains unknown. In a previous study, using a wind tunnel, we found that intact maize plants negatively influenced landing behavior of a parasitoid wasp, Cotesia kariyai (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), when they were placed downwind of infested plants. To determine whether intact plant volatiles affect host searching by C. kariyai, we collected volatiles from intact plants using a headspace volatile collection technique. In a wind tunnel, wasps landed less frequently on a green paper model treated with intact plant volatiles placed in front of an infested plant, than on a green paper model treated with the solvent, hexane. In a 4-arm olfactometer, wasps spent significantly less time in an arena containing mixed volatiles from intact and infested plants, compared to the same arena treated only with volatiles from infested plants. Both results indicate that intact plant volatiles re-direct host-searching behavior in C. kariyai females. Chemical analyses suggest differences in volatiles between intact and infested plants. In terms of parasitoid adaptations for effective searching for hosts in complex environments, aversive effects of intact plant volatiles may help C. kariyai to locate patches of infested plants.

AB  - A modified formula for average crack spacing and a numerical model for crack width in hogging moment regions of steel-concrete composite beams under fatigue loading are proposed in this article. First, the existing calculation formulas and test data of average crack spacing are discussed and summarized. By introducing the factor of transverse reinforcement spacing, a modified formula of crack spacing is suggested based on the method of non-linear fitting. Then, a numerical model for crack width in negative moment regions under fatigue loading is proposed. In the analytical model, the explicit formulations of slip occurring at both the beam-slab interface and the reinforcement-concrete interface are included by considering fatigue effects, as well as the stress of reinforcement in the cracked section. Finally, a fatigue test on two steel-concrete composite plate beams subjected to hogging moment is designed and conducted. Compared with the crack width evaluation methods in the existing literature, the analysis results of the numerical model show more reasonable agreement with the data of the experimental beams performed in this study.

AB  - In an effort to develop an effective, minimum-handling protocol for the conservation of wood bison, the present study was designed to determine the effects of ovarian synchronization and superstimulation on cumulus oocyte complex (COC) collection and in vitro embryo production in wood bison during the ovulatory (Exp. 1) and anovulatory seasons (Exp. 2). We tested the hypotheses that COC collection and in vitro embryo production are 1) greater after follicular wave synchronization than at random stages of the follicular wave, 2) repeatable within individuals, 3) greater after ovarian superstimulation with a single dose of eCG than without treatment, and 4) greater during the anovulatory season than the ovulatory season. In Exp. 1, ultrasound-guided COC collection was performed on Day-1 in wood bison to induce follicular wave emergence the following day (Day = 0). Immediately after the COC collection on Day-1, bison were given a single im dose of 2500 IU eCG or saline (n = 6 per group). Subsequent COC collections were on Days 4 and 9. A similar design was used in Exp. 2, with an additional treatment group given 5000 IU eCG (n = 8 per group). In Exp. 1, compared to the saline-treated group, a single dose of 2500 IU eCG resulted in a greater number of >8 mm follicles at the time of the Day 4 COC collection (P = 0.03), but not at the Day 9. In Exp. 2, treatment with 5000 IU eCG resulted in a greater number of >8 mm follicles than 2500 IU eCG or the saline treatment (37.5 +/- 6.9, 17.5 +/- 2.0, 16.9 +/- 2.0; P = 0.01, respectively). Although the number of embryos produced/COC submitted to IVM was not different among groups (mean = 18.6%), treatment with 5000 IU eCG produced more than twice as many embryos per bison as unstimulated bison (0.8 vs 1.9). In summary, embryo production rates were higher from COC collected subsequent to follicular wave synchronization vs random stages of the wave, and ovarian superstimulation with eCG resulted in a dose-related increase in the number of >8 mm follicles, COC collected, and embryos produced. Repeated COC collections after successive wave synchronization resulted in similar follicular counts and embryo production rates within individuals, and the greatest number of follicles aspirated, COC collected, and embryos produced was in the anovulatory season. We conclude that the minimum-handling COC collection protocols in the present study are effective and provide realistic options for embryo production in wild bison.

AB  - Little is known about how simultaneous antagonistic interactions on plants and pollinators affect pollination services, even though herbivory can alter floral traits and parasites can change pollinator learning, perception, or behavior. We investigated how a common herbivore and bumble bee (Bombus spp.) parasite impact pollination in tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) (Solanales: Solanaceae). We exposed half the plants to low-intensity herbivory by the specialist Manduca sexta L. (Lepidoptera: Sphigidae), and observed bumble bee visits and time spent on flowers of damaged and control plants. Following observations, we caught the foraging bees and assessed infection by the common gut parasite, Crithidia bombi Lipa & Triggiani (Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae). Interestingly, we found an interactive effect between herbivory and Crithidia infection; bees with higher parasite loads spent less time foraging on damaged plants compared to control plants. However, bees did not visit higher proportions of flowers on damaged or control plants, regardless of infection status. Our study demonstrates that multiple antagonists can have synergistic negative effects on the duration of pollinator visits, such that the consequences of herbivory may depend on the infection status of pollinators. If pollinator parasites indeed exacerbate the negative effects of herbivory on pollination services, this suggests the importance of incorporating bee health management practices to maximize crop production.

AB  - The composition and diversity of microbial communities are of considerable significance to the quality development of Camellia sinensis (Fuzhuan tea). In this study, we examined differences in the bacterial community structures of loose, lightly-pressed, hand-made, and machine-pressed Fuzhuan teas and raw dark tea. We observed notable differences in the bacterial communities of the five groups, where there were only 51 consensus sequences. ASV/OTU Venn diagram, Chao1, Ace, Simpson indices, and dilution curve analyses consistently revealed that machine-pressed tea exhibited the highest bacterial diversity. Taxonomically, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla in each group, whereas Corynebacterium, Methylobacterium, and Bifidobacterium were the dominant genera. Our findings revealed significant differences in the bacterial community structures of different Fuzhuan tea products derived from the same raw material, with bacterial diversity rising with increased product compaction.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a chemical element that poses risks to human health due to its high toxicity and environmental persistence. We determined the total Hg (THg) and methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations in hair samples from residents of the Demarcacao District (Porto Velho, Rondonia) in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as in water and fish samples, to evaluate factors influencing human exposure. The average THg concentration in human hair was 7.86 +/- 6.78 mg kg-1 and it was significantly higher in men, with an increasing trend related to age. There was no significant difference between female age groups. Human exposure to Hg through water was negligible compared to fish consumption. The average weekly intake estimates in the community varied between 1.54 and 4.62 mu g kg-1, substantially higher than the recommended limit. The fish species with the highest amounts safe for daily consumption were herbivores and detritivores. Our results contribute to an understanding of how exposure to Hg affects the health of riverside populations and provide insights for new research to develop methods to mitigate such exposure and thus improve the quality of life of Amazonian people.

AB  - Simple Summary Aromatase (CYP19A1), a member of the cytochrome family, is widely expressed in ovarian and granulosa cells and is primarily responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Increased expression of CYP19A1 in follicular granulosa cells has implications for cell proliferation, steroid hormone secretion, and the expression of related functional indicator genes. We hypothesize that CYP19A1 may indirectly influence lambing numbers in goats by regulating follicular cell growth and development, as well as ovarian ovulation. Abnormal expression of CYP19A1, a gene related to steroid hormone synthesis, causes steroid hormone disruption and leads to abnormal ovulation in granulosa cells. However, the exact mechanism of CYP19A1 regulation is unclear. In this study, we confirmed the localization of CYP19A1 in goat ovarian tissues using immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, we investigated the effects of CYP19A1 on granulosa cell proliferation, steroid hormone secretion, and expression of candidate genes for multiparous traits by overexpressing and silencing CYP19A1 in goat granulosa cells (GCs). The immunohistochemistry results showed that CYP19A1 was expressed in all types of follicular, luteal, and granulosa cells, with subcellular localization results revealing that CYP19A1 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Overexpression of CYP19A1 significantly increased the mRNA levels of CYP19A1, FSHR, and INHBA, which are candidate genes for multiple birth traits in goats. It also promoted cell proliferation, PCNA and Cyclin E mRNA levels in granulosa cells, and secretion of estrogen and progesterone. However, it inhibited the mRNA levels of STAR, CYP11A1, and 3 beta SHD, which are genes related to steroid synthesis. Silencing CYP19A1 expression significantly reduced CYP19A1, FSHR, and INHBA mRNA levels in granulosa cells and inhibited granulosa cell proliferation and PCNA and Cyclin E mRNA levels. It also reduced estrogen and progesterone secretion but enhanced the mRNA levels of STAR, CYP11A1, and 3 beta SHD. CYP19A1 potentially influenced the lambing traits in goats by affecting granulosa cell proliferation, hormone secretion, and expression of candidate genes associated with traits for multiple births.

AB  - Brucella is an intracellular zoonotic pathogen that can affect many hosts. Brucella melitensis Rev.1 is a live attenuated, is one of the most effective vaccine strain against brucellosis. It can be used safely in sheep, goats, and even cattle. Although many studies are available on this topic, there is no effective vaccine strain for sheep and goats that distinguishes the antibody titer produced between the field infections and vaccinations. Outer membrane protein 19 (Omp 19) is both virulent and a protective antigen found on the cell-wall of the Brucella strain.
   In this study, used the suicide plasmid pJQ200KS, which contained homologous region without Omp19 Open Reading Frame (ORF) that was transferred to B. melitensis Rev.1 and further transformed into spheroplasts along with penicillin, ampicillin, and glycine by electroporation. To obtain a mutant vector from Escherichia call, we used the heat shock transformation method along with the blue-white colony screening using X-gal media, whereas for the gene transfer in Brucella, we used electroporation. A scanning electron microscope (S.E.M) was used to observe the spheroplast transformation while the mutant vector and deletion mutants were confirmed through PCR and sequence analysis.
   In the mouse model efficacy trials, three commercial vaccines were found to comply with the OIE standards. Although the deletion mutants 19 and 44/10 had similar efficiency as the commercial vaccines in terms of stimulation power, the ELISA test with Omp19 protein showed the same results as the negative control.
   The Rev.1 Ompl9 deletion mutants obtained in this study contained sufficient residual virulence, and their protective immunity was similar to the commercial vaccines. The study showed that a vaccine prepared using a B. melitensis Rev.1 Delta Omp19 can act as a marker vaccine or differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) through the ELISA test that detects the Omp19 protein.

AB  - MSX1 is an important member of the muscle segment homeobox gene (Msh) family and acts as a transcription factor to regulate tissue plasticity, yet its role in goat endometrium remodeling remains elusive. In this study, an immunohistochemical analysis showed that MSX1 was mainly expressed in the luminal and glandular epithelium of goat uterus, and the MSX1 expression was upregulated in pregnancy at days 15 and 18 compared with pregnancy at day 5. In order to explore its function, goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs) were treated with 17 beta-estrogen (E-2), progesterone (P-4), and/or interferon-tau (IFN tau), which were used to mimic the physiological environment of early pregnancy. The results showed that MSX1 was significantly upregulated with E-2- and P-4-alone treatment, or their combined treatment, and IFN tau further enhanced its expression. The spheroid attachment and PGE2/PGF2 alpha ratio were downregulated by the suppression of MSX1. The combination of E-2, P-4, and IFN tau treatment induced the plasma membrane transformation (PMT) of gEECs, which mainly showed the upregulation of N-cadherin (CDH2) and concomitant downregulation of the polarity-related genes (ZO-1, alpha-PKC, Par3, Lgl2, and SCRIB). The knockdown of MSX1 partly hindered the PMT induced by E-2, P-4, and IFN tau treatment, while the upregulation of CDH2 and the downregulation of the partly polarity-related genes were significantly enhanced when MSX1 was overexpressed. Moreover, MSX1 regulated the CDH2 expression by activating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that MSX1 was involved in the PMT of the gEECs through the ER stress-mediated UPR pathway, which affects endometrial adhesion and secretion function.

AB  - Saponins are the group of plant specialized metabolites which are widely distributed in angiosperm plants and have various biological activities. The present study focused on alpha-tomatine, a major saponin present in tissues of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. alpha-Tomatine is responsible for defense against plant pathogens and herbivores, but its biological function in the rhizosphere remains unknown. Secretion of tomatine was higher at the early growth than the green-fruit stage in hydroponically grown plants, and the concentration of tomatine in the rhizosphere of field-grown plants was higher than that of the bulk soil at all growth stages. The effects of tomatine and its aglycone tomatidine on the bacterial communities in the soil were evaluated in vitro, revealing that both compounds influenced the microbiome in a concentration-dependent manner. Numerous bacterial families were influenced in tomatine/tomatidine-treated soil as well as in the tomato rhizosphere. Sphingomonadaceae species, which are commonly observed and enriched in tomato rhizospheres in the fields, were also enriched in tomatine- and tomatidine-treated soils. Moreover, a jasmonate-responsive ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 4 mutant associated with low tomatine production caused the root-associated bacterial communities to change with a reduced abundance of Sphingomonadaceae. Taken together, our results highlight the role of tomatine in shaping the bacterial communities of the rhizosphere and suggest additional functions of tomatine in belowground biological communication.

AB  - Simple Summary: Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), in sheep and goats, which is targeted for global control and eradication. However, in many developing countries, access to expensive sequencing technologies is limited and is compounded by difficulties in transporting clinical samples across international borders. Oxford nanopore MinION is a relatively cheap sequencing technology using portable devices that require minimal supporting laboratory infrastructure or technical expertise for sample preparation and rapid sequencing. In this study, Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing was carried out to generate complete genomes of PPRV from archived PPRV-positive samples collected from PPR outbreaks in goats in Ngorongoro and Momba districts in Tanzania during 2016 and 2018, respectively. Complete genomes of PPRV of 15,948 nucleotides long were generated within four hours of sequencing. The phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes revealed a high nucleotide identity (96.19-99.24%) with lineage III PPR viruses currently circulating in East Africa, indicating a common origin. The Oxford nanopore MinION sequencer can be deployed to overcome diagnostic and surveillance challenges in developing countries in the PPR Global Control and Eradication program. However, the coverage depth was uneven across the genome and amplicon dropout was observed between the matrix (M) and fusion (F) genes. Thus, larger field studies are needed to allow the collection of sufficient data to assess the robustness of nanopore sequencing technology.
   Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease of sheep and goats that threatens food security, small ruminant production and susceptible endangered wild ruminants. With policy directed towards achieving global PPR eradication, the establishment of cost-effective genomic surveillance tools is critical where PPR is endemic. Genomic data can provide sufficient in-depth information to identify the pockets of endemicity responsible for PPRV persistence and viral evolution, and direct an appropriate vaccination response. Yet, access to the required sequencing technology is low in resource-limited settings and is compounded by the difficulty of transporting clinical samples from wildlife across international borders due to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora, and Nagoya Protocol regulations. Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing technology has recently demonstrated an extraordinary performance in the sequencing of PPRV due to its rapidity, utility in endemic countries and comparatively low cost per sample when compared to other whole-genome (WGS) sequencing platforms. In the present study, Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing was utilised to generate complete genomes of PPRV isolates collected from infected goats in Ngorongoro and Momba districts in the northern and southern highlands of Tanzania during 2016 and 2018, respectively. The tiling multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with twenty-five pairs of long-read primers. The resulting PCR amplicons were used for nanopore library preparation and sequencing. The analysis of output data was complete genomes of PPRV, produced within four hours of sequencing (accession numbers: MW960272 and MZ322753). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes revealed a high nucleotide identity, between 96.19 and 99.24% with lineage III PPRV currently circulating in East Africa, indicating a common origin.

AB  - Early, strategic IPM actions can eradicate relatively new invasive conehead termite [Nasutitermes corniger (Motschulsky) (Blattodea: lsoptera: Termitidae)] populations, preventing negative economic and ecological consequences should this pest of agriculture, structures, and natural areas become permanently established and spread. Conspicuous foraging tunnels and above-ground nests are key aspects of N. corniger biology that render colonies vulnerable to discovery and elimination. Because the goal is eradication, the termites must be controlled wherever found-structure, yard, park, overgrown lot, orchard, forest, natural area, etc. Effective IPM methods exist to contain, control, and eradicate invasive nasutes. Removing and safely disposing dead plant material and stored wood helps reduce termite food and harborage, enables liquid insecticides to penetrate soil, and facilitates access for inspections. IPM involves a combination of physical interventions including nest destruction teamed with targeted insecticide applications, followed by diligent monitoring. Fumigation is required only in unusual situations. By killing colonies and reducing overall population size, alate (swarmer) dispersal can be reduced or eliminated, thus substantially slowing-with goal of halting-infested zone expansion. This paper details specific approaches, protocols, and recommendations for detection, treatment, transport prevention, and risk-based monitoring. We present practical suggestions regarding outreach, advocacy, partnerships with stakeholders, and networking with informed professionals. All recommendations stem from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' invasive conehead termite program's best practices and lessons learned experiences during significant mitigation progress, with eradication of two populations of invasive coneheads that spread from a single introduction into Florida as an achievable goal.

AB  - Animal weapons are one of the most studied morphological traits, particularly in Artiodactyla. Since in polygynous species males with larger weapons tend to be more successful in gaining access to females, researchers have traditionally focused on horn size. However, in species with limited horn size, weapon size has been assumed to have a reduced or null effect on life history traits. We examined the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the length of the second and third segments of Alpine chamois horns (Rupicapra rupicapra) in a population living in a poor environment. Our aim was to test how environmental conditions affected weapon growth and whether compensatory growth occurred. We showed that horn length was isometric to body size, although male horns grew more quickly. Ecological factors such as snow and forage availability affected weapon length, though mildly. No sign of compensatory growth was detected. We inferred that chamois mainly use horns as armament in intrasexual interactions. However, horn length was not a key element since horn growth remained isometric, at least under suboptimal ecological conditions. In species without extreme weapons, the handicap caused by longer horns is likely not compensated by an increase in individual fitness.

AB  - A significant amount of CH4 is emitting from livestock manure (LM) storage tank, which is being counted according to the guidelines provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Among various parameters affecting CH4 conversion factor (MCF) of LM, temperature is known as the most influential factor. As a degree of temperature, atmospheric temperature (T-a), not the manure temperature (T-m), is used for determining the MCF. Currently, the closed-type tank is more common than open-type tank, which would cause the substantial difference between T-a and T-m, probably due to the automatic temperature rise (ATR). Here, we repeatedly observed the ATR by storing pig slurry (PS) in a pilot-scale tank (30 m(3), surface/volume ratio of 1.9), and its consequent impact on the increased CH4 emissions by comparing with the results from a lab-scale tank (1 L, surface/volume ratio of 72.2) controlled at 30 degrees C. As storage began, the T-m increased gradually from 16 to 23 degrees C to above 30 degrees C even in winter (-5 degrees C < T-a < 15 degrees C). During 30 d of storage, the CH4 emissions of 1.3-2.5 kg CH4/ton PS (MCF 26-29%) was observed in the lab-scale tank, while the emissions was increased to 2.6-4.2 kg CH4/ton PS (MCF 40-50%) in the pilot-scale tank (Two-Tail test, vertical bar t(t)vertical bar<vertical bar t(c)vertical bar). For the first time, a detailed heat energy balance considering the waste heat from organic degradation, the heat requirement for warm up, and the heat loss by convection, was conducted, proving that the waste heat generated during storage was enough to reach above 30 degrees C. Cooling-down of LM at 20 degrees C was found to be effective for reducing CH4 emissions by 90%, which sufficiently offset the greenhouse gas emissions in power consumption for cooling. Our findings strongly suggest that more CH4 is emitting from LM storage tank than expected, and therefore, the IPCC needs to develop guidelines more accurately in determining MCF.

AB  - Polyphagous thrips are economically important pests, affecting numerous crops worldwide and threatening agricultural production. These small, slender pests reproduce rapidly, assemble in locations inaccessible to insecticides, and damage crops by feeding on them and transmitting plant viruses. This eventually results in significant yield loss or even complete crop failure. Of the 5500 known herbivorous thrips species, the western flower thrips [Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)], onion thrips (Thrips tabaci Lindeman), yellow tea thrips, (Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood), and melon thrips, (Thrips palmi Karny), are the most crucial pest thrips occurring globally. Here, we present the global invasion and current distribution of these four thrips species. Moreover, we examine the current knowledge regarding their specific biological attributes, rapid resistance development to insecticides, superior competitive ability, and high transmission efficiency of plant viruses. These factors contribute to the invasiveness and great pest status of thrips and impede their management. We believe that sharing information related to thrips characteristics and management tactics through strong international collaboration may facilitate the management of these globally invasive species.

AB  - The geographical, geomorphological, and climatic characteristics of Bulgaria are particularly favorable for animal breeding and, above all, for pastoral farming and sheep breeding. These conditions created prerequisites for the creation of about 30 unique local breeds of sheep. In this study we investigated the genetic diversity of eight of the most popular Bulgarian native breeds, based on the sequence analysis of a part of the mitochondrial D-loop region. An almost entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region (1180 bp) was amplified and sequenced. The obtained results showed the presence of a large number of haplotypes-225, belonging to two main haplogroups. The majority of samples showed a high prevalence of the European haplogroup B (95.2%) while the remaining individuals were assigned to haplogroup A (4.8%). None of the other reported mitochondrial haplogroups were observed. The number of polymorphic sites, nucleotide and haplotype diversity was high (240, 0.01237, and 0.9968, respectively), which is evidence for multiple maternal origins in all populations. The Tajima D-test value in all the study populations was -1.905 (p < 0.05), indicating that the abundance of rare alleles was most likely due to population expansion after a recent bottleneck. The Median joining network showed that almost all haplotypes belonging to haplogroup B formed a star-like network, which revealed a weak genetic differentiation and a large gene flow between the Bulgarian native breeds.

AB  - Since the 1940s, pesticide-intensive crop protection has sustained food security but also caused pervasive impacts on biodiversity, environmental integrity and human health. Here, we employ a systematic literature review to structurally analyze pest management science in 65 developing countries. Within a corpus of 3,407 publications, we find that taxonomic coverage is skewed towards a subset of 48 herbivores. Simplified contexts are commonplace: 48% of studies are performed within laboratory confines. 80% treat management tactics in an isolated rather than integrated fashion. 83% consider no more than two out of 15 farming system variables. Limited attention is devoted to pest-pathogen or pest-pollinator interplay, trophic interactions across ecosystem compartments or natural pest regulation. By overlooking social strata, the sizable scientific progress on agroecological management translates into slow farm-level uptake. We argue that the scientific enterprise should integrate system complexity to chart sustainable trajectories for global agriculture and achieve transformative change on the ground.
   Pest management studies usually underestimate the complex ecological interactions and social-ecological strata of farming systems, according to a meta-analysis of 3,407 studies from a range of developing countries.

AB  - A central theme of Singapore's "City in Nature" vision is framed through biophilic urbanism, or efforts to harmonize biodiversity and urban development through built, social, and political design. The central discourses of Singapore's biophilic urbanism have revolved around flora-centric paradigms, including habitat conservation, greening spaces, and access to natural capital. This paper detours from conventions of Singapore's urban ecological futures and instead explores the governance of fauna co-existence in the city-state through the concept of "urban crittizenship." Defined as a more-than-human denization framework that interrogates urban wildlife governance, urban crittizenship interrogates the politics of urban wildlife's rights to the city. Drawing on interviews, publicly accessible data, and ethnographic findings with local governing actors and activists, I show that Singapore's experience of urban fauna governance is framed through three categories ("resident," "wildlife," and "pest") and that they inform how state and society mediate and manage coexistence with urban wildlife. These experiences are examined through the examples of otters, boars, and pigeons, respectively. In doing so, I present urban crittizenship as an inductive model of analyzing urban wildlife coexistence as primarily secured through infrastructural and political regime configurations that inform their crittizenship statuses. Any real shifts toward new forms of coexistence must therefore begin with actual transformations in these areas. I further iterate that using an urban crittizenship framework refines our understanding and application of biophilic urbanism as socio-political processes that influence already-existing urban wildlife coexistence, complementing existing analyses in urban ecology. In other words, there is a politics of biophilia that warrants a conversation, because biophilia is political.

AB  - Pigs are important domestic livestock and a comprehensive understanding of their immune system is critical to improve swine vaccine efficacy. Pig models represent an excellent animal model for immunological studies because of their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans. A significant portion of pig immunological studies focused on characterizing the conventional T cell (Tconv) immune responses. These cells recognize peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. In contrast, unconventional T cells are non-MHC-restricted and profoundly regulate conventional T cells. Key subsets of unconventional T cells reviewed here include natural killer T (NKT) cells, gamma delta T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), and two potential unconventional T cell subsets expressing NKp46 or CD11b. Unlike Tconvs, most of these cells recognize lipids, small molecule metabolites, or modified peptides, and they generally show simplified patterns of T cell receptor (TCR) expression and rapid effector responses. Here, we review that unconventional T cells are an abundant and critical component of the porcine immune system, summarize the current understanding of these cells, and highlight some of the key differences among mouse, human, and porcine unconventional T cells.

AB  - This work aims to investigate the influence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ascorbic acid (ASCA) on the physicochemical characteristics, organic matter (OM) deconstructions, humification degree and succession of bacterial communities for co-composting of bagasse pith and dairy manure. The results indicated that H2O2 and ASCA accelerated the degradation of lignocellulose, improved the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and enhanced the content of humic substance (HS) and the degree of its aromatization. The bacterial communities were significantly changed in the presence of additives, in which the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria significantly increased. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the degradation of OM and lignocellulose more influenced the bacterial community compositions. Conclusively, adding H2O2 and ASCA accelerated lignocellulose degradation efficiency, and improved the composting process, which provided an optimized method to dispose of lignocellulose wastes and livestock manure.

AB  - spermatogenesis is a delicate and complex biological process in which spermatogonial stem cells continue to proliferate and differentiate into mature spermatozoa, maintaining sperm production in male mammals throughout the lifetime. To study the molecular mechanism of spermatogenesis, researchers had to isolate different germ cell subpopulations for in vitro culture and characterization. However, due to the existence of several stages of germ cells and a variety of populations of somatic cells in the testis of male mammals, it is a challenge for us to obtain high-purity germ cell subpopulations for further research. Here, we optimized the STA-PUT device and successfully applied it to isolate and purify spermatogonia populations in piglets, and multiple germ cell populations at different developmental stages in testes of adult mice and boars. This work provides a simple platform for germ cell fractionation to facilitate the molecular mechanistic study of animal spermatogenesis in vitro.

AB  - Fungal degradation of cellulose is a key step in the conversion of organic matter in composting. This study investigated the effects of adding 10% biochar (including, prepared from corn stalk and rape stalk corresponding to CSB and RSB) on organic matter transformation in composting and determined the role of cellulase and fungal communities in the conversion of organic matter. The results showed that biochar could enhance the conversion of organic matter, especially in RSB treatment. Biochar could increase cellulase activity, and RSB could enhance 33.78% and 30.70% the average activity of cellulase compared with the control and CSB treatments in the mesophilic to thermophilic phase, respectively. The results of high throughput sequencing demonstrated that Basidiomycota dominant in mesophilic phase, and Ascomycota dominant in other phases of composting. The redundancy analysis showed that Alternaria, Thermomycees, Aspergillus, Wallemia, and Melanocarpus might be the key fungi for the degradation of organic matter, and Fusarium, Penicillium, and Scopulariopsis may promote the conversion of organic matter. Network showed that the addition of RSB changed the interactions between fungal communities and organic matter transformation, and RSB treatment enriched members of Ascomycota related to organic matter transformation and cellulase activity. These results indicated that RSB improved organic matter conversion by enhancing the role of cellulase and fungal communities.

AB  - This research aimed to provide experimental evidence on whether identifying an edible animal by a name and specific preferences encourages children to perceive the animal as more similar to humans, increases their willingness to befriend the animal, and makes them less willing to consume it. In two pre-registered studies involving 208 preschool children, participants were presented with pictures of pigs (Study 1) and chickens (Study 2). In the identifiability condition, one animal was depicted with individual qualities such as a name and personal preferences, while in the non-identifiability condition, animals were portrayed with characteristics representative of the entire species. The children then rated their desire to befriend and consume the animal, while in Study 2, they also rated the animal's similarity to humans. The results revealed that animal identifiability led to higher perceived similarity to humans, increased the desire to befriend it, and reduced inclination to consume the animal. These findings highlight animal identifiability's powerful and robust effect on children's attitudes toward edible animals.

AB  - Ground-level ozone (O-3) is a widespread air pollutant causing extensive injuries in plants. However, its effects on perennial energy crops remain poorly understood due to technical difficulties in cultivating fast-growing shrubs for biomass production under O-3 treatment on the field. Here we present the results of a two-year evaluation in the framework of which willow (Salix sachalinensis F. Schmid) shrubs were exposed to ambient (AOZ) or elevated (EOZ) O-3 in two successive growing seasons (2014, 2015) and treated with 0 (EDU0) or 400 mg L-1 (EDU400) ethylenediurea spray in the second growing season. In 2014, EOZ altered the chemical composition of both top young and fallen leaves, and a novel mechanism of decreasing Mg in fallen leaves while highly enriching it in young top leaves was revealed in shrubs exposed to EOZ. In 2015, EDU400 alleviated EOZ-induced decreases in leaf fresh mass to dry mass ratio (FM/DM) and leaf mass per area (LMA). While EDU400 protected against EOZ-induced suppression of the maximum rate at which leaves can fix carbon (A(max)) in O-3-asymptomatic leaves, it did not alleviate EOZ-induced suppression of the maximum rates of carboxylation (V-Cmax) and electron transport (J(max)) and chlorophylls a, b, and a + b in the same type of leaves. In O-3-symptomatic leaves, however, EDU400 alleviated EOZ-induced suppression of chlorophylls a and a + b, indicating different mode of action of EDU between O-3-asymptomatic and O-3-symptomatic leaves. Extensive herbivory occurred only in AOZ-exposed plants, leading to suppressed biomass production, while EOZ also led to a similar suppression of biomass production (EDU0 x EOZ vs. EDU400 x EOZ). In 2016, carry-over effects were also evaluated following cropping and transplantation into new ambient plots. Effects of EOZ in the preceding growing seasons extended to the third growing season in the form of suppressed ratoon biomass production, indicating carry-over effect of EOZ. Although EDU400 protected against EOZ-induced suppression of biomass production when applied in 2015, there was no carry-over effect of EDU in the absence of EDU treatment in 2016. The results of this study provide novel mechanistic understandings of O-3 and EDU modes of action and can enlighten cultivation of willow as energy crop.

AB  - Lanping black-boned (LPBB) sheep are a unique and rare ruminant species, characterized by black pigmentation in the skin and internal organs. Thus far, LPBB are the only known animal with heritable melanin characteristics besides the black-boned chicken, and the only mammal known to contain a large amount of melanin in the body. LPBB have therefore attracted substantial research attention, due to their potential contribution to medicine. However, long periods of grazing freely and crossbreeding with Lanping normal sheep (LPN) have diluted LPBB breeding resources, posing a challenge to the protection of species. To ensure the effective conservation and management of LPBB genetic resources, the construction of a large-scale database of genotypic information is therefore very important. To achieve this, we established the first LPBB-specific SNP database, named Black-boned Sheep Genome SNP Database (BbGSD, http://202.203.179.115:3838/oarsnpdb) using sheep genotype data (100 LPBB and 50 LPN) across 46 894 242 SNP sites. In this database, we implemented four main function modules: (i) the "LD heatmap" module, which uses a heatmap to enable the interactive visualization of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) measurements between SNPs; (ii) the "SNP distribution" module, which allows users to interactively visualize tabular genotype data as heat maps; (iii) the "Phylogenetics" module which enables phylogenetic analysis to explore the evolutionary history or genetic relationships of the LPBB sheep; and the "Diversity" module, which can be used to calculate and display the nucleotide diversity among sheep populations in user-specified genomic regions. BbGSD is essential for accelerating studies on the functional genomics and screening of molecular markers of molecular-assisted breeding in black-boned sheep.Database URL: http://202.203.179.115:3838/oarsnpdb

AB  - Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), a precursor of creatine, has a recognized effect on ruminant performance when used as a dietary supplement. However, its impact on reproductive response remains to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to contribute initially to this area by supplementing the diets of ewes with a high dose of GAA, evaluating its effects on reproductive response. Twenty adult sheep had their estrus synchronized using an MPA sponge, eCG, and PGF2 alpha. After estrus detection ewes were mated. For 10 days until mating, ewes were grouped in groups of baseline diet (BSD; n = 10) and GAA diet (GAAD; n = 10), which was the BSD with daily 0.9 g/kg DM of GAA. After the eCG + PGF2 alpha dose, the GAAD group exhibited an increase in the peak diastolic and pulsatility of the ovarian artery, a reduction in the systolic/diastolic peaks ratio, and a larger intraovarian blood perfusion area. A greater depletion of follicles with <3 mm was observed in the GAAD group and a higher number of follicles >= 3 mm. No differences were observed between the diets respect to pregnancy, and twin rates. Thus, a high GAA supply before mating significantly alters ovarian vasculature and improves follicular growth in ewes but does not affect the pregnancy rate.

AB  - Generally motivated by the relevance of animals in human subsistence, the management of fauna has taken different shapes throughout the world. This study aims to analyse a typology of management forms, exploring their relationship with the motivation to maintain coexistence and use of fauna and mitigate negative human-fauna interactions by the Mexicatl (Nahua) people in Central Mexico. We generally expected to find a broad spectrum of management types in a gradient of interactions intensity. This is because we hypothesised that the more meaningful these interactions due to the magnitude of benefit or damage, philias, or phobias among other positive or negative perceptions, and ecological aspects and management viability, the more actions and practices might be motivated to maintain or mitigate them. We conducted a qualitative research based on interpretivist approaches, mixing qualitative and quantitative analyses, to register the Mexicatl names of fauna present in the area and recognised by locals and to analyse the influence of local ecological knowledge (LEK) and natural history as perceived by people on the use, conflicts, and management practices regarding local fauna. In order to gather such information, in 2018 and 2019 we generated 356 free lists of fauna and 20 sessions of group interviews about the presence of animals in the area, the Mexicatl name, information on distribution, diet, use, management, and other facts. We used visual stimuli with children and young people from schools of basic and intermediate levels in five rural communities and the municipal head of Coyomeapan, Puebla. We also generated free lists and in-depth interviews with 18 persons older than 16 years. People recognised 114 animal items, the most salient being 11 domestic and 14 wild animals including deer, medium and small mammals, snakes, and birds. For both domestic and wild fauna, people reported 18 use categories and three types of damage (crop losses, predation of domestic animals, and damages to health). LEK interacted with traditional celebrations, religious beliefs, land tenure, and migration to define preferences and management types of fauna. Bushmeat demand, especially for Mazama temama and Cuniculus paca, was related to a perception of healthy nutrition properties. Management actions included husbandry of domestic animals, extraction of wild animals for supply, or to avoid damages, captivity, tolerance to damage, protection of seeds and domestic animals threatened by wild fauna, regulations for extraction of wild fauna, and agreements to prevent conflicts. Mixed quantitative and qualitative approaches allowed the interpretation of the human-fauna interactions related to subsistence, coexistence, and the high relevance of LEK, perceptions, religious beliefs, ecosystem, socio-demographic factors, and animal behaviour and habits, which are crucial factors that influence the shaping of management practices. Local management strategies of fauna were diverse and contribute to biocultural conservation and theoretical construction on domestication.

AB  - Theory generally predicts that host specialisation and dispersal should evolve jointly. Indeed, many models predict that specialists should be poor dispersers to avoid landing on unsuitable hosts while generalists will have high dispersal abilities. Phytophagous arthropods are an excellent group to test this prediction, given extensive variation in their host range and dispersal abilities. Here, we explore the degree to which the empirical literature on this group is in accordance with theoretical predictions. We first briefly outline the theoretical reasons to expect such a correlation. We then report empirical studies that measured both dispersal and the degree of specialisation in phytophagous arthropods. We find a correlation between dispersal and levels of specialisation in some studies, but with wide variation in this result. We then review theoretical attributes of species and environment that may blur this correlation, namely environmental grain, temporal heterogeneity, habitat selection, genetic architecture, and coevolution between plants and herbivores. We argue that theoretical models fail to account for important aspects, such as phenotypic plasticity and the impact of selective forces stemming from other biotic interactions, on both dispersal and specialisation. Next, we review empirical caveats in the study of this interplay. We find that studies use different measures of both dispersal and specialisation, hampering comparisons. Moreover, several studies do not provide independent measures of these two traits. Finally, variation in these traits may occur at scales that are not being considered. We conclude that this correlation is likely not to be expected from large-scale comparative analyses as it is highly context dependent and should not be considered in isolation from the factors that modulate it, such as environmental scale and heterogeneity, intrinsic traits or biotic interactions. A stronger crosstalk between theoretical and empirical studies is needed to understand better the prevalence and basis of the correlation between dispersal and specialisation.

AB  - Lucilia silvarum Meigen (Diptera: Calliphoridae) is widespread throughout North America and Europe. Described in 1826, this blow fly was quickly associated with myiasis in amphibians, and to date has rarely been reported in carrion. There is limited data regarding the time of colonization of animals with fur and the interpretation of this data is difficult due to variation in the animal models used. During an examination of initial insect colonization of cats (Felis catus) with light and dark fur, twelve domestic short-haired cats were placed in cages 15.2 m apart in a grassy field in West Lafayette, Indiana, USA. Eggs from initial oviposition events were collected and reared to identify the colonizing species. Three species of Lucilia (Diptera: Calliphoridae), including L. silvarum, colonized the cats on the initial day of placement. In this study, L. silvarum was the primary colonizer of cats, and this may be the first study where a large number of L. silvarum were collected. Further studies should include development studies on L. silvarum to understand its life history and aid in time of colonization estimations. More work regarding the colonization of furred mammals is needed to further examine L. silvarum as a primary colonizer.

AB  - Watermelon is a globally important fruit threatened by plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs). Effective soil health management through agroecological amendments is crucial for sustainable watermelon production in nematode-infested fields. This study investigated the synergistic effectiveness of rock dust (RD) and poultry manure (PM) as sustainable soil amendments for suppressing PPNs and enhancing watermelon yield. A two-trial field experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design with three replications. The experimental treatments included 2.5 t/ha of RD and PM applied alone or in combination, 5 t/ha of RD and PM applied alone or in combination, and 0 t/ha (unamended control). Observations were made regarding growth and yield characteristics, and nematode communities were assessed at both planting and harvest stages. The collected data were subjected to analysis of variance using SAS 2002 software, and means were differentiated using Fisher's LSD at p < 0.05. Nine genera of PPNs were identified in the watermelon fields, including Meloidogyne, Pratylenchus, Hemicycliophora, Helicotylenchus, Rotylenchus, Scutellonema, Longidorus, Aphelenchus, and Tylenchus. The results indicated significant (p < 0.05) reductions in the populations of the nine PPN genera under amended treatments, with population declines ranging from 73% to 100%. Moreover, the combined RD and PM treatment at 5 t/ha yielded the highest productivity per hectare (36,250 and 36,916 in Trials 1 and 2, respectively), significantly exceeding the control (12,500). This study demonstrates that the synergistic integration of RD and PM as soil amendments effectively suppresses PPNs and enhances yields by leveraging rock dust's mineral enrichment and PM's organic nutrient release, offering dual benefits for soil health and nematode suppression. These findings highlight RD+PM amendment as a sustainable approach to mitigate nematode damage, improve yields, and reduce reliance on synthetic nematicides, ensuring food security and enhancing farmer profitability in watermelon production systems.

AB  - Acrid genotypes (var. sylvestris) of elephant foot yam [Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson syn. A. campanulatus (Roxb.) BL. Ex Dence] are consumed in spite of non-acrid (var. hortensis) types being available, due to their specific flavor, color and taste. Acrid genotypes need to be evaluated for yield and nutrition related characters for selection of desirable food and nutrition content. Genotypes variability was evaluated for yield related traits. Pseudo-stem diameter, number of leaflets, corm volume and corm yield per plant had high genotypic coefficient of variation, heritability and genetic advance as per cent of mean indicating selection would bring improvement in these traits. The top priority should be given to selection based on corm volume, canopy spread and corm width for yield improvement and could be considered while formulating selection indices in the improvement of elephant foot yam. Principal components of most variable traits, pseudo-stem diameter, canopy spread, number of leaflets, corm length, corm width, corm volume and corm yield per plant had eigen values >1 and accounting for 92.82 % of total variation among eleven genotypes. The cophenetic correlation coefficient of dendrogram (0.733) was very close to 1, indicating clustering was good. Based on average performance, genotypes ACC-85 and ACC-136 were found promising for corm yield and carbohydrate, potassium, iron, and zinc contents. The outcome of the study will be helpful for breeders in selection of such genotypes for development of nutritionally rich and high yielding varieties.(c) 2021 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluated the potential effects of adding acidifiers to the drinking water on the growth performance, complete blood count, antioxidant indicators, and diversity of gastrointestinal microbiota for weaned pigs. A total of 400 weaned pigs were randomly divided into four treatments. Pigs were fed the same basal diet and given either water (no acidifier was added, control) or water plus blends of different formulas of acidifiers (acidifier A1, A2, or A3) for 35 days. On d 18 and 35 of the experimental period, 64 pigs (four pigs per pen) were randomly selected to collect blood for a CBC test (n = 128) and an antioxidant indicators test (n = 128); 24 pigs (six pigs per group) were randomly selected to collect fresh feces (n = 48) from the rectum for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Compared to the control, supplementing the drinking water with acidifiers improved the growth performance and survival rate of weaned pigs. Acidifier groups also increased serum catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activities, while also displaying a decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration compared to the control. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the acidifier A1 group was greater than that in the control group (p < 0.05) on d 35; the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the acidifier A1 group was greater than that in the control group (p < 0.05) on d 18 and 35. The microbial species Subdoligranulum or Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 had significantly positive correlations with ADG and ADFI or with serum antioxidant indicators, respectively. These findings suggest that supplementing the drinking water with an acidifier has a potential as an antioxidant, which was reflected in the improvement of growth performance, immunity, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal flora.

AB  - Bisphenol S (BPS) and Bisphenol F (BPF), the analogues of the legacy endocrine disrupting chemical, Bisphenol A (BPA) are ubiquitous in the environment and present in various consumer goods, and potentially neurotoxic. Here, we studied sex-specific responses of bisphenols on behavioural phenotypes, including their association with pro-inflammatory biomarkers and altered neurotransmitters levels, and the key gut microbial abundances. Neurobehavioural changes, using standard test battery, biochemical and molecular estimations for inflammatory cytokines, neurotransmitters, and oxido-nitrosative stress markers, gene expression analysis using qRT-PCR, H &E based histological investigations, gut permeability assays and Oxford Nanopore-based 16S-rRNA metagenomics sequencing for the gut microbial abundance estimations were performed. Bisphenol(s) exposure induces anxiety and depression-like behaviours, particularly in the male mice, with heightened pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and systemic endotoxemia, altered monoamine neurotransmitters levels/turnovers and hippocampal neuronal degeneration and inflammatory responses in the brain. They also increased gut permeability and altered microbial diversity, particularly in males. Present study provides evidence for sex-specific discrepancies in neurobehavioural phenotypes and gut microbiota, which necessitate a nuanced understanding of sexdependent responses to bisphenols. The study contributes to ongoing discussions on the multifaceted implications of bisphenols exposure and underscores the need for tailored regulatory measures to mitigate potential health risks associated with them.

AB  - The livestock sector not only provides people with meat, eggs, milk, and other nutrients but also causes a large number of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. It is urgent to explore the influence mechanism of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission from the livestock sector and formulate effective mitigation strategies. Taking Jiangsu province as an example, we analyzed the influencing factors of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector based on sources and modified the STIRPAT (stochastic impact by regression on population, affluence, and technology) model, proposed the directions, designed the generally circular path, and determined the focus of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction from the livestock sector. The results demonstrated: (1) the top priority of emission reduction of livestock sector in Jiangsu province was the reasonable treatment of manure produced by livestock (non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from manure had accounted for more than 60% of the total emissions from the livestock sector since 2007.), and the core was pig manure management (the CH4 and N2O emissions from pig manure accounted for more than 90 and 50% of the total CH4 and N2O emissions from all livestock manure, respectively). (2) The decrease of the agricultural population, the increase of livestock output value per capita of the agricultural population, and the improvement of livestock carbon productivity all reduced non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions of the livestock sector. For every 1% decrease in agricultural population, for every 1% increase in livestock carbon productivity and livestock output value per capita of the agricultural population, non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector would be reduced by 0.0859%, 0.1748%, and 0.0400%, respectively. (3) To construct and improve the low carbon industrial chain of the livestock sector, to promote low carbon technology research and development and introduction are two focuses for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission reduction in the livestock sector. The research can provide a basis for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction from the livestock sector in China, especially in the developed eastern regions.

AB  - The classification of the superfamily Psylloidea is revised to incorporate findings from recent molecular studies, and to integrate a reassessment of monophyla primarily based on molecular data with morphological evidence and previous classifications. We incorporate a reinterpretation of relevant morphology in the light of the molecular findings and discuss conflicts with respect to different data sources and sampling strategies. Seven families are recognised of which four (Calophyidae, Carsidaridae, Mastigimatidae and Triozidae) are strongly supported, and three (Aphalaridae, Liviidae and Psyllidae) weakly or moderately supported. Although the revised classification is mostly similar to those recognised by recent authors, there are some notable differences, such as Diaphorina and Katacephala which are transferred from Liviidae to Psyllidae. Five new subfamilies and one new genus are described, and one secondary homonym is replaced by a new species name. A new or revised status is proposed for one family, four subfamilies, four tribes, seven subtribes and five genera. One tribe and eight genera/subgenera are synonymised, and 32 new and six revised species combinations are proposed. All recognised genera of Psylloidea (extant and fossil) are assigned to family level taxa, except for one which is considered a nomen dubium.

AB  - It remains a problem to efficiently improve the boar sperm quality of liquid storage due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. To reduce the effects of ROS on boar sperm, in this study, 1 mu g/mL zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) was added into the extender of boar semen during liquid storage at 4 degrees C and 17 degrees C for 7 days. The finding revealed that sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity (PMI) and acrosome integrity significantly increased when compared with the control group (P < 0.05) Additionally, ZnO NPs significantly increased the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and antioxidation abilities (P < 0.05) in boar sperm. Moreover, ZnO NPs could protect boar sperm from oxidative stress (OS) by inhibiting ROS-induced decrease of phosphorylation of PKA substrates (P-PKAs). Together, the current results suggest that ZnO NPs could be used as a novel antioxidant agent for semen preservation, which is helpful in improving the application of assisted reproductive technology in domestic animals.

AB  - Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is an unavoidable contaminant in animal feed and agricultural products. AFB1 has been found to impair the liver and kidney function of sheep. However, few data are available, which explain the toxic damage of AFB1 exposure on meat quality. In the study, male Dorper RAMS sheep (6-month-old) were orally administrated with AFB1 at the dose of 1 mg/kg body weight once. The body temperature, serum biochemistry, meat quality-related parameters, oxidation indicators in meat and serum, the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory, and microbiota composition of feces were measured 24 h after AFB1 exposure. The results showed that the body temperature was slightly increased, the mental state of mutton sheep was suppressed, and biochemical indicators were significantly changed after AFB1 exposure. AFB1 impaired mutton quality reflected by the structure of muscle fibers was changed, and increased muscle drip loss and lightness (L*), and decreased muscle redness (a*). Moreover, we found that AFB1 caused changes in the oxidative stress indicators T-SOD, T-AOC, MDA, GSH level, and GSH/GSSG ratio, and inflammation damage of mutton reflected by increasing pro-inflammatory TNF-alpha and reducing anti-inflammatory IL-10 mRNA levels, disrupts the secretion of inflammatory factors, and changed the composition of gut microbiota reflected by significantly increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and decreased the abundances of Butyrivibrio, which are related to the quality of the mutton. In summary, gut microbiota participates in AFB1 to damage mutton quality, which may be co-mediated by oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut microbiota.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction causes an increase in oxidative stress and depletion in ATP production. Studies have shown that mitochonic acid 5 (MA-5) improves cellular mitochondrial metabolism and ATP production. To this end, varying concentrations of MA-5 (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 nM) were added to a BTS extender, and thereafter, sperm motility and morphological parameters were assessed. Results indicate that adding 1 nM MA-5 significantly enhanced boar sperm motility and progressive motility, with higher values observed at the 1- and 2-h time points compared to the control. Sperm membrane and acrosome integrity values between the control and treatment groups were not different, except for 10 nM MA-5, which caused a reduction in membrane integrity. Treatment with MA-5, specifically 1 nM MA-5, also significantly boosted mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content at the 2-h incubation point. In addition, MA-5 treatments stabilized mitochondrial transcription and translation processes, maintained overall sperm functionality, increased NADPH dehydrogenase subunits 1 (MT-ND1) and NADPH dehydrogenase subunits 6 (MT-ND6) protein and gene expression, and affected mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) levels. However, after 4 h of incubation with MA-5, a decline in sperm quality parameters and an increase in ROS levels were observed. Interestingly, adding 10 nM pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and MA-5 to the extender restored mitochondrial function by enhancing mitochondrial potential and ATP content after 4 h of incubation. Overall, treatment with 1 nM MA-5 can help maintain sperm quality and mitochondrial metabolism during incubation (up to 2 h) at 37oC. Moreover, addition of a combination of MA-5 and 10 nM PQQ to the boar sperm extender is crucial for maintaining high-quality reproduction after 4 h of incubation. Consequently, MA-5 and PQQ play a role in maintaining sperm quality and mitochondrial function and can help in boar sperm preservation and artificial insemination (AI) practices.

AB  - The most abundant adipokine Adiponectin (APN) is present in ovaries. AdipoRon is a small molecule oral APN receptor agonist that binds and activates APN receptors. However, the function of APN/AdipoRon in regulation of luteal cell processes has not been elucidated. To investigate autophagic and apoptotic proteins in goat CLs and effects of APN/AdipoRon on goat luteal autophagy and apoptosis, goat CLs were collected during the early, mid and late luteal stages of the estrous cycle to evaluate autophagic and apoptotic protein patterns. LC3B, Beclin 1, Caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 as well as p-AMPK were differentially abundant at different stages of CL development. All these proteins were primarily localized in large and small luteal steroidogenic cells. Then, isolated luteal steroidogenic cells were evaluated to ascertain the functions and mechanism of APN/AdipoRon in luteal autophagy and apoptosis. Treatment with AdipoRon (25 and 50 mu M) and APN (1 mu g/mL) for 48 h resulted in a decrease in cell viability and P4 level, increased autophagic and apoptotic proteins. Treatment with AdipoRon (25 mu M) led to rapid and transient p-AMPK activation, with p-AMPK elevated at 30 min to 1 h with there being a return to a basal concentration at 2 h post-treatment. Moreover, treatment with AdipoRon led to an increase in autophagy by activating AMPK, which was markedly reduced with treatment with an AMPK inhibitor Compound C and siAMPK, however, abundances of apoptotic proteins were not affected by these treatments. In conclusion, autophagy and apoptosis are involved in the structural regression of goat CL. APN/AdipoRon led to a lesser cell viability and P4 concentration, and activated autophagy through induction of the AMPK while there was induction of apoptosis through an AMPK independent pathway in goat luteal cells.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict has become a significant challenge for conservationists, particularly in areas where endangered species, such as large carnivores, are recovering. If we fail to keep a balance between the interests of humans and wildlife, the human-wildlife conflict can have adverse outcomes. However, the drivers of human-wildlife conflict, and how to mitigate conflict, are often poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the possible causes for and potential mitigating approaches to human-tiger conflict risks through spatiotemporal niche partitioning. Based on data from the reports of Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) preying on cattle and camera trap detection data from 2014 to 2019 in Hunchun, Northeast China, we predicted Amur tiger occurrence and created risk maps of human-tiger potential encounters. We found that Amur tiger occurrence was positively driven by prey distribution and negatively by the distribution of pastures used for domestic cattle grazing. Livestock was increasingly predated in areas with limited preferred prey, that is, wild pig (Sus scrofa) and sika (Cervus nippon), and in closer proximity to cattle-grazing land. On the basis of our models, we divided areas utilized by human and Amur tigers into low-, medium-, and high-risk areas across multiple spatiotemporal scales. We suppose that multiple spatiotemporal scale niche partitioning management might effectively reduce the risk of human-tiger encounters, prompt harmonized coexistence between humans and tigers, and provide new solutions to other areas experiencing human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - The expansion of land being used for cash crop cultivation has threatened wildlife in recent decades. Tea has become the dominant cash crop in southwestern China. Unfortunately, tea plantations may threaten Asian elephant (Elephus maximus) populations via habitat loss and fragmentation. Identifying areas of suitable habitat for tea plant cultivation, and where this habitat overlaps with Asian elephant distribution, is vital for planning land use, managing nature reserves, shaping policy, and maintaining local economies. Here, we assess the potential impact of tea plantations on Asian elephants in southwestern Yunnan province, China. We used MaxEnt modeling with bioclimatic and environmental variables to identify suitable habitat for tea plant cultivation under the current climate scenario, and then overlapped this habitat with 9 known Asian elephant distribution areas (G1-G9) to determine "threatened areas." Our results showed that (1) annual precipitation (48.1% contribution), temperature constancy (29 % contribution), and slope (8.7 % contribution) were key in determining suitable habitat for tea plants; (2) the cumulative area of suitable habitat for tea plants was 13,784.88 km(2), mainly distributed in Menghai (3934.53 km(2)), Lancang (3198.67 km(2)), and Jinghong (2657.74 km(2)); (3) the distribution area of elephants was 943.75 km(2), and these areas overlapped with suitable tea plant habitat primarily located in G4 (379.40 km(2)), G3 (251.18), and G7 (168.03 km(2)); and (4) threatened areas in G1 and G7 were predominately located along the periphery of current nature reserves. Win-win solutions that work for elephant conservation and economic development include rescoping nature reserve boundaries, strengthening management on the periphery of nature reserves, establishing ecological corridors and new nature reserves within regions where elephants are currently distributed, planting alternative cash crops, and financial subsidies to farmers. This study improves understanding of human-elephant coexistence, and will assist in guiding land use policy for the future conservation outcomes seeking to promote responsible and profitable cash crop farming and elephant conservation.

AB  - Context. Accidental poisoning of domestic dogs is a potential risk when using baits to control invasive animals. We developed and trialled an electrical device attached to a non-toxic bait to assess whether we could induce a learned aversion towards baits in conservation-working dogs.
   Aims. We tested the device on conservation-working dogs licenced to enter conservation estate as part of feral pig control, and consequently are potentially exposed to lethal baits for controlling red foxes.
   Methods. Over 1 year (up to seven separate training sessions per dog), 27 dogs were sequentially presented with electrified and non-electrified non-toxic baits and their behavioural responses were recorded. On-farm training (Days 0, 1, 7, Months 1, 12) comprised dogs being called by their owner standing nearby the electrified bait. If the dog touched the bait and demonstrated aversive behaviour (we assume that it received an electric shock or 'correction'), it was then presented with a non-electrified bait. If they ate either bait, they were shown another electrified bait (up to three electrified baits per session).
   Key results. Seventeen dogs (17/27) touched the bait and received a correction. Eleven dogs required only a single correction and did not touch another bait, three dogs needed two corrections, and two dogs needed three or four corrections. These 17 dogs showed increasing avoidance to the bait over successive training sessions (x(12)(2) = 67.96, P < 0.001), including avoiding looking at the bait, refusing to come within 5-10 m of the bait and their owner, or leaving the training vicinity. All these dogs (17/17) avoided baits encountered in a working environment (1/17 touched but did not consume a bait) and bait-aversion was still detected up to 1-year post-initial training. Nine dogs (9/27) did not appear to receive a correction or show any change in bait-aversion behaviour. One dog (1/27) showed no aversion to the stimulus and continued to eat baits.
   Conclusions. Here we present a proof of concept for a deterrent device and associated experimental protocol to produce learned aversion behaviour in conservation-working dogs.

AB  - Weaning and mixing cause substantial social stress among piglets and frequently lead to stress, injury, inflammation, immunosuppression and growth retardation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different early social environments on social behavior, physiology and growth performance of weaned piglets. In total, 133 YDM (Large White x DM [Duroc x Min pig]) piglets from 12 litters were studied from weaning (35 day-old) to the end of the nursery period (63 day-old). Three pre-weaning treatments were examined: intermittent contact (INT, 4 litters), piglets of two neighboring litters were socialized twice a week for 3 h from day (D) 14 to D35; continuous contact (CONTIN, 4 litters), piglets of two neighboring litters were socialized from D14 to D35; non contact (NC, 4 litters), the other 4 litters were kept separate. After weaning, NC piglets were randomly regrouped into 4 new litters as the control group (CON, 4 litters); 4 litters of INT were mixed with nonadjacent litters from same group as the intermittent mixing group (IM, 4 litters); similarly, CONTIN was regrouped into the continuous mixing group (CM, 4 litters). The results revealed that within 72 h after mixing, the number of fighting in CM < IM < CON (P = 0.001); the numbers of head knocks in IM and CM were lower than CON (P = 0.001); the oral-nasal contact of CM < IM < CON (P < 0.001). The feed conversion ratio was higher in CM than in CON and IM (P = 0.001); daily weight gain in IM was higher than CM (P = 0.005); CV in IM was lower than CON and CM (P = 0.043). The antibody blocking rate against CSFV in IM and CM were higher than that in CON (P < 0.001); IL1 beta of IM < CON < CM (P < 0.001); cortisol in IM was lower than that in CM and CON (P = 0.005); brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in IM > CON (P = 0.024). This study revealed that intermittent socialization pattern had positive effects on social behaviors, growth performance and physiology of piglets after weaning. Intermittent socialization patterns may be helpful for improving the welfare of weaned piglets, but further confirmation is necessary.

AB  - Comparative studies with taxonomically and geographically paired alien species that exhibit different degrees of success in their invasions may help to identify the factors that determine invasiveness. Examples of such species in Europe include the noninvasive Impatiens balfourii and invasive I. glandulifera. We tested whether the low invasiveness of I. balfourii in Europe may be explained by strong pressure from local enemies. Earlier studies of these two species provided support for their hybridization. We tested this phenomenon as the potential occurrence of I. glandulifera x I. balfourii hybrids might promote the evolution of the invasiveness of I. balfourii. Both species were germinated from seeds collected in 2015 on the Swiss-Italian border in Insubria and utilized in three experiments: (1) a common garden enemy release test (leaf damage or pest pressure), (2) a test of the pressure exerted by a generalist enemy and (3) hybridization test. In the first test, the effect of enemies was assessed by the level of leaf damage and the number of pests. In the second test, a food choice experiment with a generalist herbivore (Cepaea snails) was performed. In the hybridization test, the plants were placed in a climatic chamber for self-pollination and hand cross-pollination. Analyses of enemy release and Cepaea snail preference revealed that I. balfourii experienced higher enemy pressure than I. glandulifera; however, this was not reflected in the performance of the plants. Although I. glandulifera was larger, I. balfourii had greater fecundity. Thus, the invasion success of I. glandulifera could not be unambiguously attributed to its greater degree of release from enemies compared with the noninvasive I. balfourii. Additionally, we did not obtain any evidence of hybridization between the two species. Thus, we obtained no support for the hypothesis that the evolution of the invasiveness of I. balfourii could be enhanced through hybridization with I. glandulifera.

AB  - In 2018, we initiated renewed excavation of the Later Stone Age (LSA) deposits at Wonderwerk Cave. Here we describe the goals and initial results of the first two seasons of excavation, including the first micromorphological description of these deposits. We employed a small-scale excavation technique to emphasize precision recording and limit the destruction of sensitive deposits. Our preliminary results indicate that meaningful patterns in material culture records and paleoecological proxy materials can be derived from such investigations. Bioturbation of the LSA deposits is widespread in our micromorphological samples, suggesting that some postdepositional movement of the sediment occurred but did not impact overall stratigraphic integrity. This is supported by the radiocarbon chronology (derived from various material records), which indicates that this movement had a limited effect on the material record. Three technocomplexes (the Kuruman/Oakhurst, Wilton, and Historic) were identified in the new Wonderwerk lithic material record, alongside increasing evidence for a period of intensified use and/or occupation of the site during the Wilton - a pattern previously identified by the F. Thackeray's and A. Thackeray's 1970s excavations. New radiocarbon ages support previous determinations placing the timing of this intensification at ca. 6200 years cal BP. Faunal and ostrich eggshell records also support previous findings, confirming an anthropogenic origin for the faunal remains and suggesting that different pathways of OES bead production were employed at the site at different times. The presence of herbivore dung and associated spherulites in a micromorphology thin section provides a new potential line of evidence to support the Thackeray's tentative suggestion for sheep herding at the site ca. 2000 years BP. While this evidence is far from conclusive, it suggests that the Wonderwerk Cave LSA record may have a role to play in resolving the timing of the adoption of sheep by hunter-gatherers on the Ghaap Plateau. Our work on the LSA at Wonderwerk Cave serves as a touchstone within the more regionally focused Northern Cape Archaeology and Ecology Project (NCAEP) - an international and interdisciplinary research project studying the LSA paleoenvironment of the South African arid interior. Ultimately, NCAEP is designed to produce a multi-proxy diachronic climatic record of the Northern Cape firmly situated within new and existing radiocarbon chronologies.

AB  - The concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Hg, Pb, Zn) and arsenic was determined in water, soil and alfalfa samples in three sites (Congata, Uchumayo and Vitor) located along the Quilca - Vitor - Chili River, near the city of Arequipa, Peru. The content of these elements was also analysed in samples of alfalfa at different times of being planted (1 to 3 months) in Congata. Alfalfa planted in three other locations (Quiscos, Yarabamba and La Joya) upstream and downstream of the first three was also analysed. To determine the concentration of heavy metals in sheep, measurements were made on liver and kidney samples from animals farmed in the first three sites. The concentration of metals and arsenic in the water samples was lower than the Peruvian environmental quality standards, except for Hg in Vitor (0.0001 mg L-1). The Cd content in the soil at all three sites (62.01 - 381.94 mg kg(-1)) was well above the EQS for agricultural, commercial or industrial soils. The Cd content in the alfalfa samples grown in the same soils was higher than that observed in the samples from Quiscos, Yarabamba and La Joya. The estimated daily intake values (EDI) for metals detected in sheep kidneys and liver (Fe, Cu, Zn) were below the provisional maximum tolerable daily intakes (PMTDI) for children and adults, while the target hazard quotient (THQ) and total THQ of these elements were less than 1, indicating that their consumption would not have an adverse health effect.

AB  - For robust vocalization perception, the auditory system must generalize over variability in vocalization production as well as variability arising from the listening environment (e.g., noise and reverberation). We previously demonstrated using guinea pig and marmoset vocalizations that a hierarchical model generalized over production variability by detecting sparse intermediate-complexity features that are maximally informative about vocalization category from a dense spectrotemporal input representation. Here, we explore three biologically feasible model extensions to generalize over environmental variability: (1) training in degraded conditions, (2) adaptation to sound statistics in the spectrotemporal stage and (3) sensitivity adjustment at the feature detection stage. All mechanisms improved vocalization categorization performance, but improvement trends varied across degradation type and vocalization type. One or more adaptive mechanisms were required for model performance to approach the behavioral performance of guinea pigs on a vocalization categorization task. These results highlight the contributions of adaptive mechanisms at multiple auditory processing stages to achieve robust auditory categorization.
   A computational model for categorizing vocalizations from marmosets and guinea pigs highlights the contributions of adaptive mechanisms at multiple auditory processing stages to achieve robust auditory categorization.

AB  - Insect herbivores have evolved a broad spectrum of adaptations in response to the diversity of chemical defences employed by plants. Here we focus on two species of New Guinean Asota and determine how these specialist moths deal with the leaf alkaloids of their fig (Ficus) hosts. As each focal Asota species is restricted to one of three chemically distinct species of Ficus, we also test whether these specialized interactions lead to similar alkaloid profiles in both Asota species. We reared Asota caterpillars on their respective Ficus hosts in natural conditions and analyzed the alkaloid profiles of leaf, frass, caterpillar, and adult moth samples using UHPLC-MS/MS analyses. We identified 43 alkaloids in our samples. Leaf alkaloids showed various fates. Some were excreted in frass or found in caterpillars and adult moths. We also found two apparently novel indole alkaloids-likely synthesized de novo by the moths or their microbiota-in both caterpillar and adult tissue but not in leaves or frass. Overall, alkaloids unique or largely restricted to insect tissue were shared across moth species despite feeding on different hosts. This indicates that a limited number of plant compounds have a direct ecological function that is conserved among the studied species. Our results provide evidence for the importance of phytochemistry and metabolic strategies in the formation of plant-insect interactions and food webs in general. Furthermore, we provide a new potential example of insects acquiring chemicals for their benefit in an ecologically relevant insect genus.

AB  - Many questions still remain regarding the acquisition and circulation of ancient domesticated animals across the Yellow River Basin, one of the key areas for the development of complex societies in ancient China. Here, we re-evaluate previously published strontium isotope data (Sr-87/Sr-86, n = 167) from tooth enamel of domesticated animals at 10 archaeological sites in the Yellow River Basin to shed new light on the transition between the Neolithic (7000-5000 BCE) and the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046-771 BCE). The results show that from the Late Neolithic to the Western Zhou Dynasty, some domesticated animals, mostly cattle and sheep, were increasingly sourced from non-local areas. We employed Bayesian methods to define an isoscape of bioavailable Sr for the Yellow River Basin and to show the considerable diversity in the origins of non-local domesticated animals, some of which may have come from locations hundreds of kilometers away from the site as early as the Late Neolithic. The increasingly variable Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of domesticated animals from the Neolithic to the Western Zhou Dynasty are consistent with that of associated human remains, and also match the archaeological and zooarchaeological evidence for increased circulation of animal products in the Yellow River Basin. Therefore, we infer that local economies increasingly incorporated non-local animals as part of wider circulation networks that emerged with the development of complex societies since the Late Neolithic.

AB  - Little is known about the fate of heavy metals in the recycling system of animal manure-black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) transformation-larval frass application. In this work, BSFL-transformed pig manure with different concentrations of exogenous cadmium (Cd) (0, 3, 15, 30 mg kg(-1)), and the obtained BSFL frass fertilizer were further used in pot experiments of maize planting to explore Cd migration during the whole recycling system. Results showed that Cd addition to pig manure had no significant effects on BSFL growth or BSFL transformation performance. The Cd concentrations in BSFL frass were 10.9-19.8% lower than those in pig manure, while those in BSFL bodies were 2.3-4.0-times those of pig manure. For maize planting, only 30 mg kg(-1) of Cd treatment significantly inhibited maize growth. The BSFL frass application (under exogenous Cd treatment) enhanced Cd contents in the aboveground and underground parts of maize (3.3-57.6-times) and those in soil (0.5-1.7-times) compared with CK (no Cd addition). Additionally, 61.2-73.5% of pig manure-sourced Cd was transformed into BSFL frass and the rest entered BSFL bodies. Only a small part (0.31-1.34%) of manure-sourced Cd entered maize plants. BSFL transformation decreased the proportions of weak acid-dissolved Cd from 44.2-53.0% (manure) to 37.3-46.0% (frass). After frass application, the proportions of weak acid-dissolved Cd in soil were further decreased to 17.8-42.5%, while the residual fractions of Cd increased to 27.2-67.7%. The findings provided a theoretical basis for the rational application of BSFL frass fertilizers sourced from heavy-metal-contaminated manure.

AB  - Artificial insemination in goats commonly relies on refrigerated semen doses, yet the optimal energetic substrate to support sperm metabolism remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different energetic substrates on goat buck sperm metabolism and motility when refrigerated at 17 degrees C. Semen from six Murciano-Granadina male goats were collected and diluted in PBS supplemented with 35 mM of either glucose, fructose, pyruvate, or lactate in the first experiment. In the second experiment, the effects of varying concentrations of pyruvate and/or glucose, NaCl supplementation, and the osmolarity on sperm quality parameters were assessed. Semen was stored at 17 degrees C for 48 h and evaluated for motility using the CASA system, as well as for viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial ROS by flow cytometry. The results show that pyruvate and lactate extenders outperformed the others, preserving higher total motility, progressivity, and viability of spermatozoa over 48 h, even at a concentration lower than 35 mM, as in the case of pyruvate. In contrast, glucose had a detrimental effect on sperm quality, reducing viability and healthy population rates while increasing motility, especially at higher concentrations. NaCl supplementation and osmolarity had no significant effect on any of the sperm quality parameters. In conclusion, pyruvate maintains a higher quality and motility of sperm stored at 17 degrees C in PBS in comparison with a glucose-supplemented extender.

AB  - The transcription factors (TFs) MyoCD (myocardin) and Elk-1 (ETS Like-1 protein) competitively bind to SRF (serum response factor) and control myogenic- and mitogenic-related gene expression in smooth muscle, respectively. Their functions are therefore mutually inhibitory, which results in a contractile-versus-proliferative phenotype dichotomy. Airway smooth muscle cell (ASMC) phenotype alterations occur in various inflammatory airway diseases, promoting pathological remodeling and contributing to airflow obstruction. We characterized MyoCD and Elk-1 interactions and their roles in phenotype determination in human ASMCs. MyoCD overexpression in ASMCs increased smooth muscle gene expression, force generation, and partially restored the loss of smooth muscle protein associated with prolonged culturing while inhibiting Elk-1 transcriptional activities and proliferation induced by EGF (epidermal growth factor). However, MyoCD overexpression failed to suppress these responses induced by FBS, as FBS also upregulated SRF expression to a degree that allowed unopposed function of both TFs. Inhibition of the RhoA pathway reversed said SRF changes, allowing inhibition of Elk-1 by MyoCD overexpression and suppressing FBS-mediated contractile protein gene upregulation. Our study confirmed that MyoCD in increased abundance can competitively inhibit Elk-1 function. However, SRF upregulation permits a dual contractile-proliferative ASMC phenotype that is anticipated to exacerbate pathological alterations, whereas therapies targeting SRF may inhibit pathological ASMC proliferation and contractile protein gene expression.

AB  - Hybridization of livestock can be used to improve varieties, and different hybrid combinations produce unique breeding effects. In this study, male Southdown and Suffolk sheep were selected to hybridize with female Hu sheep to explore the effects of male parentage on muscle growth and the development of offspring. Using data-independent acquisition technology, we identified 119, 187, and 26 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) between Hu x Hu (HH) versus Southdown x Hu (NH), HH versus Suffolk x Hu (SH), and NH versus SH crosses. Two DAPs, MYOZ2 and MYOM3, were common to the three hybrid groups and were mainly enriched in muscle growth and development-related pathways. At the myoblast proliferation stage, MYOZ2 expression decreased cell viability and inhibited proliferation. At the myoblast differentiation stage, MYOZ2 expression promoted myoblast fusion and enhanced the level of cell fusion. These findings provide new insights into the key proteins and metabolic pathways involved in the effect of male parentage on muscle growth and the development of hybrid offspring in sheep.

AB  - 1. Bird flocks frequently generate human-wildlife conflicts, resulting in safety and health hazards, and economic losses. Remotely controlled, raptor-like robots have recently emerged as potentially effective deterrence tools, exploiting the innate collective escape response of birds to their predators and hence avoiding the emergence of habituation, but field tests are still scanty.
   2. We tested the effectiveness of a robotic falcon (RobotFalcon [RF]) as a deterrence tool for feral pigeons Columba livia breeding and feeding in a cattle farm (similar to 500 individuals) and black-headed gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus night-roosting in a wastewater treatment plant (similar to 8000 individuals). We analysed collective behavioural responses during 10-min RF exposure trials mimicking natural predator attacks and assessed deterrence effectiveness (change in the number of birds) at different temporal scales (immediate response-within-trials and returning post-trials; short-term response-across 5-8 successive daily exposures). We also evaluated medium-term deterrence effectiveness by quantifying gull flight activity using a marine radar for similar to 10 days after RF exposure trials.
   3. The RF induced consistent collective behavioural responses, similar to real avian predators. The frequency of collective behaviours decreased both within- and across trials, mainly because flocks rapidly abandoned the target sites.
   4. Pigeons decreased both during and increasingly across trials, abandoning the target site soon after trial onset. However, most pigeons returned within 30 min after the end of trials, and individuals returning post-trials decreased only slightly (13%) across trials. The RF triggered massive gull displacements during trials, with a faster reaction in the last trial days compared to initial ones, and individuals returning post-trials decreased markedly (94%) across trials. Night flight activity showed a large (40%) decrease post- compared to pre-trial days, suggesting persistent deterrence effects.
   5. Practical implication. The RF is a valuable tool to deter birds from gathering in flocks in contexts where human-wildlife conflict may arise, based on robust evidence and field tests under different conditions. Yet, its effectiveness may depend on the importance of resources used by the target flocking species at the exposure site. Predator-like robots provide unique advantages related to animal welfare, consistency of deterrence protocols and effective management of human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Non-coding RNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to viral stresses. However, their molecular mechanisms in tea leaf spot responses remain unclear. In this study, using Camellia sinensis, we identified lncRNA81246 as a long non-coding RNA that localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. It functions as a competitive endogenous RNA, thereby disrupting CsNAC1 (encoding NAC domain-containing protein 1) degradation mediated by miR164d. Silencing lncRNA81246 increased the resistance of tea plants to presistanceathogens, whereas transient lncRNA81246-overexpression plants showed decreased resistance to pathogens. Co-expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that lncRNA81246 affects the miR164d-CsNAC1 regulatory module. Transient miR164d-overexpression and silencing assays demonstrated its positive regulation of tea plant resistance. Specifically, silencing its target, CsNAC1,enhanced disease resistance, whereas transient overexpression reduced plant resistance. Yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase, and RT-qPCR assay results suggested that CsNAC1 alters the expression of CsEXLB1, whereas AsODN and tobacco transient overexpression assays showed that CsEXLB1 negatively regulated tea plant resistance. Thus, our research demonstrated that lncRNA81246 acts as a mediator to interfere with the miR164d-CsNAC1 regulatory module involved in the disease resistance of tea plants.

AB  - Studies of populations on a temporal scale are essential to accessing the real diversity of an area since species may not be distributed equally over time. The temporal distribution of species can be related to climatic conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, which play an important role in biological systems, influencing biotic interactions. Insects may optimise their life-cycles to benefit from suitable environmental conditions, including food availability and escape from predators and parasitoids. The goal of this study is to describe the temporal distribution of Eois Hubner abundance associated with species of Piper and to investigate the role of climate and parasitoid wasps on monthly distributions of immature abundance. The study was carried out in an area of Atlantic Forest in Serra do Japi Biological Reserve (SJ), Jundiai - SP, Brazil. For 13 months, from June 2015 to July 2016, Eois immatures were sought monthly under all leaves of 24 individuals from ten Piper species and reared until the emergence of adults or parasitoids. A total of 778 immature Eois specimens were sampled, and all abundance peaks were concentrated between March to June. No correlation was found between monthly Eois distribution with precipitation and temperature. Otherwise, the results showed a time-delayed correlation between the rate of parasitism and the abundance of Eois immatures, with the highest rate of parasitism occurring after peak abundance of immatures.

AB  - Prenatal ethanol exposure is a leading preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disability, clinically categorized under fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). This study explores how developmental alcohol exposure affects the dendritic morphology of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, focusing on the actin cytoskeleton's dynamics essential for neuronal structure and synaptic function. Within this context, we hypothesized that developmental alcohol exposure disrupts actin cytoskeleton dynamics, leading to cognitive deficits and dendritic remodeling in the hippocampus. Neonatal mice (C57BL/6 J) were administered ethanol (5.0 g/kg) intraperitoneally from postnatal day 2-8, establishing a third trimester-equivalent alcohol exposure FASD model. At postnatal day 28, cognitive performance was evaluated using novel location recognition (NLR), novel object recognition (NOR), and the Morris water maze (MWM). Golgi staining assessed dendritic morphology in the hippocampal CA1 region, and the ratio of polymerized (F-actin) to globular actin (G-actin) was measured using a biochemical assay. The results revealed that developmental alcohol exposure significantly impaired recognition and spatial memory, as evidenced by decreased performances in the NOR and MWM tests across both sexes. Golgi staining revealed reduced dendritic arborization complexity and spine density in the CA1 region of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons of both male and female juvenile mice. Biochemical analyses further revealed decresed hipocampal Factin/G-actin ratios and decreased levels of polymerized F-actin in both sexes. These findings underscore the critical role of cytoskeletal integrity in cognitive development and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention in FASD.

AB  - Hunting bullets are often comprised of a lead core covered with a copper alloy jacket. When the bullet collides with an animal, particles-sometimes millions-can shed from the projectile and embed in animal tissues. Those lead fragments can persist in game meat and remain in the discarded viscera that many wildlife species scavenge. Bullets often differ in design, so it is vital to assess their weight retention and expansion, which affects how much metal they deposit in tissue and how effectively they kill animals. We fired 12 types of hunting bullets into water to measure their weight retention and expansion at 91 m and 238 m (100 and 260 yards). Bullet constructions included copper, tin, bonded lead, partitioned lead, and cup-and-core lead. On average, copper bullets retained >98 % of their weight, whereas cup-and-core lead bullets retained <13-55 %, depending on the brand and shot distance. One brand of bonded lead bullet retained mass (>= 96 %) nearly as well as copper bullets, while another brand retained much less (similar to 71 %). Two types of copper bullets expanded similarly between test distances, while a third expanded less at 238 m. Cup-and-core lead bullets often experienced a separation between their copper alloy jacket and lead core. Our data emphasize that lead-based bullets of similar construction can drastically differ in weight retention and expansion.

AB  - Orchids are among the plants most threatened by anthropic impact and environmental changes. Therefore, all known orchid species are protected in several countries by regional, national and international legislation. Several studies have cast doubts on the effectiveness of legislation to ensure the protection of wild orchids. We assessed the vitality of four orchid populations in a coastal area in Northern Italy, by monitoring the vegetative and reproductive traits of the orchid populations growing both in the protected sites comprising the Natura 2000 network, and in non-protected sites. We also monitored the level of environmental threat to orchid vitality. The early-flowering deceptive species (Ophrys sphegodes and Anacamptis morio) exhibited high vegetative vitality and experienced similar levels of environmental threat in the protected and non-protected areas. However, their reproductive success was strongly jeopardized, probably by a failed pollination that impeded the fruit set. The late-flowering, partially or totally rewarding species (Anacamptis pyramidalis and Anacamptis coriophora) were more strongly impacted by spring mowing and ungulate herbivory and alien species. Only for A. coriophora were the herbivory and alien species invasions lower at the protected vs. non-protected sites, which ensured a higher population vitality at the protected sites. We conclude that the environmental protection in our study area is ineffective for preserving orchids without targeted actions against specific environmental threats.

AB  - Invasive species cause damage to ecosystems by altering and dominating native habitats. Classical biological control can be a safe and effective way to control invasive species, especially in areas where chemical and mechanical control are not recommended, because of potential damage to non-target species, difficulty to access sites, and the costs associated with the treatment of large areas. Schinus terebinthifolia, Brazilian peppertree (BP) was introduced into Florida as an ornamental plant in the 1890s and is considered an aggressive invasive species in Florida. Pseudophilothrips ichini was the first biological control agent of BP released in Florida in 2019 and three Calophya spp., are under study as potential biological control agents. Feeding by Calophya can either elicit a hypersensitive response (HR) from BP that kills immatures at the feeding point or susceptibility with complete development and adult emergence. Pseudophilothrips ichini feeding does not elicit such response. To determine if previously elicited HR to the feeding of Calophya lutea affected P. ichini or its impact on, we measured the change in plant growth and the number of adults after one generation of P. ichini on susceptible and hypersensitive BP. After one generation of thrips feeding, plant height was the only factor that differed between plants that were hypersensitive and susceptible to Calophya lutea exposure, with hypersensitive plants being significantly shorter than susceptible plants. Our results suggest that even when HR is elicited by prior feeding of Calophya lutea, it will not affect P. ichini feeding and reproduction and should enhance control of BP.

AB  - Simple Summary Reproductive capacity is limited by the ovulation rate of ewes, which affects the sustainability of sheep farming. Recent studies have identified the involvement of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in follicular growth and development. Therefore, identification of circRNAs affecting follicle development could effectively improve the low number of prolific sheep breeds. In this study, circRNA expression profiles of follicular tissues of year-round estrus and prolific Cele black sheep, and seasonally estrous and low-yielding Hetian sheep were obtained using transcriptome sequencing technology. In addition, novel_circ_0040512 was determined to target sheep reproduction-associated oar-miR-125b using RNA pull-down and high-throughput sequencing techniques. These results provide a theoretical basis for the molecular biology of the genetic progression of sheep reproductive traits. CircRNAs are essential in regulating follicle growth and development and the female reproductive system at multiple levels. However, the molecular mechanism by which circRNAs regulate reproduction in sheep is unclear and requires further exploration. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to reveal the circRNA expression profiles in the ovaries of Cele black sheep and Hetian sheep during estrus. Analysis of the number of circRNAs in their host genes revealed that 5031 genes could produce 20,835 circRNAs. Among the differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNA), 75 were upregulated, and 105 were downregulated. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the host genes of DEcircRNA were involved in several pathways, including the MAPK and Hippo signaling pathway. In addition, we constructed a subnetwork of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) containing 4 mRNAs, 4 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 10 circRNAs, potentially related to follicle development. Functional circRNAs (e.g., novel_circ_0003851, novel_circ_0015526, novel_circ_0008117) were found to act as ceRNAs for follicle growth and development-related mRNAs (CUEDC1, KPNB1, ZFPM2) by sponging functional miRNAs (miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-17-5p). Finally, through an RNA pull-down assay, oar-miR-125b was selected and confirmed as the target miRNA of novel-circ-0041512. We analyzed the overall expression of circRNAs in sheep ovaries. Further, we explored the potential mechanisms underlying the circRNA functions, providing a theoretical basis for the genetic progress of reproductive traits in sheep.

AB  - Cystic ovarian disease (COD) is a major cause of infertility in dairy cows. This study aimed to investigate the impact of follicular cysts on the invitro blastocyst developmental competence of oocytes and the relative gene expression of blastocysts developed from the subordinate follicles of ipsilateral (ovary with cyst), contralateral (ovary opposite to cyst), and normal ovaries of buffaloes. A total of 2059 ovaries were collected from slaughterhouse and classified into three categories based on the presence of follicular cysts: a) ipsilateral, b) contralateral, and c) control (absence of cysts). Oocytes of grades A, B, and C were used for invitro maturation, invitro fertilization, and invitro culture. The cleavage rates of the ipsilateral (91.54 %) and contralateral (95.71 %) categories were higher (P < 0.01) than those of the control (76.82 %). Conversely, the blastocyst development rate was higher (P < 0.01) in control (32.67 %) than in ipsilateral (8.46 %) and contralateral (7.14 %) groups. The mRNA expression levels of maturation (BMP15), steroidogenesis (STAR, CYP19), antioxidant (SOD2, HSPB1) and anti-apoptotic (BCL2) genes were decreased in arrested embryos derived from both cystic (ipsilateral and contralateral) and control category follicles when compared to blastocysts derived from their respective category follicles. Conversely, BAX expression increased in arrested embryos. Expression of SOD2 and BAX was downregulated in blastocysts from both ipsilateral and contralateral categories compared to controls. The presence of one or more follicular cysts in either ovary affected the developmental competence of oocytes derived from subordinate follicles. Therefore, the buffaloes with cysts in either ovary should be avoided when aspirating follicles for IVF.

AB  - Raoellid mammals are small artiodactyls from the Eocene of Asia, hypothesized to be closely related to stem Cetacea. Knowledge of the cranial and dental morphology of Raoellidae comes mostly from one species, Indohyus indirae. Here we describe new material of another raoellid genus, Khirtharia, based on material retrieved from the Kalakot area, Jammu and Kashmir. This new material, comprising an almost complete, lightly deformed cranium and a partial snout with associated partial mandible, greatly adds to our knowledge of raoellid morphology. It highlights the similarity of cranial characters with Indohyus, such as a long snout with raptorial incisors, a thick and narrow supraorbital region, a strong postorbital constriction, a triangular shaped braincase, and a thickened medial wall to the auditory bulla (involucrum). The new specimen is similar to Indohyus cranially but differs dentally in being more bunodont. The presence of these traits in two different raoellid genera suggests they may be present more broadly across Raoellidae. These characters are also observed in early cetaceans, highlighting the need to investigate their phylogenetic impact. Some cranial features support aquatic habits of members of this family.

AB  - The consequences of defensive secondary metabolite concentrations and interspecific metabolite diversity on grazers have been extensively investigated. Grazers which prefer certain food sources are often found in high abundance on their host and as a result, understanding the interaction between the two is important to understand community structure. The effects of intraspecific diversity, however, on the grazer are not well understood. Within a single, localized geographic area, the Antarctic red seaweed Plocamium sp. produces 15 quantitatively and qualitatively distinct mixtures of halogenated monoterpenes ("chemogroups"). Plocamium sp. is strongly chemically defended which makes it unpalatable to most grazers, except for the amphipod Paradexamine fissicauda. We investigated differences in the feeding and growth rates of both Plocamium sp. and P. fissicauda, in addition to grazer reproductive output, in relation to different chemogroups. Some chemogroups significantly reduced the grazer's feeding rate compared to other chemogroups and a non-chemically defended control. The growth rate of Plocamium sp. did not differ between chemogroups and the growth rates of P. fissicauda also did not show clear patterns between the feeding treatments. Reproductive output, however, was significantly reduced for amphipods on a diet of algae possessing one of the chemogroups when compared to a non-chemically defended control. Hence, intraspecific chemodiversity benefits the producer since certain chemogroups are consumed at a slower rate and the grazer's reproductive output is reduced. Nevertheless, the benefits outweigh the costs to the grazer as it can still feed on its host and closely associates with the alga for protection from predation.

AB  - Climate change has created unprecedented stresses in the agricultural sector, driving the necessity of adapting agricultural practices and developing novel solutions to the food crisis. Camelina sativa (Camelina) is a recently emerging oilseed crop with high nutrient-density and economic potential. Camelina seeds are rich in essential fatty acids and contain potent antioxidants required to maintain a healthy diet. Camelina seeds are equally amenable to economic applications such as jet fuel, biodiesel and high-value industrial lubricants due to their favorable proportions of unsaturated fatty acids. High soil salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses threatening the yield and usability of such crops. A promising mitigation strategy is automated, non-destructive, image-based phenotyping to assess seed quality in the food manufacturing process. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of image-based phenotyping on fluorescent and visible light images to quantify and qualify Camelina seeds. We developed a user-friendly web portal called SeedML that can uncover key morpho-colorimetric features to accurately identify Camelina seeds coming from plants grown in high salt conditions using a phenomics platform equipped with fluorescent and visible light cameras. This portal may be used to enhance quality control, identify stress markers and observe yield trends relevant to the agricultural sector in a high throughput manner. Findings of this work may positively contribute to similar research in the context of the climate crisis, while supporting the implementation of new quality controls tools in the agri-food domain.

AB  - Using knowledge about plant-insect interactions in a crop protection perspective is a pre-requisite to promote the development of novel pest management strategies. Enhancing plant natural defenses has been described as a promising way to improve the management of pests. In cotton, plant topping (cutting off the top of the plant) for inducing such defenses has been proposed as a promising tool for integrated pest management. The main objective of this study was to explore the effect of cotton topping on the performance of the cotton aphid, Aphis gosypii, under greenhouse conditions. The effect of plant topping was evaluated on topped and on neighbor non-topped plants. Results showed that cotton topping disturbed A. gossypii aphids not only on the topped plant but also on neighbor non-topped plants. The population of aphids grew slower in the topped compared to the control treatment and lower abundances of aphids were found in the topped treatment up to a distance of 100 cm to the topped plant. When an individual nymph was confined in a clip-cage, the production of winged adults after 15 days of confinement was higher in the topped compared to the control treatment. This difference decreased as the distance to the topped plant increased. In conclusion, our study proves that cotton topping mediates plant-pest interactions on the focal and neighbor plants. We discuss how cotton topping is a promising technique that could be used as part of an integrated pest management program, particularly for smallholders in West Africa, for controlling aphid infestations.

AB  - Intensive swine farming causes strong local environmental impacts by generating effluents rich in solids, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, and pathogenic bacteria. Insufficient treatment of hog farm effluents has been reported for common technologies, and vermifiltration is considered a promising treatment alternative that, however, requires additional processes to remove nitrate and phosphorus. This work aimed to study the use of vermifiltration with a downstream hydroponic culture to treat hog farm effluents. A treatment system comprising a vermifilter and a downstream deep-water culture hydroponic unit was built. The treated effluent was reused to dilute raw wastewater. Electrical conductivity, pH, and changes in BOD5, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphorus, and coliform bacteria were assessed. Plants were monitored throughout the experiment. Electrical conductivity increased due to vermifiltration; pH stayed within a neutral to mild alkaline range. Vermifiltration removed 83% of BOD5, 99% of ammonia and nitrite, and increased nitrate by 11%. Hydroponic treatment removed BOD5 (63%), ammonia (100%), nitrite (66%), nitrate (27%), and phosphorus (47% total and 44% dissolved) from vermifiltered water. Coliforms were reduced by vermifiltration but recovered in the hydroponic unit. Plants showed the ability to grow on vermifiltered wastewater, although requiring nutrient supplementation. Vermifiltration combined with hydroponics is a promising treatment for swine wastewater, although optimization will be needed for a sustainable real-scale implementation.

AB  - Conversion of cassava (Manihot esculenta) roots to processed products such as gari and fufu before consumption is a common practice worldwide by cassava end-user for detoxification, prolonged shelf life or profitability. Fresh root and processed product yield are supposed to be equivalent for each genotype, however, that is not the case. Developing genotypes with high product conversion rate is an important breeding goat in cassava as it drives the adoption rates of new varieties. The objective of this study was to quantify the contribution of genetic and genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) patterns on cassava root conversion rate to gari and fufu. Sixty-seven advanced breeding genotypes from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) were evaluated across eight environments in Nigeria. Root conversion rate means across trials ranges from 14.72 to 22.76% for gari% and 16.96-24.24% for fufu%. Heritability estimates range from 0.17 to 0.74 for trial bases and 0.71 overall environment for gari% and 0.03-0.65 for trial bases and 0.72 overall environment for fufu% which implies that genetic improvement can be made on these traits. Root conversion rate for both gari and fufu% showed a negative but insignificant correlation with fresh root yield and significant positive correlation to Dry Matter content. For all fitted models, environment and interaction had explained more of the phenotypic variation observed among genotypes for both product conversion rates showing the presence of a strong GEL Wrickle ecovalence (Wi) stability analysis and Geometric Adaptability index (GAI) identified G40 (TMS14F1285P0006) as part of top 5 genotypes for gari% but no overlapping genotype was identified by both stability analysis for fufu%. This genotypic performance across environments suggests that it is possible to have genotype with dual-purpose for high gari and fufu conversion rate.

AB  - It is generally appreciated that storing memories of specific events in the mammalian brain, and associating features of the environment with behavioral outcomes requires fine-tuning of the strengths of connections between neurons through synaptic plasticity. It is less understood whether the organization of neuronal circuits comprised of multiple distinct neuronal cell types provides an architectural prior that facilitates learning and memory by generating unique patterns of neuronal activity in response to different stimuli in the environment, even before plasticity and learning occur. Here we simulated a neuronal network responding to sensory stimuli, and systematically determined the effects of specific neuronal cell types and connections on three key metrics of neuronal sensory representations: sparsity, selectivity, and discriminability. We found that when the total amount of input varied considerably across stimuli, standard feedforward and feedback inhibitory circuit motifs failed to discriminate all stimuli without sacrificing sparsity or selectivity. Interestingly, networks that included dedicated excitatory feedback interneurons based on the mossy cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus exhibited improved pattern separation, a result that depended on the indirect recruitment of feedback inhibition. These results elucidate the roles of cellular diversity and neural circuit architecture on generating neuronal representations with properties advantageous for memory storage and recall.

AB  - We investigated the roadkills of vertebrates in Ishinomaki City, northern Japan, for 1 full year (from April 2020 to March 2021), and attention was paid to (1) locations where the roadkill occurred, (2) the relationship between roadkill frequency and traffic volume, and (3) seasonality of roadkills and relationship with life events of target species. Over the study period, we recorded 1059 roadkill cases (2.9 records/day) from at least twenty-six vertebrates, among which three mammals (raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, domestic cat Felis catus, and sika deer Cervus nippon) accounted for more than 75% of the total cases. The locations where frequent roadkills occurred were species-specific as follows: suburban areas for raccoon dogs, within urban areas for cats, and forests, especially peninsula areas, for deer. Roadkill frequency (per kilometer) for raccoon dogs and cats showed a positive correlation with traffic volume, indicating that the prevention of animals from crossing roads would be an effective strategy of mitigating roadkills of these animals. Roadkills of raccoon dogs occurred frequently during fall (September-October), a season that corresponds to their dispersal period. Such seasonality was not found for roadkills of cats (probably due to altered life as pets) and deer (attributed to low seasonal changes in home range utilization). We suggest that management strategies can be adopted to mitigate roadkills from the viewpoint of the behavioral characteristics of target mammals.

AB  - Context. Across Australia, feral cat (Fells catus) control and eradication programs are conducted to conserve threatened and vulnerable species. Controlling feral cats effectively at a landscape scale, particularly in remote woodland habitats, remains a significant challenge. Unfortunately, some standard feral cat control methods, such as shooting and cage trapping, require road access. Poison baiting is one of the few methods available to control feral cat populations in remote and inaccessable areas. Aims. We aimed to examine the impact of a Curiosity (R) (Scientec Research PTY LTD, Melbourne, Australia) baiting program on the feral cat population found in continuous woodland habitat of the Dudley Peninsula, on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Methods. The density of cats was monitored using camera traps set up across both treatment and control sites using a before-after control-impact approach. Feral cat density was calculated using a spatially explicit capture-recapture framework. In addition, 14 feral cats were GPS collared at the treatment site, and their status and location, before and after baiting, was monitored. Key results. At the treatment site after baiting, feral cat density fell from 1.18 +/- 0.51 to 0.58 +/- 0.22 cats km(-2). In total, 14 feral cats were GPS collared, and of those, eight were detected within the treatment zone during and after bait deployment. Six of those eight cats died shortly after baiting, likely from bait consumption. A new individual cat was detected in the treatment zone within 10 days of baiting, and within 20 days, four new individuals were detected. Both before and after baiting, the number of feral cat detections was highest on roads, suggesting cat recolonisation of baited areas may be assisted by roads. Conclusions. Curiosity baiting was found to be an effective method for reducing the density of feral cats in continuous woodland habitats of Kangaroo Island. Roads may act as access routes aiding cat recolonisation. Implications. Curiosity baiting programs on Kangaroo Island (and elsewhere) would benefit from incorporating follow-up control, particularly along roads, to target feral cats re-colonising the area.

AB  - The introduction of predators like red fox and dingoes in the 1930s took a big toll on the quokka population. This paper is mainly concerned with designing conservation policies for quokka population (an endangered species). For this purpose, we designed a reaction-diffusion tri-tropic food chain model consisting quokka and its two predators, red fox and dingoes. We have shown the global existence, non-negativity and uniform boundedness for the designed spatiotemporal model. Existence and stability analysis of the equilibrium points for the model is done. We applied the prevalent idea of basic reproduction number with its origin from epidemiology to the food chain model, to deduce a condition for extinction and persistence of predator population. Natural systems exhibit an amazing diversity of structures in both living and non-living systems. We found that in the presence of diffusion, the model has the potential of exhibiting Turing instability generating beautiful patterns. Numerical results reveal that quokka tends to avoid places resided by dingoes. Our research aims at finding a solution for the current quokka extinction problem by showing the effect of presence of alternative food for dingoes and prohibiting the external factor causing death of quokka population.

AB  - Alhagi pseudalhagi (Bieb.) Desv. is a highly invasive plant species that causes significant ecological and economic damage in many regions. Herbicides combination is a valuable tool in modern weed management, offering benefits such as broader weed control, reduced resistance development, minimised environmental impact and improved cost-effectiveness. Six greenhouse studies investigated the joint action of glyphosate, 2,4-D, paraquat and glufosinate-ammonium on camelthorn control using the additive dose model (ADM) as a reference model. A randomised complete block design with four replications and seven doses of each mixture was used for the experiments. The values of ED50 (effective dose causing 50% response reduction) and ED90 were calculated from the three-parameter log-logistic models for each herbicide applied alone or in mixtures of fixed ratios. Two different statistical software used to test the data revealed similar results. A strong synergistic effect was observed in the mixture of paraquat with 2,4-D on camelthorn with a high lambda-value equal to 1.64, while the mix of glufosinate ammonium with glyphosate or paraquat-induced a moderate synergism with lambda-value of 1.29 and 1.16 respectively. Despite a slight synergistic tendency, 2,4-D binary mixtures with glyphosate or glufosinate-ammonium followed ADM (additive effects). In contrast, reduced translocation in the paraquat + glyphosate combination, means that the herbicides did not move effectively within the plant, resulting in a significant antagonistic effect with the lowest lambda-value equal to 0.02. The mixtures with additive effects are generally suggested to be combined by increasing the rate of one of the herbicide components or an adjuvant to result in sufficient combination absorption and translocation to affect camelthorn control.

KW  - group-housed pigs
AB  - In pig farming, multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are effective tools for identifying individual pigs and monitoring their health, which enhances management efficiency and intelligence. However, due to the considerable variation in breeding environments across different pig farms, existing models often struggle to perform well in unfamiliar settings. To enhance the model's generalization in diverse tracking scenarios, we have innovatively proposed the SDGTrack method. This method improves tracking performance across various farming environments by enhancing the model's adaptability to different domains and integrating an optimized tracking strategy, significantly increasing the generalization of group pig tracking technology across different scenarios. To comprehensively evaluate the potential of the SDGTrack method, we constructed a multi-scenario dataset that includes both public and private data, spanning ten distinct pig farming environments. We only used a portion of the daytime scenes as the training set, while the remaining daytime and nighttime scenes were used as the validation set for evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that SDGTrack achieved a MOTA score of 80.9%, an IDSW of 24, and an IDF1 score of 85.1% across various scenarios. Compared to the original CSTrack method, SDGTrack improved the MOTA and IDF1 scores by 16.7% and 33.3%, respectively, while significantly reducing the number of ID switches by 94.6%. These findings indicate that SDGTrack offers robust tracking capabilities in previously unseen farming environments, providing a strong technical foundation for monitoring pigs in different settings.

AB  - Ectoparasites adversely affect the Animals; lower their economic production level, such as by causing irritation, anemia and increase the cattle and buffaloes morbidity ratio. The present study of ectoparasites prevalence was carried out in District Malakand. A total population of 600 (Male n = 300 and Female n = 300) cattle and buffaloes belong to different age and sex groups were randomly captured for ectoparasites prevalence during June to August 2019. Among them, 515 (85.8%) were found to be infested by one or more species of ectoparasites. In females, the infestation recorded was higher (92.3%) as compared to the male (79.3%). Seven species of ectoparasites were identified from cattle and buffaloes. In cross young cattle in Dermacenter 45(7.5%), Ixodes 57(9.5%) Boophilus 50(8.3%), Hemophysalis 47(7.8%), Hylomma 40(6.6%) while in adult infestation were notice such as Dermacenter 58(9.6%), Ixodes 68(11.3%), Boophilus 50 (8.3%), Hemophysalis 59(9.8%), Hylomma 61(10.16%). The infestation rate is high in the cross breed of an adult as compared to young cattle. The infestation occurred in young local cattle due to Dermacenter 46(7.6%), Ixodes 34(5.6%), Boophilus 36(6%), Hemophilus 36(6%), Hemophysalis 35(5.8%), Hylomma 29 (4.8%). While in local adult cattle infestation was recorded in the genera of Dermacenter 47 (7.8%), Ixodes 53 (8.8%), Boophilus 46(7.6%), Hemophysalis 48(8%), Hylomma 41(6.8%). The infestation rate was also observed based onthe sex factor in adult cattle and buffaloes. During the study, it was noticed that the total infestation rate in females was high (92.33%) as compared to males (79.33%). While the non-infestation rate was 7.66% in the female which is less as compared to male (20.66%).

AB  - We investigated the impact of leaf color variation on herbivory, testing current hypotheses indicating that leaf color could influence herbivory through bottom-up control (by signaling leaf quality and defenses) or top-down control (by attracting predators). A comprehensive phylogenetic meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of leaf color on defense traits, leaf palatability, herbivore fitness, and herbivory. We show that nongreen leaves were better defended, less nutritive, and experienced less herbivory, leading to a reduction in herbivore fitness. Stronger effects of leaf color on herbivory were found in tropical plants, whereas lowered leaf quality in nongreen leaves was found in temperate plants. Increased leaf defense and reduction in insect fitness traits were observed in both temperate and tropical nongreen leaves. Our results indicate that leaf color plays a significant role in shaping plant defenses, leaf nutritive value, and herbivore fitness, ultimately modulating levels of herbivory. This suggests coordination between leaf color, defenses, and quality, which may be responsible for patterns of variation in herbivory and fitness-related traits in herbivores.

AB  - Context. The establishment of pregnancy in cows requires uterine activity regulation of the main Hippo signalling effector yes-associated protein 1 (YAP). It remains unknown (1) how YAP activity at the corpus luteum (CL) correlates with early pregnancy-related events in ruminants; and (2) if YAP activity in the uterus and CL can be affected by metabolic disorders that may lead to pregnancy failure in ruminants. Aims and methods. To determine the effect of early pregnancy on total and phospho-YAP expression and its transcriptional activity in the CL, we compared nonpregnant vs pregnant ewes. To understand the YAP activity dysregulation with disorders that may result in pregnancy loss, we induced negative energy balance in pregnant ewes. Key results and conclusions. Our main results indicate that early pregnancy alters the expression and activity patterns of YAP in the ovine CL but not in the endometrium. In addition, while our NEB-induced model fails to alter YAP activity at the endometrium level, we found that fasting during the first but not second week of pregnancy affects YAP activity in the CL of pregnant ewes. Implications. The data presented herein provide considerable insight into the activity of a signalling pathway that may be a key player in pregnancy recognition and establishment in ewes.

AB  - It has been reported that host plants are able to mediate the interactions between insect herbivores and entomoviruses, but how plants affect growth, development, detoxifying enzymes and metabolic enzymes of herbivores infected by entomoviruses has only rarely been studied so far. We compared growth, development duration, activity of a detoxifying enzyme (carboxylesterase) and a metabolic enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) of a caterpillar (Spodoptera exigua) infected with an entomovirus (SeMNPV) or left non-infected that were fed one of four plants (Ipomoea aquatica, Brassica oleracea, Glycine max or Zea mays). Developmental duration was shorter but growth (length, mass) and enzyme activities were higher in NPV-infected caterpillars fed I. aquatica or B. oleracea than those fed G. max or Z. mays. This study suggests that host plants influence the growth impacts of entomoviruses on herbivores by affecting the enzymes of herbivores.

AB  - Well adapted to extremely cold winters (hypothermia) and low oxygen (hypoxia), the Tibetan antelope (or chiru), Pantholops hodgsonii Abel, is an iconic species in the Tibetan Plateau. Its extinct relative, Qurliqnoria Bohlin, represents the earliest endemic Tibetan mammal going back to the late Miocene, suggesting a long process of adaptations within Tibetan Plateau for similar to 10 million years. We reexamine holotype materials of Q. hundesiensis (Lydekker) from the British Museum, originally discovered by British explorers in the Himalayas in the early 1800s, and new materials recently discovered in the Pliocene strata of Zanda Basin, southwestern Tibet. We refer additional horncore and dental materials from the Kunlun Pass Basin at 4,700-4,900 m asl, and leverage these new data to place Q. hundesiensis within modern biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental frameworks. Although Qurliqnoria remains the best candidate of a distant sister-group of living Pantholops, the Pliocene representatives offer no sign of transitions to living chiru. We infer that the Qurliqnoria lineage has persisted throughout late Miocene and Pliocene of the Tibetan Plateau in a chronospecies succession, i.e., Q. cheni to Q. hundesiensis. The Pliocene Qurliqnoria probably did not directly give rise to Pantholops, suggesting that a direct ancestor of Pantholops is yet to be found. We discuss the paleoenvironmental and paleoelevational implications of the new Qurliqnoria materials and analysis for Tibetan Plateau faunal evolution.

AB  - The objective of this study was to validate equipment and procedures involved in implementing the novel object recognition (NOR) paradigm with young pigs. Two experiments were run with the intent of determining improvements to the original, high-throughput NOR paradigm design. The focus of these experiments was the impact of confounding factors on the main cognitive outcome, recognition index (RI). Experiment 1 utilized 13 pigs that all performed the NOR task following the original paradigm with the addition of 2 extra testing days. Results from this experiment indicated that one test day is sufficient for producing RI values that differ (p < 0.05) from chance performance, which was set at 0.50 given the use of two objects. Results also indicated that pigs may habituate to the task itself after 1 day of testing as RI values were not different (p > 0.05) from that of chance on test days 2 or 3. Experiment 2 utilized 13 male and 16 female pigs to determine sex differences in paradigm outcomes in addition to introducing home-cage enrichment. Results indicated sex differences in investigative behaviors despite both sexes producing RI values different from that of chance. The impact of home-cage enrichment was less discernable, but evidence suggests a lack of influence. Overall, the modifications to the NOR paradigm described herein reduced variability in the primary outcome, RI, and thereby improved sensitivity of the behavioral assay compared with the original paradigm.

AB  - Anthracnose, a fungal disease, commonly infects tea plants and severely impacts the yield and quality of tea. One method for controlling anthracnose is the application of citronellol, a plant extract that exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Herein, the physiological and biochemical mechanism by which citronellol controls anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum camelliae was investigated. Citronellol exhibited excellent antifungal activity based on direct and indirect mycelial growth inhibition assays, with EC50 values of 76.88 mg/L and 29.79 mu L/L air, respectively. Citronellol also exhibited good control effects on C. camelliae in semi-isolated leaf experiments. Optical and scanning electron microscopy revealed that citronellol caused C. camelliae mycelia to thin, fracture, fold and deform. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the mycelial cell walls collapsed inward and separated, and the organelles became blurred after treatment with citronellol. The sensitivity of C. camelliae to calcofluor white staining was significantly enhanced by citronellol, while PI staining showed minimal fluorescence, and the relative conductivity of mycelia were not significantly different. Under citronellol treatment, the expression levels of beta-1,3-glucanase, chitin synthase, and chitin deacetylase-related genes were significantly decreased, while the expression levels of chitinase genes were increased, leading to lower chitinase activity and increased beta-1,3-glucanase activity. Therefore, citronellol disrupted the cell wall integrity of C. camelliae and inhibited normal mycelial growth.

AB  - C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is a member of natriuretic peptide family, which plays unique roles in cardiovascular system. Once CNP binds to natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B), NPR-B induces the production of cGMP, thereby activating PKG and downstream targets. The expression of NPR-B in adipose tissue led to a hypothesis that CNP could have roles involving in regulation of adipogenesis. However, there are few studies on the relationship between CNP and adipogenesis in goat. In the present study, goat adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated and employed to investigate the effect of CNP on adipogenesis in goat. The results showed that CNP significantly promoted adipogenic differentiation of goat ADSCs and also up-regulated the expression of brown adipose genes including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). Furthermore, treatment with CNP increased the cGMP production and the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), MAPK activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) during adipogenic differentiation. Conversely, PKG inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cGMP or p38 MAPK specific inhibitor SB203580 abolished stimulative effect of CNP on adipogenic differentiation. Collectively, it is proved that CNP promoted adipogenic differentiation of goat ADSCs depending on the cGMP/PKG/p38 MAPK signal pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary Abscess disease is a major disease that affects forest musk deer populations. Accurately identifying the types of pathogenic bacteria responsible for it is crucial for effective clinical treatment and the development of drugs and vaccines. This study is the first to use high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing technology to detect the types and abundance of pathogenic bacteria in abscess disease samples at the genetic level, thereby overcoming limitations of previous methods. Microbial structure and bacterial community correlation analyses of six sequencing samples revealed that the dominant pathogenic bacteria were relatively singular and had an overwhelming abundance in the same individual. The pathogenic bacterial species differed among different individuals, and the dominant pathogenic bacteria exhibited no significant correlation with other bacteria in the pus, thus indicating that the dominant pathogenic bacteria were responsible for the production of abscess disease. The primary dominant pathogenic bacteria were Trueperella pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Bacteroides fragilis. While Trueperella pyogenes has been confirmed as one of the pathogenic bacteria responsible for abscess disease in forest musk deer, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides fragilis could not be isolated or identified by previous research methods due to their obligate anaerobic characteristics. Therefore, this study is the first to report that Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides fragilis are the dominant pathogenic bacteria responsible for abscess disease in forest musk deer.Abstract Currently, researchers use bacterial culture and targeted PCR methods to classify, culture, and identify the pathogens causing abscess diseases. However, this method is limited by factors such as the type of culture medium and culture conditions, making it challenging to screen and proliferate many bacteria effectively. Fortunately, with the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, pathogen identification at the genetic level has become possible. Not only can this approach overcome the limitations of bacterial culture, but it can also accurately identify the types and relative abundance of pathogens. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA to identify the pathogens in purulent fluid samples. Our results not only confirmed the presence of the main pathogen reported by previous researchers, Trueperella pyogenes, but also other obligate anaerobes, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides fragilis as the dominant pathogens causing abscess diseases for the first time. Therefore, our findings suggest that high-throughput sequencing technology has the potential to replace traditional bacterial culture and targeted PCR methods.

AB  - State-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms mostly rely on being allowed to directly interact with their environment to collect millions of observations. This makes it hard to transfer their success to industrial control problems, where simulations are often very costly or do not exist, and exploring in the real environment can potentially lead to catastrophic events. Recently developed, model-free, offline RL algorithms, can learn from a single dataset (containing limited exploration) by mitigating extrapolation error in value functions. However, the robustness of the training process is still comparatively low, a problem known from methods using value functions. To improve robustness and stability of the learning process, we use dynamics models to assess policy performance instead of value functions, resulting in MOOSE (MOdel-based Offline policy Search with Ensembles), an algorithm which ensures low model bias by keeping the policy within the support of the data. We compare MOOSE with state-of-the-art model-free, offline RL algorithms BRAC, BEAR and BCQ on the Industrial Benchmark and MuJoCo continuous control tasks in terms of robust performance, and find that MOOSE outperforms its model-free counterparts in almost all considered cases, often even by far.

AB  - This paper presents hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of cow and pig manure in an acidic environment and compares the results with HTC performed without acid. HTC experiments were carried out at 170 & DEG;C for 10 min. The presence of an acid increased the extent of carbonization and energy densification for both types of manure. The heating value of the hydrochar was increased by an amount ranging from 9-21%, with sulfuric acid having a greater impact than acetic acid. The increased fuel densification may provide for more economic use as a fuel. Both acids increased the leaching of ionic species including PO4, Ca, K, Mg, and Fe. The results demonstrated conversion greater than 90% of total phosphorous to phosphate in hydrothermal conditions. HTC with sulfuric acid resulted in increased nitrogen leaching for both types of manure and resulted in the generation of ammonia. Further analysis of the aqueous products signified the formation of acetic acid, furfural, and 3-aminopyrazine 1-oxide compounds for the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal treatment. Analysis of the residual gas confirmed the presence of a trace amount of H2S, NO2, and SO2 formation. The addition of sulfuric acid increased NO2 significantly. Finally, detailed mass balances are presented for carbon and macronutrients (NPK).

AB  - Despite the global spread of intensive agriculture, many populations retained foraging or mixed subsistence strategies until well into the twentieth century. Understanding why has been a longstanding puzzle. One explanation, called the marginal habitat hypothesis, is that foraging persisted because foragers tended to live in marginal habitats generally not suited to agriculture. However, recent empirical studies have not supported this view. The alternative but untested oasis hypothesis of agricultural intensification claims that intensive agriculture developed in areas with low biodiversity and a reliable water source not reliant on local rainfall. We test both the marginal habitat and oasis hypotheses using a cross-cultural sample drawn from the 'Ethnographic atlas' (Murdock 1967 Ethnology 6, 109-236). Our analyses provide support for both hypotheses. We found that intensive agriculture was unlikely in areas with high rainfall. Further, high biodiversity, including pathogens associated with high rainfall, appears to have limited the development of intensive agriculture. Our analyses of African societies show that tsetse flies, elephants and malaria are negatively associated with intensive agriculture, but only the effect of tsetse flies reached significance. Our results suggest that in certain ecologies intensive agriculture may be difficult or impossible to develop but that generally lower rainfall and biodiversity is favourable for its emergence.This article is part of the theme issue 'Evolutionary ecology of inequality'.

AB  - The holotype of the Tenerife (Canary Islands) giant rat, Canariomys bravoi, an almost complete cranium from the Late Pleistocene site of Cueva de las Palomas, is described for the first time. This species is characterized by its large size, robust skull with a short rostrum, dorsal inflation at the level of the infraorbital foramen, and moderately high-crowned upper molars which develop partial stephanodonty at advanced wear stages. Canariomys tamarani from Gran Canaria Island, the only other species of this genus known so far, is slightly smaller and further differs in its higher crowned molars with cusps arranged in a lamellar pattern. However, their crania are remarkedly similar and present a distinctive anatomy of the zygomatic plate, which is very high on the rostrum, so that its dorsal border is nearly on level with the zygomatic process of the maxilla instead of considerably below it as usually seen in murines. This is also observed in other insular, often large-sized, murines but certainly evolved in parallel as an adaptation to herbivory. Molar morphology is congruent with recent analyses of ancient molecular data of C. bravoi which place it in the tribe Arvicanthini (mostly African murines), more concretely within the Arvicanthis niloticus species complex. Even though genetic data indicate that both species diverged very recently, just 650,000 years ago, cranial and dental anatomy of C. bravoi are very derived. Conversely, C. tamarani presents a molar morphology reminiscent of that of A. niloticus albeit associated with a similarly highly derived cranial anatomy.

AB  - The length-weight relationships (LWR) of eleven demersal elasmobranch species captured in the southern Gulf of Mexico were estimated and assessed to provide previously absent somatometric conversion factors. A total of 8852 specimens representing eight families and eleven species caught as bycatch in the Mexican shrimp trawl fishery were analyzed. The following species were covered: Hypanus americanus (Hildebrand et Schroeder, 1928); Gymnura lessae Yokota et Carvalho, 2017; Narcine bancroftii (Griffith et Smith, 1834); Dipturus olseni (Bigelow et Schroeder, 1951); Rostroraja texana (Chandler, 1921); Pseudobatos lentiginosus (Garman, 1880); Rhinoptera bonasus (Mitchill, 1815); Sphyrna tiburo (Linnaeus, 1758); Squatina dumeril Lesueur, 1818; Mustelus canis (Mitchill, 1815); Mustelus norrisi Springer, 1939. The values of the allometric growth parameter b ranged from 2.5 to 3.2, consistent with the expected range. The somatometric growth exhibited negative allometry in fifteen estimations, isometry in six, and positive allometry in two. The LWR differed by sex in five of the six species examined under this criterion, with females consistently exhibiting greater size and weight than males. This study provides the first published LWR for Narcine bancroftii, Dipturus olseni, Rostroraja texana, and Pseudobatos lentiginosus, along with novel LWR estimates for Hypanus americanus, Gymnura lessae, Rhinoptera bonasus, Squatina dumeril, and Mustelus canis in the Gulf of Mexico. It also presents new maximum lengths forR. texana andP. lentiginosus.

AB  - Biomass is the ideal precursor for fabricating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts due to its large-scale and low-cost production, as well as its renewability. Among various forms of biomass, especially waste pig blood is a sustainable precursor for the synthesis of functional electrocatalysts. However, various proteins or metal substances present in the waste pig blood act as impurities and impede the electrocatalytic performance, preventing its direct use as an electrocatalyst. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of hierarchical 2D porous Fe single-atom catalysts on a thermally exfoliated graphene oxide support using hemoglobin-rich red blood cells obtained from purified waste pig blood discarded during the slaughtering process. Because of the widespread Fe single-atom active sites formed via an effective and short heat treatment method and the outstanding mass-transfer properties of the hierarchical porous structure, pig blood-derived carbon (PBC/900/M) showed an excellent ORR performance in alkaline media. Moreover, PBC/900/M was successfully employed as a cathode material in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and showed a maximum power density of 658 mW/cm(2), suggesting the remarkable potential for application in AEMFCs. This strategy provides a general approach to prepare a highly efficient single-atom-based catalyst with high performance using abundant biomass as a cost-effective electrocatalyst source.

AB  - Chlorantraniliprole, a widely used anthranilic diamide insecticide, has been linked to adverse effects on mammalian health, yet the precise toxicological mechanisms affecting intestine and brain remain unclear. In this study, mice were exposed to chlorantraniliprole at doses of 80, 160, and 320 mg/kg over a 28-day period. Significant damage to the intestinal barrier was observed, evidenced by decreased expression of tight junction protein ZO-1 and increased levels of inflammatory markers. Cognitive impairments, including decreased locomotor activity, impaired reward response, and increased anhedonia, were observed in behavioral tests. Oxidative stress was overactivated in both colonic and hippocampal tissues. Chlorantraniliprole exposure caused gut dysbiosis, characterized by an increase in Lactobacillus and Allobaculum and a reduction in Parabacteroides. In addition, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production decreased following chlorantraniliprole exposure. Metabolomic profiling revealed an increase in lipid-related metabolites and peptides, but a decrease in organic acids and nucleic acids, indicating metabolic dysregulation. Furthermore, iron accumulation and mitochondrial damage were observed in colonic tissue. These findings suggest that chronic chlorantraniliprole exposure disrupts intestinal and neural homeostasis through interconnected pathways involving inflammation, oxidative stress, gut microbiota alterations, and metabolic dysfunction.

AB  - Wildlife behavior can be influenced by the deployment of sensory cues in a landscape, but different cues vary in the strength and duration of their effectiveness. We aimed to identify the most effective and cost-efficient countermeasures (sensory cues) to deter wild boar (Sus scrofa) entry and damage to cornfields in Hunchun, Jilin Province, China. These cornfields have experienced severe damage by wild boars during the critical 30-day period when this crop was ripening. From 2016 to 2021, different countermeasures were applied sequentially seeking to control this damage by using either (1) visual deterrents, i.e., solar blinkers of different colors; (2) auditory deterrents, i.e., playbacks of Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) calls, wild boar calls, or wolf (Canis lupus) calls; (3) tactile deterrents, i.e., electric fencing; (4) olfactory deterrents, i.e., Adult Amur tiger feces; or (5) various combined deterrents. We first evaluated the effectiveness of these broad categories, then performed a detailed analysis of the individual countermeasures to assess their specific deterrence effectiveness and duration. A cost-effective analysis was subsequently performed on the most effective countermeasures to evaluate the best option for practical applications. Across the broad categories of deterrents, the tactile group proved the most effective overall. For individual deterrents, the seven countermeasures showing significantly higher effectiveness than the others tested included the following: (1) 1000 mA red solar blinker (32.25 +/- 4.22 days), (2) 1000 mA yellow solar blinker (29.67 +/- 4.58 days), (3) 1000 mA green solar blinker (29.58 +/- 5.60 days), (4) electric fencing with three wires (29.67 +/- 0.58 days), (5) electric fencing with two wires (28.00 +/- 2.00 days), (6) Adult Amur tiger calls for 15 s and wild boar calls for 15 s plus a combined 30 s plus a blank recording for 5 min (26.50 +/- 2.38 days), and (7) Adult Amur tiger feces and calls (27.34 +/- 2.94 days). Except for the Adult Amur tiger feces and calls, each countermeasure would cover most of the period over which control is necessary (30 days). The 1000 mA red solar blinker of achieved the highest repellency per cost ratio (0.31) at 30.29 IUS$/hm2 but showed reduced effectiveness over time. Although electric fencing with three wires offers longer deterrence, its cost-effectiveness ratio was lower (0.27) due to higher installation and maintenance costs at 319.69 IUS$/hm2. The 1000 mA red solar blinker offers a highly cost-effective short-term deterrent, while the electric fencing with three wires provides durable, long-term protection despite its higher costs. Balancing cost and duration can optimize wild boar deterrence strategies across different management needs.

AB  - Fecal pollution contributes to global degradation of water quality and requires identification of the source(s) for predicting human health risk, tracking disease, and developing management strategies. While fecal indicator bacteria are commonly used to detect fecal pollution, they cannot identify sources. Novel approaches, such as microbial source tracking (MST), can be applied to evaluate the origin of fecal pollution. This study examined fecal pollution in the coral reef lagoons of Norfolk Island, Australia where reef health decline has been related to nutrient input. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the host sensitivity and specificity of two human wastewater-associated marker genes (Bacteroides HF183 (HF183) and cross-assembly phage (crAssphage)) and four animal feces associated marker genes targeting avian, ruminant, dog, and pig (Helicobacter-associated GFD (GFD), Bacteroides BacR (BacR), Bacteroides DogBact (DogBact), and Bacteroides Pig-2-Bac (Pig-2-Bac)) in wastewater and animal fecal samples collected from Norfolk Island. The prevalence and concentrations of these marker genes along with enterococci genetic marker (ENT 23S rRNA) of general fecal pollution and human adenovirus (HAdV), which is considered predominantly a pathogen but also a human-wastewater associated marker gene, were determined in surface, ground, and marine water resources. A secondary objective of this study was to assess the sources and pathways of fecal pollution to a sensitive marine environment under rainfall events. HF183, crAssphage, HAdV, and BacR demonstrated absolute host sensitivity values of 1.00, while GFD and Pig-2-Bac had host sensitivity values of 0.60, and 0.20, respectively. Host specificity values were > 0.94 for all marker genes. Human and animal (avian, ruminant, dog) fecal sources were present in the coral reef lagoons and surface water whereas groundwater was polluted by human wastewater markers. This study provides understanding of fecal pollution in water resources on Norfolk Island, Australia after precipitation events. The results may aid in effective water quality management, mitigating potential adverse effects on both human and environmental health.

AB  - Simple Summary The reasons behind illegal hunting can be widely different. There are also tricky methods that hunters use in the attempt to legalize their illegally-acquired trophies, specifically, introducing them in later seasons, and registering the eviscerated corpses as hinds. During certain periods of the year, hunters are only able to acquire a license for the shooting of female deer exclusively, with the male-hunting season beginning later. The eviscerated and decapitated carcass of the animal delivered to the wild game processing house cold store can be falsely registered as a female based on phenotype. If the hunting association suspects that the animal's sex has been falsely reported, a forensic genetic investigation can be proposed. In other criminal events, there are no carcasses at all. When several biological remains left on the crime scene need to be tested, a fast and cost-effective detection of a given species or species-group might be substantial before subsequent analysis. Therefore, sex and species detection can provide an early-stage credibility to the resolution of illegal activities related to trophy animals, and additionally may disclose potential poaching disputes. Molecular sexing techniques are widely applied in conservation biology, although the range of forensically validated methods is fairly limited. The primary aim of this work was to develop forensically validated assays, using two PCR panels for sex and species assignment for the abundant antlered European game species: red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and fallow deer (Dama dama). Segments of the SRY and Amelogenin X/Y genes for sex determination, additionally species-specific cytochrome b regions for species detection were targeted and separately amplified in two multiplex reactions. These assays can reliably analyze trace amounts of DNA. The results of both can easily be visualized and interpreted practically, either on agarose gel or by capillary electrophoresis. These simple, fast molecular assays are able to affect the early-stage resolution of disputed or unsolved poaching cases, without the need of individualization or sequencing of forensic samples.

AB  - Nomad, semi-nomad and transhumant used to be the most frequent mobility types of pastoral society. Nowadays, these categories become questionable in regard to the evolution of the pattern life of families in southern Morocco. How do we link past and present mobility? What have been the changes? In this article, we question the relevance of the aforementioned categories of mobility, as defined by the actors of scientific research and development, to analyze and classify pastoral mobility management that condition the way of life and the adaptive capacities of Saharan societies, by mobilizing different corpus such as 'recit de vie' and typology. This study was conducted downstream in the Draa Valley (Morocco). If the majority of breeders claim to be nomads as soon as they practice a pattern of living in a tent over the course of a year, the typology of mobility pattern reveals intra- and inter-annual fluctuations of its management embedded in their adaptive strategies to climate variability or economic constraints which makes difficult to classify breeders according to the mobility only. In this context, developing climate change mitigation interventions for pastoral societies need to understand and integrate the permanent changing pattern of mobility management in these pastoral societies.

AB  - Embrithopoda is an extinct clade of herbivorous placental mammals belonging to the afrotherian subclade Paenungulata. Early in their evolutionary history, embrithopods colonized the insular terrane of Balkanatolia, presumably via dispersal across the Tethyan marine barrier that separated Africa from Eurasia during the early Cenozoic. Here we report new embrithopods from the early Eocene locality of & Ccedil;amili Mezra, & Ccedil;i & ccedil;ekda & gbreve;i Basin, central Anatolia, which document the early co-occurrence of two sympatric species of embrithopods, including Crivadiatherium sevketseni sp. nov. and Crivadiatherium sahini sp. nov. The genus Crivadiatherium, otherwise known only from the late Eocene of Romania, is reported for the first time in Anatolia. Hypsamasia seni from the middle Eocene of north-central Anatolia is interpreted as a nomen dubium. Embrithopod specimens previously described as Palaeoamasia sp. nov. from the Eocene-Oligocene transition of the Boyabat Basin in northern Anatolia are identified as a new genus and species, Axainamasia sandersi. The embrithopod fauna of & Ccedil;amili Mezra indicates that this clade experienced at least a modest adaptive radiation after successfully colonizing Balkanatolia. The Balkanatolian record of embrithopod evolution contrasts with the evolutionary history of this clade in its native Africa, where sympatric embrithopod taxa have never been documented.

AB  - Deinotheres (Proboscidea, Deinotheriidae) are a clade of non-elephantiform proboscideans that originated in Africa and dispersed into Eurasia by the early Miocene. In Europe, deinotheres are first recorded in Greece during MN3, although they did not become a common faunal element throughout Europe until MN4. Early Miocene (MN3-MN4) deinothere remains from Europe are generally assigned to a different species (Prodeinotherium cuvieri) than those from the early middle Miocene (Prodeinotherium bavaricum; MN5-MN6). In the Valles-Penedes Basin (NE Iberian Peninsula), Prodeinotherium remains are very scarce and largely remain unpublished. To clarify their taxonomic assignment, we describe the available material and compare it with that from elsewhere in Europe. Based on size and a few diagnostic occlusal details, we tentatively recognize both Prodeinotherium cf. P. cuvieri and Prodeinotherium cf. P. bavaricum in the basin. Although all the studied sites had previously been correlated to MN4, the recognition of P. cf. P. bavaricum at els Casots and les Escletxes is consistent with ongoing litho- and magnetostratigraphic studies suggesting a slightly younger age for these sites. The lack of Prodeinotherium remains in older (MN3) localities from the Valles-Penedes Basin, where Gomphotherium is already recorded, further supports the view that deinotheres dispersed into Western Europe somewhat later than gomphotheres.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether early postnatal stress due to cross-fostering alters the behavioral response to stress in weaned pigs. We hypothesized that piglets who were cross-fostered (FOS) into another existing litter would exhibit heightened behavioral indicators of stress after weaning in response to three behavioral stress tests compared to their non-biological litter mates (NBL), and their non-fostered biological siblings (CON). Three FOS piglets from each CON litter (n = 11 litters) were randomly selected and moved to a foster litter (n = 11 litters) 12-24 h post-farrowing, where they were nursed along NBL piglets until weaning (approximately 18 d of age). At 7-and 14-d post-weaning, all piglets underwent a novel object test (NOT) in their home pens. At 21-and 28-d post-weaning, one male and one female piglet from each treatment (CON, FOS, NBL) underwent one of two behavioral tests: social isolation and dyadic contest in an isolated 1.22 x 1.22 m novel pen. All data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS. Non-biological littermate pigs exhibited a lower latency to interact with a novel object during NOT round 1 compared to CON pigs (P = 0.02), whereas FOS pigs were intermediate to but not different from either treatment (P > 0.05). A treatment by sex interaction was detected during NOT round 2 (P = 0.004), where FOS males exhibited a lower latency to interact with a novel object compared to CON pigs and FOS female pigs. Additionally, NBL females exhibited a lower latency to interaction with a novel object during NOT round 2 compared to CON, FOS female, and NBL male pigs. No treatment differences were detected during the social isolation test (P > 0.05). Treatment by sex interactions were detected during the dyadic contest for number of aggressive interactions (P < 0.01) and number of aggressive interactions initiated by an opponent (P < 0.01). Specifically, CON females and FOS males received a greater number of aggressive interactions and a greater number of aggressive interactions initiated by an opponent compared to CON males, FOS females, and NBL pigs. Taken together, these results indicate that the early postnatal stress associated with cross-fostering affects FOS piglets in a sex-specific manner. Further, NBL pigs may be the most capable of handling novel stressors post-weaning, as they exhibited fewer behavioral in-dicators of stress during the NOT and dyadic contests.

AB  - South America's Cenozoic isolation led to the evolution several types of ungulate-like mammals. One of these, Litopterna, included two main families: Proterotheriidae, with relatively small (similar to 15-70 kg), functionally monodactyl species, and Macraucheniidae, with larger (> 100 kg), tridactyl species. Litopterns resemble perissodactyls and artiodactyls in some respects but have shorter distal limbs than expected based on the metatarsal/femur ratio. We explore potential explanations for this pattern by comparing the functional morphology and proportions of litoptern hindlimbs to those of 153 extinct and 82 extant mammals of nine orders. We find that the litoptern tarsus resembles that of rodents and artiodactyls, having a secondary fulcrum in the transverse tarsal joint, and that the distal tibia resembles cursorial rodents (e.g., Dolichotis) in having a small medial malleolus. Proterotheriids likely used a half-bound or rotary gait, rather than the horse transverse gallop, and had relatively long proximal phalanges, which represents a strategy for monodactyl cursoriality distinct from horses (equids). In contrast, macraucheniids increased in size, evolved weight-bearing adaptations, and lost tarsal traits associated with mobility. Fossil trackway studies have suggested that macraucheniids used a walking pace. Our data indicate that macraucheniids had relatively long legs, providing a link between this unusual gait and the expected morphology. Litoptern tarsal specializations are present in remains from the Paleogene of Itaborai, Brazil, which suggests that adaptations in small, bounding, early litopterns may have been preadaptive for cursoriality evolving in proterotheriids and macraucheniids.

AB  - Mice cause substantial economic, social, and environmental damage to rural production systems and communities in Australia, especially during mouse plagues. The losses and damage caused by mice to hay/fodder storage are not well understood, given the size of the industry, so a pilot study (survey of 14 growers) was designed to better understand the physical and economic damage, consider disease implications, and identify the management strategies available. During a mouse plague, mice were regarded as the only factor (other than weather) that affected the long-term sustainability of fodder storage. Growers were feeding fodder to livestock (sheep/cattle) at twice the rate they normally would because of mouse damage and contamination. Mice damaged strings and the structure of bales, making transport impractical, leading to destruction of some stacks. Losses caused by mice were estimated at AUD 140,000 (range = AUD 7000-461,580; equivalent to 30-40% loss of value) and included estimates of physical damage to hay/fodder bales, rodenticides, and labour costs. Growers were concerned about contamination and disease transfer to livestock (and workers) from mice through urine/faeces and their carcasses, especially during mouse plagues. There are significant gaps in our knowledge on the impacts of mice to fodder storage in Australia. Research is needed to (1) identify effective mouse control options, (2) determine the economic impact of mice, and (3) undertake a disease study of mice, to help inform appropriate management strategies for effective control.

AB  - In this letter, we revisit a study we published in 2017, following comment in a paper by Marchesini et al. published in this volume. We provide some further analyses that help us to reinforce the original conclusions of our earlier paper, and to address the points raised by Marchesini et al. We conclude that the concerns raised in their review do not alter the inference we presented earlier, and we identify issues with analyses presented by Marchesini et al. that limit their utility. The key points of inference remain that this species in Europe shows remarkably low levels of diversity within populations and strong structure among populations which can be explained by a combination of natural and anthropogenic processes.

AB  - The left and right hippocampal formation (HF) of the avian brain have been reported to control some different aspects of homing in pigeons. In the current study, we employed GPS-tracking technology and unilateral HF lesions to further explore what if any aspects of a pigeon's homing flight might be under dominant control by either the left or right HF. Pigeons were released from three locations prior to any experimental manipulation and released repeatedly from the same three sites as sham-lesioned control, right HF-lesioned and left HF-lesioned treatment groups. Analyses of homing performance and virtual vanishing bearings revealed no effect of either lesion treatment. A more in-depth analysis of path efficiency during the initial decision-making, en route and near home phases of a homing flight also revealed no effect of either lesion treatment. A last analysis on the learning and memory for positions along a previously flown route, a proxy for investigating the development of route fidelity, also revealed no effect of either unilateral lesion. However, independent of treatment group, some statistically significant effects were observed with respect to changes in performance across training and the different release sites. The current study revealed no detectable difference between the left and right HF-lesioned pigeons with respect to several navigational parameters of a homing flight. Although in need of supporting experimentation, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that both the left and right HF are similarly able to support several aspects of homing pigeon navigation.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are secondary metabolites through which plants interact with the environment. Upon interaction with a stressor, a blend of plant VOC changes for an increasing amount of constitutive phytochemicals and/or for phytochemicals synthesized de novo . These latter compounds are referred as inducedVOCs. We previously showed that, on Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants, VOCs blend induced via jasmonic acidrelated pathway by pre-inoculation with the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea significantly reduced both plant choice and feeding damage related to the piercing sucking insect Eurydema oleracea infestation. Continuing to study the same tripartite combination, we here demonstrated that VOCs released by Arabidopsis immediately after E. oleracea infestation directly inhibited the in vitro growth of B. cinerea and indirectly reduced leaf damage caused by the pathogen, triggering the jasmonic acid-mediated pathway. Insect priming of defence against B. cinerea was short-term. Together with our previous findings, this study contributes to the knowledge on the tripartite plant-microbe-insect interaction and on the role of VOCs in the communication between plants and the other organisms of a natural community.

AB  - The rapidly changing climatic conditions are adversely impacting the Indian agricultural sector. Farmers are frequently seen adopting several adaptation measures, which are neither equally efficient nor mutually exclusive. Based on the primary data collected from 300 farming households of the Indian Eastern Himalayan foothills, the present study attempts to examine the efficiency of local farmers' adaptation by developing indices combining the feasibility, effectiveness, and sustainability of the adaptation measures with the scale of actual adoption. Further, by employing multiple linear regression, the study analyzes the internal (psychological) and external (physical and socio-economic) factors influencing higher scores of these indices. Results show that local farmers are well aware of climate change and are responding through implementing at least one and up to seven adaptation measures. Farmers preferred agroforestry, a shift from cereals to low water-intensive commercials, irrigation, and intensification of winter crops as the most efficient. There was, however, a misalignment between the perceived efficiency of adaptation measures and their scale of adoption. Farmers' perceptions of pest infestation, satisfaction with farming, soil characteristics, farm size, remittances, and access to credit were found to be positively and significantly influencing the adaptation indices, while open-mindedness toward changing farming practices and crop-raiding by elephants were found to be negatively and significantly associated with adaptation indices. Lastly, the study made relevant recommendations for improving farmers' efficiency in adopting appropriate adaptation measures and strengthening the "State Action Plan on Climate Change".

AB  - The global increase in temperature has directly impacted the environment and reproduction of ectothermic organisms, leading to defects in processes that intervene in sperm quality and maturation. The present study evaluates the effect of temperature on sperm quality of the lizard Lepidophyma gaigeae in the surroundings of Landa de Matamoros, Quer & eacute;taro, M & eacute;xico. As a species under special protection, only 12 male individuals were captured in December 2020 with 4 exposed at (1) preferred temperature (Tpref) at 24 degrees C; (2) low temperature (LT) at 21 degrees C; (3) either individuals without treatment (Control) with fluctuating temperature of the habituation site, to compare the effect on the viability, concentration, and integrity of DNA, as well as the presence of the cytoplasmic droplet (CD). Sperm viability decreased by approximately 50% in organisms exposed to Tpref, accompanied by a significant reduction in concentration. Likewise, the CD evaluation showed a retention percentage of 30% at the cauda level, while the LT and Control groups showed 5% in this terminal area of the epididymis. The percentage of sperm with intact DNA was also decreased in the Tpref group compared to the LT and control groups. These findings highlight how thermal environments impact reptilian reproduction, reinforcing not only what has already been found in these species in recent years, but also the repercussions that it presents in the medium- or long-term exposure in these organisms at an ecological level, as well as the consequences with the potential damage and even infertility, in case of prolonged exposition to preferred temperatures.

AB  - Plants produce defensive toxins to deter herbivores. In response, some specialized herbivores evolved resistance and even the capacity to sequester toxins, affecting interactions at higher trophic levels. Here, we test the hypothesis that potential natural enemies of specialized herbivores are differentially affected by plant toxins depending on their level of adaptation to the plant-herbivore system. We focus on toxic cardiac glycosides (CGs) from milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), which inhibit animal Na+/K+-ATPases, and two CG-resistant insects, the large milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus and a CRISPR-edited Drosophila melanogaster. Both have CG-resistant Na+/K+-ATPases through a set of key amino acid substitutions, which facilitate CG sequestration. We conducted infection experiments with entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema carpocapsae, S. feltiae, and S. hermaphroditum) as natural enemies on host insects containing mixtures of milkweed-derived CGs or purified CGs (ouabain, digoxin, and digitoxin) that vary in toxicity. The nematode S. carpocapsae is known to occur in soil near milkweed plants and naturally has several of the same Na+/K+-ATPase substitutions as the milkweed bug O. fasciatus and our Drosophila mutant. This nematode not only exhibited higher fecundity in hosts that carried CGs relative to the other nematode species (which have sensitive Na+/K+-ATPases), but also showed attraction to mixtures of CGs in milkweed root extracts and to purified ouabain when tested on agar plates. A coiling phenotype, which is a symptom of neurotoxicity, was observed more frequently in S. feltiae and S. hermaphroditum upon exposure to milkweed root extracts than in S. carpocapsae. Nematode behavior was further tested in sand, and while attraction to CGs was found for S. carpocapsae, nematodes of the other species tended to migrate away from milkweed root chemicals. Thus, S. carpocapsae can tolerate CGs and may use these as chemical cues to locate insect hosts that live on or around milkweed plants.

AB  - In plants, biomass and nutrient allocation often generate trade-offs between the different biochemical pathways conflicting the utilization of the common source among growth, reproduction and chemical defence. However, in dioecious plant species, these trade-off patterns could appear as a more contrasted problem between males and females due to the dissimilar reproduction investment. Generally, the growth ratio is higher in males than females, while females have a stronger defence than males. To understand the possible role of the sex-specific dissimilarities within the growth-defence conflict framework, we investigated the possible causes of the high variance of the essential oil yield in a dioecious evergreen species, Juniperus communis. Specifically, we tested the correlations between the essential oil yield with other individual-specific traits (e.g. sex, age), the presence of the growth-defence trade-off, and the differential growth and survival patterns between males and females through an extensive field survey with sample collection in three natural populations (Kiskunsag National Park, Hungary). The individual-specific essential oil yield was also measured and served as a proxy to describe the degree of chemical defence. We found that the essential oil yield showed strong and consistent sexspecific patterns decreasing with age in adults. Contrary to the predictions, the males showed a consistently higher yield than the females. We also observed a growth-defence trade-off in males but not in females. Consistently with the growthdefence conflict hypothesis, the populations' sex ratio was male-biased, and this pattern was more evident with ageing modifying the demographic structure due to the sexually dissimilar lifespan. Our juniper study revealed a contrasting and unique essential oil accumulation driven by the complex allocation trade-off mechanisms within individuals, which could be a flexible and adaptive defence response against the increasing biotic and abiotic environmental stresses exacerbated under global climate change.

AB  - The paper presents the literature data on the distribution and species composition of helminths of sheep in different regions of the Russian Federation. On the territory of the Altai Republic, 3 species of trematodes, 7 species of cestodes, and 29 species of nematodes have been registered in sheep. The parasite complex of sheep of the Northern and Central Altai includes 10 genera and 5 genera are found in the sheep of the South-Eastern Altai. In the conditions of the Chechen Republic, intestinal strongylatoses of sheep are widespread everywhere (the incidence is 59.2%). It has been observed that in all the studied sheep farms of the lowland, foothill, and mountain zones of the republic, regardless of the sheep farming system, helminths of the following species are the most common Haemonchus contortus, Nematodirus abnormalis, Nematodirus filicollis, Chabertia ovina, Bunostomum trigonocephalum, Ostertagia ostertagi, Oesophagostomum venulosum, Trichostrongylus axei. It was found that in private farms the prevalence of invasion reached 65.7-91.1% and the intensity of invasion equaled 119.7 +/- 5.2-713.5 +/- 9.7 dicrocelium eggs in 1 g of feces. The maximum level of prevalence and intensity was observed in sheep of 2-3 years of age and in some farms reached 86.3-91.1% and 547.9 +/- 8.1-713.5 +/- 9.7 helminth eggs in 1 g of feces, respectively.

AB  - Investigating the effect of non-native herbivore species in the new areas is vital for understanding their effects on native crops and the interactions that the newly arrived species have with any natural native herbivores and predatory species. The pistachio-seed wasp Eurytoma plotnikovi Nikol'skaya (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) is an invasive species on pistachio groves in Sicily, southern Italy; thus, the current study investigated its effects on pistachio crops and the native pistachio-seed wasp Megastigmus pistaciae Walker (Hymenoptera: Megastigmidae). The results showed that fruits in Pistacia vera pistachio groves were infested only with E. plotnikovi, which had been able to replace M. pistaciae after only a decade. Female E. plotnikovi emerge between May and June, but the males are rarely seen. No natural enemies were detected for E. plotnikovi in the study sites, highlighting an important phytosanitary issue for pistachio nut production in Sicily.

AB  - Simple Summary There was every indication that animal welfare will continue to be a major issue affecting livestock farming in the future. The main welfare issues affecting sheep were feeding strategies, health, and diseases. The health problems of sheep are avoidable with good grazing, breeding, and stockmanship. However, sheep must be given adequate supervision to ensure that any welfare issues are quickly noticed and addressed. Assessing animal welfare can be used as management tools by farmers to identify welfare issues and recognize poor welfare. This study aimed to assess the welfare of Tunisian sheep in extensive sheep production systems using animal-based measures of ewe welfare. This study encompasses the first national survey of sheep welfare in which animal-based outcomes were tested. Animal-based welfare measures were derived from previous welfare protocols. Fifty-two Tunisian farms were studied and a number from 20 to 100 animals by flock were examinated. The whole flock was also observed to detect clinical diseases, lameness, and coughing. The human-animal relationship was selected as welfare indicators. It was evaluated through the avoidance distance test. The average avoidance distance was 10.47 +/- 1.23 and 8.12 +/- 0.97 m for a novel person and farmer, respectively. The global mean of body condition score (BCS) was 2.4 with 47% of ewes having a BCS of two, which may be associated with an increased risk of nutritional stress, disease, and low productivity. Ten farms had more than 7% of lambs with a low body condition score, which may be an indication of a welfare problem. The results obtained in the present study suggest that the used animal-based measures were the most reliable indicators that can be included in welfare protocols for extensive sheep production systems.

AB  - Populations and species are threatened by human pressure, but their fate is variable. Some depleted populations, such as that of the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), recover rapidly even when the surviving population was small. The northern elephant seal was hunted extensively and taken by collectors between the early 1800s and 1892, suffering an extreme population bottleneck as a consequence. Recovery was rapid and now there are over 200,000 individuals. We sequenced 260 modern and 8 historical northern elephant seal nuclear genomes to assess the impact of the population bottleneck on individual northern elephant seals and to better understand their recovery. Here we show that inbreeding, an increase in the frequency of alleles compromised by lost function, and allele frequency distortion, reduced the fitness of breeding males and females, as well as the performance of adult females on foraging migrations. We provide a detailed investigation of the impact of a severe bottleneck on fitness at the genomic level and report on the role of specific gene systems.
   Genome analysis of modern and historical elephant seals reveals impacts of a severe bottleneck on the genomes and fitness of individual seals, and the implications for recovery.

AB  - Play behavior is a significant trait of immature nonhuman primates (hereafter primates) that plays an important role in sensory, locomotor, socio-cognitive, and developmental processes. It has been suggested that the function of play is to practice and improve motor skills related to foraging, avoiding predators, attracting mates, raising offspring, and strengthening the skills needed for the formation and maintenance of social bonds. From September 2009 to August 2010, we investigated the play behavior of 1-12 month-old infant white-headed langurs (Trachypithecus leucocephalus) a Critically Endangered primate species endemic to China. We carried out this study in the Guangxi Chongzuo White-headed Langur National Nature Reserve, and recorded 4421 play bouts and 1302 min of play engaged in by seven infants. We found that infants of different ages exhibited different patterns of play behavior. Specifically, nonsocial play behaviors appeared at one month of age, social play behaviors at two months, and an expanded repertoire of social and non-social play behaviors at three months of age. The frequency and duration of nonsocial play peaked at five months of age and then decreased, while social play gradually increased with age. Nonsocial play did not differ between the sexes, whereas social play showed sex specificity, with a higher frequency and longer duration of social play in male infants compared to female infants. In addition, male and female white-headed langur infants appeared to prefer individuals of same sex as social playmates, but no obvious choice preference for a specific individual. In conclusion, we provide the first report of play behavior in a population of wild Critically Endangered white-headed langurs. We suggest that age- and sex-specific differences in play behavior of infants form the bases for age and sex-based differences in the social interactions of adult langurs.

AB  - Seed dispersal through endozoochory is a critical ecosystem function worldwide. Seed gut retention time (GRT; the duration that seeds are retained in the digestive tract) is an important part of the qualitative component of the seed dispersal effectiveness framework. GRT is a major determinant of when and how far away seeds are dispersed, aiding seeds in escaping predation in space as well as in time. In this study, we examined whether the size of the disperser and/or the size of the ingested seeds affect the GRT in Aldabra Giant Tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. We selected tortoises of varying body mass (mean +/- 1 SD = 48.6 +/- 27.2 kg, range = 0.6-104.0 kg) and fed them different-sized artificial seeds (plastic beads; 2, 4.5, and 10 mm diameter). Tortoises defecated the first beads a mean of 12.0 +/- 2.7 d after ingestion, and the last beads 20.4 +/- 6.0 d after ingestion. Mean GRT was 14.6 +/- 3.7 d. We show that neither tortoise body size nor bead size had an effect on the patterns and time of defecation. We discuss the relevance of our result for seed dispersal and for rewilding projects that use Aldabra Giant Tortoises as substitute species for extinct giant tortoises on other oceanic islands.

AB  - The evolution of soil chemical properties over 20 years was monitored to assess the effects of the change in soil management from a rainfed to an irrigated model and the use of organic amendments and crop rotation. Intensive agriculture has been the activity that has caused most degradation and contamination of this soil. Long-term monitoring of the soil profile made it possible to assess its response to the application of sustainable agricultural techniques intended to offset these effects. Three profiles of the same soil were studied-P1 (1998), P2 (2003), P3 (2017)-to show the evolution in time and space. An incipient degradation process was detected in the first five years, verified by increases in salinity (2.3 dS m(-1)), exchangeable Na (0.5 g kg(-1)), and TN (1.3 g kg(-1)) in P2 in comparison with P1 (1.0, 0.2, and 1.1, respectively). There was also leaching towards the deep horizons for TN (0.4, 0.9, and 0.7 g kg(-1) for P1, P2, and P3, respectively), and for assimilable elements such as P (1.1, 6.4, and 3.8), Fe (2.0, 2.1, and 5.6), Mn (0.3, 6.5, and 1.9), Zn (0.3, 0.5, and 0.9), and Cu (0.5, 0.6, and 1.3) (all mg kg(-1), for P1, P2, and P3, respectively). Between 2004 and 2017, organic amendments (sheep manure) were reduced by 50%, crop rotation was intensified, and green fertilization and forage maize cultivation were included. As a result, P3 showed an improvement in comparison with P2, with decreases in EC (1.4 dS m(-1)), exchangeable Na (0.2 g kg(-1)), and TN (0.8 g kg(-1)). The change in soil management enhanced some soil functions (carbon sink and chemical fertility) and attenuated soil degradation.

AB  - Multiple odour nuisance in livestock farming is a notorious problem that has a significant impact on the living environment of surrounding communities. Adsorbents based on metal-organic framework (MOF) materials show great promise for controlling odour pollution, as they offer a high specific surface area, a controllable structure and an abundance of active sites. However, the MOF formation process is prone to problems such as pore clogging or collapse and reduced porosity, which limits its further application. In this study, a series of odour adsorbents were prepared by in situ growth of NH2-UiO-66 on tea stem biochar (TSBC) using a hydrothermal method and named UiO (Zr)-TSBCx. The physical and chemical properties and composition of UiO (Zr)-TSBCx have been systematically characterized using SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR, N2 adsorption-desorption and XPS. The release of odours from the pig farm effluent was monitored using in-situ continuous Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS), and the obtained primary compositions were tested for further adsorption. In dynamic adsorption experiments focused on butyric acid, UiO (Zr)-TSBC2 showed a high adsorption capacity of 3.99 x 105 mu g/g and exceptional structural stability. UiO (Zr)-TSBC2 showed variable adsorption efficiencies for different odorous gases, with the best performance for the removal of ammonia, toluene and butyric acid. It also demonstrated the ability to rapidly mitigate instantaneous high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methanethiol and toluene resulting from agitation. Additionally, based on the relationship between the adsorption amount and the structural characteristics of the adsorbent as well as the nature of the odours, a possible adsorption mechanism of UiO (Zr)-TSBC2 for a variety of odours released from pig farm effluent was proposed. This work demonstrates a novel approach to promote deodorization applications in livestock and poultry farming environments by the in-situ growth of NH2-UiO-66 on biochar prepared from tea stem.

AB  - This study investigated the performance of anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of pig manure and food waste on the reduction of antibiotic resistomes under wet and dry AcoD conditions. High-throughput quantita-tive PCR technology was utilized for a comprehensive assessment of the performances of the two pro-cesses. The results show that dry AcoD with a total solids (TS) content of 20% effectively reduced total antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) by 1.24 log copies/g wet sample, while only 0.54 log copies/g wet sam-ple was reduced in wet AcoD with a TS content of 5%. Dry AcoD was more efficient in reduction of amino-glycosides, multidrug and sulfonamide resistance genes compared with the reduction of other classes of ARGs. Dry AcoD caused a significant reduction of ARGs with resistance mechanisms of efflux pump and antibiotic deactivation. In contrast, there was no obvious difference in reductions of ARGs with different resistance mechanisms in wet AcoD. Network analysis showed that ARGs were significantly correlated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (Spearman's r > 0.8, P < 0.05), as well as microbial communities. Enrichment of ARGs and MGEs was found at the early period of AcoD processes, indicating some ARGs and MGEs increased during the hydrolysis and acidogenesis stages. But after a long retention time, their abundances were effectively reduced by dry AcoD in the subsequent stages. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The article discusses some features of the helminthofauna of domestic and wild artiodactyls in Uzbekistan, represented by the families Suidae, Cervidae, and Bovidae. The total of 14 species turned out to be hosts to helminths. The prevalence ranged 75.5% to 100.0%. Our research team identified 103 helminth species, belonging to the classes Cestoda (13 species), Trematoda (10), Acanthocephala (1), and Nematoda (79). The highest parasite species diversity was recorded in the domestic animals: 48 species in sheep, 34 in goats, and 40 in cattle. The number of helminth species in wild artiodactyls varied from 13 to 28. Most of the recorded helminths parasitised different parts of the artiodactyls' bodies, causing serious diseases. They were found in almost all organs. The most widespread helminths in the animals studied included the representatives of the class Cestoda-Moniezia expansa, M. benedeni, Avitellina centripunctata, and Echinococcus granulosus. From the class Trematoda, these included Fasciola hepatica, F. gigantica, Gastrothylax crumenifer, Calicophoron erschowi, Dicrocoelium dendriticum, and Schistosoma turkestanicum. The class Nematoda in this regard was represented by Trichocephalus ovis, Chabertia ovina, Dictyocaulus filaria, Metastrongylus elongatus, Ostertagia occidentalis, Marshallagia marshalli, Nematodirus helvetianus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, Gongylonema pulchrum, Parabronema skrjabini, and Setaria labiatopapillosa. Of the total number of helminths species of artiodactyls, a number of species are of interest from the point of view of medical parasitology. According to their life cycle, the helminths can be divided into two groups: homoxenous and heteroxenous. The first one, homoxenous, consists of parasites that do not change hosts throughout their life. According to our materials, this group included nematodes from the genera Trichocephalus, Strongyloides, Bunostomum, Chabertia, Oesophagostomum, Trichostrongylus, Haemonchus, Marshallagia, Nematodirus, Ostertagia, Dictyocaulus, Skrjabinema, Ascaris, and Neoascaris. The second, he heteroxenous, group was formed by all representatives of the classes Cestoda, Trematoda, and Acanthocephala, and also some Nematoda species. We identified oligochaetes, molluscs, and insects as intermediate hosts. The artiodactyls of Uzbekistan were also determined as intermediate hosts to parasites from the family Taeniidae, class Cestoda. The hosts and their parasites exerted close topical (in relation to biosystems) and trophic relationships, which ensures contacts with components of the parasitic system and contributes to the formation of the helminthofauna and the circulation of parasites in the wild of Uzbekistan.

AB  - Comparative studies indicate that several mammalian clades obey Gloger's rule in that they exhibit darker coloration in hwnid warm climates, although the mechanisms responsible for this association still are poorly understood. We surveyed external appearances of a single species, the feral pig (Sus scrofa), shot at 48 hunting lodges across North America and matched these to potential abiotic drivers, namely: relative humidity, temperature, precipitation, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and to biotic factors of habitat shade and predation pressure. We found that darker animals occupy locations of greater precipitation and warmer temperatures, as expected from Gloger's rule. The recent range expansion of S. scrofa implies selection for pelage coloration has occurred very rapidly. Separating pelage coloration into ewnelanin- and phaeomelanin-based pigmentation, we found more pronounced eumelanin-based pelage in areas of higher rainfall and temperatures and UV radiation, whereas pelage phaeomelanin is related to cool dry climates with lower LW radiation. This implies that humidity or UV protection but not crypsis are the mechanisms underlying Gloger's rule in this species and the factors driving eumelanin and phaeomelanin expression in mammalian pelage are different, reinforcing new interpretations of this venerable rule.

AB  - Oct4 is exclusively expressed in rodent inner cell mass (ICM) but silenced in its trophectoderm (TE). However, for many non-rodent animals, including pig, cattle, rabbit, goat, and human, OCT4 has a remarkable expres-sion in early TE. This study, applying pig as the main research model, proves that OCT4 expression in TE is supported by a unique GATA motif in the OCT4 upstream conserved regulatory region, and GATA4 is respon-sible for its activation. Moreover, OCT4 acts as a specific regulator of a narrow range of genes (including BCL2A1 and HNRNP2AB1) that are essential for the first wave of rapid proliferation in early TE. This study describes the regulatory mechanism to direct the OCT4 expression and its significance in TE of porcine pre -implantation embryo.

TI  - Clathrin Heavy Chain 1 Plays Essential Roles During Oocyte Meiotic Spindle Formation and Early Embryonic Development in Sheep

AB  - As a major protein of the polyhedral coat of coated pits and vesicles, clathrin molecules have been shown to play a stabilization role for kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle by acting as inter-microtubule bridges. Clathrin heavy chain 1 (CLTC), the basic subunit of the clathrin coat, plays vital roles in both spindle assembly and chromosome congression during somatic-cell mitosis. However, its function in oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryo development in mammals, especially in domesticated animals, has not been fully investigated. In this study, the expression profiles and functional roles of CLTC in sheep oocytes were investigated. Our results showed that the expression of CLTC was maintained at a high level from the germinal vesicle (GV) stage to metaphase II stage and that CLTC was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm of cells at interphase, from the GV stage to the blastocyst stage. After GV breakdown (GVBD), CLTC co-localized with beta-tubulin during metaphase. Oocyte treatments with taxol, nocodazole, or cold did not affect CLTC expression levels but led to disorders of its distribution. Functional impairment of CLTC by specific morpholino injections in GV-stage oocytes led to disruptions in spindle assembly and chromosomal alignment, accompanied by impaired first polar body (PB1) emissions. In addition, knockdown of CLTC before parthenogenetic activation disrupted spindle formation and impaired early embryo development. Taken together, the results demonstrate that CLTC plays a vital role in sheep oocyte maturation via the regulation of spindle dynamics and an essential role during early embryo development.

AB  - Pyrolysis is an effective method for treating of livestock and poultry manure developed in recent years. It can completely decompose pathogens and antibiotics, stabilize heavy metals, and enrich phosphorus (P) in biochar. To elucidate the P migration mechanism under different pig manure pyrolysis temperatures, sequential fractionation, solution P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Kedge X-ray absorption near-edge structure techniques were used to analyze the P species in pig manure biochar (PMB). The results indicated that most of the organic P in the pig manure was converted to inorganic P during pyrolysis. Moreover, the transformation to different P groups pathways was clarified. The phase transition from amorphous to crystalline calcium phosphate was promoted when the temperature was above 600 C-degrees. The content of P extracted by hydrochloric acid, which was the long-term available P for plant uptake, increased significantly. PMB pyrolyzed at 600 C-degrees can be used as a highly effective substitute for P source. It provides the necessary P species (e.g. water-soluble P.) and metal elements for the growth of water spinach plants, and which are slowrelease comparing with the Hogland nutrient solution.

AB  - Cylapinae Kirkaldy, 1903 is a highly diverse lineage of the plant bug family Miridae Hahn, 1831, confined mainly to the tropics. Despite an increasing amount of recent studies on that group, many species remain undescribed and biological data are lacking for most of the taxa. To date, a molecular-based phylogeny has been published only for Rhinomirini Gorczyca, 2000, one out of five Cylapinae tribes. The tribe was rendered as non-monophyletic and the Rhinocylapus Poppius, 1909 complex was transferred to the Fulviini Uhler, 1886. However, phylogenetic relationships within the complex have remained unresolved. In the present study, morphological and molecular data are employed to generate a significantly improved phylogeny of the group compared with previous work. Topologies were constructed using methods of parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference, and were based on an expanded morphological matrix with 65 encoded characters for 38 species and molecular data for 23 species on four markers (COI, 165 rRNA, 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA). As a result, a more resolved phylogeny of the Rhinocylapus complex is presented. A generic synopsis for the representatives of the complex and key to the genera are provided. Taxonomically and phylogenetically important morphological characters for the Rhinocylapus complex and its subgroupings are discussed. Dorsal habitus images, scanning micrographs of selected morphological structures, and illustrations of male and female genitalia are provided for Proamblia Bergroth, 1910, Punctifulvius Schmitz, 1978, Rhinocylapidius Poppius, 1915, Rhinocylapus Poppius, 1909, Rhinomiridius Poppius, 1909, and Yamatofulvius Yasunaga, 2000.

AB  - Tumor-suppressive cell competition is an evolutionarily conserved process that selectively removes precancerous cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Using the polarity-deficiency-induced cell competition model in Drosophila, we identify Toll-6, a Toll-like receptor family member, as a driver of tension-mediated cell competition through a-Spectrin (a-Spec)-Yorkie (Yki) cascade. Toll-6 aggregates along the boundary between wild type and polarity-deficient clones, where Toll-6 physically interacts with the cytoskeleton network protein a-Spec to increase mechanical tension, resulting in actomyosin-dependent Hippo pathway activation and the elimination of scrib mutant cells. Furthermore, we show that Spz5 secreted from fat body, the key innate organ in fly, facilitates the elimination of scrib clones by binding to Toll-6. These findings uncover mechanisms by which fat bodies remotely regulate tumor-suppressive cell competition of polarity-deficient tumors through inter-organ crosstalk and identified the Toll-6-a-Spec axis as an essential guardian that prevents tumorigenesis via tension-mediated cell elimination.

AB  - The influence of Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) is a severe interference in the biological rhythm of organisms. Feeding dysregulation might be the main factor responsible for developing metabolic diseases. The molecular basis of these physiological dysregulations is yet to be elucidated. The effect of light on appetite-regulating signal in the brain of zebrafish is still unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to find the daily mRNA expression profile of two significant appetite and energy-balancing peptide hormone (leptin) and enzyme (goat) in the brain in various illumination conditions, LD (12Light:12Dark), LL (24L), and DD (24D). Moreover, Ga-SI, the protein level of the two appetite-regulating peptides, and brain and serum melatonin are measured after 72 h of incubation under three different photic conditions. The immunohistochemical localization of the primary mediators of appetite regulators, leptin and goat, in the brain of zebrafish, under different photic conditions, is reported for the first time in zebrafish. The study revealed that in continuous light after 72 h of incubation, feeding (Ga-SI) is found the highest and the translational level of two appetite-related genes (leptin and goat) is the lowest compared to LD. In continuous dark, this relation becomes opposite. The daily variation of mRNA expression of leptin and goat in LD shows peak expression at the light and dark phase, respectively. This pattern was abolished in continuous conditions. Thus, our study suggests that the photoperiod (zeitgeber) may influence the expression pattern (daily variation) of appetite-regulating peptide hormone and enzyme in the brain of zebrafish.

AB  - The present study was performed to evaluate the influence of dietary inorganic and organic chromium (Cr) supplementation on blood biochemical constituents and mineral concentrations as well as the changes in the mineral composition of internal organs of Black Bengal goats. Thirty Black Bengal kids of 3 to 5 months (5.40 +/- 0.34 kg body weight) were allocated randomly to five treatment groups. The five groups were control (without added Cr in a basal diet), 1.0, 1.5 mg/kg of inorganic Cr, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/kg of organic Cr added per kilogram of feed dry matter. The duration of the experiment was 150 days during which the changes in the blood biochemical and mineral concentrations at 0, 30, 60, and 150 days were evaluated. At the end of the trial, mineral composition in the muscle, skin, and internal organs (liver, lungs, kidney, heart, spleen, and testis) were analyzed. Any blood variables were not affected at or before 60 days of Cr supplementation. Both inorganic and organic Cr supplementation lowered (P < 0.05) concentrations of blood glucose, cortisol, non-esterified fatty acids, and ss-hydroxybutyric acid after 60 days of Cr supplementation. Organic Cr-supplemented groups exhibited higher (P < 0.05) blood insulin concentration and neutrophil activity compared to the control. Supplementation of Cr in either form had no substantial effect (P > 0.05) on the blood hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, total protein, albumin, globulin, immunoglobulin G, total antioxidant capacity, and liver enzymes (aminotransferases) concentration, and also blood minerals (zinc, iron, and manganese) concentration. Blood Cr and copper concentrations were increased (P < 0.05) due to both organic and inorganic Cr supplementation. Minerals (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, and manganese) concentrations of internal organs of Cr- supplemented groups were mostly not affected (P > 0.05) by Cr supplementation. However, the concentrations of Cr and copper in blood and Cr in all internal organs, skin, and muscle of organic Cr-supplemented groups were higher (P < 0.05) than in those fed the basal diet. In conclusion, dietary inorganic and organic Cr supplementation, especially the organic form, after long term supplementation (> 60 days) could be beneficial in regulating blood glucose and fat metabolism and the immune status of Black Bengal goats.

AB  - Aims An in-depth understanding of the relationship between the theoretical carrying capacity of grasslands and the forage-livestock balance is crucial for maintaining ecological equilibrium in grasslands and guiding ecological engineering. However, the spatiotemporal patterns of these two parameters in the arid mountainous region of the Qilian Mountains (QLMs) in China remain unclear.Methods The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model was employed to estimate the theoretical carrying capacity. The grazing pressure index, which represents the ratio of the actual to theoretical carrying capacity, was used to assess the forage-livestock balance.Results From 2000 to 2018, the theoretical carrying capacity of grasslands in the QLMs showed a significant (p < 0.01) increasing trend (0.011 +/- 0.002 standard sheep unit (SU)center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)), with an average value of 0.73 +/- 0.7 SU center dot ha(-1). Its spatial distribution was high in the southeast and low in the northwest of the QLMs. The total annual precipitation of 72.1% in the grasslands was significantly and positively correlated with the theoretical carrying capacity (R = 0.45; p < 0.05). The average grazing pressure index of natural grasslands in the QLMs was 2.08 +/- 0.14, indicating that the grasslands were generally overloaded. The value increased significantly (p < 0.05) from 2000 to 2010 but has been decreasing significantly since 2011. Spatially, overloading was more severe in the southeastern counties.Conclusion Precipitation was the main factor responsible for the increase in the theoretical carrying capacity of the grasslands. In future grassland management, the red early-warning zones exhibiting continuously increasing overloading should be prioritized.

AB  - Combined application of biochar and organic fertilizer improves soil structure and crop yield but may lead to increased loss of phosphorus (P). To reduce the P loss risk in this case, rice straw biochar (BC) and sheep manure (SM) were modified using polyacrylamide (PAM). The effects of using organic amendments (BC, SM, and PAM-modified organic mixtures) and no amendments (CK) on soil total and colloidal P leaching loss from paddy soils were evaluated through soil column leaching experiments. The soil leachate volume was increased by 8.91% with BC treatment and reduced by 15.3% with SM treatment. The total P leaching loss (973.9 mu g kg(-1)) from the BC-treated soil was higher than that from other treatments (541.4-963.5 mu g kg(-1)). However, there was much more colloidal P loss (480.0 mu g kg(-1)) from SM treatment. The optimal conditions for the preparation of BC and SM modified using polyacrylamide (PSB) for reducing P leaching loss were SM/BC = 4:1, 1% PAM, and 100 degrees C. Molybdate-unreactive P accounts for 58.61-86.89% of the colloidal P in the soil leachate with organic amendments. PSB reduced colloidal P loss (particularly in 10-220 nm range) by similar to 50% compared with BC and SM treatments. The colloidal P concentration in the leaching solutions was significantly correlated with TOC and susceptible to Fe and Al concentrations. Using PAM-modified mixture instead of manure and biochar as a soil amendment can effectively control P leaching from fields.

AB  - The present study evaluated the effect of bromelain and high-pressure processing (HPP) on the physicochemical, tenderization, and microstructure of buffalo meat. The buffalo meat samples were marinated with 5% bromelain enzyme for 24 hr at 4 degrees C followed by HPP treatment at 0 MPa, 100 MPa, and 300 MPa for 5 min at 20 +/- 2 degrees C, leading to six samples viz Control (without bromelain and with bromelain, no high-pressure treatment), 100 MPa (with & without bromelain) and 300 MPa (with & without bromelain). The pH and moisture content of buffalo meat improved when subjected to pressure and bromelain enzyme. The cooking yield was reduced for enzyme-treated meat, while there was no significant (p>0.05) difference for HPP-treated meat. Hardness and shear force reduced at 100 and 300 MPa compared to the control; however, they were not statistically significant (p>0.05). In addition, buffalo meat that was treated with 300 MPa had a more compact but ruptured fibre structure than the control. The sensory panellists preferred non-bromelain-treated meat due to the unpleasant taste of enzyme-treated meat. In conclusion, bromelain and HPP could improve buffalo meat tenderness, but the time and pressure of HPP need to be increased to get optimal tenderness while replacing bromelain with other types of enzymes to cater for the taste of the meat sample.

AB  - IntroductionAdventitious root (AR) development, affected by various biotic and abiotic factors, is the most important procedure in tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.) cutting propagation. Establishing symbiotic relationships with most terrestrial plants, AMF (Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus) can mediate the AR formation of several herbaceous and woody plants in previous studies.MethodsIn this paper, effects of combined application of AMF and exogenous auxin on AR formation of cuttings from different tea plant varieties ('Pingyangtezao', 'Longjing 43' and 'Longjingchangye') were studied. Then we also performed RNA-Seq analysis with 'Pingyangtezao' cuttings aiming to find the possible auxin-related pathway of AM fungal regulation on AR formation. To accurately uncover the regulatory mechanism of AMF on AR formation of tea cuttings, rooting process were separated into four stages (S0, non-rooting; S1, AR protrusion; S2, AR formation and S3, AR elongation) at the same sampling time.Results and DiscussionResults showed that IBA treatment increased the mycorrhizal colonization rate, especially in 'Pingyangtezao' variety (from 37.58% to 46.29%). Both inoculating AMF and addition of IBA promoted the AR formation, and rooting of different tea plant varieties showed different dependence on auxin. AMF could alleviate the effect of auxin-related inhibitors (2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid, L-alpha-(Aminooxy)-beta-phenylpropionic acid and alpha-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-IAA) on rooting of tea cuttings, even though the colonization of AMF was hindered at various degrees. Transcriptomic analysis showed that different numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at various rooting stages of tea cuttings with the most at S2 stage (1360 DEGs), indicating the increasing regulation by AMF with the development of AR. Similar trend was found in auxin-related DEGs, and family genes of YUC, GH, PIN, LAX, SAUR, AUX, and ABP involved in the AM fungal regulation on AR formation of tea cuttings. Additionally, AMF strongly mediated auxin transport and signal transduction pathways in tea cuttings as showed by the results of correlation analysis. Overall, interaction of AMF and exogenous auxin in promoting rooting and the preliminary mechanism of AMF regulating AR formation of tea cuttings was deciphered in this paper, which may provide a basis for further deep mechanistic research and cutting propagation of tea production.

AB  - Survival rates are a central component of life-history strategies of large vertebrate species. However, comparative studies seldom investigate interspecific variation in survival rates with respect to other life-history traits, especially for males. The lack of such studies could be due to the challenges associated with obtaining reliable datasets, incorporating information on the 0-1 probability scale, or dealing with several types of measurement error in life-history traits, which can be a computationally intensive process that is often absent in comparative studies. We present a quantitative approach using a Bayesian phylogenetically controlled regression with the flexibility to incorporate uncertainty in estimated survival rates and quantitative life-history traits while considering genetic similarity among species and uncertainty in relatedness. As with any comparative analysis, our approach makes several assumptions regarding the generalizability and comparability of empirical data from separate studies. Our model is versatile in that it can be applied to any species group of interest and include any life-history traits as covariates. We used an unbiased simulation framework to provide "proof of concept" for our model and applied a slightly richer model to a real data example for pinnipeds. Pinnipeds are an excellent taxonomic group for comparative analysis, but survival rate data are scarce. Our work elucidates the challenges associated with addressing important questions related to broader ecological life-history patterns and how survival-reproduction trade-offs might shape evolutionary histories of extant taxa. Specifically, we underscore the importance of having high-quality estimates of age-specific survival rates and information on other life-history traits that reasonably characterize a species for accurately comparing across species.

AB  - Rapid urbanisation has had a significant negative influence on the water bodies that flow through and around urban areas. This study aims to evaluate the water quality and analyse the suitability for drinking and irrigation uses. This study envisaged assessing the water quality status of the groundwater using the pollution index of groundwater (PIG), ecological risk index (ERI) and multivariate statistical techniques, namely cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA), that were applied to differentiate the sources of water quality variation and determine the cause of pollution in the study area. Most groundwater is unsuitable for drinking and irrigation consumption, depending on analyses. PIG values indicated high pollution levels in the studied water body, rendering it unsuitable for any practical purpose. CA results showed the impact of surface water and treatment plant on groundwater. PCA was used to identify four important factors in the groundwater, including mineral and nutrient pollution, heavy metal pollution, organic pollution and faecal contamination. The deteriorating water quality of the groundwater was demonstrated to originate from vast sources of anthropogenic activities, especially municipal sewage discharge. Study wells had greater concentrations of Cl- and Na+ in their water because seawater flows into the aquifer system and mixes with the marine aquifer matrix. Thus, the current work reveals how to employ the PIG and multivariate statistical approaches to obtain more accessible and more meaningful information about the water quality of groundwater and to identify the sources of pollution.

AB  - Preclinical and clinical studies have shown a wide-range of individual differences in response to stressors or novel environments which can affect the susceptibility to develop abnormal behaviors and neuropsychiatric disorders. Both vulnerability and resiliency have been observed in animals and humans experiencing stressful events. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is a rodent depression model consisting of various stressors. This protocol leads to depressive- and anhedonic-like behaviors in rodents. The present study aimed to evaluate potential individual differences in response to CUMS in rats, with respect to the expression level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glycogen synthase kinases 3-beta (GSK3-beta) (proteins involved in the modulation of mood, neuroplasticity, and cognition) in the hippocampus. CUMS was performed for four consecutive weeks. Depressive-like behavior, locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and pain threshold were also evaluated using forced swim test (FST), open field test (OFT), and the hot plate (HP), respectively. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate BDNF and GSK3-beta expression levels. The results showed that CUMS rats can be classified as two clusters: affected and non-affected (depressed and non-depressed). Affected rats showed depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, decreased locomotor activity, and increased pain threshold. However, non-affected rats were similar to controls. In addition, there was a downregulation of BDNF and upregulation of GSK3-beta in affected rats. Spearman correlation analysis also showed a relationship between BDNF and GSK3-beta expression levels with individual differences. In conclusion, the present study showed that BDNF and GSK3-beta may be involved in individual differences in CUMS rats.

AB  - Tea green leafhoppers are insects widely distributed in major tea-growing areas. At present, less attention has been paid to the study on effect of tea green leafhopper infestation on tea growth phenotype. In this study, tea green leafhoppers were used to treat tea branches in laboratory and co-treated with brassinolide (BL), the highest bioactivity of brassinosteroids (BRs), in tea garden. The results showed that the expression of genes related to BRs synthesis was inhibited and BL content was reduced in tea shoots after infestation by tea green leafhoppers. In addition, area of each leaf position, length and diameter of internodes, and the biomass of the tender shoots of tea plant were decreased after infestation by tea green leafhoppers. The number of trichomes, leaf thickness, palisade tissue thickness and cuticle thickness of tea shoots were increased after tea green leafhoppers infestation. BL spraying could partially recover the phenotypic changes of tea branches caused by tea green leafhoppers infestation. Further studies showed that tea green leafhoppers infestation may regulate the expression of CsDWF4 (a key gene for BL synthesis) through transcription factors CsFP1 and CsTCP1a, which finally affect the BL content. Moreover, BL was applied to inhibit the tea green leafhoppers infestation on tea shoots. In conclusion, our study revealed the effect of plant hormone BL-mediated tea green leafhoppers infestation on the growth phenotype of tea plants.

AB  - Simple Summary In this work, we performed a prospective study to compare bacterial communities in the nasal and laryngeal cavities of pigs with or without clinical signs of respiratory disease which were followed in a longitudinal fashion, at three critical phases of production, from weaning to the finishing phase. The findings reported here provide evidence that the composition of the upper respiratory tract bacterial microbiota differs significantly when comparing pigs with or without respiratory clinical signs after weaning; these differences were maintained in the nursery phase but were not observed at the finishing phase. Our results contribute to the knowledge of the porcine microbiota at different stages of production, providing new insights into the role of bacteria in the early stages of respiratory diseases. A prospective study was conducted to identify bacterial communities in the nasal and laryngeal cavities of pigs with or without clinical signs of respiratory disease in a longitudinal fashion, from weaning to the finishing phase. Nasal and laryngeal swabs were collected from asymptomatic pigs (n = 30), as well as from pigs with clinical signs of respiratory disease (n = 30) at the end of the weaning (T1-33 days) phase, end of the nursery phase (T2-71 days), and finishing (T3-173 days). Total DNA was extracted from each sample, and the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Principal coordinates analysis indicated no significant differences between the nasal and laryngeal bacterial communities. Nevertheless, the microbiota composition in the upper respiratory tract (URT) was clearly distinct between animals, with or without signs of respiratory disease, particularly at post-weaning and the end of nursery. In pigs with clinical signs of respiratory disease, Actinobacillus, Streptococcus Porphyromonas, Veillonella, and an unclassified genus of Pasteurellaceae were more abundant than in pigs with no signs. Metabolic prediction identified 28 differentially abundant pathways, mainly related to carbohydrate, energy, amino acid, anaerobic, and nucleotide metabolism in symptomatic pigs (especially in T2). These findings provide evidence that the composition of the URT bacterial microbiota differs significantly when comparing pigs with or without respiratory clinical signs after weaning, and this difference is maintained in the nursery phase; such differences, however, were not evident at the finishing phase.

AB  - In sheep production, due to the limitations of breeding conditions, the uteri of ewes are often infected with bacteria, resulting in the failure of embryo implantation or loss, causing huge losses to the sheep industry. Therefore, in this study, by using RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence, we investigated the effects of LPS infusion on the immune microenvironment and endometrial receptivity, which play an important role in the process of embryo implantation in ruminants, during the three critical periods of embryo implantation in sheep. The results showed that LPS infusion at day 12, day 16, and day 20 significantly increased the expression of Th1 cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-8, IL-6), while significantly decreasing the expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) and disrupting the expression of implantation factors, such as ITGB3, ITGB5, VEGF, and LIF, in the endometrial tissues of sheep. Additionally, the protein expression level of TLR4 and the phosphorylation level of ERK were significantly elevated at day 12, day 16, and day 20 after LPS infusion, suggesting that LPS may impair endometrial receptivity through the TLR4/ERK pathway. Validation was conducted in a receptive model of sEECs using TLR4 and ERK phosphorylation inhibitors. Compared with the LPS group, TLR4 and ERK phosphorylation inhibitors significantly reduced the expression of TLR4 and p-ERK, down-regulated Th1 cytokines, up-regulated Th2 cytokines, and alleviated the disruption of genes for attachment. Treatment with 50 mu M PTE can significantly alleviate the abnormal expression of implantation genes caused by LPS, and its mechanism may be related to the regulation of the ERK signaling pathway.

AB  - To cope with abiotic and biotic stressors, plants have developed mutualistic associations with beneficial soil microbes, but little is known about how extreme abiotic conditions impact on microbe-induce resistance to insect herbivores. Extreme temperatures are often accompanied by extremes in plant water availability, which together reduce plant growth and change plant physiology. There are potential consequences for increasing plant susceptibility to biotic stresses, and this poses a real challenge for plant productivity. We evaluated how the effects of beneficial soil bacteria (Acidovorax radicis N35e) on barley plant growth and resultant resistance against aphid infestation (Sitobion avenae) were impacted by a single heatwave event across a plant water availability gradient. We also tested if timing of bacterial inoculation (before or after the temperature treatment) affected bacteria-plant interactions on aphids. We found that heatwaves affected plant biomass allocation from above-ground to below-ground tissues. Inoculation with A. radicis led to reduction of aphid numbers, but depended on timing of inoculation, and led to stronger resistance when inoculations occurred closer to aphid infestation. Remarkably, microbe-induced resistance against aphids was consistent across heatwave and water availability treatments. This study provides evidence that beneficial plant-bacteria interactions may represent a potential solution for sustainable agricultural practices to enhance plant growth and response to insect pests under climate change. Future field trials should investigate the consistency of beneficial effects reported here for a better understanding of multispecies interactions in the context of global change.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   Para hacer frente a factores de estres abioticos y bioticos, las plantas han desarrollado asociaciones mutualistas con microorganismos beneficiosos del suelo. Sin embargo, se sabe poco sobre como las condiciones abioticas extremas afectan la resistencia inducida por microorganismos a los herbivoros insectos. Las temperaturas extremas a menudo van acompanadas de extremos en la disponibilidad de agua para las plantas, lo que, en conjunto, reduce el crecimiento de las plantas y afecta su fisiologia. Esto puede producir consecuencias en la planta, como aumentar su susceptibilidad a los estreses bioticos, representando un desafio para la productividad de las plantas. Se evaluo como los efectos de las bacterias beneficiosas del suelo (Acidovorax radicis N35e) en el crecimiento de plantas de cebada y la resistencia contra la infestacion de afidos (Sitobion avenae) podrian ser afectados por un evento de ola de calor a lo largo de un gradiente de disponibilidad de agua para las plantas. Tambien se evaluo si el momento de la inoculacion bacteriana (antes o despues del tratamiento de temperatura) podria afectar las interacciones bacteria-planta sobre los afidos. Se observo que las olas de calor afectaron significativamente la asignacion de biomasa de las plantas, desviandola de los tejidos aereos hacia los tejidos subterraneos. Ademas, la inoculacion con A. radicis redujo el numero de afidos, pero el efecto de la bacteria dependio del momento de la inoculacion y condujo a una resistencia mas fuerte cuando las inoculaciones ocurrieron mas cerca de la infestacion de afidos. Notablemente, la resistencia inducida por microorganismos contra los afidos fue consistente en todos los tratamientos de ola de calor y disponibilidad de agua. Este estudio proporciona evidencia de que las interacciones beneficiosas entre las plantas y las bacterias pueden representar una solucion potencial para practicas agricolas sostenibles, mejorando el crecimiento de las plantas y la respuesta a las plagas de insectos bajo el cambio climatico. Sin embargo, se necesitan futuros estudios de campo para investigar la consistencia de los efectos beneficiosos informados en este estudio, con el fin de obtener una mejor comprension de las interacciones entre multiples especies en el contexto del cambio global.

AB  - Selecting foraging habitat is a fundamental behavior in the life of organisms as it directly links resource acquisition to fitness. Differences in habitat selection among individuals may arise from several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and yet, their interaction has been given little attention in the study of wild populations. We combine sex, body size, and boldness to explain individual differences in the seasonal foraging habitat selection of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) from the Kerguelen Archipelago. We hypothesize that habitat selection is linked to the trade-off between resource acquisition and risk, and that individuals differ in their position along this trade-off because of differences in reproductive strategies, life stages, and metabolic requirements. Before the post-molt foraging trip, we used a novel object approach test to quantify the boldness of 28 subadult and adult females and 42 subadult males and equipped them with data loggers to track their movements at sea. Subadult males selected neritic and oceanic habitats, whereas females mostly selected less productive oceanic habitats. Both sexes showed a seasonal shift from Antarctic habitats in the south in the summer to the free of ice subantarctic and subtropical habitats in the north in the winter. Males avoided oceanic habitats and selected more productive neritic and Antarctic habitats with body size mostly in the winter. Bolder males selected northern warmer waters in winter, while shyer ones selected the Kerguelen plateau and southern colder oceanic waters. Bolder females selected the Kerguelen plateau in the summer when prey profitability is assumed to be the highest. This study not only provides new insights into the spatiotemporal foraging ecology of elephant seals in relation to personality but also emphasizes the relevance of combining several intrinsic and extrinsic factors in understanding among-individual variation in space use essential in wildlife management and conservation.

AB  - Plant domestication has commonly reduced levels of secondary metabolites known to confer resistance against insects. Chili pepper is a special case because the fruits of different varieties have been selected for lower and higher levels of capsaicin, the main compound associated with defence. This may have important consequences for insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Despite the widespread consumption of chili peppers worldwide, the effects of capsaicin on insects are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of capsaicin on a generalist herbivore, Spodoptera latifascia (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and its ectoparasitoid, Euplectrus platyhypenae (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). Using chili varieties with three pungency levels: non-pungent (Padron), mild (Cayenne) and highly pungent (Habanero), as well as artificial diets spiked with three different levels of synthetic capsaicin, we determined whether higher capsaicin levels negatively affect the performance of these insects. Overall, capsaicin had a negative effect on both herbivore and parasitoid performance, particularly at high concentrations. Caterpillars reared on highly pungent fruits and high-capsaicin diet had longer development time, reduced pupation success, lower adult emergence, but also lower parasitism rates than caterpillars reared on mild or non-capsaicin treatments. In addition, we found that the caterpillars were capable of sequestering capsaicinoids in their haemolymph when fed on the high pungent variety with consequences for parasitoids' performance and oviposition decisions. These results increase our understanding of the role of capsaicin as a chemical defence against insects and its potential implications for pest management.

AB  - Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) are pivotal in skeletal muscle development and are influenced by numerous regulatory factors. This study focuses on the regulatory and functional mechanism roles of lncMD1, a muscle-specific long non-coding RNA, in the proliferation and differentiation of goat SMSCs. Employing in vitro cultured goat SMSCs, this study demonstrated that lncMD1, functions as a decoy for miR-133a-3p and miR-361-3p. This interaction competitively binds these microRNAs to modulate the expression of dynactin subunit 2 (DCTN2) and dynactin subunit 1 (DCTN1), thereby affects SMSCs proliferation and differentiation. These findings enhance the understanding of non-coding RNAs in goat SMSCs growth cycles and offer a theoretical foundation for exploring the molecular processes of goat skeletal muscle myogenic development.

AB  - PurposeAdvanced oxidation processes are known for their ability to remove organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals, and bacteria from wastewater, yielding outstanding results. However, these processes requires high energy input, costly equipment, and specialized operators.This study proposes a simple acidic oxidation method (H2O2 at pH 3 for 24 h) for in-situ treatment of pig effluent, offering a low-cost alternative for environmental management.MethodsThe treatment was applied to effluents from three Italian farms, and its effectiveness was evaluated against: (i) bacterial load and amoxicillin-resistant bacteria by total viable count on selective media, (ii) nine commonly used veterinary antibiotics by LC-MS, and (iii) foul odor emissions by e-nose. Additionally, the fertilizer effect of treated effluents was examined using a maize pot experiment.ResultsThe treatment fully eliminated amoxicillin-resistant bacteria, reduced total bacterial load, and enhanced antibiotic degradation compared to natural dissipation (-53% vs. -48% over 24 h). Odor emissions were reduced by 20-80%, depending on organic content. Fertilizing properties were preserved, with improved Cu, Fe, and S uptake in plants (+ 25 to + 32%).ConclusionsThese results highlight a practical, effective method for treating pig sludge, reducing its environmental impact while maintaining agricultural value.

AB  - During the adaptive evolution of animals, the host and its gut microbiota co-adapt to different elevations. Currently, there are few reports on the rumen microbiota-hepato-intestinal axis of Tibetan sheep at different altitudes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the regulatory effect of rumen microorganism-volatile fatty acids (VFAs)-VFAs transporter gene interactions on the key enzymes and genes related to gluconeogenesis in Tibetan sheep. The rumen fermentation parameters, rumen microbial densities, liver gluconeogenesis activity and related genes were determined and analyzed using gas chromatography, RT-qPCR and other research methods. Correlation analysis revealed a reciprocal relationship among rumen microflora-VFAs-hepatic gluconeogenesis in Tibetan sheep at different altitudes. Among the microbiota, Ruminococcus flavefaciens (R. flavefaciens), Ruminococcus albus (R. albus), Fibrobactersuccinogenes and Ruminobacter amylophilus (R. amylophilus) were significantly correlated with propionic acid (p < 0.05), while propionic acid was significantly correlated with the transport genes monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) and anion exchanger 2 (AE2) (p < 0.05). Propionic acid was significantly correlated with key enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvic acid carboxylase and glucose (Glu) in the gluconeogenesis pathway (p < 0.05). Additionally, the expressions of these genes were significantly correlated with those of the related genes, namely, forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) (p < 0.05). The results showed that rumen microbiota densities differed at different altitudes, and the metabolically produced VFA contents differed, which led to adaptive changes in the key enzyme activities of gluconeogenesis and the expressions of related genes.

AB  - Variability in galling caused by Leptocybe invasa Fisher & La Salle has been reported in several species and hybrids of Eucalyptus. Genetic diversity within Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. could confer resistance to L. invasa via variation in plant specialized metabolites or plant responses detrimental to insect herbivores. Moreover, optimal defence theory proposes that plants will invest more constitutive resistance in parts that are vulnerable to herbivore attack, such as immature leaves and apical buds, which are prone to galling. We investigated constitutive resistance of subspecies and genotypes of E. camaldulensis to L. invasa while controlling for differences among growing conditions characteristic of their autochthonous Australian habitats using common nursery and garden arboreta plantings. Data on galling intensity, gall size, leaf phenolics and leaf physical attributes were used to investigate differences in susceptibility. We show that E. camaldulensis exhibits both constitutive and induced resistance to L. invasa. Intraspecific variability in galling was pronounced and correlated with concentrations of quinic acid derivatives and hypersensitive abscission of leaves. Whether these metabolites directly affect the survival of eggs or larvae remains to be determined. Hypersensitive leaf abscission in subspecies of E. camaldulensis in response to injury by a galling insect has not been reported previously and warrants investigation.

AB  - Dairy goats are the goats bred with the ability to produce large quantities of milk, and the increase of the female kid rate of breeding dairy goats is beneficial for milk production and economic benefits of dairy goat farms. Our previous study revealed that regulating the pH of dairy goat semen diluent to 6.2 or 7.4 respectively, the proportion of X chromosome bearing sperm (X-sperm) in the up and down layers of the tube after incubation was significantly higher than that of Y chromosome bearing sperm (Y-sperm) i.e. enriched X-sperm. In this study, fresh dairy goat semen collected in different seasons was diluted in different pH solutions to calculate the number and rate of X-sperm and to measure the functional pa-rameters of enriched sperm. The artificial insemination experiments were performed with enriched X -sperm. The mechanisms of regulating the pH of diluent affecting sperm enrichment were further studied. The results showed that the proportion of enriched X-sperm in pH 6.2 and 7.4 diluents of sperm collected in different seasons showed no significantly different, but were significantly higher than that of the control group (pH 6.8). The in vitro functional parameters of X-sperm enriched in pH 6.2 and 7.4 diluent solution were not significantly different from those of the control group (P > 0.05). After artificial insemination with X-sperm enriched in pH7.4 diluent, the proportion of female offspring was signifi-cantly higher than that of the control group. It was found that the regulating pH of the diluent affected sperm mitochondrial activity and glucose uptake capacity via phosphorylating NF-kB and GSK3a/b proteins. The motility activity of X-sperm was enhanced under acidic conditions and weakened under alkaline conditions, which was conducive to the effective enrichment of X-sperm. This study demon-strated that the number and proportion of X-sperm enriched using pH 7.4 diluent were elevated, and the proportion of female kids was increased. This technology can be used for the reproduction and pro-duction of dairy goats in farms at large scales. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Present research reveals the effect of different soil environment modifications on population dynamic tendency of fecal Escherichia coli (E. coli). Various soil environments were created by varying the temperature regimes, relative water content, pH, C/N ratio and ammonium content. The result showed that population dynamics of E. coli with all treatments increased initially and then decreased with the passage of time. Maximum population of E. coli at higher temperature regime (37 degrees C and 45 degrees C) was observed on 8th day of incubation, whereas, at low temperature regime (0.6 degrees C and 25 degrees C), it reached the peak after 15 days of incubation, other treatments (soil relative water content, pH, C/N, ammonium content) reached the peak all after 8 days of incubation. At the end of the incubation period (60 days), maximum population of E. coli was observed in the soil treated with 0.6 degrees C, 80% of relative soil water content, pH 7.0, 135 mg-ammonium/kg and C/N of 25:1. The results indicated that 45 degrees C, 90% of relative water content, pH 9.0, 125 mg-ammonium/kg, C/N of 10:1 inhibited E. coli growth, whereas, 37 degrees C, 80% of relative soil water content, pH 7.0, 135 mg-ammonium/kg and C/N of 25:1 stimulated E. coli growth.

AB  - Ammonia could be regarded as one detrimental pollutant with an acrid smell in livestock sheds. So far, the pig breeding industry became the main source of atmospheric ammonia. Previous literature demonstrated that excessive ammonia inhalation might cause a series of physiological damage to multiple organs. Unfortunately, the toxicity mechanisms of gaseous ammonia to the porcine nervous system need further research to elucidate. Selenium (Se) involves in many essential physiological processes and has a mitigative effect on the exogenous toxicant. There were scant references that corroborated whether organic Se could intervene in the underlying toxicity of ammonia to the hypothalamus. In the present study, multi-omics tools, ethology, and molecular biological techniques were performed to clarify the detailed mechanisms of relaxation effects of L-selenomethionine on ammonia poisoning. Our results showed that ammonia inhalation caused the clinical symptoms and the increment of positive apoptosis rate in the hypothalamus with the dysfunction of mitochondrial dynamics factors, while obvious mitochondria structure defects were observed. In parallel, the inflammation medium levels and gut microbes-driven metabolism function were altered to mediate the neurotoxicity in fattening pigs through the initiation of inflammation development. Interestingly, L-selenomethionine could attenuate ammonia toxicity by activating the PI3K/Akt/PPAR-gamma pathway to inhibit the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis process, blocking the abnormal immune response and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the nucleus. Meanwhile, Se could enhance the production performance of fattening sows. Taken together, our study verified the novel hypothesis for the toxicity identification of aerial ammonia and provided a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of occupational poisoning.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) is a valuable source of essential amino acids, especially sulphur-containing ones, which are generally lacking in leguminous crops, thus representing an alternative source of protein for both humans and farm animals. Rhizosphere soil samples from five experimental plots with mono- and mixed cultivations of three camelina cultivars, including two introduced varieties Cs1.Pro (Luna) and Cs2.Pro (Lenka) and one Bulgarian variety Cs3.Pro (local Bulgarian landrace) with variety 666 of vetch (Vicia sativa L.) (Cs3-Vs.Pro) and variety Mir of pea (Pisum sativum L.) (Cs3-Ps.Pro), were collected and analysed. The total DNA was isolated from the rhizosphere soils and the presence of the 16S rRNA gene was confirmed by amplification with the universal primer 16SV34. In the present study, the structure of the soil bacterial community in five different plots (Cs1.S.Pro, Cs2.S.Pro, Cs3.S.Pro, Cs3.Vs.S.Pro, and Cs3.Ps.S.Pro) where camelina was grown alone and by being intercropped with pea and vetch was analysed via a metagenomic approach. The number of observed species was highest in the local genotype of the camelina Cs3 grown alone, followed by soil from the intercropped variants Cs3-Vs and CsS-Ps. The soil bacterial communities differed between the sole cultivation of camelina and that grown with joint cultivation with vetch and peas, indicating that legumes considerably affected the growth and development of beneficial microorganisms by aspects such as nitrogen fixing, levels of nitrifying bacteria, and levels of phosphorus-dissolving bacteria, thus helping to provide better plant nutrition. The alpha-diversity indicated that bacterial communities in the rhizosphere were higher in soils intercropped with vetch and pea. The optical properties of cereals and legumes were determined by their energy structure, which includes both their occupied and free electronic energy levels and the energy levels of the atomic vibrations of the molecules or the crystal lattice.

AB  - Vermicomposting, a process in which housefly larvae are used to decompose organic waste, has attracted attention as a method for managing antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) in livestock manure. Vermicomposting effectively reduces antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and residual antimicrobials. However, the evaluation of live bacteria, including ARB, remains scarce. Additionally, conventional DNA extraction methods include DNA from dead bacteria, impeding the accurate evaluation of ARG-associated risk in compost and the microbiome. This study assesses the effectiveness of vermicomposting pig manure against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by evaluating the ARB, ARGs (focusing on DNA from live bacteria), and microbiome associated with vermicomposting processes. Vermicomposting significantly reduces the abundance of bacteria, including ARB, and decreases the ARG ( tetA, tetB, blaTEM, TEM , and bla CTX _ M ) copy number in live bacteria. Bacterial community analysis revealed an increase in the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria. . Moreover, the vermicomposted samples effectively cultivated myriad plants. Overall, vermicomposting effectively reduces the ARB and ARGs in pig manure, with potential benefits for plant growth and sustainable waste management. Hence, it can be widely applied to treat livestock manure and other organic wastes to combat AMR.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and play key roles in many biological processes, such as development and response to multiple stresses. However, little is known about their roles in generating novel phenotypes and phenotypic variation during the course of animal evolution. Here, we, for the first time, characterized the miRNAs of the cochlea in an echolocating bat (Rhinolophus affinis). We sampled eight individuals from two R. affinis subspecies with significant echolocation call frequency differences. We identified 365 miRNAs and 121 of them were novel. By searching sequences of these miRNAs precursors in multiple high-quality mammal genomes, we found one specific miRNA shared by all echolocating bats but not present in all other nonecholocating mammals. The targeted genes of this miRNA included several known hearing genes (e.g., KCNQ4 and GJB6). Together with the matched mRNA-seq data, we identified 1766 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two subspecies and 555 of them were negatively regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). We found that almost half of known hearing genes in the list of all DEGs were regulated negatively by DEMs, suggesting an important role of miRNAs in call frequency variation of the two subspecies. These targeted DEGs included several important hearing genes (e.g., Piezo1, Piezo2, and CDH23) that have been shown to be important in ultrasonic hearing of echolocating mammals.

AB  - Over the last few years, the cumulative use of antibiotics in healthcare institutions, as well as the rearing of livestock and poultry, has resulted in the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This presents a substantial danger to human health worldwide. The characteristics of airborne ARGs, especially those transferred from outdoors to indoors, remains largely unexplored in neighborhoods, even though a majority of human population spends most of their time there. We investigated airborne ARGs and mobile genetic element (MGE, IntI1), plant communities, and airborne microbiota transferred indoors, as well as respiratory disease (RD) prevalence using a combination of metabarcode sequencing, real -time quantitative PCR and questionnaires in 72 neighborhoods in Shanghai. We hypothesized that (i) urbanization regulates ARGs abundance, (ii) the urbanization effect on ARGs varies seasonally, and (iii) land use types are associated with ARGs abundance. Supporting these hypotheses, during the warm season, the abundance of ARGs in peri-urban areas was higher than in urban areas. The abundance of ARGs was also affected by the surrounding land use and plant communities: an increase in the proportion of gray infrastructure (e.g., residential area) around neighborhoods can lead to an increase in some ARGs (mecA, qnrA, ermB and mexD). Additionally, there were variations observed in the relationship between ARGs and bacterial genera in different seasons. Specifically, Stenotrophomonas and Campylobacter were positively correlated with vanA during warm seasons, whereas Pseudomonas, Bacteroides, Treponema and Stenotrophomonas positively correlated with tetX in the cold season. Interstingly, a noteworthy positive correlation was observed between the abundance of vanA and the occurrence of both rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis. Taken together, our study underlines the importance of urbanization and season in controlling the indoor transfer of airborne ARGs. Furthermore, we also highlight the augmentation of green-blue infrastructure in urban environments has the potential to mitigate an excess of ARGs.

AB  - Individuals generally differ in their ability to perform challenging behaviours, but the causes of such variability remain incompletely understood. Because animals can usually use different behavioural tactics to achieve their goals, we might expect individual differences in skill to be maintained when the available tactics require different abilities to perform well. To explore this idea, I used the producer-scrounger (PS) paradigm, which considers interactions between foragers that may either invest effort in searching for resources (i.e. produce) or exploit others' discoveries (i.e. scrounge). Specifically, I tested whether individual differences in cognitive traits (i.e. the ability to find food) might result from a trade-off with competitiveness (i.e. the ability to steal food) that would exert disruptive selection pressure and, as such, might explain the coexistence of condition-dependent foraging tactics. If individuals differ in their competitiveness, with strong contestants being better able to monopolize food resources (and hence to scrounge), the model predicts that strong and weak competitors should rely more on scrounging and producing, respectively, especially when the finder's advantage is low. These findings indicate that the existence of individual differences in competitive abilities may be sufficient to explain short-term individual foraging tactic specialization. Yet, the degree of behavioural specialization is expected to depend on both the social and ecological context. Furthermore, persistent phenotypic differences, that are necessary for stable individual specialization, require the existence of a trade-off between competitive abilities that enable greater success as scroungers and cognitive abilities that are associated with better efficiency to detect and/or capture prey and, as such, enable greater success as producers. Therefore, this study further highlights the importance of considering the existence of alternative tactics to measure and predict the evolution of traits, including cognitive traits, within populations.
   When animals can use alternative tactics to achieve their goal, they tend to consistently differ in the degree to which they play each tactic. Using the producer-scrounger as a general framework, here I demonstrate that the maintenance of persistent phenotypic differences, that are necessary for stable individual specialization, requires the existence of a trade-off between abilities that enable greater success as either a producer or a scrounger.image

AB  - Additives were widely investigated to retain the nutrients and mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) during manure composting. However, the sustained effects of additives on the GHGs emissions following incorporation of composts to soil were scarcely explored. This study evaluated the effects of bentonite added at the beginning of pig manure composting on the GHGs emissions during two successive processes, i.e., composting and soil incubation amended with composting products. Addition of bentonite did not hinder the composting process and alter the total CO2 emission. On the other hand, reduction by about 17% and 29% for CH4 and N2O emission, respectively, was achieved in the presence of bentonite during composting. Incorporation of the final composting products to soil enhanced significantly the soil C and N of various forms, and gas emissions of CO2 and N2O. However, no significant differences were observed between bentonite-manure co-compost and manureonly compost application except for the N2O emission. Compared to the manure-only compost, compost amended with bentonite reduced N2O loss by around 6.8%, but not statistically significant. This study confirmed that addition of bentonite at the composting stage can mitigate the GHGs emission considering both composting and compost application stages, with all reductions occurring at the composting stage.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a global conservation issue that undermines the conservation of an endangered species. HEC and the factors influencing crop-raiding behaviour were studied in the tropical forests of south India from Nov 2006 to Mar 2008. Crop depredation, protection methods, and land use changes were studied at Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (TR). A total of 297 incidents of crop damage were recorded, with peaks in the raiding during the monsoon season. Spatial analysis of HEC showed peripheral farms are more vulnerable (1.51%) than village centers (0.18%). Temporally, cropping patterns have changed from food crops to commercial crops. The elephant-damaged area was positively correlated with the effective perimeter (perimeter with crops), total cultivated area, and area of degradation around the village. Logistic regression of crop raiding incidence with independent predictors showed that the incidence of raiding was 95% greater in moist deciduous forests than in thorny forests. Palatable crops were likely to be raided more frequently (391 times). Crops with protection methods were 22 times less likely to be targets of raids. In the areas adjacent to the Mudumalai TR, crop species, improvements in protection, and land use change reduced the HEC. Relocating villages from the core reserve and existing corridors in the eastern region is essential for conserving elephants in the Nilgiris, Western Ghats landscape.

AB  - Horseshoe bats are natural hosts of zoonotic viruses, yet the genetic basis of their antiviral immunity is poorly understood. Here we generated two new chromosomal-level genome assemblies for horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus) and three close relatives, and show that, during their diversification, horseshoe bats underwent extensive chromosomal rearrangements and gene expansions linked to segmental duplications. These expansions have generated new adaptive variations in type I interferons and the interferon-stimulated gene ANXA2R, which potentially enhance antiviral states, as suggested by our functional assays. Genome-wide selection screens, including of candidate introgressed regions, uncover numerous putative molecular adaptations linked to immunity, including in viral receptors. By expanding taxon coverage to ten horseshoe bat species, we identify new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, and report convergent functionally important residues that could explain wider patterns of susceptibility across mammals. We conclude that horseshoe bats have numerous signatures of adaptation, including some potentially related to immune response to viruses, in genomic regions with diverse and multiscale mutational changes.

AB  - Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) is a commercially important species in the North Atlantic whose spatial population structure has not yet been fully determined across its entire range. We genotyped individuals from across the North Atlantic using a subset of informative single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers to assess their usability as a SNP panel. We assessed whether these purportedly structured SNPs had any association with sex. We found several of these loci to be in sex-determining chromosomes and that their inclusion generated genetic structure mainly in males. The population structure without the sex-associated SNPs was weak and followed an isolation-by-distance pattern, likely with a large regional population on each side of the North Atlantic. We discuss how different sex ratios in the samples and/or an evolving sex-determination system in this species likely caused the inclusion of sex-associated loci in the panel. We found suggestive evidence of polymorphisms at sex-determining chromosomes differentiating males on east and west locations, indicating evolution of the sex-determination system. These results highlight the importance of documenting sex-based differences in genetic studies and call for a better understanding of genomic architecture to understand sex-determination systems across the whole distribution of sexually dimorphic species.

AB  - Habitat selection and spatial usage are important components of animal behavior influencing fitness and population dynamic. Understanding the animal-habitat relationship is crucial in ecology, particularly in developing strategies for wildlife management and conservation. As this relationship is governed by environmental features and intra- and interspecific interactions, habitat selection of a population may vary locally between its core and edges. This is particularly true for central place foragers such as gray and harbor seals, where, in the Northeast Atlantic, the availability of habitat and prey around colonies vary at local scale. Here, we study how foraging habitat selection may vary locally under the influence of physical habitat features. Using GPS/GSM tags deployed at different gray and harbor seals' colonies, we investigated spatial patterns and foraging habitat selection by comparing trip characteristics and home-range similarities and fitting GAMMs to seal foraging locations and environmental data. To highlight the importance of modeling habitat selection at local scale, we fitted individual models to colonies as well as a global model. The global model suffered from issues of homogenization, while colony models showed that foraging habitat selection differed markedly between regions for both species. Despite being capable of undertaking far-ranging trips, both gray and harbor seals selected their foraging habitat depending on local availability, mainly based on distance from the last haul-out and bathymetry. Distance from shore and tidal current also influenced habitat preferences. Results suggest that local conditions have a strong influence on population spatial ecology, highlighting the relevance of processes occurring at fine geographical scale consistent with management within regional units.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA), which reduces ocean pH and leads to substantial changes in seawater carbonate chemistry, may strongly impact organisms, especially those with carbonate skeletons. In marine molluscs, while the physiological effects of OA are well known, with a reduction of growth and shell calcification, there are few studies on behavioural effects. A large marine gastropod, Haliotis tuberculata, was exposed to ambient (pHT 8.0) or low pH (pHT 7.7) during a 5-month experiment. Because animal fitness can be affected through various behavioural changes, a broad spectrum of behavioural parameters was investigated, including situations involving no stress, responses to predators, righting to evaluate indirectly the level of energy reserves, and finally, reproductive behaviour. In addition, we measured the expression profile of the GABA A-like and serotonin receptor genes, often described as central neuromodulators of sensory performance and behaviour and known to be affected by OA in molluscs. No significant effect of low pH as compared to ambient pH was observed on abalone behaviour for any of these behavioural traits or gene expressions after either one week or several months of exposure to OA. The significance tests were corroborated by estimating the size of pH effects. The behaviour of this mollusc appears not to be affected by pH decrease expected by the end of the century, suggesting some resilience of the species to OA at the adult stage. This is probably related to the ecological niche of this abalone, where important pH variations can be observed at tidal, diurnal or seasonal scales.

AB  - Simple Summary Each country has their own national breeds that are well adapted to the local climate and other conditions. Our study examines two national sheep breeds from Slovakia, the Original and the Improved Valachian sheep. The main goal of the study was to identify parts of their genome which contain genes enabling such adaptations. These are the so called selection signatures. Within the breed we look for genomic regions that were remarkably similar among a large proportion of genotyped individuals. The results point towards adaptation to high altitude pastures and resistance to parasites. The signatures of selection between the Original and Improved Valachian sheep focus on regions with striking difference in the same region of the genome between the two breeds. These results highlighted genes that improve the milk, meat and wool production, and their quality characteristics. This study explored the genomic diversity and selection signatures in two Slovakian national breeds, the Original Valachian and the Improved Valachian sheep. As they are an important animal genetic resource within the country, but with decreasing population size, our aim is to identify potentially valuable genomic regions. A total of 97 sheep (18 male and 79 female) from the Original Valachian, and 69 sheep (25 male and 44 female) from the Improved Valachian populations were genotyped using the GeneSeek GGP Ovine 50 K chip. The inbreeding levels were assessed with runs of homozygosity (ROH). The selection signatures within breeds were identified based on the top 1% of most homozygous regions within the breed, the so-called ROH islands. The selection signatures between breeds were assessed based on variance in linkage disequilibrium. Overall, we have identified selection signatures with quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genes pointing towards all three production purposes of the Valachian sheep, milk, meat, and wool, including their quality characteristics. Another group with apparent large importance was the various traits related to health and resistance to parasites, which is well in line with the sturdy nature of this breed.

AB  - According to relevant statistics, the electricity consumption for lighting in university buildings accounts for 20 to 40% of the total energy consumption of the buildings. Lighting energy saving is a key influential factor in achieving a low-carbon campus construction. The electricity consumption for lighting is simultaneously affected by the utilization of natural daylight and artificial lighting schemes. Currently, there is a lack of research regarding the dynamic quantitative correlation between the geometric design of external windows affecting the utilization of natural daylight and carbon emissions. Also, research on the dynamic synergistic impact between natural light utilization and artificial lighting on carbon emissions has not been observed. Hence, there is a lack of quantitative carbon impact prediction and guidance in the early design and actual operation of such spaces. This study took the professional drawing space of a university in the severe cold regions of Shenyang as a prototype. Daylight factor (DF) and spatial daylight autonomy (sDA) were determined using Rhino + Grasshopper and Ladybug + Honeybee for window geometry. DIALux evo simulation was used to analyze the carbon emissions of space operation, followed by correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis using SPSS to determine the degree of influence of each window design parameter on the carbon emissions. The window-to-floor ratio (WFR), window-to-wall ratio (WWR), windowsill height (H-ws), window width (W-w), and window height (H-w) had inhibitory effects on carbon emissions from daylight-responsive artificial lighting (C), and the influence of different orientations was different. Under the condition of an opposing window, the overall C trend of the professional drawing space was west < east< south < north, and the C of the morning period in each orientation was significantly lower than that in the afternoon period. Taking the frame structure system space with a floor-to-floor height of 4.2 m as an example, within the requirements of WFR and WWR, the C of the west-facing professional drawing classroom with 2.55 m for H-w, 0.75 m for H-ws, and 9.6 m for W-w was the smallest. To a certain extent, opening large windows and opening high windows can reduce the C of the space.

AB  - The close structural analogy of bisphenol (BP) S with BPA, a recognized endocrine-disrupting chemical and a substance of very high concern in the European Union, highlights the need to assess the extent of similarities between the two compounds and carefully scrutinize BPS potential toxicity for human health. This analysis aimed to investigate human health toxicity data regarding BPS, to find a point of departure for the derivation of human guidance values. A systematic and transparent methodology was applied to determine whether European or international reference values have been established for BPS. In the absence of such values, the scientific literature on human health effects was evaluated by focusing on human epidemiological and animal experimental studies. The results were analyzed by target organ/system: male and female reproduction, mammary gland, neurobehavior, and metabolism/obesity. Academic experimental studies were analyzed and compared to regulatory data including subchronic studies and an extended one-generation and reproduction study. In contrast to the regulatory studies, which were performed at dose levels in the mg/kg bw/day range, the academic dataset on specific target organs or systems showed adverse effects for BPS at much lower doses (0.5-10 mu g/kg bw/day). A large disparity between the lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels (LOAELs) derived from regulatory and academic studies was observed for BPS, as for BPA. Toxicokinetic data on BPS from animal and human studies were also analyzed and showed a 100-fold higher oral bioavailability compared to BPA in a pig model. The similarities and differences between the two bisphenols, in particular the higher bioavailability of BPS in its active (non-conjugated) form and its potential impact on human health, are discussed. Based on the available experimental data, and for a better human protection, we propose to derive human reference values for exposure to BPS from the N(L)OAELs determined in academic studies.

AB  - DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and holds promise for enhancing livestock meat production. In this study, we analyzed the DNA methylome and transcriptome of the longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) in Duroc pigs with varying growth rates. Our results reveal that DNA methylation suppressed the expression of key muscle development markers (MYOD, MYOG, MHC1) and proliferation markers (PI67, PCNA), as well as the protein expression and phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT (p < 0.05). Dual-luciferase reporter assays and EMSA showed that SP1 overexpression enhanced the luciferase activity of the wild-type LPAR1 promoter, an effect amplified by the demethylating agent 5-AZA (p < 0.05). The EMSA further demonstrates the relationship between SP1 and the LPAR1 promoter region. Overexpression of SP1 upregulated LPAR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels (p < 0.05). Knockdown of LPAR1 reduced muscle marker gene expression and delayed myotube formation, while silencing SP1 disrupted the expression of LPAR1, MEF2C, and MHC1 (p < 0.05), and the demethylation induced by 5-AZA partially reversed these effects. These findings suggest that the DNA methylation/SP1/LPAR1 axis is critical for skeletal muscle growth and development, underscoring the regulatory role of DNA methylation in muscle formation.

AB  - BackgroundAge at puberty is an important factor affecting goat fertility, with endocrine and genetic factors playing a crucial role in the onset of puberty. To better understand the relationship between endocrine and genetic factors and mechanisms underlying puberty onset in goats, reproductive hormone levels were analyzed by ELISA and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-multistage/mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing was performed to analyze ovarian genes.ResultsSerum follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, 11-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, cortisone, and cortisol levels were found to be higher but progesterone were lower in pubertal goats as compared to those in prepubertal goats (P < 0.05). A total of 18,139 genes were identified in cDNA libraries, and 75 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (|log(2) fold change|>= 1, P <= 0.05), of which 32 were significantly up- and 43 were down-regulated in pubertal goats. Gene ontology enrichment analyses indicated that DEGs were mainly involved in "metabolic process," "signaling," "reproduction," and "growth." Further, DEGs were significantly enriched in 91 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, including estrogen signaling pathway, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and cAMP signaling pathway. Bioinformatics analysis showed that PRLR and THBS1 were highly expressed in pubertal ovaries, and ZP3, ZP4, and ASTL showed low expression, suggesting their involvement in follicular development and lutealization.ConclusionsTo summarize, serum hormone changes and ovarian DEGs expression were investigated in our study. Further studies are warranted to comprehensively explore the functions of DEGs in goat puberty.

AB  - (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the main active component of tea polyphenols, has been less studied in Litopenaeus vannamei. Therefore, the potential benefits of EGCG on L. vannamei were explored in this experiment. L. vannamei were fed diets containing EGCG (0, 0.5, and 1.0 g/kg). At the end of the 60-day farming experiment, metabolomics, transcriptomics, quantitative real-time PCR assays, and tissue sections were used to assess and explore the effects of EGCG on growth, antioxidant capacity, and immunity. It was found that the best growth and genes expressions related to antioxidant, anti-stress, apoptosis, and immunity were observed in the group with 0.5 g/kg EGCG. The analysis of hepatopancreatic metabolomics and transcriptomics results revealed bumper differential metabolites and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with nutrient metabolism, digestion, immunity, and environmental adaptation. Many metabolites with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant activities have been identified. A large number of DEGs were enriched in apoptosis, Rap1 signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, hippo signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, and signaling pathways related to amino acid and lipid metabolism. In conclusion, dietary 0.5 g/kg EGCG was beneficial for growth, resistance to oxidative stress, and immunity in L. vannamei. The improvement of the properties was attributed to the modulation of signaling pathways, metabolites abundance and genes expressions related to the above properties by EGCG.

AB  - Simple Summary The worldwide waste problem has large environmental impacts and huge efforts have been made to mitigate this problem. Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae (BSFL) were proposed as an efficient way to get rid of organic waste, acting by converting the waste into a protein- and lipid-rich biomass suitable for various purposes such as animal feed, biodiesel and chitin. This article studies larval growth and development and waste reduction and conversion indexes of BSFL when reared on six different waste streams and a control substrate (chicken feed): pig manure slurry mixed with roadside silage grass, the organic wet fraction of municipal household waste, secondary sludge from slaughter waste, fast food waste, mushroom stems and pig manure solids. In addition, the larval fatty acid profile and the chemical composition of the frass were also analyzed. The larval growth as well as the waste reduction index and the efficiency of conversion of ingested substrate were highest in the fast food waste (FFW) substrate. The larvae reared on FFW had high fat content and produced fat-rich frass with high dry matter content. Slaughter waste, pig manure and mushroom stems also showed good potential for bioconversion and led to protein-rich larvae. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are considered a commercially viable solution for global organic waste problems. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of rearing BSFL on a wide range of low-value waste streams and its potential to transform them into high-quality animal feed and fertilizer. Six waste streams of different origins were selected and each tested in triplicate. Several parameters were analysed: growth performance, waste reduction index (WRI), conversion efficiency (ECI) and larval composition. Frass composition was also analysed. Larvae reared on fast food waste (FFW) had the highest ECI and WRI and the lowest values when reared on pig manure slurry mixed with silage grass (PMLSG) and slaughter waste (SW). The highest protein content was found for larvae reared on mushroom stems (MS) although this substrate had the lowest protein content. Moreover, the frass nutritional profile was proportionally related to the substrate's nutritional profile: the protein-rich substrate (SW) resulted in protein-rich frass and the low-protein substrate (MS) resulted in protein-poor frass. The same was true for the lipid content. In conclusion, this study showed that BSFL can be successfully reared on a wide range of waste streams that can affect the larval and frass chemical compositions.

AB  - Farm animals can socially learn to trust a human after observing that human handling a familiar conspecific gently, even if they never positively interacted with the human themselves. This study aimed to evaluate whether pigs are reassured by a human during a stressful challenge, having previously acquired a positive perception of the human by witnessing the gentle handling of a high or low socially ranked conspecific. Additionally, the effectiveness of reducing pigs' stress response based on the degree of human familiarity was examined. Seventyfive pigs (21 days old, 5.6 +/- 0.2 kg) housed in 15 nursery pens (5 pigs/pen) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (5 pens/treatment): Dominant Demonstrator Group (DDG), Subordinate Demonstrator Group (SDG), and Control Group (CG). Pigs from DDG and SDG observed a high or low socially ranked conspecific ("demonstrator"), respectively, while the demonstrator received gentle handling consisting of stroking for 10 minutes and a sucrose solution twice a day for 5 weeks. The CG received minimal human contact required for feeding, cleaning, and health examination. Following the treatment period, pig behavior was evaluated in response to a familiar (handlers involved in treatments) or an unfamiliar person (unknown human) in a social support test, consisting of physical restraint in a cage for 3 minutes while the person provided stroking, followed by the release of the animal into a test pen for 1 minute. Data were analyzed using a mixed linear model in R Software. Post-hoc comparisons were conducted using the Tukey test. Both DDG (P = 0.009) and SDG pigs (P = 0.005) showed a greater frequency of behavioral reactions reflecting restlessness when tested with an unfamiliar human compared to a familiar human, whereas CG pigs exhibited no differences (P = 0.74). Moreover, when tested with their familiar human, DDG (P = 0.0001) and SDG pigs (P = 0.001) remained calm for longer compared to CG. When pigs were released from the cage by their familiar human, SDG (P = 0.0006) and DDG pigs (P = 0.001) contacted the human sooner compared to CG. Subordinate demonstrator group (P = 0.0007) and DDG (P < 0.0001) pigs also spent more time investigating the familiar human in comparison to CG. No differences in behavioral reactions based on the demonstrator's social rank were observed. In conclusion, the positive perception of humans acquired by pigs through social learning persists in aversive situations and can lead to positive reassurance by familiar humans during stressful events.

AB  - Due to the favorable climatic and ecological conditions offered by Colombian ecosystems, the hippo population introduced into the country in the 1980s has increased and now it has spread from the middle valley of the Magdalena River in Antioquia to the Momp & oacute;s Depression in Bol & iacute;var. Recently, the Colombian government declared it as an invasive species for its negative effects on the ecosystems and people's lives and livelihoods. In this context, we conducted a demographic study to estimate the population size and structure, describe its spatial distribution, and project the population dynamics into the future. We used direct and indirect records to estimate a population of at least 181 hippos distributed in seven groups, five in advanced stages of biological invasion. Given their current structure and size, the hippo population will reach 1,000 individuals around 2040 if no urgent eradication actions are taken.

AB  - Traditional and folk medicine has used the placenta to treat a wide range of ailments. Fatigue is one of the frequent physiological reactions resulting from hard physical and mental work or severe life stress. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of sheep placental extract (SPE) on memory and exercise performance in aged mice. Senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) was used as an ageing model and mice were fed with 3 (low, medium, and high) doses of SPE. Passive and active avoidance tests were performed to assess the memory function, treadmill exercise, forelimb grip strength test, liver glycogen and serum lactate were measured to assess the exercise performance. The memory of the aged mice was improved after SPE administration. Further, SPE treatment increased exercise performance by increasing forelimb grip strength and liver glycogen levels and decreasing serum lactate levels. To conclude, feeding sheep placental extract improves learning, memory, and exercise performance in ageing mice.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the probiotic potential of autochthonous Lactobacillus species isolated from buffalo calves against multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli . A total of 252 rectal swabs were collected from healthy neonatal buffalo calves under 30 days old from six districts of Andhra Pradesh, India in a completely randomized design from August 2019 to August 2021, of which 190 Lactobacillus strains were isolated based on cultural, morphological, biochemical and molecular tests. Out of 190 isolates, 57 showed high levels of auto-aggregation (> 80.00%) and hydrophobicity (> 60.00%) and 51 of the 57 isolates had a zone of inhibition greater than 15.00 mm in diameter against multidrug-resistant E. coli in an Agar well diffusion assay. Among the 51 isolates, 36 were found to be acid and bile tolerant and showed varying levels of sensitivity to antibiotics such as erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Among the 36 isolates, Limosilactobacillus reuteri 178 , L. reuteri 209 , L. fermentum 182 , L. fermentum 211 , and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 34 were non-hemolytic, and none of the isolates were able to hydrolyse gelatine. Therefore, these five autochthonous Lactobacillus species may be used in probiotic or synbiotic formulations against multidrug resistant E. coli in buffalo calves. (c) 2024 Urmia University.

AB  - Given the global biodiversity crisis, there is an urgent need for new tools to monitor populations of endangered marine megafauna, like sharks. To this end, Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) stand as the most effective tools for estimating shark abundance, measured using the MaxN metric. However, a bottleneck exists in manually computing MaxN from extensive BRUVS video data. Although artificial intelligence methods are capable of solving this problem, their effectiveness is tested using AI metrics such as the F-measure, rather than ecologically informative metrics employed by ecologists, such as MaxN. In this study, we present both an automated and a semi-automated deep learning approach designed to produce the MaxN abundance metric for three distinct reef shark species: the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus), and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus). Our approach was applied to one-hour baited underwater videos recorded in New Caledonia (South Pacific). Our fully automated model achieved F-measures of 0.85, 0.43, and 0.72 for the respective three species. It also generated MaxN abundance values that showed a high correlation with manually derived data for C. amblyrhynchos (R = 0.88). For the two other species, correlations were significant but weak (R = 0.35-0.44). Our semi-automated method significantly enhanced Fmeasures to 0.97, 0.86, and 0.82, resulting in high-quality MaxN abundance estimations while drastically reducing the video processing time. To our knowledge, we are the first to estimate MaxN with a deep-learning approach. In our discussion, we explore the implications of this novel tool and underscore its potential to produce innovative metrics for estimating fish abundance in videos, thereby addressing current limitations and paving the way for comprehensive ecological assessments.

AB  - Simple Summary Given that wild animal hospitalisations are increasing, veterinary knowledge of wildlife medicine needs to be improved along with more effective clinical and diagnostic procedures. A blood test can be a quick and minimally invasive way of gathering useful clinical information. This study evaluates the haematological and biochemical parameters in injured roe deer and discusses their values in relation to animal hospitalisation outcomes. The study was conducted on a cohort of 98 roe deer divided into groups based on age and hospitalisation outcome. A panel of haematological and biochemical parameters was performed for each animal. Significant differences were found within both the unweaned and weaned groups. Creatine kinase, creatinine, and bilirubin may be useful indicators to correlate with the severity of trauma. Veterinary facility admissions of wild animals are increasing alongside the interest in wildlife diseases. To improve animal welfare, it is therefore important to increase veterinarians' knowledge of wild animal medicine and to improve the clinical and diagnostic procedures, especially in the case of patients affected by trauma or multiple traumas. Blood analysis can be a quick and minimally invasive way of gathering useful clinical information for adequate treatment and management, and, together with a good clinical examination, to help predict hospitalisation outcomes. Few papers have reported reference ranges for the haematological and biochemical parameters of roe deer. This study evaluates the haematological and biochemical parameters in traumatised roe deer in relation to animal hospitalisation outcomes. The study was carried out on a cohort of 98 roe deer divided into groups according to their age and hospitalisation outcome. For each animal, a panel of haematological and biochemical parameters was performed. Significant differences were found between unweaned (<4 months old) groups in terms of MCV, MCH, CK, creatinine, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin, and between weaned (>4 months old) groups for total bilirubin. Creatine kinase, creatinine, and bilirubin may be useful indicators to correlate with the severity of trauma and help predict prognosis.

AB  - Brown blight, as the most damaging and common foliar disease of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) in China, has been recently reported to be caused by different species of the genus Colletotrichum. During the years 2016 to 2017, tea plants in commercial tea cultivation areas of Chongqing City that reported significant incidences of brown blight disease were investigated and then analyzed using both morphological characteristics and multilocus phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that at least five species of Colletotrichum were identified, including four well-known species (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. camelliae, C. fioriniae, and C. karstii) and one novel species (C. chongqingense), indicating that there is remarkable species diversity in Colletotrichum spp. present as pathogens. Results of pathogenicity analyses confirmed that C. chongqingense was the causal agent of brown blight and different isolates differed in virulence. C. chongqingense, as a novel pathogen, has never been reported as being associated with brown blight disease in tea plants or anthracnose in other host plants anywhere in the world. Knowledge of the Colletotrichum populations will facilitate further studies addressing the relationships between Colletotrichum spp. and their host plant Camellia sinensis.

AB  - Resources, such as nitrogen, are widely hypothesized to underlie the expression and evolution of plant defenses to herbivory. However, resource availability can affect selection on plant defense traits in contrasting ways: resource availability can 1) weaken selection on defense traits by reducing the costs of herbivory, or 2) strengthen selection on defense traits by increasing herbivore pressure. Previous studies have compared herbivore resistance in populations across natural resource gradients to infer how resource availability affects the microevolution of plant defenses. However, because these studies do not manipulate resource availability, they are unable to directly test the effects of resources of plant defense trait evolution. We used a three-decade-long nitrogen fertilization field experiment to test how nitrogen availability affects the evolution of an architectural plant defense trait: stem nodding in Solidago altissima. Stem nodding is a genetic dimorphism that helps plants to evade apex-galling herbivores. By comparing the frequency of defensive nodding versus erect morphs in experimentally fertilized or unfertilized plots 27, 32 and 33 years post-treatment initiation, we assessed how nitrogen addition affects the evolution of this defense trait. We found that the defensive nodding morph was 3-6 times more common in plots that evolved under nitrogen fertilization compared to those that evolved in unfertilized control plots. This study provides empirical evidence for resource availability driving plant defense evolution and demonstrates that this evolution can occur on time-scales conducive to study at many long-term nutrient fertilization experiments.

AB  - The formation of hydrides, a result from excess hydrogen uptake by the cladding during nuclear reactor operation, can significantly impact cladding integrity. We present a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a hydrogen predictive model in the BISON fuel performance code to characterize the key input parame-ters involved in the model. This includes identifying the key parameters necessary to simulate hydrogen behavior in the fuel cladding, revealing the impact of environmental conditions on hydrogen distribution, and informing the envelope of conditions for ongoing experimental work conducted by the University of Michigan. The Sobol sensitivity analysis reveals the quantitative impacts of environmental conditions on the predicted total hydrogen concentration, as well as the respective impact on their sensitivity with respect to the physical parameters. Overall, the precipitation of hydrogen that occurred at the cold end of the sample is the most important phenomenon in the prediction of hydrogen concentration. The op-timization study using the results from sensitivity analysis indicates that the BISON simulations produce accurate hydrogen predictions when the sets of parametric ranges are shifted to enable more precip-itation to occur at the cold end. Lastly, the sensitivity and uncertainty (S/U) analysis for the ongoing benchmarking experiments supports the focus of experiments that lies on the measurement of Soret ef-fect of hydrogen driven by linear temperature gradients. The outputs are expected to better characterize the various parameters involved in the hydrogen transport model in the BISON code, and improve the un-derstanding of the hydrogen transport behaviors in zirconium-based fuel cladding in a range of expected environmental conditions.

AB  - Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) represent a readily accessible and important source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) capable of multilineage differentiation. The Hippo signaling pathway effector YAP has emerged as a pivotal regulator of stem cell fate, yet the specific molecular mechanism by which it modulates lipogenic differentiation of ADSCs has not been clearly defined. In this study, goat ADSCs (gADSCs) isolated from Albas goats in Inner Mongolia were used to investigate the role of YAP1 in adipogenic differentiation. Overexpression of YAP1 significantly promoted the differentiation of ADSCs into adipocytes, an effect accompanied by up-regulation of LATS2 and activation of the negative feedback loop of the Hippo signaling pathway. Elevated LATS2 expression induced YAP phosphorylation, leading to reduced nuclear levels of YAP and TAZ and their subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm. YAP1 overexpression up-regulated LATS2 expression, which, in turn, enhanced the adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs. This pro-adipogenic effect of YAP1 was dependent on LATS2 kinase activity. These findings indicate that overexpression of YAP1 promotes ADSC adipogenesis by inducing LATS2 expression and activating the Hippo pathway negative feedback loop. Elucidating the molecular role of YAP in ADSC lipogenic differentiation holds great significance for regulating stem cell fate, treating metabolic disorders, and promoting hair follicle growth.

AB  - Climatic variations adversely affect the limited water resources of earth which leads to water stress and influences agricultural production worldwide. Therefore, a novel approach has been introduced to improve the tolerance against water stress in herbaceous nature medicinal plants such as Coriandrum sativum by the usage of nanotechnology (foliar applied nanoparticles of ZnOx) coupled with the application of water deficit irrigation. This is an alternative water saving strategy that proved to be efficient to mitigate the Coriandrum sativum tolerance against water stress regimes for sustainable yield production through the activation of antioxidant system. Thus, the phenomena of green synthesis have been deployed for the formation of Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnOx NPs) from the leaf extract of Camellia sinensis L. and zinc acetate dihydrate was used as precursor. Different techniques have been used for the thorough study and confirmation of ZnOx NPs such as UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-vis) X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Elemental dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The prepared ZnOx NPs exhibit hexagonal wurtzite crystal nature has an average size of 37 nm with high purity. These ZnOx NPs have been further studied for their role in amelioration of water stress tolerance in Coriandrum sativum in a pot experiment. Two levels of water stress regimes were employed, IR75 (moderate) and IR50 (Intense) to evaluate the behavior of plant compared to full irrigation (FI). Results showed that under water stress regimes, the 100 ppm of prepared NPs stimulate the antioxidant system by increasing the activity of catalases (CAT), super oxidases (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) enzymes and found the maximum at IR50, while the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased due to increase in activity of antioxidative enzymes. Furthermore, chlorophyll content and amount of proline also enhanced by the foliar application of prepared ZnOx NPs under moderate water stress (IR75). The results suggested that all the investigated agronomic attributes significantly increased, including plant biomass and economic yield (EY), compared to non-treated ZnOx NPs plants, except for the number of primary branches and LAI. Further, the 100 ppm of prepared ZnOx NPs have great potential to improve water stress tolerance in Coriandrum sativum by improving the antioxidant enzymes activity that enhance agronomic attributes for high crop productivity that require further research at transcriptomic and genomic level.</p>

AB  - Milk samples of ewes' and goats' unprocessed milk were collected from milk tanks from various farms in Epirus, Greece and classified in two groups according to the type of farming. Analyses of the samples included microbial inhibition assays to detect the presence of antibiotic residues, isolation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli strains as microbiological indicators for susceptibility to antimicrobial medicines, Somatic Cells and Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CNS) counts. These findings were correlated with each other as well as to the stage of the lactation period and to the type of the farming practices. Monitoring of bulk tank milk for residues of antibiotics should be performed after heating of the milk, on a regular basis, and should include at least two different tests. The results point out that the type of farming affects the CNS counts as well as the prevalence of residues in the milk. Furthermore, the inverse correlation between CNS counts and prevalence of residues of antibiotics suggests a possible protective role of CNS. Resistance of the bacterial indicators to antibiotics was random and relatively rare, perhaps acquired in past due to misuse of antibiotics, turning the indicator microorganisms to reservoir of resistance.

AB  - Low temperature is a limiting environmental factor that impairs the growth, yield and quality of tea plants. Fatty acids desaturations (FADs) play a key role in mediating membrane fluidity in response to various abiotic stresses; however, the intrinsic mechanisms underlying FAD-mediated alleviation of cold stress in tea plants are poorly understood. In this study, cold stress exposure significantly increased the content of C18:2 (linoleic acid) in two tea varieties contrasting in cold tolerance (cold-tolerant Longjin43 and cold-sensitive Huangjinye). Three different cDNA sequences, designated CsFAD2, CsFAD5 and CsFAD6, encoding omega-6 FADs that are involved in the response to cold stress were isolated from tea. Yeast experiments further demonstrated that CsFAD2, CsFAD5 and CsFAD6 can convert C18:1 to C18:2. Ectopic expression of CsFAD2, CsFAD5 and CsFAD6 in Arabidopsis seedlings and plants enhanced cold tolerance in pot experiments. Interestingly, CsFAD2-or CsFAD5-silenced tea leaves were more sensitive to cold acclimation than CsFAD6-silenced leaves, and CsFAD2/5-silenced leaves affected cold tolerance more than CsFAD2/6-or CsFAD5/6 -silenced leaves, suggesting that CsFAD2 and CsFAD5 were more important than CsFAD6 in cold acclimation-dependent cold tolerance. Taken together, our results suggest that C18:2 is an important component associated with cold stress and CsFAD2 and CsFAD5 contribute more than CsFAD6 to cold tolerance.

AB  - Early-life attachment disruption appears to sensitize neuroinflammatory signaling to increase later vulnerability for stress-related mental disorders, including depression. How stress initiates this process is unknown, but studies with adult rats and mice suggest sympathetic nervous system activation and/or cortisol elevations during the early stress are key. Guinea pig pups isolated from their mothers exhibit an initial active behavioral phase characterized by anxiety-like vocalizing. This is followed by inflammatory-dependent depressive-like behavior and fever that sensitize on repeated isolation. Using strategies that have been successful in adult studies, we assessed whether sympathetic nervous system activity and cortisol contributed to the sensitization process in guinea pig pups. In Experiment 1, the adrenergic agonist ephedrine (3 or 10 mg/kg), either alone or with cortisol (2.5 mg/kg), did not increase depressive-like behavior or fever during initial isolation the following day as might have been expected to if this stimulation was sufficient to account for the sensitization process. In Experiment 2, both depressive-like behavior and fever sensitized with repeated isolation, but beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol (10 or 20 mg/kg) did not affect either of these responses or their sensitization. The high dose of propranolol did, however, reduce vocalizing. These results suggest sympathetic nervous system activation is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce the presumptive neuroinflammatory signaling underlying sensitization of depressive-like behavioral or febrile responses in developing guinea pigs. Thus, processes mediating sensitization of neuroinflammatory-based depressive-like behavior following early-life attachment disruption in this model appear to differ from those previously found to underlie neuroinflammatory priming in adults.

AB  - Simple Summary: Weaning causes a breakdown of intestinal barrier function and thus easily induces diarrhea in pigs. Establishing a proper cell model is helpful for exploring the underlying mechanisms and for rapidly exploiting new feed additives on a large scale. An LPS-induced immune-stressed IPI-2I cell model for piglets was generated and the regulatory effects of TTO on inflammatory injury were studied. The results showed that 50 mu g/mL LPS stimulated for 6 h can be used to establish an immune-stressed cell model in IPI-2I cell lines, and 0.03% TTO treatment for 6 h alleviated inflammatory injury in the intestinal epithelial cells of pigs. In addition, TTO might suppress the inflammatory injury to intestinal epithelial cells caused by LPS stimulation through TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling. Tea tree oil (TTO) improves the intestinal mucosal immunity of weaning piglets, but its underlying mechanism is not clear. We hypothesized that TTO may alleviate inflammatory injury by regulating the function of intestinal epithelial cells. Ileum epithelial cells (IPI-2I) were chosen and an inflammatory injury cell model was generated. The cell viability, cytokine secretion, and gene expression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B were measured to further evaluate the effects of TTO on the inflammatory injury in immune-stressed cells. The results showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS; content: >= 30 mu g/mL; time: 3 h, 6 h, or 9 h) decreased cell viability (p < 0.01), and 50 mu g/mL LPS stimulated for 6 h resulted in an increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and a dramatically decreased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (p < 0.05) in IPI-2I cells. Concentrations of 0-0.05% of TTO improved cell viability, while the 0.03% TTO treatment resulted in the highest cell viability and alleviated LPS-induced cell death (p < 0.01). In addition, 0.03% TTO alleviated the LPS-induced increase in the gene expression of IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, and IFN gamma, as well as the decrease in the expression of IL-10 in IPI-2I cells (p < 0.05). LPS also upregulated the gene expression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B (p < 0.05); while TTO supplementation alleviated this effect (p < 0.05), 0.03% and 0.05% TTO supplementation had greater effects (p < 0.05). In conclusion, 50 mu g/mL LPS stimulated for 6 h can be used to establish an immune-stressed cell model in IPI-2I cell lines, and 0.03% TTO treatment for 6 h alleviated inflammatory injury in the intestinal epithelial cells of pigs.

AB  - Plant specialised metabolites constitute a layer of chemical defence. Classes of the defence compounds are often restricted to a certain taxon of plants, e.g. benzoxazinoids (BX) are characteristically detected in grasses. BXs confer wide-range defence by controlling herbivores and microbial pathogens and are allelopathic compounds. In the crops maize, wheat and rye high concentrations of BXs are synthesised at an early developmental stage. By transfer of six Bx-genes (Bx1 to Bx5 and Bx8) it was possible to establish the biosynthesis of 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4benzoxazin-3-one glucoside (GDIBOA) in a concentration of up to 143 nmol/g dry weight in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results indicate that inefficient channeling of substrates along the pathway and metabolisation of intermediates in host plants might be a general drawback for transgenic establishment of specialised metabolite biosynthesis pathways. As a consequence, BX levels required for defence are not obtained in Arabidopsis. We could show that indolin-2-one (ION), the first specific intermediate, is phytotoxic and is metabolised by hydroxylation and glycosylation by a wide spectrum of plants. In Arabidopsis, metabolic stress due to the enrichment of ION leads to elevated levels of salicylic acid (SA) and in addition to its intrinsic phytotoxicity, ION affects plant morphology indirectly via SA. We could show that Bx3 has a crucial role in the evolution of the pathway, first based on its impact on flux into the pathway and, second by C3-hydroxylation of the phytotoxic ION. Thereby BX3 interferes with a supposedly generic detoxification system towards the non-specific intermediate.

AB  - After a long period of adaptive evolution, Tibetan sheep have adapted to the plateau environment in terms of genetics, physiology and biochemistry, but the mechanism of hypoxia adaptation has not been fully elucidated, and the functional genes and molecular mechanisms regulating the hypoxia adaptation of Tibetan sheep need to be further studied. In this study, Tibetan sheep were selected as the research object, and the mRNA expression levels of the hypoxa-related gene EPO in heart, lung, kidney, liver, spleen and longissimus dorsi muscle of Hu sheep (100 m) and Tibetan sheep at different altitudes (2500 m, 3500 m, 4500 m) were assessed by RT-qPCR. The SNPs loci were detected by sequencing and Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) technology, then the correlation between genetic polymorphism and blood gas was analyzed. The results show that the expression of the EPO gene was the highest in the kidney, indicating that the expression of EPO gene had tissue differences. The expression levels of the EPO gene in the heart, lung and liver of Tibetan sheep at a 4500 m altitude were significantly higher than those in Hu sheep (p < 0.05), and the levels in the hearts of Tibetan sheep increased with the increase in altitude. Three mutations were identified in the EPO gene, the SNPs (g.855 A > C) in exon 1 and the SNPs (g.1985 T > G and g.2115 G > C) in exon 4, which were named EPO-SNP1, EPO-SNP2 and EPO-SNP3, respectively, and all three SNPs showed three genotypes. Correlation analysis showed that g.2115 G > C sites were significantly correlated with pO(2) (p < 0.05), and haplotype combinations were significantly correlated with pO(2) (p < 0.05). Thesee results suggest that the expression of the EPO gene is altitude-differentiated and organ-differentiated, and the EPO gene variants have significant effects on pO2, which may be beneficial to the adaptation of Tibetan sheep to hypoxia stress.

AB  - Land spreading of animal manure is an essential process in agriculture. Despite the importance of grassland in global food security the potential of the grass phyllosphere as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is unknown. Ad-ditionally, the comparative risk associated with different manure sources is unclear. Due to the One Health nature of AMR there is an urgent need to fully understand the risk associated with AMR at the agriculture -environmental nexus. We performed a grassland field study to assess and compare the relative and temporal impact of bovine, swine and poultry manure application on the grass phyllosphere and soil microbiome and resistome over a period of four months, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR). The soil and grass phyllosphere contained a diverse range of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Manure treatment was found to introduce ARGs belonging to clinically important antimicrobial classes, such as aminoglycoside and sulphonamide into grass and soil. Temporal analysis of ARGs and MGEs associated with manure treatment indicated ARGs patterns were similar across the different manure types in the manure treated soil and grass phyllosphere. Manure treatment resulted in the enrichment in members of the indigenous microbiota and the introduction of manure associated bacteria, with this impact extending past the recommended six-week exclusion period. However, these bacteria were in low relative abundance and manure treatment was not found to significantly impact the overall composition of the microbiome or resistome. This provides evidence that the current guidelines fa-cilitate reduction of biological risk to livestock. Additionally, in soil and grass samples MGEs correlated with ARGs from clinically important antimicrobial classes, indicating the key role MGEs play in horizontal gene transfer in agri-cultural grassland. These results demonstrate the role of the grass phyllosphere as an under-studied sink of AMR.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) content has become an important determinant of meat quality for raisers and consumers in modern society. The objective of this work was to investigate the roles of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and fatty acid metabolism signaling pathways in determining the IMF contentin the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of pigs. The expression profile of candidate genes involved in the PPAR and fatty acid metabolism signaling pathways were detected in the LD muscle of two pig breeds with different IMF contents (Large White and Min) by a quantitative real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) array. Our results showed that three lipid metabolismrelated biological processes lipogenesis, fatty acid transport and fatty acid oxidation in these two pathways showed significant differences in activation between Large White and Min pigs. The activation of the PPAR and fatty acid metabolism signaling pathways may play a positive role in reducing IMF content in pigs.

AB  - (1) Background: Mannheimia haemolytica (M. haemolytica) is an opportunistic pathogen and is mainly associated with respiratory diseases in cattle, sheep, and goats. (2) Methods: In this study, a mouse infection model was established using a M. haemolytica strain isolated from goats. Histopathological observations were conducted on various organs of the mice, and bacterial load determination and RNA-seq analysis were specifically performed on the spleens of the mice. (3) Results: The findings of this study suggest that chemokines, potentially present in the spleen of mice following a M. haemolytica challenge, may induce the migration of leukocytes to the spleen and suppress the release of pro-inflammatory factors through a negative feedback regulation mechanism. Additionally, an interesting observation was made regarding the potential of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells congregating in the spleen to differentiate into immune cells, which could potentially collaborate with leukocytes in their efforts to counteract M. haemolytica invasion. (4) Conclusions: This study revealed the immune regulation mechanism induced by M. haemolytica in the mouse spleen, providing valuable insights into host-pathogen interactions and offering a theoretical basis for the prevention, control, and treatment of mannheimiosis.

AB  - Analysis of the dosimetric parameters of internal irradiation and biological effects in monogastric animals (rats, guinea pigs, pigs) caused by orally received "hot" radioactive particles causing ulcerative necrotic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract is presented. Mathematical models of particle transport and the formation of absorbed doses in the digestive tract have been developed. The features of the deep distribution of absorbed doses in the mucous membrane depending on the spectral characteristics of beta-radiation of radionuclides that are part of silicate particles are given. It is shown that the main factors in the formation of ulcerative lesions of the digestive tract were the uneven distribution of particles in the contents and the concentration of particles in certain areas of the mucous membrane, followed by the formation of high local dose loads. The dosimetric scale of extremely severe, severe, moderate, and mild acute radiation ulcerative gastroenterocolitis is proposed, which allows extrapolating the results of model experiments on scenarios of radioactive contamination of the environment by particles of various genesis. The results obtained can be taken into account in the tasks of radiation safety.

AB  - Three catch crop species, ryegrass, forage rape and black oat, were grown between successive rotations of maize to reduce nitrogen leaching due to maize fertilization with digested dairy manure. Catch crops showed a high nutrient uptake, but with a wide range, depending on the year and the specie. Ensiling was shown to be a feasible storing method increasing catch crop methane production per hectare between 14-36% compared with fresh catch crop. In semi-continuous co-digestion experiments, methane production was increased between 35-48%, in comparison with anaerobic digestion of dairy manure alone. Catch crops were shown to be a good co-substrate, being a sustainable option to prevent leaching of nutrients to the environment, thus closing the loops from production to utilization by optimal recycling measures.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) loss caused by the irrational use of manure organic fertilizer has become a worldwide envi-ronmental problem, which has caused a potential threat to water safety and intensified agricultural non-point source pollution. Hydrothermal carbonization is method with a low-energy consumption and high efficiency to deal with environmental problems. Application of pig manure-derived hydrochar (PMH) to soil exhibited potential of sustainable development compared with the pristine pig manure (PM). However, the effects of PMH on the distribution of P among the fractions/forms and the interaction between microorganisms and P forms and its relevance to the potential loss of P in paddy fields has not been clarified. Therefore, in this study, a soil column experiment was conducted using the untreated soil (control), and the PM, PMH1 (PMH derived at 180 degrees C), and PMH2 (PMH derived at 260 degrees C) treated soils (at the dose of 0.05 %) and rice was cultivated to investigate the effects of PM and PMH on the P fractions, mobilization, ad potential loss via the induced changes on soil mi-crobial community after a complete growing season of rice. The trend of P utilization was evaluated by P speciation via continuous extraction and 31P NMR. The addition of PMH reduced the proportion of residual P in soil by 23.8-26.3 %, and increased the proportion of HCl-P and orthophosphate by 116.2-158.6 % and 6.1-6.8 % compared to PM. The abundance of gcd gene developed after the application of PMH2, which enhanced the mobile forms of soil P utilization via secreting gluconic acid. The network diagram analysis concluded that the changes in various P forms were mainly related to Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria. The results illustrated that PMH mitigate the potential risk of P loss more than PM by altering P fractions and affecting soil microbial community.

AB  - Fatty acid composition is a key factor affecting the flavor and quality of goat milk. CircRNAs are now recognized as important regulators of transcription, and they play an important role in the control of fatty acid synthesis. Thus, understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling this process in ruminant mammary glands is of great significance. In the present study, mammary tissue from dairy goats during early lactation and the dry period (nonlactating) were collected and used for high-throughput sequencing. Compared to levels during the dry period, the expression level of circ003429 during early lactation was lower (12.68-fold downregulated). In isolated goat mammary epithelial cells, circ003429 inhibited the synthesis of triglycerides (TAG) and decreased the content of unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1, C18:1, and C18:2), indicating that this circRNA plays an important role in regulating lipid synthesis. A binding site for miR-199a-3p in the circ003429 sequence was detected, and a dual-luciferase reporter system revealed that circ003429 targets miR-199a-3p. Overexpression of circ003429 (pcDNA-circ003429) downregulated the abundance of miR-199a-3p. In contrast, overexpression of miR-199a-3p increased TAG content and decreased mRNA abundance of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) (a target gene of miR-199a-3p), and TAG content was decreased and mRNA abundance was increased in response to overexpression of circ003429. These results indicate that circ003429 alleviates the inhibitory effect of miR-199a-3p on the mRNA abundance of YAP1 by binding miR-199a-3p, resulting in subsequent regulation of the synthesis of TAG and unsaturated fatty acids.

AB  - 1. Grasses have developed a wide range of morphological and physiological mechanisms to resist herbivory. For instance, they accumulate silicon (Si) in tissue, as physical defence, and associate symbiotically with foliar Epichloe-endophytes that provide chemical defence via antiherbivore alkaloids. Recent evidence showed that some Epichloe-endophytes increase foliar Si in forage grasses; however, whether this impacts insect herbivores is unknown. Furthermore, while Si is primarily a physical defence, it also affects production of plant defensive secondary metabolites; Si supply might therefore affect Epichloe-alkaloids, although this remains untested.
   2. We grew endophyte-free (Nil) and Epichloe-infected tall fescue and perennial ryegrass in a factorial combination with or without Si supplementation, in the absence or presence of Helicoverpa armigera. Epichloe-endophyte strains were AR584 for tall fescue, and AR37, AR1 or Wild-type (WT) for perennial ryegrass. We assessed how Si supply and Epichloe-endophytes in interaction with herbivory affected foliar Si and mutualist-derived alkaloid concentrations. Subsequently, their effects on H. armigera relative growth rates (RGRs) were evaluated.
   3. Endophytes generally increased Si concentrations in Si-supplied plants. In tall fescue AR584 and perennial ryegrass AR37, endophytes increased constitutive ( herbivore-free) and induced (herbivore-inoculated) Si concentrations by at least 25%; in contrast, in perennial ryegrass, the AR1 endophyte only increased constitutive levels. Si supply did not affect alkaloids produced by AR584 or AR1/WT endophytes; however, in the presence of herbivory, Si supply decreased the induction of alkaloids produced by AR37 endophytes by 33%. For tall fescue, Si supply reduced H. armigera RGR by at least 76%, regardless of endophytic status, whereas, endophyte-alkaloids played a secondary role only reducing herbivore growth in the absence of Si supply. Conversely, in perennial ryegrass, both Si and endophyte-alkaloids (regardless of Si supply) reduced herbivore RGR although not synergised.
   4. Novel interactions between constitutive and induced Si-and alkaloid-based antiherbivore defences in grasses were observed. Overall, Si had a greater effect on the folivore than endophytes in both grasses. Endophyte defences contributed more to herbivore resistance in perennial ryegrass than tall fescue. We demonstrate that Si and endophytes were not antagonistic and highlight that the protective nature of their interaction varies with the grass-endophyte species tested.

AB  - Swine confinement buildings represent workplaces with high biological air pollution. It is suspected that individual components of inhalable air are causatives of chronic respiratory disease that are regularly detected among workers. In order to understand the relationship between exposure and stress, it is necessary to study the components of bioaerosols in more detail. For this purpose, bioaerosols from pig barns were collected on quartz filters and analysed via a combinatorial approach of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metaproteomics. The study reveals the presence of peptides from pigs, their feed and microorganisms. The proportion of fungal peptides detected is considered to be underrepresented compared to bacterial peptides. In addition, the metaproteomic workflow enabled functional predictions about the discovered peptides. Housekeeping proteins were found in particular, but also evidence for the presence of bacterial virulence factors (e.g., serralysin-like metalloprotease) as well as plant (e.g., chitinase) and fungal allergens (e.g., alt a10). Metaproteomic analyses can thus be used to identify factors that may be relevant to the health of pig farmers. Accordingly, such studies could be used in the future to assess the adverse health potential of an occupationally relevant bioaerosol and help consider defined protective strategies for workers.

AB  - Soot particles released in the atmosphere have long been investigated for their ability to affect the radiative forcing. Although freshly emitted soot particles are generally considered to yield only positive contributions to the radiative forcing, atmospheric aging can activate them into efficient cloud condensation or ice nuclei, which can trigger the formation of persistent clouds and ultimately provide a negative contribution to the radiative forcing. Depending on their residence time in the atmosphere, soot particles can undergo several physical and chemical aging processes that affect their chemical composition, particle size distribution and morphology, and ultimately their optical and hygroscopic properties. The impact of the physical-chemical aging on the properties of soot particles is still difficult to quantify, as well as their effect on the radiative forcing of the atmosphere.This work investigates the hygroscopic properties of chemically aged soot particles obtained from the combustion of aviation fuel, and in particular the interplay between aging mechanisms initiated by two widespread atmospheric oxidizers (O-3 and SO2). Activation is measured in water supersaturation conditions using a cloud condensation nuclei counter. Once particle morphology and size distribution are taken into account, the hygroscopicity parameter kappa is derived using kappa-K & ouml;hler theory and correlated to the change of the chemical composition of the particles aged in a simulation chamber. While fresh soot particles are poor cloud condensation nuclei (kappa < 10(-4)) and are not significantly affected by either O-3 or SO2 at the timescale of the experiments, rapid activation is observed when they are simultaneously exposed to both oxidizers. Activated particles become efficient cloud condensation nuclei, comparable to the highly hygroscopic particulate matter typically found in the atmosphere (kappa = 0.2-0.6 at RH = 20 %). Statistical analysis reveals a correlation between the activation and sulfur-containing ions detected on the chemically aged particles that are absent from the fresh particles.

AB  - In China, there is a renewed interest in traceability systems as an efficient tool to guarantee pork safety. One of the pathways through which a traceability system can benefit consumers is by easing information asymmetry. However, past literature on the traceability system in China pays more attention to theoretical analysis and less to empirical analysis. Using a large-scale survey of pig farms in China, we investigate the effects influencing farmers' participation in the traceability system. Findings show that a traceability system can influence the safety of pork indirectly through its impacts on farmers' production behaviors. Another important finding is that unsafe pork is a result of non-standard use of veterinary drugs, and the traceability system works well for farmers by pushing them to take stricter safety measurements.

AB  - Simple Summary Neonatal diarrhea is a major cause of economic losses in the swine industry worldwide and has significant impact in Spain, which is one of the biggest pork producers globally. Multiple infectious agents can contribute to this condition, with some viruses such as species A rotavirus (RVA) playing a major role. Studies on their occurrence and genetic diversity are essential for development of RVA vaccines. In this study, fecal samples from diarrheic suckling piglets originating from farms distributed throughout Spain were analyzed for RVA and four other common enteric pathogens using molecular methods. The individual prevalence was 89.4%, 64.4%, 44.9%, 33.7% and 4.4% for Clostridium perfringens, Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile, species A rotavirus, species C rotavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, respectively. Most specimens (96.9%) were positive for at least one of the target pathogens and concurrent infections were common. The molecular characterization of RVA positive specimens of specific genes used for genotyping revealed the extensive genetic diversity of RVA strains circulating in swine herds in Spain. Comparison with genotypes contained in the commercial vaccine available in Spain showed differences in the identity of the predominant RVA genotypes from diarrheic piglets in the sampled pig farms. These findings contribute to the surveillance of RVA strains circulating in swine herds in Spain and may help optimize target vaccine design. Species A rotavirus (RVA) is a major viral pathogen causing diarrhea in suckling piglets. Studies on its genetic heterogeneity have implications for vaccine efficacy in the field. In this study, fecal samples (n = 866) from diarrheic piglets younger than 28 days were analyzed over a two-year period (2018-2019). Samples were submitted from 426 farms located in 36 provinces throughout Spain and were tested using real-time PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) for five enteric pathogens. The individual prevalence was 89.4%, 64.4%, 44.9%, 33.7% and 4.4% for Clostridium perfringens, Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile, species A rotavirus, species C rotavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, respectively. Most specimens (96.9%) were positive for at least one of the target pathogens, and more than 80% of samples harbored mixed infections. Nucleotide sequencing of 70 specimens positive for RVA revealed the presence of the VP7 genotypes G4, G9, G3, G5, G11 and the VP4 genotypes P7, P23, P6 and P13, with the combinations G4P7 and G9P23 being the most prevalent, and especially in the areas with the highest pig population. The study shows the extensive genetic diversity of RVA strains as well as discrepancies with the genotypes contained in the vaccine available in Spain, and multiple amino acid differences in antigenic epitopes of different G- and P- genotypes with the vaccine strains. Further investigations are needed to determine the efficacy of the vaccine to confer clinical protection against heterologous strains.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving landscape of natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, improving the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment classification models is crucial. This paper investigates the performance of two advanced models, the Large Language Model (LLM) LLaMA model and NLP BERT model, in the context of airline review sentiment analysis. Through fine-tuning, domain adaptation, and the application of few-shot learning, the study addresses the subtleties of sentiment expressions in airline-related text data. Employing predictive modeling and comparative analysis, the research evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in capturing sentiment intricacies. Fine-tuning, including domain adaptation, enhances the models' performance in sentiment classification tasks. Additionally, the study explores the potential of few-shot learning to improve model generalization using minimal annotated data for targeted sentiment analysis. By conducting experiments on a diverse airline review dataset, the research quantifies the impact of fine-tuning, domain adaptation, and few-shot learning on model performance, providing valuable insights for industries aiming to predict recommendations and enhance customer satisfaction through a deeper understanding of sentiment in user-generated content (UGC). This research contributes to refining sentiment analysis models, ultimately fostering improved customer satisfaction in the airline industry.

AB  - Plant structural defenses such as trichomes exert a significant selection pressure on insect herbivores. However, whether variation in structural defense traits affects common herbivores in related plant species is less understood. Here, we examined the role of trichomes in plant-herbivore interactions in two commonly cultivated members in Cucurbitaceae: bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and cucumber (Cucumis sativa). In common garden experiments when the two species were grown together, we observed that they differed in their attractiveness to four major herbivore species (Trichoplusia ni, Acalymma vittatum, Diaphania indica, and Anasa tristis) and, consequently, their feeding behavior. We found that L. siceraria consistently harbored less herbivores, and the two lepidopteran herbivores (T. ni and D. indica) were found to take significantly longer time to commence feeding on them, a primary mode of pre-ingestive defense function of trichomes. To tease apart structural and chemical modes of defenses, we first used scanning electron microscopy to identify, quantify, and measure trichome traits including their morphology and density. We found that C. sativa has significantly lower number of trichomes compared to L. siceraria, regardless of trichome type and leaf surface. We then used artificial diet enriched with trichomes as caterpillar food and found that trichomes from these two species differentially affected growth and development of T. ni showing cascading effects of trichomes. Taken together, we show that trichomes, independent of chemical defenses, are an effective pre- and post-ingestive defense strategy against herbivores with negative consequences for their feeding, growth, and development.

AB  - Plants utilize a mixture of defence types in response to herbivores, including physical, chemical, and biological defences. Among chemical defences, phenolics are well-known to inhibit digestion and are highly variable across plant species and resource gradients. There are prominent hypotheses predicting the potential change of phenolics in response to soil nutrients, but most focus on nitrogen (N) and none consider their interaction with defence strategies. We proposed an updated theoretical model that incorporates defence types and predicts their relative advantages under herbivore attack. We studied intraspecific leaf chemistry of several architecturally defended and non-architecturally defended species growing together across four sites with varying soil chemistry. We measured individual-level leaf concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and phenolics, and site-level soil N, P, and K. We found that architectural defenders had lower phenolics and higher P than non-architectural defenders across locations. Relationships between soil nutrients and leaf chemistry were steeper in architectural defenders. Most leaf nutrients and phenolics showed significant relationships with soil P, and only leaf P was related to its respective soil resource. Within leaves, phenolics were negatively related to leaf N in both groups but only negatively related to leaf P for architectural defenders. Our results suggest that architectural defenders are less able to accumulate phenolic defences in high P soils than non-architectural defender. One possible explanation is that phenolic production is limited in P-rich soils via active phloem loading, but only in architectural defenders that have defence options other than chemical ones.

AB  - Due to the restrictions of its use, Bisphenol A (BPA) has been replaced by many structurally related bisphenols (BPs) in consumer products. The endocrine disrupting potential similar to that of BPA has been described for several bisphenols, there is therefore an urgent need of toxicokinetic (TK) data for these emerging BPs in order to evaluate if their internal exposure could increase the risk of endocrine disruption. We investigated TK behaviors of eleven BPA substitutes (BPS, BPAF, BPB, BPF, BPM, BPZ, 3-3BPA, BP4-4, BPAP, BPP, and BPFL) by intravenous and oral administrations of mixtures of them to piglets and serial collection of blood over 72 h and urine over 24 h, to evaluate their disposition. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling and a comparison was made with TK predicted by the generic model HTTK package. The low urinary excretion of some BPs, in particular BPM, BPP and BPFL, is an important aspect to consider in predicting human exposure based on urine biomonitoring. Despite their structural similarities, for the same oral dose, all BPA analogues investigated showed a higher systemic exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of the unconjugated Bisphenol) than BPA (2 to 4 fold for 3-3BPA, BPAF, BPB and BPZ, 7-20 fold for BP4-4, BPAP, BPP, BPFL, BPF and BPM and 150 fold for BPS) due mainly to a considerable variation of oral bioavailability (proportion of BP administered by oral route that attains the systemic circulation unchanged). Given similarities in the digestive tract between pigs and humans, our TK data suggest that replacing BPA with some of its alternatives, particularly BPS, will likely lead to higher internal exposure to potential endocrine disruptive compounds. These findings are crucial for evaluating the risk of human exposure to these emerging BPs.

AB  - The wingless-integrated (WNT) signaling pathway is known to play a critical role in myogenesis. WNT5B, a member of the WNT family, is essential for determining cell fate and development. However, the molecular mechanisms by which WNT5B regulates myogenesis remain unclear. This study observed that WNT5B, which is conserved between mice and pigs, is highly expressed in the skeletal muscle. The expression of WNT5B was varied in the skeletal muscle between the Tongcheng (obese-type) and Landrace (lean-type) pigs. In vitro, WNT5B promoted skeletal muscle cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, while inhibited cell apoptosis. In vivo, WNT5B promoted myofiber thickness and increased slow-type muscle fibers in porcine skeletal muscles. Mechanically, a SNP site (c.1608 A > G) located in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of WNT5B regulated transcript attenuation and acts through AU-rich element mediation (ARE) to influence myogenesis. Also, the SNP was located in the miRNA response element of miR-29a/b/c to influence WNT5B expression. However, ARE sites did not affect the binding relationship of miR-29a/b/c. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the SNP (c.1608 A > G) affects WNT5B mRNA stability by protecting the 3'UTR of the WNT5B from the degrading effects of miR-29a/b/c. This study reveals the critical role of WNT5B in myogenesis and indicates that it is a novel candidate gene for pig breeding.

AB  - This paper theoretically establishes a solar sheep game model under three cases to capture the friction among the stockholders including the government, PV investors, and shepherds. Nash equilibrium has been revealed for analyzing the impact of different policies on the benefits of each player. The results show that the implementation of the feed-in tariff (FIT) policy can maximize the government's revenue. However, when the government focuses on promoting poverty alleviation for shepherds, the sheep farming (SF) subsidy policy is more efficient than FIT if the positive effect of the PV panel on sheep raising is not enough. Besides, dynamic system models are established either to study the bounded rationality behavior during the decision process in the long run. Thresholds regarding speed of decision adjusting for each player are found. Results also show the system will lose stability if players adjust their decisions too frequently. Based on data from Talatan and Cascadilla, numerical analysis has been applied to illustrate the managerial implications from the proposed model.

The impact of seaweed addition was evaluated through physicochemical, microbiological, and organoleptic properties of the semi-hard goat cheeses. Carbohydrate content was relatively low, whereas the total lipid content was relatively high (particularly in semi-hard goat cheese supplemented with seaweeds). Crude protein content presented higher values in semi-hard goat cheese supplemented with Ulva sp. The semi-hard goat cheese supplemented with Ulva sp. shows increased levels of Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn. Instrumental color and the textural parameters of semi-hard goat's cheese varied significantly with seaweed addition. Most of the microbiological load complies with the Portuguese (INSA) and the United Kingdom's (HPA) guidelines for assessing the microbiological safety of ready-to-eat foods placed on the market. Additionally, the Flash Profile scores of semi-hard goat cheeses supplemented with seaweeds highlighted aroma and flavor complexity. Overall, this study confirms the potential of using seaweeds as a viable alternative to produce semi-hard goat cheeses with less pungency or goat milk flavor, making this product more pleasant and appealing to consumers sensitive to these sensory characteristics.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The encroachment of woody plants, including the eastern redcedar, in the central Great Plains is reaching critical levels. This encroachment impacts the profitability of cattle grazing operations, and potentially the ability to meet consumer demand for beef products due to lower stocking rates. Even though chemical and fire control are currently being used, the incorporation of small ruminants such as goats can help control the spread of woody plants, while providing an additional source of revenue and protein. In this analysis, we take a data driven approach to analyzing the potential for success utilizing different combination of chemicals, fire, breeding goats and stocker goats to control woody plant encroachment. Given our assumptions, the combination with the highest net present value was cattle, controlled burning and breeding goats.
   Pasture and grazing land in the southern and central Great Plains is being invaded by woody species, especially eastern redcedar. As a result of woody plant encroachment, cattle production on native rangeland is becoming less profitable because stocking rates must be decreased. Eastern redcedar encroachment can be controlled by grazing management, herbicide use, prescribed fire, mechanical control and mixed species grazing. This study utilizes traditional management practices, prescribed fire and three types of mixed species grazing operations to determine the most economically feasible way to manage redcedar encroachment on rangeland. The cost-benefit analysis in this study found that the source of redcedar management on rangeland with the highest net present value was the use of a breeding goat operation in which goats were grazed alongside cattle with the use of prescribed fire. This suggests that producers who are fighting redcedar encroachment will likely be able to implement a mixed species grazing operation with breeding goats to better manage their land and increase returns.

AB  - The Nagoya Protocol actions the third objective of the Convention on Biological Diversity and provides a framework to effectively implement the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources. This includes microorganisms used as biological control agents. Thus biological control practitioners must comply with access and benefit-sharing regulations that are implemented by countries providing microbial biological control agents. A review of best practices and guidance for the use and exchange of microorganisms used for biological control has been prepared by the IOBC Global Commission on Biological Control and Access and Benefit-Sharing to demonstrate commitment to comply with access and benefit-sharing requirements, and to reassure the international community that biological control is a very successful and environmentally safe pest management strategy that uses biological resources responsibly and sustainably. We propose that best practices include the following elements: collaboration to facilitate information exchange about the availability of microbial biological control agents and where they may be sourced; freely sharing available knowledge in databases about successes and failures; collaborative research with provider countries to develop capacity; and production technology transfer to provide economic opportunities. We recommend the use of model concept agreements for accessing microorganisms for scientific research and non-commercial release into nature where access and benefit-sharing regulations exist and where regulations are not restrictive or do not exist. We also recommend a model agreement for deposition of microbial biological control agents into culture collections.

AB  - Estrogen is an important hormone that affects muscle development in female animals. Previous studies have shown that estrogen can protect muscle cells from apoptosis by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms by which estrogen-induced MAPK signaling regulates myoblast growth and development remain unclear. In this study, RNA-seq was performed on ovariectomized small-tailed Han (OR-STH) sheep and sham surgery small-tailed Han (STH) sheep to analyze the effects of estrogen on muscle growth and development in female animals. There were 8721 differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs), 143 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and 2238 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) in the longissimus dorsi between the OR-STH and STH groups. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the differentially expressed gene MAPK15 was significantly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is important for muscle development. Therefore, we constructed the ceRNA network circFAM171A1/oar-miR-485-5p/MAPK15 and explored its effect on muscle growth and development. The results of the molecular mechanism experiments indicated that circFAM171A1 can sponge oar-miR-485-5p to regulate MAPK15. The addition of the exogenous hormone estradiol (E2) to sheep myoblasts could induce circFAM171A1, regulate the expression of oar-miR-485-5p and MAPK15, and promote the proliferation of sheep myoblasts. The results showed that MAPK15 and circFAM171A1 significantly promoted the proliferation of myoblasts and inhibited the apoptosis of myoblasts in sheep, whereas oar-miR-485-5p inhibited the expression of MAPK15 and circFAM171A1, inhibited myoblast proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, circFAM171A1 attenuated the inhibitory effect of oar-miR-485-5p on myoblasts. In summary, estrogen induced the expression of circFAM171A1 in sheep myoblasts, and circFAM171A1 can act as a sponge for oar-miR-485-5p to promote the expression of the target gene MAPK15 and ultimately regulate the proliferation of sheep myoblasts. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of estrogen regulation of muscle growth and development in female animals.

AB  - Brown algae from genus Cystoseira s.l. form dense underwater forests that represent the most productive areas in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the combined effects of global and local stressors such as climate change, urbanization, and herbivore outbreaks, there has been a severe decline in brown algal forests in the Mediterranean Sea. Natural recovery of depleted sites is unlikely due to the low dispersal capacity of these species, and efficient techniques to restore such habitats are needed. In this context, the aims of our study were (1) to improve and simplify the current ex situ laboratory protocol for the cultivation of Gongolaria barbata by testing the feasibility of some cost-effective and time-efficient techniques on two donor sites of G. barbata and (2) to evaluate the survival and growth of young thalli during the laboratory phase and during the most critical five months after out-planting. Specifically, the following ex situ cultivation methods were tested: (A) cultivation on clay tiles in mesocosms with culture water prepared by three different procedures (a) filtered seawater with a 0.22 & mu;m filter membrane, (b) filtered seawater with a 0.7 & mu;m filter membrane (GF), and (c) UV-sterilized water, and (B) cultivation on clay tiles in open laboratory systems. After two weeks, all thalli were fixed to plastic lantern net baskets suspended at a depth of 2 m in the coastal sea (hybrid method), and the algal success was monitored in relation to the different donor sites and cultivation protocol. The satisfactory results of this study indicate that UV-sterilized water is suitable for the cultivation of G. barbata in mesocosm, which significantly reduces the cost of the laboratory phase. This opens the possibility of numerous and frequent algal cultures during the reproductive period of the species. Additionally, if the young thalli remain in the lantern net baskets for an extended period of several months, they can grow significantly in the marine environment without being exposed to pressure from herbivorous fish.

AB  - Invasive alien plants (IAPs) are a frequent consequence of global connectivity and present significant threats to biodiversity, amplifying impacts from global climate change and habitat loss. Integrated management efforts for landscape-level plant invasions often include some combination of mechanical, cultural, chemical, and biological control. The former three have well established protocols and development pipelines for rapid responses to new invasions. Biological control of IAPs, however, is often employed only after the invaded region has reached some arbitrary but intolerable level of negative impact that triggers efforts to develop agents to provide control. Despite mounting evidence that investments in prevention and proactive approaches to IAPs are the most cost effective, most expenditures, including those for biological control development, continue to be in the postinvasion reactive phase. We build a rationale for earlier investigation and implementation of biological control for IAPs. A potential framework for this approach would pair prioritization methods (e.g., risk assessments and horizon scanning) to identify targets with extensive literature searches for known herbivores or foreign range surveys and early host range tests. In addition, resource sharing among regions and nations with similar climates and risks would alleviate the onus of investment from any one party. Finally, investments into conservation and training opportunities between nations further incentivizes maintaining natural resources for potential biological control. By developing and implementing biological control earlier in or before the invasion process, countless impacts and costs are lessened.

AB  - The study was implemented for exploring influences of nano-K2MoO4 on the daily gain and antioxidant function of Chinese merino sheep in the native pasture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Northwest of China. Eighty of the sheep, weight of (45.56 +/- 2.35) kg, were randomly distributed to the tested areas for 90 days, 20 sheep/group. The findings showed that the contents of Mo and N in the forage of applying nano-K2MoO4 were extremely higher than those in the control pastures (P <0.01). The daily gain in the fertilized groups were remarkably lower than that in the control group (P <0.01). The harvest of forage in the fertilized pastures were significantly higher than those in control (P <0.01). The contents of Mo in blood and liver in grazing the Chinese merino sheep were extremely higher than those from the control group (P <0.01). The contents of Cu in blood and liver in grazing the Chinese merino sheep were extremely lower than those in the unfertilized pastures (P <0.01). The levels of hemoglobin (Hb), blood platelet (PLT), and erythrocyte count (RBC) in animals from the fertilized pastures were extremely lower than those in the control pastures (P < 0.01). The activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT in serum were significantly lower than those in group C. The serum MDA levels were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the application of nano-K2MoO4 in pastures can greatly improve the yield of forage, but strikingly decreased the daily gain and antioxidant function in grazing the Chinese merino sheep.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) is present worldwide as a serious contaminant of food and feed and causes male reproductive toxicity. The implication of paraptosis, which is a nonclassical paradigm of cell death, is unclear in ZEA-induced male reproductive disorders. In this study, the toxic effects of ZEA on the blood-testis barrier (BTB) and the related mechanisms of paraptosis were detected in goats. ZEA exposure, in vivo, caused a significant decrease in spermatozoon quality, the destruction of seminiferous tubules, and damage to the BTB integrity. Furthermore, ZEA exposure to Sertoli cells (SCs) in vitro showed similar dysfunction in structure and barrier function. Importantly, the formation of massive cytoplasmic vacuoles in ZEA-treated SCs corresponded to the highly swollen and dilative endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and paraptosis inhibition significantly alleviated ZEA-induced SC death and vacuolization, which indicated the important contribution of paraptosis in ZEA-induced BTB damage. Meanwhile, the expression of ER stress marker proteins was increased after ZEA treatment but decreased under the inhibition of paraptosis. The vacuole formation and SC death, induced by ZEA, were remarkably blocked by ER stress inhibition. In conclusion, these results facilitate the exploration of the mechanisms of the SC paraptosis involved in ZEA-induced BTB damage in goats.

AB  - The development of the goat mammary gland is mainly under the control of ovarian hormones particularly estrogen and progesterone (P4). Amino acids play an essential role in mammary gland development and milk production, and sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) was reported to be expressed in the mammary gland of rats and bovine mammary epithelial cells, which may affect the synthesis of milk proteins or mammary cell proliferation by mediating prolactin, 17 beta-estradiol (E2) or methionine function. However, whether SNAT2 mediates the regulatory effects of E2 and P4 on the development of the ruminant mammary gland is still unclear. In this study, we show that E2 and P4 could increase the proliferation of goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) and regulate SNAT2 mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigation revealed that SNAT2 is abundantly expressed in the mammary gland during late pregnancy and early lactation, while knockdown and overexpression of SNAT2 in GMECs could inhibit or enhance E2- and P4-induced cell proliferation as well as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. We also found that the accelerated proliferation induced by SNAT2 overexpression in GMECs was suppressed by the mTOR signaling pathway inhibitor rapamycin. This indicates that the regulation of GMECs proliferation mediated by SNAT2 in response to E2 and P4 is dependent on the mTOR signaling pathway. Finally, we found that the total content of the amino acids in GMECs changed after knocking-down and overexpressing SNAT2. In summary, the results demonstrate that the regulatory effects of E2 and P4 on GMECs proliferation may be mediated by the SNAT2-transported amino acid pathway. These results may offer a novel nutritional target for improving the development of the ruminant mammary gland and milk production.

AB  - Order Rodentia contains approximately half of all living mammalian species. Most of the living species diversity within rodents is within five monophyletic radiations: Hystricognathi, Sciuridae, Geomyoidea, Dipodidae, and Muroidea. The samples collected across different areas of Egypt were analyzed by means of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequence analysis to ascertain the true taxonomic status between the studied species. For phylogenetic analysis, the cytochrome b sequences from this study were combined with previously published data. This study reveals that all species were divided into two main clades, the first for the Gerbillinae taxon and the second for the other studied genera in the molecular phylogenetic trees and demonstrates that Gerbillus species form a sister group with Dipodillus species. The phylogenetic relationships specified for the murine genera. Clustering was obtained between Mus and Rattus as well as in all Gerbillinae species. This study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of some rodents in Egypt.

AB  - The symbiosis between termites and their hindgut protists is mutually obligate and vertically inherited. It was established by the late Jurassic in the cockroach ancestors of termites as they transitioned to wood feeding. Since then, protist symbionts have been transmitted from host generation to host generation by proctodeal trophallaxis (anal feeding). The protists belong to multiple lineages within the eukaryotic superphylum Metamonada. Most of these lineages have evolved large cells with complex morphology, unlike the non-termite-associated Metamonada. The species richness and taxonomic composition of symbiotic protist communities varies widely across termite lineages, especially within the deep-branching clade Teletisoptera. In general, closely related termites tend to harbour closely related protists, and deep-branching termites tend to harbour deep-branching protists, reflecting their broad-scale co-diversification. A closer view, however, reveals a complex distribution of protist lineages across hosts. Some protist taxa are common, some are rare, some are widespread, and some are restricted to a single host family or genus. Some protist taxa can be found in only a few, distantly related, host species. Thus, the long history of co-diversification in this symbiosis has been complicated by lineage-specific loss of symbionts, transfer of symbionts from one host lineage to another, and by independent diversification of the symbionts relative to their hosts. This review aims to introduce the biology of this important symbiosis and serve as a gateway to the diversity and systematics literature for both termites and protists. A searchable database with all termite-protist occurrence records and taxonomic references is provided as a supplementary file to encourage and facilitate new research in this field.

AB  - Adiponectin (APN) is an essential adipokine for a variety of reproductive processes. To investigate the role of APN in goat corpora lutea (CLs), CLs and sera from different luteal phases were collected for analysis. The results showed that the APN structure and content had no significant divergence in different luteal phases both in CLs and sera; however, high molecular weight APN was dominant in serum, while low molecular weight APN was more present in CLs. The luteal expression of both AdipoR1/2 and T-cadherin (T-Ca) increased on D11 and 17. APN and its receptors (AdipoR1/2 and T-Ca) were mainly expressed in goat luteal steroidogenic cells. The steroidogenesis and APN structure in pregnant CLs had a similar model as in the mid-cycle CLs. To further explore the effects and mechanisms of APN in CLs, steroidogenic cells from pregnant CLs were isolated to detect the AMPK-mediated pathway by the activation of APN (AdipoRon) and knockdown of APN receptors. The results revealed that P-AMPK in goat luteal cells increased after incubation with APN (1 mu g/mL) or AdipoRon (25 mu M) for 1 h, and progesterone (P4) and steroidogenic proteins levels (STAR/CYP11A1/HSD3B) decreased after 24 h. APN did not affect the steroidogenic protein expression when cells were pretreated with Compound C or SiAMPK. APN increased P-AMPK and reduced the CYP11A1 expression and P4 levels when cells were pretreated with SiAdipoR1 or SiT-Ca, while APN failed to affect P-AMPK, the CYP11A1 expression or the P4 levels when pretreated with SiAdipoR2. Therefore, the different structural forms of APN in CLs and sera may possess distinct functions; APN might regulate luteal steroidogenesis through AdipoR2 which is most likely dependent on AMPK.

AB  - Simple Summary Cystic echinococcosis is a parasitic disease affecting humans; in Chile, it uses sheep and dogs as its main hosts. The Eg95 vaccine has been developed with the aim of controlling ovine infection. Here, we present the results of a 3-year control program in the Alto Biobio commune in central Chile. The program tried to provide a first dose at 2 months of age, a booster 1 month later, and yearly vaccination. Given the difficult land work, important delays in the vaccinations were recorded, and many animals did not receive the first booster. Dog deworming was not included in the program. The main results of the program were that after vaccination, the proportion of large and fertile cysts was lower than before; however, the proportion of infected sheep had not reduced. In addition, the lower age at first dose and the administration of the second dose 1 month after the first were associated with greater protection. Hence, the results suggest that vaccination was not effective against the infection of sheep, but it was effective against the development of cysts; thus, cysts are less infective for dogs. This could favor disease control by cutting the cycle. Echinococcosis is a neglected zoonosis that uses dogs and sheep as its main hosts in Chile. The Eg95 vaccine against sheep infection has been included in some control programs. Here, we assess the efficacy of the vaccination program in the hyperendemic Alto Biobio commune after 3 years of execution. Fisher's test and generalized linear models were used in the assessment. The program tried to offer a first dose at 2 months of age, a booster 1 month later, and yearly vaccination. Given logistic difficulties, important delays in vaccination occurred, and most animals did not receive the first booster. Dog deworming was not included in the program. Likely due to the aforementioned factors, the overall frequency of infection was not lower, but the proportion of large (>5 mm) cysts and fertile cysts was smaller after the program. The frequency of infection and/or the number of cysts were lower when the age at first dose was younger and the first booster was administered 1 month after the first dose. The results suggest that vaccination affects both cyst development after the larvae reach the target organs, as well as the development of the protoscolex once the cysts start developing.

AB  - Semen cryopreservation enables the long-term storage and transportation of gametes that can be utilized for in vitro/vivo fertilization procedures. The cryopreservation of epididymal semen may be the only method to protect valuable male genetic material in the event of unanticipated death when ejaculation is no longer possible, and orchiectomy is required for an individual's health. Approximately 40-50% of the boar sperm population does not survive the cryopreservation process. Freezing and thawing procedures subject boar sperm to extreme survival conditions, leading to structural and metabolic cell damage, sperm motility loss, and membrane integrity damage. Boar sperm is susceptible to cold shock due to a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in its plasm membrane. Several critical steps have been found to address the challenges faced when cryopreserving boar sperm. The pre-freeze stage, which involves maintaining the semen sample at 15-18 degrees C, is one noteworthy method. The goal of this procedure is to lessen the susceptibility of boar sperm to cold shock and preserve sperm viability. The prolonged holding time causes sperm capacitation processes to reverse and increases sperm cryoresistance. This study aims to investigate the sperm motility and morphometry of pre-freeze and post-thaw boar epididymal semen cooled at increasing holding times at 18 degrees C. The study investigated the sperm motility and morphometry of pre-freeze and post-thaw boar epididymal semen cooled at increasing holding times at 18 degrees C. A total of 50 testes of heterogeneous boars were collected (5 testes/day) from the local abattoir and transported to the laboratory at 5 degrees C within 30 min after slaughter. Semen was retrieved from the caudal part of the epididymis using the slicing float-up method, diluted with Beltsville Thawing Solution extender, pooled in a 50 mL centrifuge tube/5 testes/day, and cooled at 18 degrees C. Following each holding time (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 h), the cooled semen sample was re-suspended with Fraction A extender and stored at 5 degrees C for an additional 45 min. A cooled resuspended semen sample was then diluted with Fraction B extender, loaded into 0.25 mL straws, and frozen using liquid nitrogen vapour. Thawing was accomplished by immersing the semen straws in warm (37 degrees C) water for 1 min and the samples were evaluated for sperm motility and morphometry traits using the computer-assisted sperm analyzer system. The data were analyzed using variance analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to assess sperm morphometry, establishing the minimum and maximum values. Boar epididymal sperm survived for up to 48 h when held at 18 degrees C. Furthermore, the highest post-thawed sperm motility rates were observed in semen frozen after 3 h of holding time, with a sperm total motility of 85.9%, a progressive motility of 60.3%, and a rapid motility of 33.2%, as compared to other holding times (p < 0.05). The acceptable ranges for pre-freeze and post-thawed sperm morphology were head length (8.4-9.1 <mu>m), width (4.4-4.8 mu m), area (29.9-38.2 mu m(2)), perimeter (20.1-23.7 mu m), midpiece width (1.1-2.8 mu m), and sperm shape, were consistent regardless of the holding time. A holding time of 3 h enhances the cryoresistance of sperm cooled at 18 degrees C. Therefore, these findings suggest that boar epididymal sperm can be effectively conserved and can maintain fertilization capability when cooled for 3 h at 18 degrees C before freezing.

AB  - Renewal is the return of extinguished responding after removal from the extinction context. Renewal has been extensively studied using classical aversive conditioning procedures that measure a passive freezing response to an aversive conditioned stimulus. However, coping responses to aversive stimuli are complex and can be reflected in passive and active behaviours. Using the shock-probe defensive burying task, we investigated whether different coping responses are susceptible to renewal. During conditioning, male, Long-Evans rats were placed into a specific context (Context A) where an electrified shock-probe delivered a 3 mA shock upon contact. During extinction, the shock-probe was unarmed in either the same (Context A) or a different context (Context B). Renewal of conditioned responses was assessed in the conditioning context (ABA) or in a novel context (ABC or AAB). Renewal of passive coping responses, indicated by an increased latency and a decreased duration of shock-probe contacts, was observed in all groups. However, renewal of passive coping, measured by increased time spent on the side of the chamber opposite the shock-probe, was only found in the ABA group. Renewal of active coping responses linked to defensive burying was not observed in any group. The present findings highlight the presence of multiple psychological processes underlying even basic forms of aversive conditioning and demonstrate the importance of assessing a broader set of behaviours to tease apart these different underlying mechanisms. The current findings suggest that passive coping responses may be more reliable indicators for assessing renewal than active coping behaviours associated with defensive burying.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) is commonly found in crops and feed, with a high detection rate and concentration. This substance adversely affects reproduction and development, with particularly noticeable effects on pigs. Given these detrimental effects, there is an urgent need to identify effective protective agents against ZEA toxicity. Sulforaphane (SFN) has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its widely acknowledged antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxifying properties. This study elucidates ZEA's mechanism of oxidative injury in porcine endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) via mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) disruption and demonstrates SFN's protective role. ZEA disrupts the structural integrity and functional dynamics of mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAM) by downregulating PACS 2, leading to elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels (P < 0.01), increased ROS generation (P < 0.01), MDA accumulation (P < 0.01), and suppressed antioxidant enzyme activity (P < 0.01). SFN (10 mu M) or the overexpression of PACS 2 can reduce the toxic damage caused by ZEA (45 mu M).

AB  - Genotoxic stress activates the DNA-damage response (DDR) signalling cascades responsible for maintaining genome integrity. Downstream DNA repair pathways include the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) enzyme that hydrolyses the phosphodiester bond between the tyrosine of topoisomerase I (TopI) and 3 '-phosphate of DNA. The plant TDP1 subfamily contains the canonical TDP1 alpha gene and the TDP1 beta gene whose functions are not fully elucidated. The current study proposes to investigate the involvement of TDP1 genes in DDR-related processes by using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants treated with genotoxic agents. The phenotypic and molecular characterization of tdp1 alpha, tdp1 beta and tdp1 alpha/beta mutants treated with cisplatin (CIS), curcumin (CUR), NSC120686 (NSC), zeocin (ZEO), and camptothecin (CPT), evidenced that while tdp1 beta was highly sensitive to CIS and CPT, tdp1 alpha was more sensitive to NSC. Gene expression analyses showing upregulation of the TDP2 gene in the double mutant indicate the presence of compensatory mechanisms. The downregulation of POL2A gene in the tdp1 beta mutant along with the upregulation of the TDP1 beta gene in pol2a mutants, together with its sensitivity to replication inhibitors (CIS, CTP), point towards a function of this gene in the response to replication stress. Therefore, this study brings novel information relative to the activity of TDP1 genes in plants.

AB  - Recovering phosphorus (P) through combustion from waste streams, like wastewater sludge and animal manure, offers a promising solution. This research explores the P release patterns in different ashes derived from secondary raw materials, using a long-term soil incubation lasting 160 days. The study evaluated the P release dynamics in five types of ashes from enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) systems and pig slurry burned at different temperatures. According to the results, a primary effect was observed on P bioavailability during the initial incubation period. All tested ashes release more than 50% of the total P applied between days 5 and 10. Ashes from EBPR exhibited higher P release than those from pig manure, indicating ash origin as a key factor in P release. Additionally, combustion temperature was crucial, with higher temperatures resulting in increased P release rates. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation revealed a strong relationship between the characteristics of the ashes and the amount of P release. Overall, these findings suggest that ashes could be a valuable P-source for agriculture avoiding the process of wet chemical P extraction, thus reducing both economic and environmental costs.

AB  - A context can be conceptualized as a stable arrangement of elements or as the sum of single elements. Both configural and elemental representations play a role in associative processes. This study aimed to explore the respective contributions of these two representations of a context in the acquisition of conditioned anxiety in humans. Virtual reality (VR) can be an ecologically valid tool to investigate context-related mechanisms, yet the influence of the sense of presence within the virtual environment remains unclear. Forty-eight healthy individuals participated in a VR-based context conditioning wherein electric shocks (unconditioned stimulus, US) were unpredictably delivered in one virtual office (CTX+), but not in the other (CTX-). During the test phase, nine elements from each context were presented singularly. We found a cluster of participants, who exhibited heightened anticipation of the US for anxiety-related elements as compared to the other group. In contrast to their clear elemental representation, these individuals showed diminished discriminative responses between the two context's configurations. Discriminative responses to the contexts were boosted in those individuals, who had a weaker elemental representation. Importantly, the individual sense of presence significantly influenced the conditioned responses. These findings align with the dual-representation view of context and provide insights into the role of presence in eliciting (conditioned) anxiety responses.

AB  - African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are well-studied and inhabit diverse landscapes that are being transformed by both humans and natural forces. Most tools currently in use are limited in their ability to predict how elephants will respond to novel changes in the environment. Individual-, or agent-based modeling (ABM), may extend current methods in addressing and predicting spatial responses to environmental conditions over time. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate elephant space use and validated the model with movement data from elephants in Kruger National Park (KNP) and Chobe National Park (CNP). We simulated movement at an hourly scale, as this scale can reflect switches in elephant behavior due to changes in internal states and short-term responses to the local availability and distribution of critical resources, including forage, water, and shade. Known internal drivers of elephant movement, including perceived temperature and the time since an individual last visited a water source, were linked to the external environment through behavior-based movement rules. Simulations were run on model landscapes representing the wet season and the hot, dry season for both parks. The model outputs, including home range size, daily displacement distance, net displacement distance, and maximum distance traveled from a permanent water source, were evaluated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons to actual elephant movement data from both KNP and CNP. The ABM was successful in reproducing the differences in daily displacements between seasons in each park, and in distances traveled from a permanent water source between parks and seasons. Other movement characteristics, including differences in home range sizes and net daily displacements, were partially reproduced. Out of the all the statistical comparisons made between the empirical and simulated movement patterns, the majority were classified as discrepancies of medium or small effect size. We have shown that a resource-driven model with relatively simple decision rules generates trajectories with movement characteristics that are mostly comparable to those calculated from empirical data. Simulating hourly movement (as our model does) may be useful in predicting how finer-scale patterns of space use, such as those created by foraging movements, are influenced by finer spatio-temporal changes in the environment.

AB  - The fish guild structure of 96 fish species inhabiting the Vembanad Lake, an open, large, well-mixed coastal estuary along the south-west coast of India, was studied based on samples from upper (freshwater), middle (estuarine), and lower (saline) zones representing three major seasons (monsoon, post-monsoon, and pre-monsoon). Functional group assessment revealed seven ecological guilds (marine estuarine opportunists, freshwater, marine estuarine dependent, estuarine, catadromous, anadromous, and amphidromous), six feeding guilds (detritivore, zooplanktivore, herbivore, zoobenthivore, omnivore, and carnivore), three vertical distribution guilds (demersal, benthopelagic, and pelagic), five reproductive-mode functional groups (oviparous with pelagic eggs, oviparous with benthic eggs, oviparous guarders, viviparous and ovoviviparous), and five flowpreference guilds (rheophilic A1, eurytopic, rheophilic A2, rheophilic B, and rheophilic C). The estuary was characterized by high species diversity, low individual species abundance, complex guild structure, varying fish diversity from upper to lower estuary and higher proportion of marine rather than `true' estuarine species. The absence of a significant relationship between season and fish guild structuring could be due to high resource availability in the estuary and low ecological connectivity between upper and lower estuarine zones as a result of anthropogenic interventions in the middle zone. Salinity variations considerably influenced the fish guild formation in the estuary. A drastic change in the hydrography of the estuary over the past sixty years due to topographical alterations has transformed the fish guilds resulting in a considerable increase in freshwater species and a reduction in marine and estuarine-dependant species.

AB  - We use circuit-level granular electricity measurements from student housing and statistical analysis to better understand individuals' electricity consumption. Two key patterns emerged-individuals varied systematically in their magnitude of electricity use as well as in their variability of usage at the hourly and daily level. A cluster analysis of electricity consumption in individual bedrooms shows that 18% of students consume 48% of total electricity use at a median of 2.17 kWh/d/person. These few energy hogs have a disproportionate impact on electricity consumption. In contrast, the misers (22% of students) consume only 4% of the electricity (0.18 kWh/d/person). Mini-refrigerators in bedrooms contributed substantially to the total electricity use of the moderate users. In contrast, mini-refrigerators were less influential for energy hogs, suggesting that these residents may draw power in others ways, such as by using powerful computing or gaming systems for hours each day. A sub-cluster analysis revealed substantial individual variability in hourly usage profiles. Some energy hogs use electricity consistently throughout the day, while others have specific periods of high consumption. We demonstrate how our analysis is generalizable to other situations where the resident does not directly pay their utility bills and thus has limited financial incentive to conserve, and how it contributes to a deeper understanding of the different ways in which individuals use energy. This allows for targeting interventions to groups with similar patterns of consumption. For example, policies such as fines or fees that might reduce the excessive electricity use for short times or for individual hogs could result in potential savings ranging from 16-33% of bedroom electricity.

AB  - Throughout much of the Quaternary, lower sea levels in the southern Cape of South Africa exposed a different landscape to what we see today, the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain (PAP). The PAP was dominated by large-bodied and gregarious grazing species contrasting with the small-bodied predominantly solitary species we find in the region today. The distribution of these herbivores would likely have been driven by similar drivers we see in contemporary herbivore ecology. Importantly, the occurrence of early humans and their associated technology would have also influenced the probability of herbivores occurring in an area. Here we create a predictive model for large herbivores using probability of occurrence of functional grouping in relation to environmental drivers and humans. We show how early humans influenced the distribution of large herbivores on the PAP alongside other environmental drivers. In the fynbos biome, probability of occurrence was highest for the medium-sized social mixed feeders' functional group in the thicket for small non-social browsers, large browsers, and non-ruminants and in grasslands for water-dependent grazers. In our models, human influence affected functional groups to varying degrees but had the strongest effect on medium-sized social mixed feeders.

AB  - Intermittent fasting (IF) is a widely used dietary strategy that has shown several advantageous impacts on general health and aging. IF has recently been linked to the control of neurogenesis, a crucial process for emotional control, memory, and learning, in the hippocampus. Nevertheless, there is little knowledge about the sex-specific impacts of IF on hippocampal neurogenesis and the related mechanisms, which were investigated in this study among both male and female rats, together with analyzing the involvement of the flora-gut-brain axis in facilitating these effects. Our findings show that IF favorably affects hippocampus neurogenesis in female mice relative to male mice, suggesting a sex-specific mechanism. In addition, IF influenced the diversity of the gut microbiota and decreased the synthesis of fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P), which is believed together with fructose metabolism to be linked to neurological damage and cognitive decline. Collectively, these data indicate that the connection between the flora-gut-brain axis and hippocampus neurogenesis is significant.

AB  - Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is the pituitary hormone that regulates gonadal function by Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis (HPGA) in vertebrates. FSHR has the function of transmitting follicle-stimulating growth biological information in animal breeding activities. In this study, we analyzed the structure of FSHR gene???s promoter, expression regulation and the correlation between polymorphism with fecundity. The results show that it is highly possible that the promoter of FSHR gene is in the region of 2045-2295bp and 2038-2288bp, TATA box was also found there. The expression differences were found in oviduct during every stage of estrous cycle (P<0.05) between Small Tail Han (STH) sheep and Tan (T) sheep. There were significant differences in genotype distribution between STH sheep and T sheep at T1235C and AG2357-2358 CT sites (P<0.01). The results of haplotypes analysis indicated that H2, H7 were preponderant haplotype in high prolificacy sheep breed. The litter size of TT genotype was significantly higher than that in CC genotype at T1235C loci in STH sheep (P<0.05). The current study provides evidence in sheep for genetic markers that might be used in breeding program.

AB  - Simple Summary Caseous lymphadenitis is a contagious bacterial disease that affects both domestic and wild animals. It has been studied by scientists since the 19th century. Thanks to new high-throughput RNA sequencing techniques, we can now better understand how the immune system responds to this disease, evaluate individual resistance levels, and identify disease biomarkers. This knowledge can help prevent the spread of incurable diseases, reduce economic losses, and breed farm animals with greater bacterial resistance. In this study, we explore the potential role of immune genes in the fight against disease in ewes from an ordinary farm. The ovine genome reflected host-pathogen interactions by promoting transcriptional changes in innate and acquired immunity in diseased sheep. Furthermore, in exposed sheep, innate immunity increased over the adaptive response. Caseous lymphadenitis (CL) is a chronic contagious disease that affects small ruminants and is characterized by the formation of pyogranulomas in lymph nodes and other organs. However, the pathogenesis of this disease and the response of the host genome to infection are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the whole blood transcriptome and evaluate differential gene expression during the later stages of CL in naturally infected ewes. The study included diseased, serologically positive (EP), exposed, serologically negative (EN) ewes from the same infected flock and healthy ewes (CN) from a different flock. RNA sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq system, and differential gene expression was estimated using DESeq2 and Edge R approaches. The analysis identified 191 annotated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the EP group (102 upregulated and 89 downregulated) and 256 DEGs in the EN group (106 upregulated and 150 downregulated) compared to the CN group. Numerous immunoregulatory interactions between lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells were influenced in both EP and EN ewes. Immune DEGs were preferentially assigned to antigen presentation through the MHC complex, T lymphocyte-mediated immunity, and extracellular matrix interactions. Furthermore, the EP group showed altered regulation of cytokine and chemokine signaling and activation and recombination of B-cell receptors. Conversely, NF-kappa B signaling, apoptosis, and stress response were the main processes influenced in the EN group. In addition, statistically significant enrichment of the essential immune pathways of binding and uptake of ligands by scavenger receptors in EP and p53 signaling in the EN group was found. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the disease course and host-pathogen interaction in naturally CL-infected sheep by investigating the blood transcriptome.

AB  - The physiological well-being of buffaloes, encompassing phenotypic traits, reproductive health, and productivity, depends on their energy status. Mitochondria, the architects of energy production, orchestrate a nuanced interplay between nuclear and mitochondrial domains. Oxidative phosphorylation complexes and associated proteins wield significant influence over metabolic functions, energy synthesis, and organelle dynamics, often linked to tissue-specific pathologies. The unexplored role of ATP synthase in buffalo tissues prompted a hypothesis: in-depth exploration of nuclear-derived mitochondrial genes, notably ATP synthase, reveals distinctive tissue-specific diversity. RNA extraction and sequencing of buffalo tissues (kidney, heart, brain, and ovary) enabled precise quantification of nuclear-derived mitochondrial protein gene expression. The analysis unveiled 24 ATP synthase transcript variants, each with unique tissue-specific patterns. Kidney, brain, and heart exhibited elevated gene expression compared to ovaries, with 10, 8, and 19 up-regulated genes, respectively. The kidney showed 3 and 12 down-regulated genes compared to the brain and heart. The heart-brain comparison highlighted ten highly expressed genes in ATP synthase functions. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed enriched functions linked to ATP synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, offering a comprehensive understanding of energy production in buffalo tissues. This analysis enhances understanding of tissue-specific gene expression, emphasizing the influence of energy demands. Revealing intricate links between mitochondrial gene expression and tissue specialization in buffaloes, it provides nuanced insights into tissue-specific expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein genes, notably ATP synthase, advancing the comprehension of buffalo tissue biology.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Modern varieties of cereal grains commonly cultivated in Europe are considered good alternative energy sources that can be used as partial replacements for barley and wheat, which are commonly used as primary energy sources in pig feed. In Central Europe, rye deserves special consideration as it can be cultivated on low-fertility soils with a very low environmental impact among cereals. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of partial substitution of wheat and barley with maize or modern rye varieties (population and hybrid) on concentration of selected heavy metals in feed offered to pigs and in pig muscles, liver and kidneys at slaughter.
   The carry-over of heavy metals from feed to muscles is generally low if animals are fed with a standard diet containing amounts below the maximum permissible levels. However, prolonged exposure to heavy metals can lead to their accumulation in some organs like muscles, liver, and kidneys. This paves the way for human health risks related to the consumption of products of animal-origin. Thus, using feed mixtures with a low level of heavy metals in pig production will contribute to increasing public health and safety and is of environmental concern. The study aimed to assess the impact of the level of some heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn) in standard (control) feed mixtures and in alternative feed mixtures based on maize or new rye varieties (population and hybrid) on the heavy metal concentration in muscles, liver and kidney of fattened pigs at slaughter. While some differences between heavy metals content in examined tissue samples from experimental groups were observed, all of them were in the range of allowable levels according to European Community rules. In conclusion, new rye varieties, especially the hybrid variety, could be an alternative source of cereal grains for pig nutrition.

AB  - In the realm of marine intelligence, effective ship classification across vast oceanic expanses is pivotal. Despite strides in conventional identification techniques, existing methods exhibit limitations in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and overall performance. This paper introduces a novel Elephant Herd optimization based Spiking Neural Networks (EHO-SNN) for discerning large ships, small vessels, and the absence of ships. Initial satellite images from the Airbus dataset capture ships at sea, subjected to preprocessing via the wavelet transform-based Retinex algorithm (WRA) to eliminate noise and fog artifacts. Deep learning mobile net facilitates feature extraction, while the Elephant Herd algorithm culls irrelevant features, honing in on the most pertinent ones. Finally, the classification through a spiking neural network, distinguishing between large ships, small vessels, and the absence of ships. Detected large and small ships are accurately positioned within a selected scene, while the absence of a ship terminates the process. The Proposed EHO-SNN model attains an impressive classification accuracy of 99.10%. Notably, it surpasses OMRCNN-SHD, Efficient Net, and AN-YOLOv4 by 1.15%, 12.30%, and 7.79%, respectively, thereby advancing overall accuracy in ship classification.

AB  - Expression of bronchodilatory beta(2)-adrenoceptors and bronchoconstrictive muscarinic M-3-receptors alter with airway size. In COPD, (a combination of) beta(2)-agonists and muscarinic M-3-antagonists (anticholinergics) are used as bronchodilators. We studied whether differential receptor expression in large and small airways affects the response to beta(2)-agonists and anticholinergics in COPD. Bronchoprotection by indacaterol (beta(2)-agonist) and glycopyrrolate (anticholinergic) against methacholine- and EFS-induced constrictions of large and small airways was measured in guinea pig and human lung slices using video-assisted microscopy. In guinea pig lung slices, glycopyrrolate (1, 3 and 10 nM) concentration-dependently protected against methacholine- and EFS-induced constrictions, with no differences between large and small intrapulmonary airways. Indacaterol (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mu M) also provided concentration-dependent protection, which was greater in large airways against methacholine and in small airways against EFS. Indacaterol (10 mu M) and glycopyrrolate (10 nM) normalized small airway hyperresponsiveness in COPD lung slices. Synergy of low indacaterol (10 nM) and glycopyrrolate (1 nM) concentrations was greater in LPS-challenged guinea pigs (COPD model) compared to saline-challenged controls. In conclusion, glycopyrrolate similarly protects large and small airways, whereas the protective effect of indacaterol in the small, but not the large, airways depends on the contractile stimulus used. Moreover, findings in a guinea pig model indicate that the synergistic bronchoprotective effect of indacaterol and glycopyrrolate is enhanced in COPD.

AB  - This paper presents a deep-learning-based system for classifying pig postures, aiming to improve the management of sustainable smart pigsties. The classification of pig postures is a crucial concern for researchers investigating pigsty environments and for on-site pigsty managers. To address this issue, we developed a comprehensive system framework for pig posture classification within a pigsty. We collected image datasets from an open data sharing site operated by a public organization and systematically conducted the following steps: object detection, data labeling, image preprocessing, model development, and training. These processes were carried out using the acquired datasets to ensure comprehensive and effective training for our pig posture classification system. Subsequently, we analyzed and discussed the classification results using techniques such as Grad-CAM. As a result of visual analysis through Grad-CAM, it is possible to identify image features when posture is correctly classified or misclassified in a pig image. By referring to these results, it is expected that the accuracy of pig posture classification can be further improved. Through this analysis and discussion, we can identify which features of pig postures in images need to be emphasized to improve the accuracy of pig posture classification. The findings of this study are anticipated to significantly improve the accuracy of pig posture classification. In practical applications, the proposed pig posture classification system holds the potential to promptly detect abnormal situations in pigsties, leading to prompt responses. Ultimately, this can greatly contribute to increased productivity in pigsty operations, fostering efficiency enhancements in pigsty management.

AB  - Aim of study: In this study, the effects of castration at different months of age on carcass and meat characteristics in goats reared under semi-extensive prolonged fattening conditions were investigated. Area of study: The experiment was conducted in the Yayladag & imath; district of Hatay province, Turkiye. Material and methods: The experiment was conducted with 48 male goats from the Kilis goat breed randomly allocated to 4 groups of 12 individuals each. Intact goats (uncastrated goats) functioned as the control group. Each of the other 3 groups was castrated using burdizzo forceps at the 4(th), 6(th), and 8(th) months after birth. During the experiment, all goats were exposed to the same management and feeding conditions. The effects of castration age on growth, carcass and slaughter parameters, as well as the muscle characteristics of the Longissimus thoracis, Semitendinosus, Psoas major, Triceps brachii, and Vastus lateralis were investigated. Main results: At the end of the fattening period, castration at 4-months age increased the weight of muscle tissue (P <0.05) and fat deposition (P <0.001). Additionally, an increase in intramuscular fat and tenderness of the meat, and a decrease in redness and cooking loss were observed with castration at 6-months age (P <0.05). Despite the increase in adiposity with early castration, the oleic acid and the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids (UFA:SFA), hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic index (h/H) and Delta(9) desaturase index of the meat tended to increase as the castration age decreased. In conclusion, the most appropriate castration age is at 6-months in terms of growth performance and at 4-and/or 6-months in terms of meat quality. Research highlights: Castration of goats at the correct age plays a crucial role in managing herd dynamics, enhancing meat quality, improving efficiency, and meeting market demands in goat farming.

AB  - Chinese forest musk deer (FMD), an endangered species, have exhibited low reproductive rates even in captivity due to stress conditions. Investigation revealed the presence of di(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), an environmental endocrine disruptor, in the serum and skin of captive FMDs. Feeding FMDs with maslinic acid (MA) has been observed to alleviate the stress response and improve reproductive rates, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the alleviation of DEHP-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in primary peritubular myoid cells (PMCs) through MA intake. Primary PMCs were isolated and exposed to DEHP in vitro . The results demonstrated that DEHP significantly suppressed antioxidant levels and promoted cell apoptosis in primary PMCs. Moreover, interfering with the expression of PRDX6 was found to induce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell apoptosis in primary PMCs. Supplementation with MA significantly upregulated the expression of PRDX6, thereby attenuating DEHP-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in primary PMCs. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for mitigating stress levels and enhancing reproductive capacity of in captive FMDs.

AB  - The accumulation of ovarian granulosa cell (GC) apoptosis underlies follicular atresia. By comparing the previous sequencing results, miR-486 was found to be differentially expressed at higher levels in the monotocous goat than in the polytocous goat. Unfortunately, the miRNA-mediated mechanisms by which the GC fate is regulated are unknown in Guanzhong dairy goats. Therefore, we investigated miR-486 expression in small and large follicles, as well as its impact on normal GC survival, apoptosis and autophagy in vitro. Here, we identified and characterized miR-486 interaction with Ser/Arg-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) using luciferase reporter analysis, detecting its role in GC survival, apoptosis and autophagy regulation through qRT-PCR, Western blot, CCK-8, EdU, flow cytometry, mitochondrial membrane potential and monodansylcadaverine, etc. Our findings revealed prominent effects of miR-486 in the regulation of GC survival, apoptosis and autophagy by targeting SRSF3, which might explain the high differential expression of miR-486 in the ovaries of monotocous dairy goats. In summary, this study aimed to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-486 regulation on GC function and its effect on ovarian follicle atresia in dairy goats, as well as the functional interpretation of the downstream target gene SRSF3.

AB  - In mammals, sex determination is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, redirecting gonadal development from forming ovaries to testes. Mutations or alterations in the SRY gene can significantly affect phenotypic changes and lineage-specific markers. This study aims to elucidate the role of the SRY gene in buffalo embryos using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We designed a crRNA targeting the HMG domain of the SRY gene using the CRISPOR algorithm. Nucleofection of sgRNA-Cas9 RNPs into buffalo fibroblasts confirmed efficient cleavage at the targeted site. Using this validated guide, we investigated the role of the SRY gene in sexual determination by electroporating CRISPR-Cas9-RNPs into single-stage zygotes of buffalo. Genetic changes in the SRY gene were confirmed through sequencing, revealing mosaic blastocysts with multiple alleles and non-mosaic mutants. Mutations in SRY gene increased the expression of female lineage-specific gene Wnt4 whereas decreased the expression of male specific gene SOX9 in blastocysts, suggesting reprogramming towards female sex determination pathways. Our findings provide insights into buffalo sex differentiation mechanisms and potential applications in reproductive strategies for breeding programmes.

AB  - Fecal contamination in water poses a serious threat to public health and the ecological environment. Numerous qPCR-based methods have been used to identify the source of fecal contamination, but this method relies on expensive equipment, well-established laboratory conditions, and experienced personnel, significantly reducing the timeliness of identifying contamination sources. Here, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for tracking the sources of fecal contamination to rapid identifying and quantifying humans, ruminants, pigs, and poultry fecal contamination. The results demonstrated that LAMP assay enabled us to easily and quickly (<30 min) detect associated gene of the host gut microbes for tracking of fecal contamination sources, exhibiting a same detection level of 100 gene copies/mu L as lab-based qPCR. Compared to LAMP molecular markers of other bacterial genera and bacteriophages, the LAMP molecular markers of Bacteroidales showed a higher sensitivity and detection concentration. The majority of the non-target species (96.9%) showed little effect on the LAMP marker genes of the target species. Moreover, the LAMP assay was used to identify a multiple fecal contamination and spatial distribution characteristics in the Liuxi River basin. The detection frequency and abundance of human-associated marker genes were the highest, followed by pig-associated marker gene; the mean concentration of human- and pig-associated marker gene in tributaries were higher than that in the mainstem. This LAMP assay could be used to easily and quickly identify the sources of fecal contamination and contribute in the control and treatment of fecal contamination in water.

AB  - Astronauts during interplanetary missions will be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation, including charged particles like Fe-56. Most preclinical studies with mature, "astronaut-aged" rodents suggest space radiation diminishes performance in classical hippocampal- and prefrontal cortex-dependent tasks. However, a rodent cognitive touchscreen battery unexpectedly revealed Fe-56 radiation improves the performance of C57BL/6J male mice in a hippocampal-dependent task (discrimination learning) without changing performance in a striatal-dependent task (rule-based learning). As there are conflicting results on whether the female rodent brain is preferentially injured by or resistant to charged particle exposure, and as the proportion of female vs. male astronauts is increasing, further study on how charged particles influence the touchscreen cognitive performance of female mice is warranted. We hypothesized that, similar to mature male mice, mature female C57BL/6J mice exposed to fractionated whole-body Fe-56 irradiation (3 x 6.7cGy Fe-56 over 5 days, 600 MeV/n) would improve performance vs. Sham conditions in touchscreen tasks relevant to hippocampal and prefrontal cortical function [e.g., location discrimination reversal (LDR) and extinction, respectively]. In LDR, Fe-56 female mice more accurately discriminated two discrete conditioned stimuli relative to Sham mice, suggesting improved hippocampal function. However, Fe-56 and Sham female mice acquired a new simple stimulus-response behavior and extinguished this acquired behavior at similar rates, suggesting similar prefrontal cortical function. Based on prior work on multiple memory systems, we next tested whether improved hippocampal-dependent function (discrimination learning) came at the expense of striatal stimulus-response rule-based habit learning (visuomotor conditional learning). Interestingly, Fe-56 female mice took more days to reach criteria in this striatal-dependent rule-based test relative to Sham mice. Together, our data support the idea of competition between memory systems, as an Fe-56-induced decrease in striatal-based learning is associated with enhanced hippocampal-based learning. These data emphasize the power of using a touchscreen-based battery to advance our understanding of the effects of space radiation on mission critical cognitive function in females, and underscore the importance of preclinical space radiation risk studies measuring multiple cognitive processes, thereby preventing NASA's risk assessments from being based on a single cognitive domain.

AB  - Evolutionary innovations generate phenotypic and species diversity. Elucidating the genomic processes underlying such innovations is central to understanding biodiversity. In this study, we addressed the genomic basis of evolutionary novelties in the glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis, GWSS), an agricultural pest. Prominent evolutionary innovations in leafhoppers include brochosomes, proteinaceous structures that are excreted and used to coat the body, and obligate symbiotic associations with two bacterial types that reside within cytoplasm of distinctive cell types. Using PacBio long-read sequencing and Dovetail Omni-C technology, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly for the GWSS and then validated the assembly using flow cytometry and karyotyping. Additional transcriptomic and proteomic data were used to identify novel genes that underlie brochosome production. We found that brochosome-associated genes include novel gene families that have diversified through tandem duplications. We also identified the locations of genes involved in interactions with bacterial symbionts. Ancestors of the GWSS acquired bacterial genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and these genes appear to contribute to symbiont support. Using a phylogenomics approach, we inferred HGT sources and timing. We found that some HGT events date to the common ancestor of the hemipteran suborder Auchenorrhyncha, representing some of the oldest known examples of HGT in animals. Overall, we show that evolutionary novelties in leafhoppers are generated by the combination of acquiring novel genes, produced both de novo and through tandem duplication, acquiring new symbiotic associations that enable use of novel diets and niches, and recruiting foreign genes to support symbionts and enhance herbivory.

AB  - Since the discovery of Venta Micena in 1976 until now, the Orce archaeopalaeontological sites (Guadix Baza basin) in the northern part of Granada have contributed significantly to the body of knowledge on Early Pleistocene ecosystem dynamics. The exceptional fossil accumulation at Venta Micena stands out, housing important examples of early Pleistocene European faunas. Additionally, the discovery of new sites such as Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva 3 has yielded evidence of some of the oldest human presence in western Eurasia, alongside bones bearing cut and percussion marks made by stone tools. These discoveries were made by using novel techniques and methodology, allowing for new interpretations of the fossil record. Integration of artificial intelligence and geometric morphometrics applied to fossil studies contributed to better understanding of the genesis of the sites, and to unravelling the role of humans and other mammals in creating fossil accumulations at the Orce sites. At Barranco Le & oacute;n, Canis mosbachensis was found to be the most active carnivore and not, as earlier thought, the large hyaena Pachycrocuta brevirostris. At Fuente Nueva 3, large saber-toothed cats seem to be the top consumers of carcasses. This evidence suggests the existence of more complex associations between humans and various carnivorous taxa.

AB  - The predatory ring-legged earwig, Euborellia annulipes (Lucas, 1847) (Dermaptera: Anisolabididae), exhibits omnivorous feeding habits, enabling it to incorporate non-prey items into its diet. This behavior is thought to offer additional needed benefits from the occasional consumption of plant material. This study examined the hypothesis that herbivory of E. annulipes on various species of cultivated Brassica has a positive effect on its biological traits and is influenced by the availability of essential food sources. The provisioned plant material (pieces of leaf) consisted of the following Brassica species: pak choi cabbage, Portuguese cabbage, cabbage, and radish did not improve the biological performance of the earwig when compared to a diet without plant material. Nevertheless, 66.0% of the second instar nymphs developed successfully when fed only pak choi cabbage, and 43.3% did so when fed solely on Portuguese cabbage. Herbivory by E. annulipes on brassicas occurred in the presence and absence of a diet, although it was significantly more pronounced when no other food sources were available. Among the four Brassica species studied, pak choi cabbage exhibited the highest feeding frequency and consumption rate. Additionally, pak choi cabbage grown under controlled conditions and exposed to routine releases of earwigs showed no reduction in productivity. These findings indicate that E. annulipes can consume brassica leaves, demonstrating species-specific variations in this consumption. However, conditions of food scarcity lead to increased consumption of plant material, while repeated releases of earwigs do not affect the growth and yield of pak choi cabbage plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Swine reproduction efficiency is determined by the fertility potential of the sow and sperm quality. The objective of this study is to compare boar sperm motility and kinematic features to evaluate their relationships with reproductive success after artificial insemination (AI). In this study, the movement patterns of boar ejaculates were analyzed by a computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA)-Mot system, and the kinematic values of ejaculate clusters were assessed. The semen of the Pietrain boars showed more linear trajectory of the spermatozoa, while curvilinear velocity and oscillatory movement characterized the semen of the Duroc x Pietrain boars. The offspring of sows inseminated with Pietrain boars showed significantly lower number of stillbirths. In addition, ejaculate grouping into clusters did not have a predictive capacity on litter size variables. Nevertheless, the kinematic variables of the ejaculate may have a predictive, albeit reduced, capacity regarding litter size variables. The results of this study therefore open up possibilities for future assessments of fertility. The aim was to determine the relationship between kinematic parameters of boar spermatozoa and fertility rates of sow, as well as to assess the effect of sperm clusters on the fertility capacity of the ejaculate. Semen samples were collected from 11 sexually mature boars. Samples were analyzed by an ISAS(R)v1 CASA-Mot system for eight kinematic parameters. Ejaculate clusters were characterized using multivariate procedures, such as principal factors (PFs) analysis and clustering methods (the k-means model). Four different ejaculate clusters were identified from two kinematic PFs which involved linear trajectory and velocity. There were differences (p < 0.05) between the sperm kinematic variables by sire line. There was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between dam lines and ejaculate clusters in fertility variables. The discriminant ability of the different kinematics of sperm variables to predict litter size fertility was analyzed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Curvilinear velocity (VCL), average path velocity (VAP), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), and beat-cross frequency (BCF) showed significant, albeit limited, predictive capacity for litter size fertility variables (range: 0.55-0.58 area under curve, AUC). The kinematic analysis of the ejaculates in clusters did not have a predictive capacity for litter size variables.

AB  - The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between lamb and ewe behaviors in postnatal 3hour and lamb survival using machine learning (ML) algorithms and to determine the best ML classifier to predict lamb survival. The research data consisted of postnatal 3-hour behavior records of 43 Kivircik ewes and their 65 lambs, along with preweaning survival information of lambs. The prediction of lamb survival was performed on three datasets containing different features using decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron, logistic regression, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors, and boosting (B) ML algorithms. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score values of the RF algorithm were 0.931, and the area under curve value was 0.966 for dataset 1, which included parity of dam, birth type and sex of lamb, and birth weight predictors, as well as postnatal lamb and ewe behaviors as features. In dataset 2, which includes principal component scores instead of lamb and ewe behaviors, the RF approach made classification with an accuracy of 0.909. In dataset 3, which includes the maternal behavior score as a feature, the RF and SVM algorithms showed similar performance (0.909 accuracy). These results indicate that, by using lamb and ewe behaviors in the postnatal 3-hour with ML methods, it is possible to classify lambs as either surviving or dying before weaning with high accuracy. In addition, it was determined that the ML algorithm that best adapted to the current study data was the RF classifier. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Changing agricultural practices and wetland loss have resulted in the decline in abundance of King Rail (Rallus elegans) populations throughout the southeastern United States, including within the historical breeding range of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley region in eastern Arkansas. Despite a recent increase in coordinated efforts to improve monitoring program for secretive marsh birds and to track trends in population status of the King Rail, successful observations of reproduction by the species are rare throughout much of the historical breeding range. During a field visit and birding trip on 15 June 2018, we obtained photographic documentation of adult and juvenile King Rails in an emergent marsh impoundment on the Freddie Black Choctaw Island Wildlife Management Area Deer Research West Unit in Desha County, Arkansas (eBird Checklist S46788433). This emergent marsh wetland is a product of intensive wetland restoration through the Wetland Reserve Program. This is the first documented observation of King Rail reproduction in Arkansas since 2006. This observation provides a tribute to the Wetland Reserve Program and demonstrates the impacts wetland restoration can have on species of greatest conservation concern. Lastly, the observation is a tribute to the active management program of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission aimed to maintain important emergent marsh wetland habitat conditions for migratory waterbirds during the breeding season.

AB  - Lipid compositions of mammalian erythrocyte membranes are different among species. Therefore, the information on hemolysis from mammalian erythrocytes is useful to understand membrane properties of human erythrocytes. In this work, pressure-induced hemolysis and hypotonic one were examined using erythrocytes of human, sheep, cow, cat, dog, pig, horse, rat, and mouse. Pressure-induced hemolysis was suppressed by membrane sphingomyelin, whereas hypotonic hemolysis decreased upon increment of cell diameter. Mass spectra of erythrocyte membrane lipids demonstrated that sphingomyelin with an acyl chain 24:1 was associated with the suppression of pressure-induced hemolysis. In cow erythrocytes, pressure-induced hemolysis was greatly suppressed and the detachment of cytoskeletal proteins from the membrane under hypotonic conditions was also inhibited. Taken together, these results suggest that sphingomyelin with 24:1 fatty acid plays an important role in the stability of the erythrocyte membrane, perhaps via cholesterol.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) has been implicated in the global decline of insect populations. Causal mechanisms contributing to declines remain unclear, however. Here we examine causal factors which could link some declining terrestrial insect populations with ALAN. To do so, we defined the closest and furthest halves of individual bushes according to the nearest source of artificial light. We sampled leaves and invertebrates from both sides to determine herbivory and abundance. First, we observed that, within bushes, leaves were significantly more likely to display herbivory at closer distances to established streetlighting. This may be due to the phenomenon of positive phototaxis in insects (flight to light). Further, insects within bushes were significantly more abundant on the side closest to streetlighting at midnight, but not at midday, when lights are unilluminated. Consequently, we argue that ALAN creates bottom-up trophic effects, driven by insect light attraction behaviours even at the scale of single plants.

The data indicate that the ELF-EMF may affect factors related to epigenetic regulation and alter important biological processes in the uterus. The impact of the ELF-EMF on apoptosis and oxidative-stress-related genes has not been documented in porcine endometrium. This raises the question of whether the exposure to the ELF-EMF can induce apoptosis and/or oxidative stress in the endometrium of pigs during the peri-implantation period. Porcine endometrial slices (100 +/- 5 mg) collected (n = 5) during the peri-implantation period were treated in vitro with ELF-EMF at a frequency of 50 Hz and flux density of 8 x 104 mG for 2 h. To determine the effect of ELF-EMF on apoptosis and oxidative stress in the endometrium, CASP3, CASP7, CIDEB, GADD45G, NOS1, NOS2, NOS3, and TP53I3 mRNA transcript were analyzed using real-time PCR, and protein abundance of CASP3, CASP7 using Western blot, and eNOS using ELISA were determined. Moreover, CASP3/7 and NOS activity was analyzed using flow cytometry and colorimetry, respectively. The decreased CASP7 and increased NOS3 mRNA transcript and protein abundance in ELF-EMF-treated endometrium were observed. Moreover, CIDEB, GADD45G, and TP53I3 mRNA transcript abundance was increased. Only p <= 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference. The documented alterations indicate the potential of the ELF-EMF to affect apoptosis and generate oxidative stress in the endometrium. The insight into observed consequences documents for the first time the fact that the ELF-EMF may influence endometrial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and/or tissue receptivity during peri-implantation.

AB  - Plant-insect interactions in the fossil record are, as yet, sparsely known and understudied. Here, we document evidence of a new type of insect skeletonization on Abroma augustum (L.) L. f. (Malvaceac) leaf remains from the latest Neogene (Pliocene) sediments of Chotanagpur plateau, Jharkhand, eastern India. This unique skeletonization feeding trace attributable to herbivorous insects occurs all over the surfaces of our recovered Pliocene leaf remains. In the skeletonized area, the interveinal tissues are completely removed leaving behind only the tough leaf veins. This type of insect feeding behaviour is documented for the first time on Indian Cenozoic leaf remains. Based on published data, as well as our survey of modem forests adjacent to the fossil locality, we suggest that probable damage inducers of this skeletonization on Abroma Jacq. fossil leaves might be Chrysomelid (Coleopteran) beetles. This finding also reveals that specific insect feeding damage, such as the one presented here, can reveal similarity of environments despite the difference of plant species observed. Such results strengthen the importance of using plant-insect interactions on leaves as a complementary proxy to others revealing paleoenvironmental conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herbivore-induced volatiles were extracted from fresh healthy jasmine plants (Jasminum sambac L.) and infested jasmine plants damaged by two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae and analyzed through Gas Chromatography -Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine volatile hydrocarbon profile in them. Further, olfactometer behavioral bioassay was conducted to investigate the preference of the predator, Scolothrips sexmaculatus to the emitted volatiles. The results revealed that both the healthy and plants infested with two-spotted mites had emitted organic volatile compounds (VOC's) numbering 19 and 31 respectively and some compounds were detected twice or even thrice. The variation in the volatile constituents of healthy and damaged plants clearly depicts the emission of volatiles responsible for attracting beneficials witnessing tritrophic interactions in jasmine ecosystem. The mite infested plants emanated potential natural enemy attractants such as ally isothocyanate, styrene, naphthalene, Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and several other organic compounds. The compound allyl isothiocyanate was detected in two-spotted mite infested jasmine extracts at 4.307 mts in a peak area of 1664139 mm2. Allyl isothiocyanate serves the plant as a defense against herbivores; since it is harmful to the plant. Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a six-carbon compound was detected due to herbivory of mite infested plants in a peak area of 4112779391 mm2 implying its maximum presence. Dicacodyl phthalate, another compound, was detected in a peak area of 20400249 mm2 at 30.97 mins. The healthy jasmine plants emanated natural enemy attractants, linalool, methyl salicylate and alpha-farnesene, aside from other volatile organic compounds. In the olfactometer behavioural bioassay studies, maximum number of released mite predator, S. sexmaculatus, oriented on mite infested jasmine plant volatiles (18.5 nos), and healthy plant volatiles (5.5 nos). The volatile organic compounds detected in enormous quantities in mite infested jasmine plants is a positive cue for commercial preparation of artificial lures to attract mite natural enemies in jasmine ecosystem. The predatory thrips lured to mite infested volatiles enrolls an encouraging sign to be exploited in integrated management of mites to enhance the efficacy of potential natural enemies of two-spotted spider mites.

AB  - Body temperature is one of the important indicators that reflect the health of pigs. The traditional rectal temperature measurement is inconvenient and time-consuming, and also easy to cause stress responses to pigs. Infrared Thermography (ITG) was supposed to have potentials to realize non-invasive and rapid temperature detection for pigs in intensive pig farming. In this paper, an automatic temperature detection method base on ITG was developed. First, temperatures on six regions on pig body surface (i.e., forehead (FH), eyes, nose, ear root (ET), back and anus) were measured by ITG for the region of interest (ROI) selection; Then, an improved model of YOLOv5s-BiFPN was developed for automatic ROI detection and temperature extraction. A dataset with 2797 images that collected from sixteen pigs for 30 days was used for model development. It was shown that temperatures on FH and ET were supposed to be the ROI for ITG temperature detection and because of their strong correlations with the rectal temperature among the six parts on pig body surface. Also, the maximum temper-ature (MaxT) on FH and ET could reflect pig's body temperature variations the best. The proposed model of YOLOv5s-BiFPN achieved optimal performances (e.g., the mAP was 96.36%, outperformance was 20 MB, target detection speed was up to 100 frame/s), and the mAPs were increased by 4.85%, 4.38%, 1.60%, 1.56%, 31.52%, and 22.42% compared with models of CenterNet, Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4, YOLOv5s, Nanodet and YOLOv5n, respectively. Therefore, it is a feasible way for pig body temperature automatic detection and facilitates early staged disease warning and environmental control.

AB  - Biohybrid approaches (where living and engineered components are combined) provide new opportunities for advancing animal behaviour research and its applications. This review article and accompanying special issue explores how different types of novel technologies can be used in the field of animal behaviour from three perspectives: (1) comprehension, (2) application and (3) integration. Under the perspective of 'comprehension,' we present examples of how technologies like virtual animals or robots can be used in experimental settings to interact with living animals in a standardized manner. Such interactions can advance our understanding of fundamental topics such as mate choice, social learning and collective behaviour. Under 'application,' we investigate the potential for technologies to monitor, react and interact with animals in a variety of scenarios. For example, we discuss how drones can be used to keep large herbivores away from valuable crops and robotic predators to deter invasive species. Under 'integration,' we discuss possibilities for the coexistence of engineered and biological systems, augmenting the capacity or resilience of either or both components. Integration can be physical, for example, livestock can have sensors sit in their inner body for temperature monitoring, or within the environment, where sensors or robots monitor and interact with animals, such as a short-term earthquake forecasting method. Based upon these three themes, we discuss and classify existing biohybrid animal behaviour research, including the four articles included in our special issue. We also consider the ethics of this emerging field, highlight the advantages and potential issues associated with using technologies to create biohybrid systems and emphasize how such technologies can support the advancement of animal behaviour research.

AB  - In this work, five microcosms containing polluted soil and the organics and inorganics stimulants were set up and undergone during five months. The sample was originated from an oil refinery located in the south of Algeria with 77.15 +/- 0.1 g/kg of TPHs. We have evaluated the performance of the biostimulation by residual TPHs, composition of hydrocarbon residues by GC, microbial growth and eco-toxicity using Hordeum vulgare. Three bacterial were isolated from contaminated soil and characterised by MALDI-TOF. At the end of the experimental, we obtained a reduction of TPHs to 30.66 +/- 1.15 g/kg. The results from GC showed the disappearance of major hydrocarbons pics within the treated microcosm. In the uncontaminated medium, the germination rate was higher than in the contaminated soil. A remarkable increase in the rate was observed in the seeds put in the treated medium to reach a percentage higher than 80%.

AB  - We offer a perspective on the major challenges that are confronting the management of reproduction in sheep and cattle in Australia and New Zealand, over the next two decades. An important context is the dominance of grazing systems in which large flocks or herds are managed over large areas where it is challenging to manage reproduction with precision. Consequently, the variable forage supply usually dominates reproductive outcomes, a problem that will be exacerbated by global heating. Thus, in extensive grazing systems, there is a great need for technological solutions to improve the management of nutrition. Global heating will also exert direct effects on reproductive function. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, reproduction will remain a focus for industry. In addition, as the industries develop, we foresee continued societal pressure to reduce medication, mitigate environmental damage, and improve animal well-being. Management solutions for extensive grazing systems must involve minimal interventions with the animals and be applicable to diverse genotypes and environments. Clearly, genetics and breeding will be at the heart of solutions and elegant strategies will be needed that focus on developing animals that are robust, if perhaps a little less productive. A high rate of genetic gain is the main reason for pursuing reproductive technologies, but highly advanced reproductive technology is not likely to be the best fit in extensive management systems. Even for AI, the simplest technology, uptake is limited and lateral thinking is needed to find ways to improve the rates of genetic gain. We conclude that there are many opportunities for improving reproductive performance in sheep and cattle in Australia and New Zealand. As we gain deeper understanding of the processes involved, we should be able to make progress in fertility and fecundity, embryo survival, and postnatal survival. Improvements in reproductive performance will increase productivity, and should also be associated with significantly improved animal wellbeing and a reduction in methane emissions intensity. To capture these benefits, the development of new management options will require lateral thinking about reproductive technology for extensive grazing systems, and a transdisciplinary approach that brings together the systems biology of grazing animals with an understanding of the barriers to adoption by farmers.

AB  - The pteropod community structure in the oceanic waters of the southern Gulf of Mexico (sGoM) was analyzed in June 2015. For the first time, we used an integrative morphological and molecular approach for pteropod identification in the sGoM. A total of 32 pteropod taxa were morphologically identified from the oceanic waters of which 12 were successfully sequenced, at least for one of the loci implemented (COI and 28S). The molecular data support the taxonomic identity of half of them. However, despite the morphological differences in the other six taxa, the molecular evidence displayed low genetic variability, resulting in a resolution to the genus level. During the sampling campaign, the oceanographic conditions were very homogeneous in all the sampled areas, with high surface temperatures (SST >27.5 degrees C) and low chlorophyll (CHL <0.5) concentrations. Nevertheless, CHL presented a positive and significant correlation with total pteropod abundance, herbivores abundance and carnivores abundance, suggesting a bottom-up control of the pteropod community. The ecological analysis showed that four species accounted for 63% of the pteropod abundance: Heliconoides inflatus, Creseis conica, Limacina trochiformis and Creseis acicula. The cluster analysis showed the presence of four assemblages, named after their distribution and species composition. The oceanic assemblage presented a wide distribution over the sampled area, characterized by a set of oceanic species such as H. inflatus, Styliola subula and Limacina lesueurii, with no apparent correlation with the measured environmental variables. The coastal oceanic assemblage presented the highest pteropod abundances; it was characterized by the dominance of the neritic species C. conica and L. trochiformis, and significant positive correlation with CHL concentration. The other two assemblages were distributed in the vicinity of an anticyclonic eddy with high stratification and low CHL values in the northwest, and presented a mixed dominance among the oceanic species H. inflatus, C. acicula and S. subula. The oceanic assemblage is suggested as the basal pteropod community in the sGoM. It is modified by the deflection of the coastal current in the southeast that transports nutrients and biota into the oceanic domain and produce relative enrichment of the CHL concentration. The presence of a Loop Current anticyclonic eddy in the northwest, increases the stratification and accentuates the oligotrophic conditions, leading to a different pteropod community well adapted to those oligotrophic conditions.

AB  - Folate is essential for DNA synthesis and methylation via one-carbon (C1) metabolism during embryonic development. It is transported into the developing oocytes via folate receptors (FOLR1 and FOLR2) and transporters (RFC1) for utilization during embryo development. However, the role of folate receptors during pre-implantation stages of embryos is not well known. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the expression of folate transport genes and proteins in mature oocytes and pre-implantation embryos and the effect of FOLR1 knockdown in zygotes on blastocyst outcome. For this, immature goat oocytes were matured in maturation medium followed by in vitro fertilization and culture at standard conditions. A group of zygotes was transfected with esiRNA against FOLR1 and in vitro cultured for blastocyst outcome assessment. The transcripts and proteins for FOLR1, FOLR2 and RFC1 were present in oocytes as well as all the stages of pre-implantation embryos. Immunofluorescence revealed the presence of FOLR1 in the nuclei of embryos but not in the metaphase (matured) oocytes. The knockdown of FOLR1 in embryos was effective and significantly reduced the blastocyst production rate. The present study demonstrates the existence of active folate transport in oocytes and pre-implantation goat embryos. FOLR1 is vital for pre-implantation embryo development and may aid in the progression by functioning as a transcription factor.

AB  - The article presents evidence about the Middle Palaeolithic and Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition interval in the karst area of the Danube Gorges in the Lower Danube Basin. We review the extant data and present new evidence from two recently investigated sites found on the Serbian side of the Danube River - Tabula Traiana and Dubocka-Kozja caves. The two sites have yielded layers dating to both the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic and have been investigated by the application of modern standards of excavation and recovery along with a suite of state-of-the-art analytical procedures. The presentation focuses on micromorphological analyses of the caves' sediments, characterisation of cryptotephra, a suite of new radiometric dates (accelerator mass spectrometry and optically stimulated luminescence) as well as proteomics (zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry) and stable isotope data in discerning patterns of human occupation of these locales over the long term.

AB  - Thrips are one of the most challenging pests in agricultural crops, including Chrysanthemum. In this study we tested via two plant assays whether solutions containing sticky rice germ oil (RGO) droplets could effectively trap thrips and lower thrips damage on Chrysanthemum. In the first assay, we additionally assessed the metabolomic effects of these RGO droplet sprays and thrips presence on plant chemistry via 1H NMR and headspace GC-MS on multiple timepoints to investigate which plant metabolites were affected by spraying and their potential relation to plant resistance against thrips. In the second assay, we tested the individual RGO solution constituents against thrips. Our results suggested that the adhesive RGO droplets were not effective as a physical trap as only three out of 600 adult thrips were caught at the achieved coverage. However, average thrips damage was still reduced up to 50% and no negative effects on plant growth were observed up to 25 days. Results from the second plant assay indicated that the individual constituents of the solution containing RGO droplets may have direct effects against thrips. Metabolomics analysis of sprayed leaves via headspace GC-MS and 1H NMR indicated that fatty acids and several volatile compounds such as 4(10)-thujene (sabinene), eucalyptol, cis-4-thujanol, and isocaryophyllene were highest on day 10, while sucrose, malic acid, o-Cymene, and 3-Methyl-2-butenoic acid were highest on day 25. Plants with thrips showed higher flavonoid, carbohydrate and glutamine acetic acid levels, and lower fatty acids and malic acid levels. RGO application increased the levels of fatty acids and alcohols present on top of and inside the Chrysanthemum leaves, while decreasing the concentrations of volatile compounds such as eucalyptol, chrysanthenone and eugenol in the Chrysanthemum leaves. Most interestingly, the thrips effect on the plant metabolome was no longer visible in RGO treated plants at the later harvesttime, suggesting that RGO application may overrule or prevent the metabolomic effects of thrips infestation. In conclusion, our study provides new information on how the application of a new plant-based plant protection product affects insect herbivores and alters crop phytochemistry for improved herbivore resistance.

AB  - The influence of bakery waste (BAWA) in the diet of black goat kids on nutrient intake, health, growth potential, and carcass features was assessed. Three treatment diets, consisting of 0 BAWA (CON), 50 g/kg BAWA (BAWA50), and 100 BAWA (BAWA100) of dietary dry matter (DM), were administered to 27 male kids (initial body weight = 17.43 +/- kg; age = 105 +/- 3.5 days) at random (9/treatment). Bakery waste was included in diets BAWA50 and BAWA100, replacing some of the barley grain. The study lasted for 70 days (7 days used for adaptation and 63 days used for data collection). Kids in the BAWA100 group consumed considerably more (p < 0.01) DM, crude protein (CP), and metabolizable energy than those in the BAWA50 and CON groups. However, intakes of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and ether extract (EE) were similar (p >= 0.08) among the treatment diets. The kids' initial and final body weights, total growth, and average daily weight were not substantially impacted (p >= 0.13) by the addition of BAWA. All diets had similar feed efficiency when it came to converting feed into body weight increases (p >= 0.11). Nevertheless, the BAWA diet yielded a considerably lower cost gain (p = 0.04) than the CON diet. The three treatment groups had no differences (p >= 0.15) in DM, ADF, NDF, and EE digestibility. However, compared to the CON group, the digestibility of CP tended to improve (p = 0.07) in the BAWA100 and BAWA50 groups. The three experimental groups' nitrogen (N) intakes did not differ significantly from one another (p > 0.33). Additionally, the three diets' N retention percentage and grams/d were equivalent (p > 0.33). Several carcass metrics, such as dressing percentage, hot and cold carcass weights, fasting live weight, and non-carcass components, were not significantly affected (p > 0.23) by the addition of BAWA. Additionally, no differences in carcass cut weights were found. The inclusion of BAWA100 and BAWA50 increased loin cut weight (p = 0.043) and total lean muscle weight (p = 0.001) compared to the CON group. Other components, such as intermuscular fat, subcutaneous fat, total fat, total bone, meat-to-bone ratio, and meat-to-fat ratio, were similar among the three diet groups. Concerning carcass linear dimension measurements, only rib fat depth was greater (p = 0.008) in kids fed the BAWA100 diet compared to the BAWA50 and CON diets. No significant variation was observed among the treatments concerning various physicochemical properties of the longissimus dorsi muscle in the black goat kids. All measured serum metabolites and hematological parameters were not affected by the incorporation of BAWA into the diet. In summary, the inclusion of 50 and 100 g/kg BAWA in the diet had comparable effects on the black goat kids' feed intake, digestibility, growth performance, carcass characteristics, meat quality, and overall health. Importantly, feed costs can be reduced by using up to 100 g/kg of BAWA on a DM basis.

AB  - An innovative plant growth monitoring and environmental control platform is designed and implemented in this study. In addition to using multi-band artificial light sources for plant growth and development, an artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) approach is also utilised for environmental parameter monitoring, control, and the recording of plant growth traits and diseases. The five LED bands are white (5000 K), cool white (5500 K), blue (peak: 450 nm), red (660 nm), and light red (630 nm). The tea plant (Camellia sinensis f. formosana) is irradiated using lighting-emitting diodes (LED) composed of bands of different wavelengths. In addition, the number of leaves, contour area of the leaves, and leaf colour during the growth period of two varieties of tea plants (Taicha No. 18 and Taicha No. 8) under different irradiation intensities are analysed. Morphological image processing and deep learning models are simultaneously used to obtain plant growth characterization traits and diseases. The effect of the spectral distribution of the light source on the growth response of tea leaves and the effect of disease suppression are not fully understood. This study depicts how light quality affects the lighting formula changes in tea plants under controlled environments. The experimental results show that in three wavelength ranges (360-500 nm, 500-600 nm, and 600-760 nm), the light intensity ratio was 2.5:2.0:5.5 when the illuminance intensity was about 150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) with a photoperiod of 20:4 (dark); this enabled more leaves, a smaller contour area of the leaves, and a light green colour of the leaves of the tea plant (Taicha No. 18). In addition, during the lighting treatment, when the ratio of the band with an irradiation intensity of 360-500 nm to that with an irradiation intensity of 500-600 nm was 2:1.5, it resulted in a better leaf disease inhibition effect. When the light intensity was increased to more than 400 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), it had little effect on the growth and development of the tea plants and the inhibition of diseases. The results of the study also found that there was a significant difference between the colour of the leaves and the relative chlorophyll content of the tea trees. Finally, the tea plant growth response data obtained from manual records and automatic records are compared and discussed. The accuracy rates of leaf number and disease were 94% and 87%, respectively. Compared with the results of manual measurement and recording, the errors were about 3-15%, which verified the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed solution. The innovative platform provides a data-driven crop modeling application for plant factories.

AB  - Pig production in Ireland has gone through enormous changes during the past 60 yr, from pigs being primarily produced as a sideline on dairy farms, to an industry with one of the highest average herd sizes in Europe. This happened in part due to external pressure on the industry, whereby economies of scale were needed to compete with pigs produced in other countries, but largely due to the instigation of national programmes to support the pig industry through research, education and knowledge transfer. These efforts helped producers to take advantage of genetic improvements and monitor their own performance over time, as well as allowing for benchmarking of the national herd against other countries. The research programme initiated in the 1960s continues to grow and expand, providing the pig industry with internationally renowned data and knowledge in the areas of nutrition, animal welfare, the environment and energy use. Recent initiatives such as the establishment of the Teagasc and promote further cross-collaboration between stakeholders in the pig industry, and enable it to rise to the challenges of the years ahead.

AB  - The black rhinoceros (rhino) (Diceros bicornis) is critically endangered, with poaching being one of several threats to the species' survival. Many reserves across several countries, including Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, now dehorn their rhinos in an attempt to reduce poaching. Historical data collected by the Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry, and Tourism and Save the Rhino Trust were used to investigate whether dehorning has an effect on age at first reproduction (AFR), inter-calving interval (ICI), birth sex ratios, calf survival, cause of death, and lifespan. These were assessed in four Namibian sub-populations (hereafter referred to as 'populations') of black rhino (denoted A, B, C, and D) which have undergone varying levels of dehorning. No significant difference was found in any of the variables between dehorned and horned individuals. Population was a significant predictor of AFR (LRT = 7.433, p = 0.024) and ICI (LRT = 13.281, p = 0.004), although pairwise comparisons only found populations A and B to be significantly different (AFR: z = -2.736, p = 0.017, ICI: z = -3.705, p = 0.001). Additionally, a significantly higher number of males than females were born in population D (p = 0.021, CI = 0.544, 0.960). The main cause of death across all individuals was poaching, although there was no significant difference in the proportion of rhinos poached between dehorned and horned individuals (X-2 = 0.638, p = 0.424, n = 265). No evidence was found to suggest that dehorning has any effect on AFR, ICI, birth sex ratios, calf survival, or lifespan in the black rhino, which is reassuring in the continued use of dehorning as an anti-poaching technique in this species.

AB  - The phenotypic plasticity of flowering plants in response to herbivore damage to vegetative tissues can affect plant interactions with flower-feeding organisms. Such induced systemic responses are probably regulated by defence-related phytohormones that signal flowers to alter secondary chemistry that affects resistance to florivores. Current knowledge on the effects of damage to vegetative tissues on plant interactions with florivores and the underlying mechanisms is limited. We compared the preference and performance of two florivores on flowering Brassica nigra plants damaged by one of three herbivores feeding from roots or leaves. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we quantified expression patterns of marker genes for defence-related phytohormonal pathways, and concentrations of phytohormones and glucosinolates in buds and flowers. Florivores displayed contrasting preferences for plants damaged by herbivores feeding on roots and leaves. Chewing florivores performed better on plants damaged by folivores, but worse on plants damaged by the root herbivore. Chewing root and foliar herbivory led to specific induced changes in the phytohormone profile of buds and flowers. This resulted in increased glucosinolate concentrations for leaf-damaged plants, and decreased glucosinolate concentrations for root-damaged plants. The outcome of herbivore-herbivore interactions spanning from vegetative tissues to floral tissues is unique for the inducing root/leaf herbivore and receiving florivore combination.

AB  - Simple Summary The slow freezing of boar spermatozoa is carried out by exposure to liquid nitrogen vapors (conventional) or by using automated equipment that controls the temperature drop curve. In both cases, freezing/thawing causes a reduction in sperm functionality. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare both freezing techniques through a panel of evaluations of sperm function by CASA and flow cytometry technologies. We observed the negative effect of post-thawing incubation time on sperm motility. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the levels of free radicals, reduced lipid peroxidation, and a loss of cholesterol and markers of apoptosis, which have an impact on the better conservation of the motility of frozen boar spermatozoa with automated equipment. For this reason, the control of the temperature drop curve allows sperm functionality to be preserved. No significant differences were observed for some parameters associated with the state and preservation of the membranes.Abstract The slow freezing of boar sperm is the only way to preserve genetic material for extended periods; this can be achieved with exposure to liquid nitrogen vapors (conventional) or by using automated freezing equipment. The aim was to compare the effect of both techniques on post-thaw functionality. Boar sperm devoid of seminal plasma and resuspended in lactose-egg yolk-glycerol medium were cryopreserved. Conventional: straws were exposed to LN2 vapors; automated: using a drop curve of -39.82 degrees C center dot min-1 for 113 s from -5 to -80 degrees C during the critical period; and subsequent immersion in NL2. Cell viability, cholesterol flow, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), lipid peroxidation, peroxynitrite, superoxide anion levels, phosphatidylserine translocation, and caspase activation were evaluated by flow cytometry. In addition, total motility (TM) and progressive motility (PM) were determined by the SCA system immediately (T0), 60 (T60), and 120 min (T120) post-thawing. Automated freezing significantly reduces cholesterol flow and free radical and lipid peroxidation levels, making it possible to preserve motility for 120 min of incubation. At the same time, viability, acrosome integrity, MMP, and caspase activation did not differ from the conventional technique. In conclusion, controlling the temperature drop curve using automated freezing equipment reduces oxidative/nitrosative stress, preserving membrane fluidity and sperm motility.

AB  - Cabbage is an annual vegetable crop species cultivated throughout the year. The development of high-yielding cabbage hybrids and the optimization of several agronomic management practices such as fertilization and crop rotation have resulted in increased soil fertility, crop yield and product quality. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the farming system (organic and conventional) and the applied rotation scheme on soil nutrient content, head yield and the nutrient content of cabbage. The preceding crops included either pea (P), faba bean (F) or cabbage (C), and thus, the rotation schemes were P-C, F-C and C-C. Sheep manure was applied in the organic farming system, and the inorganic fertilizer 11-15-15 (N-P2O5-K2O) was applied to the conventionally cultivated plants. The results reveal an interaction between the farming system and the preceding crop for the head yield, with the lowest values (57.00 t ha-1 and 53.87 t ha-1 in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, respectively) recorded in plots where cabbage was cultivated as a preceding crop under the organic farming system. The N, P and K contents in head tissues were affected only by the farming system, with the greatest values recorded in the conventional farming system. Both factors affected the nutrient content in the soil. Specifically, the highest values of NO3- and total N content in the soil were recorded in the P-C and F-C rotations, and the K content was higher in the continuous cabbage cropping system (C-C). Moreover, the NO3-, P and K contents in the soils were higher in the conventional farming system compared to the organic system. To conclude, combining inorganic fertilization in a crop rotation scheme with legume species such as pea and faba bean as preceding crops for cabbage can result in increased soil fertility and head yield.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of hydrothermal pretreatment to enhance the energy recovery and waste management of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) as a co-substrate in pig farming operations. Pig farms in Thailand generate wastewater rich in organic matter and nutrients, and efficient treatment is essential for meeting environmental discharge standards and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two pretreatment strategies were evaluated: a low-temperature hydrothermal fermentative pretreatment (HFP) and a high-temperature thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP). Napier grass, characterized by its high lignocellulosic content and rapid growth, was processed at various temperatures (35-100 degrees C for HFP; 125-200 degrees C for THP) and reaction times (6-72 h) to produce distinct liquid and solid fractions. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays demonstrated that HFP at 35 degrees C for 12 h yielded the highest overall methane production (184.5 m3 CH4 per ton of dry biomass), reflecting a 65 % increase in biodegradability relative to untreated grass. Regression analysis further elucidated the interactive effects of temperature and reaction time on methane yields, while mass balance evaluations compared alternative pathways for the valorization of the HFP solids. Notably, converting the solids into biomass pellets delivered a superior net energy output compared to further anaerobic digestion. Overall, the integrated approach of using hydrothermal pretreatment, especially via HFP, not only improves biogas yields but also aligns with sustainable agricultural practices by reducing waste, mitigating environmental impacts, and enhancing the energy efficiency of pig farming systems.

AB  - Modern commercial pig production systems are currently facing several challenges like market prices volatility, high production and environmental costs. Responding to public demand and the legal requirements for improving the welfare standards is leading to further growth of the farming costs and lower profit margins for the pig industry. Due to its impact on key production performance indicators and on welfare, space allowance for nursery and finishing pigs has been the subject of extensive research over the past decades. However, space allowance per pig is just a relative approach, pen side ratio and shape being important as well as it interferes with the free movement and several behaviors expressed by pigs. This study is focused on the impact of pen shape by comparing implications of housing pigs in pens with different perimeter to area ratios at the same level of surface allowed per pig. Results are suggesting that the pen shape design might have an influence on the rearing performance indicators like average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) both in nursery and finishing stages. It seems as well that a welfare indicator, namely the recorded number of skin lesions, differ according to the pen shape, in the favor of pens with lower length to width ratio, even if the pig density per surface unit, feeding, ventilation and enrichment patterns are the same.

AB  - The olive oil agro-industry generates large quantities of by-products, such as olive cake (OC), whose sustainable valorisation in animal feed can contribute to the principles of circular economy, waste reduction, and resource efficiency. This study evaluated the effects of incorporating OC into the diets of growing B & iacute;saro pigs, focusing on productive parameters and the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD). Two trials were carried out. In the first trial, 25 pigs were fed five diets containing 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20% exhausted OC (EOC) for 15 days. The results showed a linear decrease in ATTD with increasing EOC levels (p < 0.001), but the increased feed intake compensated for the reduced digestibility, and growth performance was maintained. The initial and final live weight (LW), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were not affected (p > 0.05). In the second trial, 40 pigs were fed five diets for 82 days: a control diet and four diets incorporating 10% crude OC, 10% two-phase OC, 10% EOC, and 10% EOC with 1% olive oil. No significant differences were observed in final weight, ADG, ADFI, FCR, or the digestibility of DM, OM, CP, CF, and NDF. The results suggest incorporating moderate levels of OC into B & iacute;saro pig diets could be a viable strategy for valorising by-products, reducing agro-industrial waste and increasing sustainability in animal production. In addition, the inclusion of OC had no negative impact on animal performance, highlighting the potential of OC as a sustainable ingredient for animal feed, which aligns with the objectives of the circular economy and sustainable livestock farming practices.

AB  - The electromagnetic field (EMF) affects the physiological processes in mammals, but the molecular background of the observed alterations remains not well established. In this study was tested the effect of short duration (2 h) of the EMF treatment (50 Hz, 8 mT) on global transcriptomic alterations in the myometrium of pigs during the peri-implantation period using next-generation sequencing. As a result, the EMF treatment affected the expression of 215 transcript active regions (TARs), and among them, the assigned gene protein-coding biotype possessed 90 ones (differentially expressed genes, DEGs), categorized mostly to gene ontology terms connected with defense and immune responses, and secretion and export. Evaluated DEGs enrich the KEGG TNF signaling pathway, and regulation of IFNA signaling and interferon-alpha/beta signaling REACTOME pathways. There were evaluated 12 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DE-lnc-RNAs) and 182 predicted single nucleotide variants (SNVs) substitutions within RNA editing sites. In conclusion, the EMF treatment in the myometrium collected during the peri-implantation period affects the expression of genes involved in defense and immune responses. The study also gives new insight into the mechanisms of the EMF action in the regulation of the transcriptomic profile through lnc-RNAs and SNVs.

AB  - Pearl bodies are produced by some plant species as food reward for ants and in exchange, ants defend these plants against insect pests. Sap-sucking pests such as aphids also excrete honeydew as food reward for ants, leading to potential conflict where ants could preferentially defend either the plant or the aphid. How pest insects might influence plant pearl body production, is yet to be investigated. Okra is a widely consumed vegetable worldwide and is attacked by the ant-tended cotton aphid. The plants produce pearl bodies, which are predominantly found on the underside of the leaves and formed from epidermal cells. We conducted a set of field and greenhouse experiments to explore plant-aphid-ant interactions, their influence on pearl body production and resulting performance of okra plants, across okra varieties. We found that ants of Pheidole genus, which are dominant in okra fields, preferred pearl bodies over aphid honeydew; although, their highest abundance was recorded in presence of both these food rewards, and on one okra variety. Removal of pearl bodies from the plants increased their production; however, plant growth and chlorophyll content were negatively associated with pearl body replenishment. Potentially to mitigate this resource cost, plants developed such a novel defense response because we found that aphid presence reduced pearl body production, but only when there were no ants. Finally, aphids negatively affected plant performance, but only at very high densities. As aphids also attract ants, plants may tolerate their presence at low densities to attract higher ant abundances. Our study highlights that plants can adapt their defense strategies in pest presence for efficient resource use. We suggest that understanding pearl body associated interactions in crop plants can assist in using such traits for pest management.

AB  - The rainfall-runoff relationship frequently undergoes changes and exhibits a non-stationary state due to the impacts of climate and human activities. This non-stationarity often results in performance degradation of most existing runoff prediction models, which were designed and applied under the assumption of a stationary rainfall-runoff relationship. This study proposes an adaptive rainfall-runoff model (Stream-LSTM (Stream-Long Short-Term Memory)) based on data stream mining and deep learning for 1-day-ahead daily runoff prediction. The model consists of two main components: (1) a dynamic threshold adjustment strategy that automatically detects changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship, and (2) a network fine-tuning approach that preserves longterm memory while adapting to new patterns. Results in the Source Region of the Yellow River basin demonstrate that the proposed model achieves Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.91 with a decay period of 10 in a changing environment, outperforming the widely used data-driven models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (0.71), Random Forest (RF) (0.66), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) (0.69) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) (0.61). The Stream-LSTM model performed well on peak runoff prediction with NSE values generally exceeding 0.70. Additionally, preliminary inter-basin testing on two selected basins in the CAMELS dataset indicates the potential applicability of the method. This study provides a promising method for dynamic daily runoff prediction in a non-stationary environment, which is of great significance for flood mitigation and regional water resource management.

AB  - Simple Summary The adoption of sustainable methods for herbivore pest control has become mandatory in Europe, with the EU directive 128/09. Since then, stringent evaluation protocols have been applied to insecticides and several molecules (that are suspected to be unsafe for the environment or human health) have been banned. Hence, the evaluation of sustainable methods, e.g., preventive tools based on the manipulation of pest behaviour, must be considered. Using field and laboratory assays, we tested the efficacy of different products in preventing infestation of a key pest of olive orchards, the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae. Our findings may be useful for the development of control strategies in integrated pest management (IPM) and organic agriculture. The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, is the key pest of olive trees in several areas of the world. Given the need for the development of sustainable control methods, preventive tools, based on the manipulation of pest behaviour, must be considered. Here, under field and laboratory conditions, we tested the efficacy of different products in preventing B. oleae infestation. A field trial was conducted, from July to November 2020, in an olive orchard located in Central Italy. A table olive variety was selected and sprayed with rock powder, propolis, the mixture of both, copper oxychloride, or water (control). All treatments, except propolis, caused a reduction of B. oleae oviposition in olives, compared to the control. The mixture allowed the strongest reduction of fly infestation throughout the season, suggesting a synergistic effect. Behavioural no-choice assays were conducted to better understand the effects of treatments on B. oleae females. Compared to the control, females showed a lower preference for the central area of an arena containing an olive twig bearing two olive fruits, fully developed, but still green, treated with rock powder, plus propolis mixture. For all treatments, B. oleae showed lower oviposition events, suggesting deterrence to oviposition. Our results indicate that the tested products may have value against B. oleae, within integrated pest management (IPM) and organic agriculture.

AB  - Yeast fermentation products (YFPs) are known to contain bioactive compounds, such as nutritional metabolites and cell wall polysaccharides (specifically glucan and mannan), which have been demonstrated to exert positive effects on the growth performance and immunity of livestock and poultry. However, the impact of YFPs on intestinal inflammation and microflora composition in pigs infected with Salmonella typhimurium remains unclear. To investigate this, a total of 18 weaned pigs were divided into three treatment groups: a non-challenged control group (Con), a group challenged with Salmonella typhimurium (ST), and a group challenged with Salmonella typhimurium and supplemented with 0.4% YFP (YFP). The experiment spanned five weeks, encompassing a period of 21 days prior to and 14 days subsequent to the initial Salmonella typhimurium challenge. The findings indicated that the YFP group exhibited an increase in average daily gain (ADG) and a decrease in the feed-gain ratio (F/G) in comparison to the ST group following the Salmonella challenge. Additionally, the YFP group demonstrated a reduction in the levels of inflammatory cytokines in plasma and a decrease in the expression of inflammatory genes in the colon. Treatment with YFP also resulted in improved colon histomorphology, heightened alpha diversity of the gut microbiota, augmented the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, and elevated concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In addition, YFP reprogrammed energy metabolism in colon epithelial cells by blunting glycolysis. Together, dietary YFP supplementation alleviated colon inflammation in weaned pigs challenged with Salmonella typhimurium, and shaped the beneficial microbiota, thereby maintaining gut homeostasis. The results provided evidence supporting the application of yeast fermentation products in livestock production.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis [L.] O. Kuntze) is a plantation crop, grown commercially in Asia, Africa, and South America. Among biotic threats to tea production, diseases caused by fungal pathogens are most significant. Worldwide, tea plants are challenged by several root, stem, and foliar diseases. Foliar diseases, blister blight, gray blight, and brown blight are particularly important as they adversely affect the bud and the two youngest leaves, causing loss of harvestable shoots. Over the past several decades, climate change and field management practices have influenced the risk of crop damage by several fungal pathogens, as well as the development and spread of diseases. Management interventions, such as the adoption of good cultural/agronomic practices, use of fungicides and microbial biocontrol agents, plant defense elicitors, and deployment of resistant cultivars, have mitigated damage to tea plants caused by fungal diseases. A clearer understanding of knowledge gaps and the benefits of plant disease management strategies available is needed. The present article reviews the prevailing knowledge of major fungal pathogens of the tea crop, their genetic variability, the damage they cause and its economic impact, and the need for new disease management strategies as climate change intensifies. We will also emphasize important knowledge gaps that are priority targets for future research.

AB  - Phylodynamic methods provide a coherent framework for the inference of population parameters directly from genetic data. They are an important tool for understanding both the spread of epidemics as well as long-term macroevolutionary trends in speciation and extinction. In particular, phylodynamic methods based on multitype birth-death models have been used to infer the evolution of discrete traits, the movement of individuals or pathogens between geographic locations or host types, and the transition of infected individuals between disease stages. In these models, population heterogeneity is treated by assigning individuals to different discrete types. Typically, methods which allow inference of parameters under multitype birth-death models integrate over the possible birth-death trajectories (i.e. the type-specific population size functions) to reduce the computational demands of the inference. As a result, it has not been possible to use these methods to directly infer the dynamics of trait-specific population sizes, infected host counts or other such demographic quantities. In this article, we present a method which infers these multitype trajectories with minimal additional computational cost beyond that of existing methods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by applying it to a previously published set of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes, inferring the numbers of human and camel cases through time, together with the number and timing of spillovers from the camel reservoir. This application highlights the multitype population trajectory's ability to elucidate properties of the population which are not directly ancestral to its sampled members.

AB  - Gallic acid (GA), an important polyphenolic compound in the plant, is a well-known antioxidant, antihyperglycemic, and anti-lipid peroxidative agent. Recently, GA treatment exhibited ameliorative effects on plants in response to some abiotic stresses. However, the elicitation effect of GA on plant defense against herbivorous insects has not yet been reported. In this study, we found that the exogenous application of GA induced the direct defense of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) against tea geometrid (Ectropis obliqua) larvae, through activating jasmonic acid (JA) signaling and phenylpropanoid pathways. These signaling cascades resulted in the efficient induction of several defensive compounds. Among them, astragalin, naringenin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate were the three of the most active anti-feeding compounds. However, the exogenous GA treatment did not affect the preference of E. obliqua female moths and larval parasitoid Apanteles sp. Our study suggests that GA may serve as an elicitor that triggers a direct defense response against tea geometrid larvae in tea plants. This study will help to deepen the understanding of the interaction between plants and phytophagous insects and also provide theoretical and technical guidance for the development of plant defense elicitors.

AB  - In this study, the geographic and host plant-associated genetic structure of Tomoplagia spp. (Diptera: Tephritidae) was investigated. The study was developed in the rupestrian montane grasslands of the Espinhaco Mountain Range, Brazil, where these flies' larvae develop within flower heads of Asteraceae. The three species of Tomoplagia investigated have different host spans within the subtribe Vernoniinae: one is strictly monophagous (Tomoplagia grandis Prado, Norrbom & Lewinsohn) and two are oligophagous [Tomoplagia incompleta (Williston) and Tomoplagia bicolor Prado, Norrbom & Lewinsohn]. The genetic variability and differentiation throughout their geographic distribution were investigated at the local scale (sympatric, between different host species in the same locality) and the regional scale (allopatric, on the same or different host species in different localities). Allele richness was greater for populations of the two oligophagous species. Moreover, population genetic structure was low in all species both on the local and regional scales, and the attribution of individuals of the three species to different genetic groups was not strongly associated with either locality or host plant. These results indicate the absence of simple geographic and host-associated genetic structure in these specialized herbivores, suggesting that females of T. bicolor and T. incompleta have low host philopatry, using various host species indiscriminately within their distribution range. Therefore, the use of host plants by fruit flies of the genus Tomoplagia is a plastic character that can shift temporally and spatially among phylogenetically related and chemically similar plants. Contrary to expectations, given the specialized and intimate nature of their host association, the studied Tomoplagia species showed no clear host-associated genetic differentiation; instead, genetic variation presents a mosaic pattern across hosts and localities.

AB  - Rationally nanostructured electrode materials exhibit excellent sodium-ion storage performance. In particular, yolk-shell configurations of metal chalcogenide@void@C are introduced in various synthetic strategies for use as superior anode materials. Herein, yolk-shell-structured nanospheres, with goat pupil-like configuration of S-doped SnSe yolks and hollow carbon shells, are synthesized by salt-infiltration and a simple post-treatment procedure. Impressively, the co-infiltration of thiourea and selenium oxide enables the doping of sulfur into SnSe (SnSeS) and carbon shells, as well as the formation of a goat pupil-like yolk-shell architecture. High-reactivity thiourea-derived H2S gas forms nanocrystals inside the carbon nanospheres. The nanocrystals act as seeds for the crystal growth of SnSeS through Ostwald ripening. The unique yolk-shell structure and composition with a heterointerface provide not only structural stability but also fast electrode reaction kinetics during repeated cycling. The SnSeS@C electrode shows an excellent cycle life (186 mA h g(-1) for 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1)) and rate capability (112 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1)).

AB  - The subcortical maternal complex, which consists of maternal-effect genes, plays a crucial role in the development of oocytes and preimplantation embryo until the activation of the zygote genome. One such gene, known as peptidyl-arginine deiminase VI (Padi6), is involved in the oocyte maturation, fertilization and embryonic development. However, the precise function of Padi6 gene in buffalo is still unclear and requires further investigation. In this study, the sequence, mRNA and protein expression patterns of Padi6 gene were analyzed in oocytes, preimplantation embryos and somatic tissues of buffalo. The coding sequence of gene was successfully cloned and characterized. Real-time quantitative PCR results indicated an absence of Padi6 transcripts in somatic tissues. Notably, the expression levels of Padi6 in oocytes showed an increased from the germinal vesicle stage to metaphase II stage, followed by a rapid decrease during the morula and blastocyst stages. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed these findings, revealing a noticeable decline in protein expression levels. Our research provides the initial comprehensive expression profile of Padi6 in buffalo oocytes and preimplantation embryos, serving as a solid foundation for further investigations into the functionality of maternal-effect genes in buffalo.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining the host's metabolism and can influence the host's productivity. Both dietary composition and gender have distinct effects on the composition of the gut microbiota. Therefore, to investigate the differences in the structure and function of the gut microbiota between female and male goats, we analyzed their fecal microbiota and metabolites when fed a 10% crude protein diet at four different energy levels-7.01, 8.33, 9.66, and 10.98 MJ/kg DM. Four non-pregnant female and four male Leizhou goats (all 8 months of age) were used in the experiment, with an average body weight of 10.3 +/- 0.8 kg for females and 13.6 +/- 1.1 kg for males (mean +/- SD). The animals were assigned to two separate 4 x 4 Latin square designs according to their gender, each consisting of four treatments and four 28-day periods, including 25 days of a dietary adaptation period and 3 days of fecal sample collection per period. The data were analyzed using the SAS statistical package and Pearson's correlation analysis. The dominant phyla for all samples were Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, regardless of dietary energy levels or gender. Among fecal bacteria, unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae was the dominant genus in the female goats, and Oscillospiraceae_UCG-005 was the dominant genus in the male goats. The relative abundance of unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae (p < 0.001), Bacteroides (p = 0.007), norank_f_Ruminococcaceae (p = 0.024), Mediterraneibacter (p = 0.001), and norank_f_Muribaculaceae (p = 0.008) was greater in the female goats than in the male goats. In contrast, the relative abundance of Oscillospiraceae_UCG-005 (p < 0.001), Ruminococcus (p = 0.035), Monoglobus (p = 0.006), Oscillospiraceae-NK4A214_group (p = 0.008), norank_f_F082 (p < 0.001), and Prevotellaceae_UCG-003 (p < 0.001) was lower in the female goats than in the male goats. The volcano plot showed that there were 153, 171, 171, and 183 differential metabolites between the female and male goats at dietary energy levels of 7.01, 8.33, 9.66, and 10.98 MJ/kg DM, respectively. Numerous correlations were observed between differential metabolites and microflora genera. We concluded that the non-pregnant female and male goats exhibited distinct metabolic abilities when consuming a 10% crude protein diet at four different energy levels. Interestingly, in the female and male goats, the fecal microbiota also showed some differing responses to the energy levels. These results provide a gender-based reference for formulating low-protein dietary strategies for 8-month-old Leizhou goats.

AB  - Increasing reports of zoonotic avian influenza virus (AIV) spillovers to mammals signal critical shift in their ecology and raise substantial public health concerns. The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has driven this expansion, with genetic adaptations enhancing replication in mammalian hosts. Adaptations have been identified in diverse carnivore species, including American mink (Neogale vison), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and otters (Lutra lutra). These carnivores often feed on, or share habitat with, wild birds, making them suitable species for monitoring AIV presence in mammals. Here we investigated exposure to influenza A viruses (IAVs), including H5 and H7 subtypes in three mesocarnivore species (red foxes, American mink, and European badgers) in Ireland. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we detected a seroprevalence for IAVs of 24.6% (28/114) in foxes, 22.2% (2/9) in mink, and 1% (1/96) in badgers. Among red fox samples positive for antibodies against IAVs, 82.1% (23/28) were positive for antibodies against the H5 subtype. No antibodies against the H7 subtype were detected. We also examined the use of Nobuto filter paper as a reliable alternative to serum samples for IAVs antibody detection via ELISA and assessed the use of haemolysed serum samples. These findings, as well as those gathered from ongoing passive surveillance of wild birds, highlight that influenza A is circulating in wildlife in Ireland. If we are to better understand influenza A dynamics in Ireland, and globally, it is imperative that surveillance programmes are supported, and serosurveys provide one valuable tool for active surveillance.

AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are among the most at-risk ecosystems globally. In Hawai'i, more than 45% of TDF species are threatened or endangered. Despite decades of active TDF restoration, there remains limited information on the potential for long-term success, since there are few studies of natural regeneration. We assess natural regeneration of endangered plants at Ka'upulehu dryland forest, a Hawaiian biocultural restoration initiative. Drawing on 6 annual censuses we (1) assess rates and patterns of natural regeneration across species and as a function of rainfall and (2) identify bottlenecks. Our surveys document natural recruits of 11 of the 12 endangered species first outplanted 15-20 years ago. Higher annual rainfall increased the number of new recruits per year and growth, but decreased survival of larger recruits. The total number of natural recruits increased three-fold over the study period and varied across species. For nearly half of the species, we documented a second generation of recruits. Successes appear to be a function of time, including a changing microclimate and adaptive management practices. Remaining bottlenecks include lack of seed dispersal, and seed predation and herbivory by introduced species. The success at Ka'upulehu highlights the potential for TDF restoration and the value of a biocultural approach.

AB  - There is still no consensus regarding the ultimate cause of the famous 3-4-year population cycles of lemmings. According to the plant stress hypothesis, herbivore population peaks are caused by stress factors that force plants to reallocate stored defensive proteins to transportable and easily digestible N-compounds. One possible plant stress factor is ionization caused by exhalation of the radioactive noble gas radon, which is enhanced after spring tides, i.e., tides at new or full Moon. I hypothesized that increased ionization caused by radon accumulation in the subnivean space after peak spring tides, which occur close to perihelion (31 December-05 January, when the Earth-Sun distance is shortest), and at 3.8-year intervals, results in increased protein digestibility of mosses, which are important food for lemmings. Population outbreaks of Norway lemming Lemmus lemmus occurred two years after peak spring tides during 1871-1910, when also perigee (the time when the Earth-Moon distance is shortest) coincided with spring tides and perihelion. Thereafter this relationship weakened, and lemming peaks became less pronounced and more related to plant seed indices. As we have now entered a new 30-year period with coincidence of spring tide, perihelion and perigee, I predict more regular and pronounced lemming outbreaks in the next decades, unless radon accumulation is prevented by frequent lack of a stable snow cover due to global warming.

AB  - Green waste compost (GWC) is a value-added product generated by the composting of urban green waste. Although GWC could potentially be used as a growth medium for soilless culture of plants, GWC alone has high salinity, high pH, and other undesirable physicochemical properties. In the current study, we therefore assessed how addition of vermiculite (VMT: 0, 3.5, and 7%) and humic acid (HA: 0, 0.5, and 1 g/100 g) affected the physicochemical properties of GWC and its use as a growth medium for cornflower (Centaurea cyanus L.). GWC modified by the combination of 3.5% VMT and 0.5 g/100 g HA had the best physicochemical properties (bulk density, porosity, water holding capacity, electrical conductivity, pH, and nutrient content) and resulted in the best growth of cornflower in terms of plant height, maximum root length, flower number, and biomass. The results therefore indicate that GWC modified by 3.5% VMT and 0.5 g/100 g HA powder is an excellent soilless growth medium. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) plays a key role in salt and water homeostasis in tetrapod vertebrates. There are four ENaC subunits (alpha, beta gamma, delta), forming heterotrimeric alpha beta gamma- or delta beta gamma-ENaCs. Although the physiology of alpha beta gamma-ENaC is well understood, for decades the field has stalled with respect to delta beta gamma-ENaC due to the lack of mammalian model organisms. The SCNN1D gene coding for delta-ENaC was previously believed to be absent in rodents, hindering studies using standard laboratory animals. We analyzed all currently available rodent genomes and discovered that SCNN1D is present in rodents but was independently lost in five rodent lineages, including the Muridae (mice and rats). The independent loss of SCNN1D in rodent lineages may be constrained by phylogeny and taxon-specific adaptation to dry habitats, however habitat aridity does not provide a selection pressure for maintenance of SCNN1D across Rodentia. A fusion of two exons coding for a structurally flexible region in the extracellular domain of delta-ENaC appeared in the Hystricognathi (a group that includes guinea pigs). This conserved pattern evolved at least 41 Ma and represents a new autapomorphic feature for this Glade. Exon fusion does not impair functionality of guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) delta beta gamma-ENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Electrophysiological characterization at the whole-cell and single-channel level revealed conserved biophysical features and mechanisms controlling guinea pig alpha beta gamma- and delta beta gamma-ENaC function as compared with human orthologs. Guinea pigs therefore represent commercially available mammalian model animals that will help shed light on the physiological function of delta-ENaC.

AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) remains a challenging condition, necessitating effective models for investigation and therapeutic exploration. In this study, we employed a goat skin model to assess the immune response triggered by topical oxazolone (OX) application. The OX simulates a Th2-driven immune reaction typified by elevated Th2 cytokine (IL-4 and IL-13) expression and the infiltration of mononuclear cells magnified by the presence of CD3+ and CD4+ T-cells in the epidermal and dermal layers. Additionally, the application of pomegranate peel extract (PPE) demonstrated a mitigating effect on OX-induced skin alterations, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits. This study underscores the value of goats as a reliable and accessible model for studying AD in humans and/or large animals. While the therapeutic potential of PPE dosage requires further exploration.

AB  - As important supplementary to major edible oils, comparative chemical advantages of minor edible oils decide their development and usage. In this study, chemical composition of 13 kinds of specific edible vegetable oils were investigated. The comparative advantages of chemical compositions of these edible oils were obtained as follows: (1) camellia, tiger nut and almond oil were rich in oleic acid, the contents of which accounted for 79.43%, 69.16% and 66.26%, respectively; (2) safflower oil contained the highest content of linoleic acid (76.69%), followed by grape seed (66.85%) and walnut oil (57.30%); (3) perilla seed, siritch, peony seed and herbaceous peony seed oil were rich in alpha-linolenic acid (59.61%, 43.74%, 40.83% and 30.84%, respectively); (4) the total phytosterol contents of these oils ranged from 91.46 mg/100 g (camellia oil) to 506.46 mg/100 g (siritch oil); and (5) The best source of tocopherols was sacha inchi oil (122.74 mg/100 g), followed by perilla seed oil (55.89 mg/100 g), peony seed oil (53.73 mg/100 g) and herbaceous peony seed oil (47.17 mg/100 g). The comparative advantages of these specific edible oils indicated that they possess the high potential nutritional values and health care functions.

AB  - Proposed mechanisms of zoonotic virus spillover often posit that wildlife transmission and amplification precede human outbreaks. Between 2006 and 2012, the palm Raphia farinifera, a rich source of dietary minerals for wildlife, was nearly extirpated from Budongo Forest, Uganda. Since then, chimpanzees, black-and-white colobus, and red duiker were observed feeding on bat guano, a behavior not previously observed. Here we show that guano consumption may be a response to dietary mineral scarcity and may expose wildlife to bat-borne viruses. Videos from 2017-2019 recorded 839 instances of guano consumption by the aforementioned species. Nutritional analysis of the guano revealed high concentrations of sodium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus. Metagenomic analyses of the guano identified 27 eukaryotic viruses, including a novel betacoronavirus. Our findings illustrate how "upstream" drivers such as socioeconomics and resource extraction can initiate elaborate chains of causation, ultimately increasing virus spillover risk.
   A study in Uganda found that local extirpation of a mineral-rich tree species used in tobacco farming forced wildlife to obtain minerals by eating bat guano, in which 27 eukaryotic viruses were identified, including a novel betacoronavirus.

   Sows are susceptible to heat stress. Various indicators can be found in the literature assessing the level of heat stress in pigs, but none of them is specific to assess the sows' thermal condition. Moreover, previous thermal indices have been developed by considering only partial environment parameters, and the interaction between the index and the animal's physiological response are not always included. Therefore, this study aims to develop and assess a new thermal index specified for sows, called equivalent temperature index for sows (ETIS), with a comprehensive consideration of the influencing factors. An experiment was conducted, and the experimental data was applied for model development and validation. The equivalent temperatures have been transformed on the basis of equal effects of air velocity, relative humidity, floor heat conduction and indoor radiation on the thermal index, and used for the ETIS combination. The correlations between ETIS and sow's physiological parameters were performed. In the comparison with other thermal indices, the ETIS had the best performance (R = 0.82) using experimental data obtained from the sow house. In addition, the comfort threshold of ETIS has been classified for evaluating heat stress levels in the sow. This study concludes that the newly developed ETIS can be used to assess the degree of thermal comfort for sows.
   Heat stress affects the estrus time and conception rate of sows. Compared with other life stages of pigs, sows are more susceptible to heat stress because of their increased heat production. Various indicators can be found in the literature assessing the level of heat stress in pigs. However, none of them is specific to assess the sows' thermal condition. Moreover, thermal indices are mainly developed by considering partial environment parameters, and there is no interaction between the index and the animal's physiological response. Therefore, this study aims to develop a thermal index specified for sows, called equivalent temperature index for sows (ETIS), which includes parameters of air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. Based on the heat transfer characteristics of sows, multiple regression analysis is used to combine air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. Environmental data are used as independent variables, and physiological parameters are used as dependent variables. In 1029 sets of data, 70% of the data is used as the training set, and 30% of the data is used as the test set to create and develop a new thermal index. According to the correlation equation between ETIS and temperature-humidity index (THI), combined with the threshold of THI, ETIS was divided into thresholds. The results show that the ETIS heat stress threshold is classified as follows: suitable temperature ETIS < 33.1 degrees C, mild temperature 33.1 degrees C <= ETIS < 34.5 degrees C, moderate stress temperature 34.5 degrees C <= ETIS < 35.9 degrees C, and severe temperature ETIS >= 35.9 degrees C. The ETIS model can predict the sows' physiological response in a good manner. The correlation coefficients R of skin temperature was 0.82. Compared to early developed thermal indices, ETIS has the best predictive effect on skin temperature. This index could be a useful tool for assessing the thermal environment to ensure thermal comfort for sows.

AB  - Simple Summary Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are new regulators of the development of skeletal muscle in mammals. Herein, circ_003628 in Longissimus dorsi muscle tissue of goats, previously found by RNA-seq, was selected to construct an expression profile in different caprine tissues, and investigate the effect on proliferation and differentiation of caprine skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs), using RT-qPCR, EdU, CCK-8 and immunofluorescence assays. The results showed that circ_003628 had the highest expression level both in the longissimus dorsi muscle among nine caprine tissues collected, and on day 6 after differentiation during SMSCs differentiation periods. The interfering of circ_003628 inhibited the viability, proliferation, and differentiation of goat SMSCs. In our previous a study, circ_003628 was one of the most highly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the Longissimus dorsi muscle of goats found by RNA-seq, suggesting that the circRNA may be important for caprine muscle growth and development. However, there have been no reports describing the molecular mechanisms by which circ_003628 regulates the activities of goat skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs). In this study, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and DNA sequencing were used to validate the authenticity of circ_003628, and its characteristics, expression profile and effect on goat SMSCs were also studied using real-time quantitative-PCR (RT-qPCR), EdU, CCK-8 and immunofluorescence assays. Circ_003628 is partially originated from 13 exons, 12 introns and 3 '-untranslated regions (UTR) of caprine Myosin Heavy Chain 1 (MYH1), and 25 exons and 5 ' UTR of Myosin Heavy Chain 4 (MYH4), as well as intergenic sequences between the two genes. A total of 77.07% of circ_003628 were located in the nuclei of goat SMSCs, while 22.93% were expressed in the cytoplasm. The circRNAs were only expressed in triceps brachii, quadriceps femoris and longissimus dorsi muscle tissues in nine caprine tissues investigated, with the highest expression level in longissimus dorsi muscle. The expression level of circ_003628 gradually increased during differentiation periods of goat SMSCs and reached the maximum on day 6 after differentiation. The small interfering RNA of circ_003628 (named si-circ_003628) inhibited the viability and proliferation of goat SMSCs, and also decreased the expression of four cell proliferation marker genes: paired box 7 (Pax7), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4 and CyclinD1 in goat SMSCs. Transfection of si-circ_003628 significantly decreased the area of MyHC-labeled myotubes of goat SMSCs, as well as the expression levels of three differentiation marker genes: myosin heavy chain (MyHC), myogenin (MyoG), and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C).

AB  - The aim of this work was to determine the concentrations of selected mutagenic elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Se) in raw ewe milk from undisturbed environment in Orava region, northern Slovakia. There are possible sources of some of the analyzed metals which may be distributed from the metallurgical plants located in the Ostrava region, Czech Republic, and Katowice, Poland. In total, forty milk samples were analyzed in June and August using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The differences in elements concentrations between the seasonal periods were not significant except of iron (p < 0.0001). The concentrations of most of the metals in ewe milk were low and under the permissible or recommended limits. However, arsenic and selenium concentrations were elevated and could pose a risk of the mutagenic effect, particularly in children. The frequency of element occurrence in June was as follows: Se > Fe > As > Cu > Mn > Ni > Co > Pb > Cr > Cd, and in August: Se > Fe = As > Cu > Mn > Pb > Co > Ni > Cr > Cd. The correlation analysis revealed very strong positive correlation between Cu:Pb (p < 0.05), very strong negative correlation between Fe:Se (p < 0.05). The strong correlations were also found between other elements. The present study showed that milk produced in the relatively undisturbed environment might contain various mutagenic elements. The relationships between the elements might result in the additive or synergistic effects of elements and increase the risk of their mutagenic effects even in low concentrations. Therefore, attention must be paid to the monitoring of metals in the areas where food sources destined especially for child nutrition are produced.

AB  - The common bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus decula) is a widely distributed antelope species in Africa that utilises a variety of habitat types. A study was conducted on the population status and diurnal activity pattern of T. s. decula in Maze National Park, Ethiopia, from January to July 2020 during the wet and dry seasons. Data were collected using randomly sampled blocks covering a total area of 34 km(2). The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and compared with Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests. The average population size throughout both the wet and the dry season was 21 +/- 8, of which 10.5 +/- 3.5, 4.0 +/- 2.0 and 6.5 +/- 2.5 were adults, subadults and juveniles. There was a significant difference (chi(2) = 3.4, df = 4, p < 0.05) in the T. s. decula population between the two seasons. The sex ratio of adult males to adult females was 0.56:1 and 0.75:1 in the dry and the wet seasons, respectively, indicating a population predominated by females. The mean group size was and 2.00 for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The riverine forest had the greatest number of individuals and hence highest density and population distribution per square kilometre; however, distribution between the habitats did not vary significantly (F = 2.71, df = 4, p = 0.16). The overall density of the population was very low in the sampled blocks, with the population density not exceeding one per 1.7 km(2). The dominant activity pattern of T. s. decula was feeding followed by resting and running/ fighting. Even though its population was predominantly female, a good indicator for future breeding success, the low numbers and density of common T. s. decula due to the high impact of illegal hunting and predation, especially of subadults, indicates a vulnerable population requiring enhanced conservation efforts.

AB  - Airborne diseases pose a significant challenge in intensive livestock farming due to their rapid transmission. Aerosols facilitate the spread of pathogens, introducing external infections to farms and enabling cross-transmission within barns. To address knowledge gaps in aerosol dynamics in animal respiratory tracts and enhance understanding of airborne disease transmission, this study employed CT scanning, 3D printing, and CFD technologies to develop and validate a pig respiratory model. Qualitative and quantitative results from the present study reveal spatiotemporal heterogeneity in aerosol deposition and transmission. Under rest conditions, for aerosols with D <= 5.0 mu m, 21.1% of inhaled aerosols were deposited in the lung by the end of a respiratory cycle. Doubling the respiratory cycle or the inhalation rate could further increase the penetration ability of small-sized aerosols by approximately 60% to 70%. Moreover, the asymmetric distribution of airflow between the left and right halves of the lower respiratory tract (QL/R = 0.89) resulted from the leftward position of the pig's heart and consequently led to a deposition ratio of about 0.83 between the left and right bronchial airways. These findings provide fundamental scientific data for the development and application of aerosolized vaccines and offer insights into optimizing respiratory intervention strategies.

AB  - BackgroundUpland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plants constitutively store volatile terpenes in their leaves, which are steadily emitted at low levels. Herbivory leads to a greater release of these stored volatiles. Additionally, damaged plants increase the accumulation of volatile terpenes in their leaves and begin to synthesize and emit other terpenes and additional compounds. This has been well characterised for cultivated G. hirsutum, but little is known about volatile production in response to herbivory in wild populations. We investigated how damage by a generalist herbivore species, the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), affects leaf-stored and emitted volatiles in wild G. hirsutum plants and compared the responses of two known chemotypes. Wild cotton plants were grown in a greenhouse from seeds collected from four distinct locations covering sixteen populations, along the Yucatan coast (Mexico), from where this cotton species originates. We assessed whether the differences in leaf terpene profiles between the two chemotypes persisted upon herbivory, in leaves and in headspace emissions, and whether these chemotypes also differed in the production and release of herbivory-induced volatiles. In addition to chemotypic variation, we further investigated intraspecific variation in the volatile response to herbivory among genotypes, populations, and the four geographic regions.ResultsThe difference between the two chemotypes persisted after herbivory in the stored volatile profile of induced leaves, as well as in the emissions from damaged plants. Therefore, wild cotton chemotypes may differ in their airborne interactions with their environment. The specific terpenes distinguishing these chemotypes showed a weak inducibility, raising questions about their functions. Herbivory triggered changes in stored and emitted volatiles similar to what is known for cultivated varieties of G. hirsutum. However, we report for the first time on the emission of volatile aldoximes by cotton plants, which were only detected in the headspace upon herbivory, and displayed chemotypic and interpopulation variation. Intraspecific variation was also observed in the induced emissions of nitriles and certain terpenes. Moreover, chemotypes differed in their induction of (E)-beta-ocimene stored in the leaves.ConclusionsThis comprehensive insight into herbivore-induced volatiles of wild cotton reveals variation in production and emission among populations. A full understanding of their ecological role may help in the development of future pest-management strategies for cotton crops.

AB  - This study was carried out through two separate experiments aiming at evaluating the effects of two space allowances (0.54 and 0.62 m(2)/pig in summer and 0.44 m(2)/pig and 0.50 m(2)/pig in winter) on the behavioural and physiological response, and meat quality of pigs of two slaughter weights (120 kg and 140 kg). In summer, higher blood haematocrit levels were found at slaughter in heavier pigs transported at a smaller space allowance (p = 0.04). During lairage, pigs transported at a smaller space allowance started fighting later (p = 0.04). Fighting behaviour was greater in heavier pigs (p <= 0.05), whilst their drinking activity was lower (p < 0.05). This resulted in greater exsanguination blood CK levels (p < 0.01) and drier hams (p = 0.05) in heavier pigs. In winter, only lower space allowance influenced some meat quality traits (p < 0.05), but these effects were minor. The effects of space allowance during summer transports on within-truck ambient conditions, post-transport pigs' welfare, and meat quality are similar. Mixing heavier pigs may result in greater aggressiveness and more fatigue-related meat quality variation during summer. Overall, winter transport results may have been biased by the short journey and within-truck load distribution.

AB  - The diversity of herbivorous insects is associated with host plant diversity. The determination of dietary profile is a central topic in insect ecology. DNA barcoding, that is, taxon identification using a standardized DNA region, have been important to the recent advances in food web understandings. In this study, three commonly plant barcoding loci (i.e., rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA) were chosen for screening of ingested plant DNA in 207 specimens of 18 leaf-grazing katydid species representing 4 subfamilies in China. The obtained sequences were queried against the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) and GenBank for taxa identification. The results of identification were as follow: 3 Conocephalinae species consumed 10 plant families, with preference for Poaceae; 1 Mecopodinae species consumed 18 plant families, with preference for Fabaceae and Vitaceae; 11 Phaneropterinae species consumed 43 plant families, with preference for Juglandaceae; 3 species Pseudophyllinae species consumed 9 plant families, with preference for Balsaminaceae. Among these, only 81 out of 207 samples were identified at the species level when compares with NCBI and BOLD database. Our study added a significant amount of dietary information for leaf-grazing katydids in China. It is crucial to fully understand coevolution of katydids and plant, katydids diet resource requirements, and best practices for habitat conservation.

TI  - Residues of veterinary antibiotics in manures from pig and chicken farms in a context of antimicrobial use reduction by implementation of health and welfare plans

KW  - ANIMAL MANURE
KW  - SOIL
AB  - The use of antibiotics in food-producing animals can induce the presence of residual substances in manure, which are then released into the environment and may contribute to soil and groundwater contamination. During the on-farm implementation of strategies to improve animal health and welfare in chicken and pig farms, the consequences of antibiotic use were evaluated in terms of the occurrence and levels of antibiotic residues in manure.A set of 35 broiler farms from Cyprus, Greece, the Netherlands and 40 pig farms from France and Italy provided a total of 350 manure samples. The primary objective was to develop a specific LC/MS/MS method capable of quantifying antibiotic residues in both types of manure. The method was able to detect fifteen antibiotics belonging to nine classes, with validated limits of quantification of 10-20 mu g/kg, and accuracies ranging from 81% to 138%.With the exception of amoxicillin, which was never detected in any manure, all antibiotics used were detected in manure from treated animals with typical concentrations ranging from 10 to 99198 mu g/kg for both chickens and pigs. The occurrence of residual antibiotics was higher in chicken than in pig manure, especially for fluoroquinolones and doxycycline which were detected in 89% and 100% of the chicken manure, respectively, and in 28% of the pig manure. The impact of the health plans on the antibiotic load manure was assessed by measuring for each farm the ratio of the sum of all antibiotic concentrations measured after and before the implementation of the plan. The results showed that, in addition to the frequency of treatments, the class of antibiotic used is an important factor to consider as it strongly influences the stability/instability of the compounds, i.e. their ability to persist in the manure of food-producing animals.

Here, we examined innate and adaptive immune responses to environmental heterogeneity in wild Antarctic fur seals. In a fully crossed, repeated measures design, we sampled 100 pups and their mothers from colonies of contrasting density during seasons of contrasting food availability. Biometric and cortisol data as well as blood for the analysis of 13 immune and oxidative status markers were collected at two key life-history stages. We show that immune responses of pups are more responsive than adults to variation in food availability, but not population density, and are modulated by cortisol and condition. Immune investment is associated with different oxidative status markers in pups and mothers. Our results suggest that early life stages show greater sensitivity to extrinsic and intrinsic effectors, and that immunity may be a strong target for natural selection even in low-pathogen environments such as Antarctica.
   An investigation into the immune profiles of Antarctic fur seals provides detailed insights into how organisms manage the allocation of and trade-offs among resources in a variable environment.

AB  - Ticks, key vectors for multiple pathogens in veterinary medicine, lack the ability to fly. To feed on blood, they must climb onto a host's hair coat from their natural habitat. Their life cycle is closely linked to wildlife, with the Cervidae family serving as primary hosts for adult ticks. In South Korea, the Korean water deer and roe deer are prominent members of the Cervidae family. Notably, the Korean water deer exhibit a lower rate of tick infestation compared to the roe deer. This study aims to understand the reasons behind this difference by conducting an in-depth comparative analysis of the skin and hair characteristics of both species. We found significant variations in certain factors that may hinder ticks from reaching their feeding sites on Korean water deer, potentially acting as a natural defense mechanism against ticks. To our knowledge, this research is the first to focus on comparing the skin and hair attributes of Korean water deer and roe deer in the context of tick bite prevention. The Korean water deer (WD), a predominant wildlife species in South Korea, is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. Despite belonging to the same family, Cervidae, WD show significantly fewer adult ixodid tick infestations compared to roe deer (RD). Ticks, which cannot fly, engage in questing behavior in natural environments to latch onto hosts. They detect signals like body temperature and host skin chemicals to navigate through the hair coat to the preferred epidermis. In light of this, we performed an extensive comparative study of the skin tissue and hair characteristics of both deer species, focusing on elements contributing to the reduced tick bite incidence in WD. Remarkably, WD exhibited more prominent blood vessels, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands, which are crucial for skin barrier functions (p < 0.005). Moreover, WD had irregular scale patterns on their hair cuticles and possessed hair that was significantly stiffer and 2.83 times thicker than that of RD (p < 0.001). These characteristics potentially impede ticks from reaching the epidermis hair in WD and RD in the context of tick bite prevention. Further investigations in this area could enhance our understanding of tick-host dynamics and contribute to developing preventive measures against tick-borne diseases in other deer species.

AB  - Manure is one of the main sources of heavy metal (HM) pollution on farmlands. It has become the focus of global ecological research because of its potential threat to human health and the sustainability of food systems. Soil pH and organic matter are improved by manure and play pivotal roles in determining soil HM behavior. Geochemical modeling has been widely used to assess and predict the behavior of soil HMs; however, there remains a research gap in manure applications. In this study, a geochemical model (LeachXS) coupled with a pHdependent leaching test with continuously simulations over a broad pH range was used to determine the effects and pollution risks of pig or cattle manure separate application on soil HMs distribution. Both pig and cattle manure applications led to soil pH reduction in alkaline soils and increased organic matter content. Pig manure application resulted in a potential 90.5-156.0 % increase in soil HM content. Cattle manure did not cause significant HM contamination. The leaching trend of soil HMs across treatments exhibited a V-shaped change, with the lowest concentration at pH = 7, gradually increasing toward strong acids and bases. The dissolved organic matter-bound HM content directly increased the HM availability, especially for Cu (up to 8.4 %) after pig manure application. However, more HMs (Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni) were in the particulate organic matter-bound state than in other solid phases (e.g., Fe-Al(hydr) oxides, clay minerals), which inhibited the HMs leaching by more than 19.3 % after cattle manure application. Despite these variations, high HM concentrations introduced by pig manure raised the soil contamination risk, potentially exceeding 40 times at pH +/- 1. When manure is returned to the field, reducing its HM content and mitigating possible pollution is necessary to realize the healthy and sustainable development of circular agriculture.

AB  - Ruminant Genome Database (RGD; http://animal.nwsuaf.edu.cn/RGD) provides visualization and analysis tools for ruminant comparative genomics and functional annotations. As more high-quality ruminant genome assemblies have become available, we have redesigned the user interface, integrated and expanded multi-omics data, and developed novel features to improve the database. The new version, RGD v2.0, houses 78 ruminant genomes; 110-species synteny alignments for major livestock (including cattle, sheep, goat) and wild ungulates; 21 012 orthologous gene clusters with Gene Ontology and pathway annotation; similar to 8 600 000 conserved elements; and similar to 1 000 000 cis-regulatory elements by utilizing 1053 epigenomic data sets. The transcriptome data in RGD v2.0 has nearly doubled, currently with 1936 RNA-seq data sets, and 155 174 phenotypic data sets have been newly added. New and updated features include: (i) The UCSC Genome Browser, BLAT, BLAST and Table Browser tools were updated for six available ruminant livestock species. (ii) The LiftOver tool was newly introduced into our browser to allow coordinate conversion between different ruminant assemblies. And (iii) tissue specificity index, tau, was calculated to facilitate batch screening of specifically expressed genes. The enhanced genome annotations and improved functionality in RGD v2.0 will be useful for study of genome evolution, environmental adaption, livestock breeding and biomedicine.

AB  - Antlers are costly bone structures that grow every year. Thus, in addition to the genetic potential, its full potential size depends on the physiological state and food availability. Our aim was to examine antler characteristics related to genetic potential (burr perimeter) with final antler investment (antler weight) and how they relate with antler structural characteristics: beam length, circumference at mid and upper parts of the beam, and length of first (brow) and midbeam (third) tines. We measured 206 antlers from the University of Castilla-La Mancha experimental farm (UCLM) and from 203 top size antlers from Latvian International Antler Competition (LIAC). The results show that UCLM and LIAC had antlers of similar length (4.6% difference), but LIAC had 47% heavier antlers. The body growth explained that correlations of antler measurements with age were higher in males of 3 or more years, but much weaker in fully grown males (5 years or older). Weight reflected investment in antlers, as it showed the greatest correlation with all measurements, but length had weaker correlations. A large burr cross-section seems to reflect genetic potential, because it is necessary but not sufficient to grow large antlers. The results could be a useful tool for deer breeders.

AB  - The main target of the present work is to characterize the effect of the inclusion of natural sheep wool (SW) into a railway brake block composition and then to compare it to that of a set of three organic fibers commonly used in the friction material industry: aramid fiber (AF), cellulose fiber (CF) and polyacrylonitrile fiber (PAN). In order to achieve this, 4 versions of the same friction material with a fixed amount of each organic fiber were produced and one more sample was manufactured including no organic fibers. The characterization work consisted of friction tests on a full-scale railway test rig. Then, the samples were SEM analyzed in order to characterize the tested surface microstructure. It was found that all organic fibers helped achieve a more stable bedding, and showed lower friction in wet conditions. They also affected the recovery %. Pictures of the blocks were taken after certain phases of the test and, although the failure sequence remained the same for all samples, the organic fibers very much influenced the magnitude of the wear rates. Sheep wool led to better results than cellulose. No final conclusions could be drawn with respect to metal pick-up. SEM analysis evidenced primary and secondary plateaus, but no significant differences were observed depending on the fiber nature. Finally, a Life Cycle Assessment with a "from cradle to gate" perspective was carried out. Ecoinvent v3.5 database and CML and ReCiPe Endpoint methodologies were used to evaluate the environmental impact create by the five brake block materials. Overall, cellulose, PAN and sheep wool brake blocks show slightly lower environmental impacts that the base material or than aramid fibers. Therefore, Latxa sheep wool offers a good balance between low cost, adequate wear rates and environmental impact, making it a compelling substitute for cellulose fibers.

AB  - PurposePlant-soil feedbacks (PSF) and aboveground herbivory are ubiquitous processes that drive plant community structure and affect plant invasion success. There are multiple pathways through which PSF and herbivory may interact, yet few studies have explored PSF-herbivory interactions. We addressed this knowledge gap with a full reciprocal PSF greenhouse experiment involving three native and three invasive plant species of eastern U.S. deciduous woodland.MethodsIn phase I, each species was planted individually in woodland soil and assigned to two herbivory treatments: unclipped controls and aboveground herbivory simulated by clipping. In phase II, each species was grown individually in all Phase I conditioned soil types. Individual and net pairwise feedbacks are presented separately for aboveground and belowground biomass measurements. Based on PSF and invasion theory, we expected that feedbacks among native species would generally be negative, feedbacks among native and invasive species would tend to favor invasive species, and aboveground herbivory would weaken feedbacks.ResultsIn contrast with predictions, most PSFs were neutral and herbivory did not affect PSFs. Significant negative net pairwise PSF was only detected for belowground biomass, was significantly negative for one native-native pair, and did not favor the invasive species in the two cases of significant PSF found for native-invasive species pairs. Significant negative net pairwise PSF was found for one invasive-invasive species pair.ConclusionsOur results suggest that PSF is not a strong dynamic amongst our study species with or without simulated herbivory, at least not for individually grown plants.

AB  - Perinatal deaths cause economic losses in goat production, and birth induction has emerged as a key strategy for producers to plan parturition periods and thus increase neonatal survival. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone administration in pregnant goats on the vitality, thermographic profile, physiological response, and behavioral patterns of their newborn kids. A total of 36 multiparous French Alpine goats and their offspring were randomly assigned into three groups: G1, control goats; G2, goats that received a 0.9 % intramuscular injection of physiological saline solution 36 h before parturition; and G3, goats that received a 16-mg intramuscular injection of dexamethasone 36 h prior to the estimated parturition date. In the dams, the duration of labor, interval between expulsions, latency to first grooming, sniffing, surface temperature, and mother-young bonding were evaluated. In the kids, vitality, neonatal behavior, blood glucose and lactate levels, oxygenation saturation, birth weight, and surface temperature were evaluated at birth, after the first suckling, and at 24 h postpartum. Kids born to dexamethasone-treated goats showed improved vitality parameters compared to neonates from untreated dams, particularly in the suckling reflex (P < 0.0001) and in normal oxygenation and glucose levels. Additionally, dexamethasone-treated dams showed improved maternal behavior. We conclude that administering a 16-mg dose of dexamethasone to naturally mated goats improves mother-kid bonding and results in kids born with higher surface temperatures, adequate oxygenation levels, and higher percentages of the suckling reflex.

AB  - Classification of species into dietary guilds that consume similar food resources can provide a useful framework for understanding ecosystem function. Traditionally, species were assigned to guilds qualitatively rather than quantitatively, largely due to a lack of detailed data on the diets of many species. More recently, detailed dietary data are collected and analysed quantitatively to produce a classification, but the collection of such data is intensive and usually limits a study to a small number of species. Here, we show that quantitative classifications can be built from qualitative data sourced from natural history texts and expert knowledge for well-known fauna. We collected available data on the presence or absence of nine broad food item categories in the diets of 158 species of fish observed on New Zealand's shallow rocky reefs. These data were analysed using multivariate statistical methods pioneered by K. R. Clarke and colleagues for use with site-by-species ecological survey data. In particular, we adapted a taxonomic dissimilarity measure to take into account a natural hierarchy of the food items, so that, for example, the diets of two species that consume different types of invertebrates were considered more similar to each other than those of, say, invertivores vs piscivores, or carnivores vs herbivores. Our analysis produced five distinct dietary guilds: Herbivore (9 species), Omnivore (11), Invertivore (80), Macro-carnivore (52) and Piscivore (6). We suggest that invertivores, which made up around half of the species, are likely underrepresented in many studies due to the exclusion of smaller species. The approach of collecting broadly available qualitative data and applying modern multivariate quantitative methods to produce more inclusive dietary classifications may be usefully applied to other well-known taxonomic groups for which detailed data are scarce.

AB  - Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most hazardous mycotoxin, posing risks to public health. Utilization of bio-based materials to biodegrade AFB1 is a green strategy to overcome this issue. The investigation aimed to screen for endogenous protective enzymes in bio-based material-edible rosemary based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS)-proteomics and ascertain their impacts on the biodegradation and biotransformation of AFB1, and the trade-offs of multilevel metabolism of the animal-derived foods through untargeted metabolomics. The proteomics results verified that bio-based material-edible rosemary (0.20%, w/w) significantly up-regulated glutathione S-transferase and stimulated the down-regulation of cytochrome P450 1A2 levels via activating AhR nuclear translocation in rosemary-pickled AFB1-contaminated goat meat. Metabolomics results demonstrated that edible rosemary substantially increased histidine and glutathione implicated in the antioxidant status of goat meat. More importantly, edible rosemary with high endogenous protective enzyme content could efficiently biodegrade AFB1 in goat meat. We first unveiled that rosemary could not only efficiently biodegrade AFB1 up to 90.20% (20.00-1.96 & mu;g kg-1) but also elevate the bio-ingestion quality of goat meat. These findings suggest that the bio based material -rosemary is an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for biodegrading AFB1 and elevating the bio-ingestion composition of goat meat.

AB  - Emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis is a buprestid species native to Asia, where it is a pest of ash trees, Fraxinus spp. Since it was accidentally introduced to the United States in the 1990s, this beetle has become one of the most destructive invasive pests of North American ash trees. In 2015 it was found attacking the white fringe tree, Chionanthus virginicus, indicating the potential for host range expansion. This study evaluates the responses of two introduced larval parasitoids, Spathius agrili and S. galinae, to EAB larvae infesting this novel host plant. Third to fourth instar EAB larvae reared with tropical ash in the laboratory were inserted into green ash and white fringe tree bolts. Infested bolts were exposed to gravid females of both Spathius spp. under no-choice and S. galinae under choice testing conditions. No-choice testing indicated no difference in parasitism rate on EAB larvae between white fringe and green ash for either parasitoid species. Two-choice testing with S. galinae also indicated no difference in parasitism rate when green ash was an option. Sex ratio and brood size were unaffected by host substrate for EAB, but both species emerged sooner on EAB in white fringe tree under no-choice conditions. EAB larvae can be successfully parasitized in white fringe tree under laboratory conditions. These results indicate that S. agrili and S. galinae have potential to attack EAB larvae infesting white fringe tree.

AB  - Seeds from the cocoa tree, Theobroma cacao L. (Malvaceae), make up the raw materials for cocoa which is used to produce chocolate. In Peru, cocoa is produced mainly by smallholder farmers under a small-scale agriculture model. During March and September 2020, surveys of organic smallholding farms were conducted in four Districts of the Department of Piura in northwestern Peru. Three species of the family Tuckerellidae (peacock mites) were collected and identified from this region in Peru: namely Tuckerella ornata (Tucker), Tu. pavoniformis (Ewing), and Tu. knorri Baker & Tuttle. In this article, we report the presence of peacock mites affecting cocoa crops in Peru for the first time. The populations of peacock mites found in the cocoa trees were considerable and causing significant fruit damage. A key to the species of Tuckerella found in cocoa is presented.

TI  - Optimizing the Glass Bead Sterilization Protocol Focusing on Removal of Organic and Bacterial Intraoperative Contamination
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Validated glass bead sterilization protocols to effectively sterilize rodent surgical instruments after bacterial exposure (for example, cecal contamination) are lacking. To refine current approaches, we added either a multienzyme detergent, neutral pH detergent, or chlorhexidine scrub step before glass bead sterilization of forceps or needle drivers exposed to cecal contents. We exposed sets of forceps and needle drivers to cecal contents, which were then air dried for 3 min. Immediately after, the instruments were wiped several times with a clean, dry paper towel. The contaminated tips were soaked in either a multienzyme or neutral pH detergent (t = 5 min), chlorhexidine scrub (t = 2 min), or no pretreatment solution. To further increase debris removal, instruments (from all groups) were brushed using a clean toothbrush. The nonpretreatment instruments were briefly soaked in saline before brushing. After being rinsed with sterile water, all instruments were exposed to a glass bead sterilizer for 60 s at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Sets were then swabbed for bacterial culturing. Swabs were plated onto either sheep blood agar (n = 23) or chocolate agar (n = 20) for aerobic culturing or Brucella agar (n = 20) for anaerobic culturing. A subset of instruments was sampled to determine organic material presence after treatment using an ATP luminometer (n = 21). Multiple agar types and bioluminescence were used to more deeply evaluate tool sterility and to differentiate the relative effectiveness of each protocol. From the saline group, only one pair of forceps yielded growth on Brucella agar, and 2 pairs yielded growth on chocolate agar. No other bacterial growth was observed. The use of a pretreatment agent also lowered overall organic contamination levels in needle drivers compared with using only saline. These results indicate that brushing instruments to mechanically remove debris from instruments is paramount to ensure sterility. However, a best practice would be to also use one of the pretreatment options used in this study.

AB  - Background Damage from insect herbivores can elicit a wide range of plant responses, including reduced or compensatory growth, altered volatile profiles, or increased production of defence compounds. Specifically, herbivory can alter floral development as plants reallocate resources towards defence and regrowth functions. For pollinator-dependent species, floral quantity and quality are critical for attracting floral visitors; thus, herbivore-induced developmental effects that alter either floral abundance or attractiveness may have critical implications for plant reproductive success. Based on past work on resource trade-offs, we hypothesize that herbivore damage-induced effects are stronger in structural floral traits that require significant resource investment (e.g. flower quantity), as plants reallocate resources towards defence and regrowth, and weaker in secondary floral traits that require less structural investment (e.g. nectar rewards).Methods In this study, we simulated early-season herbivore mechanical damage in the domesticated jack-o-lantern pumpkin Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo and measured a diverse suite of floral traits over a 60-d greenhouse experiment.Key Results We found that mechanical damage delayed the onset of male anthesis and reduced the total quantity of flowers produced. Additionally, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) indicated that mechanical damage significantly impacts overall floral volatile profile, though not output of sesquiterpenoids, a class of compounds known to recruit specialized cucumber beetle herbivores and squash bee pollinators.Conclusions We show that C. pepo spp. pepo reduces investment in male flower production following mechanical damage, and that floral volatiles do exhibit shifts in production, indicative of damage-induced trait plasticity. Such reductions in male flower production could reduce the relative attractiveness of damaged plants to foraging pollinators in this globally relevant cultivated species.

AB  - In this study, the dual character of the methane production and fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were evaluated after adding nano-Fe2O3 (NF) during anaerobic digestion (AD) of swine manure, concerning the different exposure times (ET). NF has a decreasing effect on methane production, and the inhibitory effect is proportional to the dosage. NF350 decreased the accumulative methane production by about 7.8% when the ET was 30 days due to the disruption of cellular integrity and the damage to the bacterial communities. Nonetheless, NF could improve the maximum specific methane production rate by up to 24.5% when the ET was shorter than 12 days. And the changes in the relative abundance of ARGs were proportional to the daily methane production at this stage. The addition of NF in a short time is helpful for methanogenic activities, which might be correlated with direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). NF specifically enhanced the reduction of tetracycline resistance genes with antibiotic target protection (40.7%) and aminoglycoside resistance genes with antibiotic inactivation (34.0%) when the ET was 30 days. It was speculated that the specifical reduction was mainly due to that higher NF could produce the ROS (reactive oxygen species), down regulate key enzyme actions in phosphorylation, acetylization, and nucelotidylalation with antibiotic inactivation, and reduces the reduction of selective pressure for tetracycline. Environmental variables and microbial community were the major factors causing the changes of the ARGs by Structural equation models (SEM) and Procrustes analysis. These results illustrated that resonable NF addition could help to improve the accumulative methane production and reduce ARGs during AD of swine manure.

AB  - Elsinoe annonae is a fungal pathogen that causes fruit scab disease in the edible-oil (tea oil) plant (Camellia oleifera Abel). The absence of genome resources for this fungus hampers functional genetic studies of the pathogenesis mechanism of E. annonae. This study reports the genome assembly of E. annonae strain SM-YC-2 collected from tea oil tree fruit with scab disease in Fujian Province, China. Combining 16.44 Gb of PacBio Sequel II long reads and 5.13 Gb of Illumina NovaSeq reads, we generated a 25.93-Mb (99.19% of expected genome size) high-quality genome assembly with 52.66% GC content, 5.05% repeats, and over 98% Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs completeness for E. annonae strain SM-YC-2. These high-quality genome assembly resources will facilitate functional genomic characterization studies, enhance insights into the pathogenicity mechanism of E. annonae, and support the development of molecular-based control strategies.

AB  - The notothenid Patagonotothen ramsayi is one of the most abundant fin fish species on the Patagonian Shelf and it is an important prey species and central to the trophic ecology of the shelf ecosystem of the region. 353 otoliths and the parasites analysed from 80 fishes collected in January 2010, and 2004 and 2006, respectively, from the Falkland Islands Shelf and in an area north of the Falkland Islands on the high seas, were used to gain insights into the stock discrimination using elemental signatures and parasitology. Multivariate analyses (Quadratic Discriminant Function Analysis (QDFA)) of trace elements in the edges of the otolith was extremely well resolved indicating samples taken from the southern (SS), northern Falkland Islands shelf (NS) and the high seas (HS) to the north are clearly separated. Analyses of the otoliths cores were less well resolved, but showed good separation. However, there was overlap with the samples taken on the SS / NS, NS / HS, but no overlap between the samples taken on the SS / HS, indicating some intermixing during larval dispersal. Univariate and multivariate analyses of parasite communities showed a clear separation of samples taken from the SS and HS. In addition, this study has added to the biogeography and knowledge of host specificity of the parasites inhabiting the Patagonian Shelf. Our results demonstrate that the multi-pronged approach of using both otolith trace elemental analyses and parasites can be a powerful tool to resolve stock discrimination in P. ramsayi.

AB  - Urbanization, with the acceleration of construction operations in cities, is the main reason for in-creasing the absorption of thermal energy in urban areas, which leads to climate change, especially urban form has responded differently depending on environmental dimension of urban context concerning the urban heat island intensity. In the last Studies, Researchers have not Codified the effect of urban form on heat islands in the form of a comprehensive model. It is necessary to examine each urban context according to its own conditions. Accordingly, this study aims to identify the effect of building form variability on reducing the intensity of heat islands in Ferdous context of Tabriz in the form of comprehensive modelling as a new task. The research gap is the effect of the form of buildings on the intensity of UHI, and the question will be asked whether it is possible to control the intensity of UHI by changing the form by influencing the climatic indicators. Our conceptual framework was based on urban form typologies in microscale affect the amount of energy intake and consumption, especially the intensity of heat islands, and whether the use of desirable types can be responsive to reducing the intensity of these islands? In this regard, using a quantitative analysis method in Rhinoceros software, especially using Grasshopper plugins, urban form is investigated. This analysis includes both the coldest and hottest days of the year. The results show that the optimal model is the cross typology.

AB  - BackgroundHerbal tea drinks, different from classical Camellia beverages, are a wide variety of herbal drinks consumed for therapeutic purposes or health promotion. Herbal tea is widely consumed in Guangxi. However, the documentation on the plants for herbal tea and their related health benefits is still limited.MethodsAn ethnobotanical survey was conducted in 52 villages and 21 traditional markets in Guangxi from 2016 to 2021. Semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, and structured questionnaires were applied to obtain ethnobotanical information of herbal tea, in which 463 informants had participated. Relative frequency of citation (RFC) and cultural food significance index (CFSI) were used to evaluate the most culturally significant herbal tea plants, and informant consensus factor (ICF) was applied to assess the agreement among informants.ResultsThis study recorded 155 herbal tea species belonging to 49 families. The most commonly used parts included leaf (27.61%), whole plant (22.09%), branch and leaf (19.02%), and flower (13.50%). The most frequent preparation method of herbal tea was decoction. Herbal tea was very popular in Guangxi, attributing to its therapeutic value, special odor, and good taste. There are 41 health benefits classified into eight categories. Among them, clearing heat was the most medicinal effects. Local people had high consistency in tonic, removing cold and cough, improving blood circulation, and clearing heat away. Based on CFSI values of each species, the most culturally significant herbal tea species were Siraitia grosvenorii (Swingle) C. Jeffrey ex A. M. Lu & Zhi Y. Zhang, Plantago asiatica L., Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino, Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Pholidota chinensis Lindl., and Morus alba L.ConclusionHerbal tea is a valuable heritage that carries the local people's traditional knowledge, like health care and religious belief. The recorded herbal tea species in this study possess tremendous potential for local economic development in the future. Further research on efficacy evaluation and product development of herbal tea species is necessary.

AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the environmental impact (EI) of herds representative of the Italian heavy pig production system to investigate the EI variation associated with farm management (FM), diet formulation (DF) and animal response (AR) variables. Data originated from 8 breeding farms, which included the sows and preweaning piglets (Site1) and the post-weaned piglets (7.5-30 kg body weight - BW, Site2) and 10 growing-fattening farms, dealing with 30-170 kg BW pigs (Site3). A cradle-to-farm gate Life Cycle Assessment was used, with 1 kg BW gain (BWG) as functional unit. Impact categories were global warming (GWP), acidification (AP) and eutrophication (EP) potentials and land occupation (LO). Whole-production cycle EI (Site123, 0-170 kg BW) was obtained summing up EIs of 0-30 and 30-170 kg BW animals. Impacts were analysed with one- or two-way PERMANOVA to test the effect of FM, DF and AR variables. The Site123-related EI averaged nearly 3.1 kg CO2-eq (GWP), 50 g SO2-eq (AP), 22 g PO4-eq (EP) and 4.9 m(2)/y (LO) per kg BWG. Site3 contributed nearly 80% of the whole impact. Regarding Site1, GWP resulted mitigated by increasing sow productivity. Site2 EI resulted mitigated by decreasing feed conversion ratio and increasing average daily gain, whereas Site3 EI by increasing feed self-sufficiency and decreasing dietary crude protein and mortality. In perspective, given the relevance of Site3 on the whole-pig system EI, a deeper integration between the farm agronomical management and the growing-finishing pigs' diets formulation would support the environmental sustainability of heavy pig operations.

AB  - Adoption of renewable energy sources such as biomass has been increasing worldwide. In this study, fast pyrolysis as an acceptable and viable method to get renewable bio-oil and biochar is used. Different temperatures and N-2 flow velocities were used in the fast pyrolysis process to evaluate the pyrolysis yield of biochar and bio-oil. The waste wood and pig manure were utilized to prepare biochar and bio-oil. X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, high-pressure liquid chromatograph, Micro confocal laser Raman spectrometer, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and dynamic shear rheometer were used to measure the chemical compositions, structure, and pyrolysis yield of biochar and bio-oil. The obtained results indicate that pyrolysis temperature increases the purity of inorganic oxide in biochar and N-2 flow velocity promotes the yield of carbon in biochar. The increase of N-2 flow velocity would increase the acid property of bio-oil and damage the products yield of bio-oil. It was also observed that biochar could remarkably alter the fundamental performances of petroleum asphalt including penetration, softening point, ductility, viscosity, and complex modulus. The most important is that the upgraded bio-oil can be used to replace partly or fully the petroleum asphalt which is a promising biomass application. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are available in minuscule numbers in the body or placental tissues. These cells have mostly been harvested from bone marrow and adipose tissue. To broaden the currently available knowledge, the current study provides (a) information on the feasibility of isolation of MSCs at different ambient temperatures, (b) details of MSCs' culture characteristics with respect to the physiological status of the donor, and (c) information on the viability of cryopreserved cells. Bone marrow harbors a higher mononuclear cell fraction than that of the adipose tissue, although percent adherent cells are comparably more in adipose tissue. MSCs from a pregnant donor show enhanced proliferation and differentiation potential, although further studies are desired. The cryopreserved cells have comparable characteristics to that of the fresh cells. In conclusion, donor animals' tissue type and physiological status may affect MSCs' characteristics and should be taken into consideration while applying in clinical settings. The current study demonstrates the culture characteristics of adipose tissue and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). The study evaluates the effect of ambient temperature, physiological status of the donor and the tissue source on sheep (Ovis aries) mesenchymal stem cells. The tissue samples were harvested from full term pregnant female sheep (n = 9) and male sheep (n = 10). Adipose tissue was harvested from n = 9 sheep and bone marrow from n = 10 sheep. The samples (adipose tissue, n = 2; bone marrow, n = 3) transported at cold ambient temperature (<10 degrees C) failed to yield MSCs while those (n = 14) at higher (>20 degrees C) ambient temperature successfully yielded MSCs. Bone marrow mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction was higher than the adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF), but the percent adherent cells (PAC) was higher in the later cell fraction. Adipose tissue-derived MSCs from the full term female sheep had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher proliferation potential as compared to those of the male sheep-derived MSCs. Female sheep MSCs also had rapid differentiation potential. The cryopreserved MSCs had morphological features comparable to that of the fresh cells. In conclusion, the tissue type and physiological status of donor animal may affect MSCs' characteristics and should be taken into consideration while applying in clinical settings.

AB  - Climate control represents a significant energy use in livestock houses. Although energy-efficient solutions aimed at reducing this energy consumption are expanding, their spread in these facilities is hindered by the lack of standardized methodologies for assessing their impacts on the energy performance. An Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for livestock houses represents a solid solution for assessing and rating the energy performance of these buildings accordingly to a standardized methodology. Unfortunately, specific EPC s for livestock houses are not present in literature. The aim of this work is to propose the first methodological framework for an EPC specifically developed for livestock houses which can be easily adapted to different types of livestock pro-ductions. An exemplificative adaptation and a practical application are provided for growing-finishing pig houses with the aim of clarifying the certification procedure, highlighting the potentialities of this approach, and providing and discussing some examples of results. The results show that the certified pig house has a low energy performance, labelled with the class E. By adopting the energy efficiency measures proposed in the framework of the EPC, the energy performance could remarkably improve and achieve a class-B rating. This EPC proposal represents a complete novelty in literature and an innovative and promising approach to the topic of energy efficiency in livestock sector by enhancing the comparison of the energy performance between existing livestock houses or design alternatives equipped with different energy-efficient technologies and solutions.

AB  - The imbalance of mineral element homeostasis in animals is common, causing animal immune dysfunction. Ten female sheep were randomly selected and injected with 4% (w/v) Na2EDTA through a central venous catheter to establish the mineral element imbalance model, then divided into control group (before injection) and Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid (EDTA) group (after injection). Isolation of peripheral blood neutrophils for mineral elements content determination was done using Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and nontargeted metabolomics analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The ICP-MS results showed that Hg and Cs levels in neutrophils were significantly lower after injection than before (P < 0.05), but had no significant effects on other elements. Our previous study showed that serum Zn, P, K, and other 11 elements were significantly lower after the injection of Na2EDTA than before. LC-MS/MS results showed that differential metabolites are mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism; monoamine metabolism was weakened; and polyamine metabolism was enhanced. Under positive and negative ion modes, the mineral elements P, K, Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn had the highest correlation with the differential metabolites of neutrophils, followed by Se, and the correlation between each mineral element and different differential metabolites was also different. The results indicated that the imbalance in mineral elements affected the metabolism of sheep neutrophils, these may affect neutrophil function, and Na2EDTA could help to reduce the level of heavy metals in the body of sheep. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the precise regulation of animal immune metabolism by modern animal husbandry nutrition.

AB  - The study of animal mummification in ancient Egypt has recently received increasing attention from a number of modern scholars given the fact that this part of ancient Egyptian funerary and religious history is a practice yet to be fully understood. In this study, nine samples of embalming matter were extracted from six gazelle mummies from the archaeological site of Kom Mereh (modern village of Komir), dated to the Roman period of dominance in ancient Egypt. All samples were analyzed for the presence of inorganic and organic matter applying a multi-analytical approach based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Furthermore, in order to identify more specific compounds such as bitumen and beeswax in studied balms, each sample was subjected to a solid phase extraction (SPE) and saponification separation process, respectively. The results of this study revealed that the majority of the analyzed embalming substances sampled from six gazelle mummies from Kom Mereh were complex mixtures of plant oils, animal fats, conifer resin, and beeswax. In this regard, this study was able to report a practice until now unmentioned in the scientific literature, namely, the use of cruciferous oil, derived from seeds of Brassicaceae plants, in animal mummification.

AB  - Silkworm seed production is vital for silk farming, requiring precise breeding techniques to optimize yields. In silkworm seed production, precise sex classification is crucial for optimizing breeding and boosting silk yields. A non-destructive approach for sex classification addresses these challenges, offering an efficient alternative that enhances both yield and environmental responsibility. Southern India is a hub for mulberry silk and cocoon farming, with the high-yielding double-hybrid varieties FC1 (foundation cross 1) and FC2 (foundation cross 2) being popular. Traditional methods of silkworm pupae sex classification involve manual sorting by experts, necessitating the cutting of cocoons - a practice with a high risk of damaging the cocoon and affecting yield. To address this issue, this study introduces an accelerated histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature extraction technique that is enhanced by block-level dimensionality reduction. This non-destructive method allows for efficient and accurate silkworm pupae classification. The modified HOG features are then fused with weight features and processed through a machine learning classification model that incorporates recursive feature elimination (RFE). Performance evaluation shows that an RFEhybridized XGBoost model attained the highest classification accuracy, achieving 97.2% for FC1 and 97.1% for FC2. The model further optimized with a novel teaching learning-based population selection genetic algorithm (TLBPSGA) achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.5% for FC1 and 98.2% for FC2. These findings have far-reaching implications for improving both the ecological sustainability and economic efficiency of silkworm seed production.

AB  - Mice were exposed to a low dose of the model thyroid hormone disruptor, propylthiouracil. Although this had only a modest effect on maternal thyroid hormones production, postnatal analysis of the pups' plasma by mass spectrometry and the brain striatum by RNA sequencing gave evidence of low lasting changes that could reflect an adverse effect on neurodevelopment. Overall, these methods proved to be sensitive enough to detect minor disruptions of thyroid hormone signalling in vivo.

AB  - Mosquito-borne pathogens have spread throughout tropical regions of the Western Hemisphere causing increased burden of disease in the region. Outbreaks of dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, West Nile, and Zika have occurred over the past several years. Mosquito blood-feeding patterns need to be assayed to assist in determining which vertebrates could act as hosts of these mosquito-borne pathogens and which mosquito species could act as vectors. We conducted bloodmeal analyses of mosquitoes collected at Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, a dry tropical forest reserve in Costa Rica. Mosquitoes were collected using backpack aspirators and light, gravid, and resting traps, and then identified morphologically. Blood-fed mosquitoes underwent DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing of the vertebrate cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase 1 genes to identify vertebrate bloodmeal hosts. Several mosquitoes known to vector pathogens were found including Culex (Melanoconion) erraticus Dyar & Knab (Diptera: Culicidae), Cx. (Mel.) pedroi Sirivanakarn & Belkin, Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus Skuse, Ae. (Ochlerotatus) scapularis Rondani, Ae. (Och.) serratus Theobald, and Ae. (Och.) taeniorhynchus Wiedemann. The most common bloodmeal hosts were basilisk lizards (Basiliscus vittatus) Wiegmann (Squamata: Corytophanidae) in Culex (Linnaeus) species and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) Zimmermann (Artiodactyla: Cervidae) in Aedes (Meigen) species. These results show the diversity of mosquito species in a tropical dry deciduous forest and identify associations between mosquito vectors and potential pathogen reservoir hosts. Our study highlights the importance of understanding interactions between vector species and their hosts that could serve as predictors for the potential emergence or resurgence of mosquito-borne pathogens in Costa Rica.

AB  - This experiment aimed to investigate the effects of wheat and barley substitution for corn on growth performance, blood antioxidant capacity, intestinal health and fecal microbial composition in growing pigs. Eighteen healthy "Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire" pigs (50 +/- 0.85 kg) were randomly divided into three groups with six replicates and one pig per replicate. The three treatment groups were fed the basal diet (CON) based on corn and soybean meal, respectively, and the experimental group diet was partially replaced by wheat (WH) and barley (BL), respectively. The nutritional levels of the three treatments were the same. The experiment lasted 28 days. Wheat and barley partially replacing corn had no significant effects on growing pigs' growth performance, blood antioxidant capacity and nutrient digestibility (p > 0.05). Compared with CON and BL, WH significantly increased the duodenal villus height and villus height/crypt depth ratio of growing pigs (p < 0.05). Compared with CON, WH and BL significantly increased the contents of butyric acid, propionic acid and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) in the cecum and colonic digesta of growing pigs (p < 0.05). In addition, the abundance of Turicibacter, Escherichia-Shigella and other harmful bacteria in barley and wheat diet groups were significantly decreased at the genus level (p < 0.05). The abundance of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Prevotella and Roseburia increased significantly (p < 0.05). In conclusion, barley and wheat partially replacing corn as energy feedstuffs does not affect the growth performance of pigs but can regulate intestinal flora and promote intestinal health.

AB  - Simple Summary The extensive use of animal wastes as fertilizers, often in an uncontrolled manner, may cause the spread of zoonotic diseases as they provide a nutrient-rich environment for pathogens. This study aims to determine the impact of the methane fermentation process carried out in two agricultural biogas plants, which differed in the type of substrates used (pig slurry from a maternal farm versus pig slurry from a fattening farm), on the efficiency of sanitization of biomass. The obtained results lead to the conclusion that the effectiveness of biomass sanitization is significantly higher when pig slurry from a fattening farm is used as a substrate, which offers a clear recommendation for the location of biogas plants in their vicinity. Large-scale pig farming is associated with the production of large amounts of animal excrement, which, after processing into the form of, e.g., slurry, are managed on agricultural land as natural fertilizers. The utilization of pig manure on agricultural land in an excessive and uncontrolled manner may pose a threat to zoonoses due to the significant amounts of potentially pathogenic microorganisms within its content. This study aims to determine the impact of the methane fermentation process carried out in two agricultural biogas plants on the efficiency of sanitization of pig slurry, input biomass, and digestate. The biogas plants differed in terms of the substrate used; one used pig slurry from a maternal (breeding) farm (BP-M), and the other utilized pig slurry from a fattening farm (BP-F). The physicochemical analyses showed that the slurry, input biomass, and digestate from the BP-F were characterized by a significantly higher contents of organic dry matter, ash, and ammonium nitrogen than the slurry, input biomass, and digestate from the BP-M. The parameters of the methane fermentation process, including temperature and pH, reached higher values in the BP-F compared to the BP-M. The microbiological analyses led to the conclusion that the efficiency of sanitization of input biomass, including pig slurry, was significantly higher in the BP-F compared to the BP-M. Due to the above findings, locating biogas plants near pig fattening farms should be recommended.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) toxicity induces significant disruptions in growth and development, plants have developed strategies to alleviate metal toxicity promoting establishment even during herbivores infestation. The study demonstrates that W. trilobata maintains growth and development under the combined stress of Cd exposure and herbivore invasion by Spodoptera litura, in contrast to W. chinensis. Cd toxicity markedly reduce shoot elongation and total fresh biomass, and a significant decrease in the dry weight of the shoot biomass and leaf count by 19%, 18%, 16%, and 19% in W. trilobata compared to controls. An even more pronounced decrease of 35%, 43%, 45% and 43% was found in W. chinensis. Compared to W. chinensis, W. trilobata showed a higher increase in phytohormone production including abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid (GA3), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and methyl jasmonic acid (JA-me) under both Cd and herbivory stress as compared with respective controls. In addition, leaf ultra-structure also showed the highest damage to cell membranous structures by Cd-toxicity in W. chinensis. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis revealed numerous genes viz., EMSY, MCCA, TIRI, BED-type, ABA, JAZ, CAB-6, CPSI, LHCII, CAX, HNM, ABC-Cd-trans and GBLP being differentially expressed between Cd-stress and herbivory groups in both W. trilobata and W. chinensis, with a particular emphasis on genes associated with metal transport and carbohydrate metabolism. Analyses employing the Gene Ontology (GO) system, the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) categorization, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, highlight the functional and evolutionary relationships among the genes of the Phenylpropanoid and Flavonoid biosynthesis pathways and brassinosterod metabolism, associated with plant growth and development under Cd-toxicity and herbivory. W. trilobata opposite of W. chinensis, significantly improve plant growth and mitigates Cd toxicity through modulation of metabolic processes, and regulation of responsible genes, to sustain its growth under Cd and herbivory stress, which can be used in stress improvement in plants for sustainable ecosystem biodiversity and food security.

AB  - The ALDH1A1 gene encodes a cytoplasmic member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, which plays an important role in regulating animal reproductive performance, including estrus cycle and embryonic development. The aim of this study was to characterize ALDH1A1 activity in ovaries of 3-5 year-old yaks and to determine its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and progesterone secretion in luteal cells (LCs). The coding sequence (CDS) of the ALDH1A1 gene was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis was used to confirm localization of the ALDH1A1 protein in the ovary. To assess the activity of ALDH1A1 in regulating progesterone secretion, si-ALDH1A1 was transfected into LCs in vitro and progesterone levels in LC supernatants were measured by ELISA. The interference efficiency was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunofluorescence staining, and cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by EdU and TUNEL staining, respectively. The cloned ALDH1A1 sequence contained 1462 bp, encoding 487 amino acids. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that ALDH1A1 protein expression, which was significantly higher in LCs, was mainly found in antral follicles and the corpus luteum (CL). The expression of ALDH1A1 mRNA in LCs was effectively inhibited by si-ALDH1A1transfection, and progesterone secretion was markedly decreased along with the significant down-regulation of progesterone pathway-related genes, STAR, CYP11A1, CYP19A1, CYP17A1, 3 beta-HSD, and HSD17B1. Knockdown of ALDH1A1 mRNA expression decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in LCs. The mRNA expression of the proliferation-related genes, PCNA, CCND1, CCNB1 and CDC25A, was significantly down-regulated, while expression of the apoptosis-promoting CASP3 gene was significantly increased. In summary, we characterized the yak ALDH1A1 gene and revealed that ALDH1A1 knockdown promoted apoptosis, repressed cell proliferation, and decreased progesterone secretion by yak LCs, potentially by regulating the mRNA expression of genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, and progesterone synthesis and secretion.

AB  - The judgement bias test represents one of the most applied tools to evaluate animals' optimistic/pessimistic attitude and to infer their emotional and welfare state accordingly. The judgement bias test (JBT) has been used several times with dogs (Canis familiaris), in most cases using a spatial test that evaluates the dog's attitude towards a bowl placed in ambiguous positions (located between two unambiguous trained positions associated with opposite outcomes). Results are contrasting and methodological and statistical caveats emerged: dogs struggled to learn the association between unambiguous positions and their outcomes, they hardly discriminated between adjacent locations and they might be influenced by researchers. Therefore, we propose a novel paradigm, aimed at easing the learning process and at achieving more reliable measures. Improvements of the novel paradigm are the increased difference between payoffs of trained locations, the reduction of the number of trials and of their length and the removal of the potential influence of researchers. Results showed that 98% of dogs reached the learning criterion and that their learning appeared more stable: dogs behaved differently between the two trained stimuli and the variability of responses towards these stimuli was lower than the one towards ambiguous stimuli. Behavioural analyses confirmed that dogs fully learned outcomes associated with trained stimuli and that they were hesitant towards ambiguous stimuli. Furthermore, dogs managed to successfully discriminate between each pair of adjacent locations. These results suggest that this protocol is a promising tool to assess judgement biases in dogs and to evaluate their affective state.

AB  - BackgroundSpecies adjust to changes in temperature and the accompanying reduction in resource availability during the annual cycle by shifts in energy allocation. As it gets colder, the priority of energy allocation to maintenance increases and reproduction is reduced or abandoned.ResultsWe studied whether and how young female guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) adjust even under ad libitum food conditions growth, storage of fat reserves and reproduction when kept at 5 degrees C versus 15 degrees C, and how offspring born into these conditions compensate during development to independence. Reproducing females grew less in the cold. Their lower weight resulted largely from less fat storage whereas growth in fat free mass was about the same for both groups. The increased need for thermoregulation diminished fat storage most likely due to the development of more brown fat tissue. Reproductive activity did not differ between groups in terms of litter frequency, mass and size. However, females in 5 degrees C weaned pups later (around day 25) than females in 15 degrees C (around day 21). Later weaning did not make up for the higher energy expenditure of pups in cold conditions leading to slower growth and less fat storage. Female pups born into the cold matured later than those born in 15 degrees C. Investment in reproduction continued but allocation to individual pups declined.ConclusionsIn more thermally demanding conditions female guinea pigs - even under ad libitum food abundance - transfer the higher costs of maintenance and reproduction largely to offspring.

AB  - This work is based on the hypothesis of an impairment in neurogenesis during aging, which may be one of the causes of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Uncompensated neuronal death leads to memory loss. There is an opinion that activation of endogenous neurogenesis or cell replacement therapy may be an effective treatment of AD. We used mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from the human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly, which have a number of significant advantages over MSCs from other tissues. Human MSCs (hMSCs) were transplanted into the frontal cortex of 8-9-month-old female 5XFAD transgenic (Tg) mice, a model of the hereditary AD. To evaluate the effects of such transplantation, spatial memory was analyzed in parallel with morphofunctional characteristics of adult neurogenic niches-the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles of the brain, as well as the brain areas responsible for learning and memory-the temporal cortex and CA1/CA3 fields of the hippocampus, using immunohistochemistry for markers of cell proliferation (BrdU) and neuronal differentiation (nestin, doublecortin, beta-3 tubulin, NeuN, MAP2, GFAP). 5XFAD Tg mice were characterized by an impaired SGZ/SVZ ratio of proliferative activity and a reduced neuronal density in the cortex and hippocampus. The positive effect of hMSC treatment on memory and neuronal as well as glial density in the temporal cortex and hippocampal regions manifested itself two months after transplantation. By that time, hMSCs were detected in the brain of Tg mice only. Both in Tg and non-transgenic (nTg) mice treated with hMSCs, the density of BrdU+ cells was increased in the adult neurogenic niches, however only in the hippocampus of Tg mice, there was a reduced number of amyloid plaques and apoptotic cells, as well as an increased density of synaptophysin-immunopositive (SyP+) cells. Thus, the positive effect of hMSCs was manifested in the hippocampus of Tg mice, the structure remote from the frontal cortex, i.e. the transplantation site. Overall, our data indicate a paracrine effect of hMSCs, as well as the validity of the chimeric model and the promising use of MSC therapy in the treatment of AD.

AB  - The Directive on National Emission Ceilings specifies the reduction of ammonia (NH3) emissions among other air pollutants, which is most significant for the agricultural sector. The ammonia emission limit set for Hungary was a 10% reduction by 2020, while the target of 32% should be reached by 2030 compared to the 2005 reference year. The paper presents the results of a survey on pig production technology in Hungary from 97 domestic farms. The study aims to know the level of implementation of reduction techniques in livestock production and manure management and highlights the need for further improvements in this production sector. The research found that the application of ammonia reduction techniques was not considered widespread, either in livestock buildings or in manure storage (treatment) and during field application. For almost all (more than 90%) pig production groups, the housing systems were the reference without additional emission reduction. For manure storage, farms have insulated storage under the current regulation, however, significantly more emission reduction technologies were in the variant without cover or crust. Slurry spreading was mainly used with manure application techniques, but more emission-friendly injection and band spreading were also emerging. Besides the expected immediate incorporation, a high proportion of manure was applied between 12 and 24 hours or even after 24 hours. hi the studied elements of manure management, significant improvements are needed in applying techniques to reduce ammonia emissions. Effective results can be achieved even by shortening the time between manure application and incorporation with efficient work organization.

AB  - Uncovering genes associated with muscle growth and body size will benefit the molecular breeding of meat Hu sheep. HMGA2 has proven to be an important gene in mouse muscle growth and is associated with the body size of various species. However, its roles in sheep are still limited. Using sheep myoblast as a cell model, the overexpression of HMGA2 significantly promoted sheep myoblast proliferation, while interference with HMGA2 expression inhibited proliferation, indicated by qPCR, EdU, and CCK-8 assays. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter system indicated that the region NC_056056.1: 154134300-154134882 (-618 to -1200 bp upstream of the HMGA2 transcription start site) was one of the habitats of the HMGA2 core promoter, given the observation that this fragment led to a similar to 3-fold increase in luciferase activity. Interestingly, SNP rs428001129 (NC_056056.1:g.154134315 C>A) was detected in this fragment by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product of pooled DNA from 458 crossbred sheep. This SNP was found to affect the promoter activity and was significantly associated with chest width at birth and two months old, as well as chest depth at two and six months old. The data obtained in this study demonstrated the phenotypic regulatory role of the HMGA2 gene in sheep production traits and the potential of rs428001129 in marker-assisted selection for sheep breeding in terms of chest width and chest depth.

AB  - Hypothermic liquid storage at 4-5 degrees C has emerged as a novel approach for preserving boar semen, offering innovative possibilities for semen preservation. However, this method also presents challenges, including cold shock and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Therefore, reducing oxidative damage induced by low temperatures becomes essential while supplementing appropriate protectants. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) compared to Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and Skim Milk Powder (SMP) in maintaining boar sperm motility and progressive motility using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Among the tested concentrations, 4 g/L of BSA exhibited the best protective effect. Subsequently, we supplemented different concentrations of L-cysteine (LC) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) as additives in the presence of BSA as a protectant. Our results demonstrated that 1 mmol/L of LC and 0.5 mmol/L of NAC exhibited superior protection of sperm quality compared to other concentrations. Furthermore, the 1 mmol/L LC and 0.5 mmol/L NAC groups showed significantly improved plasma membrane integrity and acrosome integrity compared to the control group. These groups also exhibited enhanced antioxidant capacity, evidenced by increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP production, total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and GPX-4 levels. Additionally, they demonstrated decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as reduced oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and glutathione reductase (GR) levels. Furthermore, LC and NAC treatment enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. However, inhibiting AMPK using compound C did not inhibit the protective effects of LC and NAC on low-temperature preserved boar sperm. These findings suggest that 4 g/L BSA can serve as an effective protectant for hypothermic liquid storage of boar semen. Additionally, LC and NAC supplementation reduces oxidative damage by enhancing antioxidant capacity rather than through AMPK-mediated ATP supplementation. These results contribute to advancing the application of LC and NAC in hypothermic liquid storage of boar semen.

AB  - The silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, is an invasive polyphagous pest affecting several agricultural and horticultural crops worldwide. A multimodal effort involving mixing new-generation chemicals and botanical insecticides effectively eliminate this destructive insect pest and resistance problems through synergistic actions. Moringa oleifera, often known as the 'miracle tree', has evolved into a plethora of secondary metabolites in the root system that possess exceptional insecticidal potency and interfere with the defensive mechanisms of other plant genera. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of flupyradifurone 17.09 % SL or afidopyropen 50 g/L DC alone and in combination with moringa root extract (MRE) (10 % w/v) on B. tabaci nymphal and adult mortality, as well as on the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and plant defense enzymes of chili, eggplant and tomato crops. The tested insecticides exhibited excellent synergism with MRE at 1:10 and 1:20 ratios, with combination indices <1. Overall, the flupyradifurone or afidopyropen + MRE treatments at medium to high dosages significantly reduced the percentage of healthy nymphs (1.82-2.17 %), while increasing the percent reduction of adults in the greenhouse (29.76-90.07 %) and nymphal and adult populations of B. tabaci in the field (20.21-92.29 %) compared with the control (96.32 %, 2.18-5.96 %, and 2.09-5.32 %, respectively) and single insecticidal treatments (3.92-4.48 %, 29.27-88.39 %, and 21.18-89.25 %, respectively). In addition, the MRE-based treatments significantly elevated the activities of peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) enzymes, as well as the subsequent emissions of the lipoxygenase pathway and monoterpene compounds in host plants following whitefly herbivory. Mixtures of lower recommended doses of afidopyropen or flupyradifurone with MREs could be a viable option to prolong the field efficacy of the insecticides against B. tabaci via excellent synergism and activating plant defensive compounds.

AB  - The archeology of the Puna, a high elevation desert in South America, gives us a long-term perspective on the role of wild plants in people's diets during the Holocene. We explore the impact of aridification on the use of edible wild plants among desert people through the study of macrobotanical remains. Our goal is to examine the variation in plant dependency and risk management strategies used over time, in particular during the drought of the Middle Holocene (ca. 8700-4500 BP). The macrobotanical record suggests the use of risk-averse strategies in order to cope with unpredictable resource productivity. Hunter-gatherers relied on carbohydrate rich resources from the vega wetlands and tolar shrublands, such as roots and tubers, as well as low-ranked seeds, stems, leaves, and fruits. They also obtained non-local edible plants by strengthening ties and forming safety nets with groups living in different ecozones that were not subject to the same resource fluctuation. Social interaction with areas lying beyond the ecological boundaries of the Puna has a longstanding tradition in this area beginning in the Early Holocene, and was likely a means of providing food security to populations whose subsistence depended mainly on camelid hunting, and eventually camelid pastoralism. A notable increase in that interaction began during the Late-Holocene, which was a period of lesser aridity, with the introduction of corn and quinoa.

AB  - In order to monitor wildlife populations in a manner that supports policy makers and natural resource managers, data must be collected using frameworks and methodologies that allow for comparisons between projects and across time. Though hunting statistics may represent a reliable data source for monitoring population trends in game species, a standardised framework for collecting and analysing this data has never been established in Europe, even within countries. Here we describe a case study on the use of hunting statistics in Spain in order to (i) describe the variability in big game statistics collection frameworks across mainland regions of Spain and (ii) propose a minimum common denominator for a standardised approach at the country level. The main differences in methodologies identified are that each region collects different variables, uses different spatial and temporal resolution, and follows different methodologies. We described spatial patterns by grouping regions based on similarities in the hunting data collection system and identified socio-economic factors as a potential driver of differences in methodologies among regions. Hunting effort-related variables and improved temporal resolution (to the event level) must be incorporated in order to achieve country-level standardisation of methodologies. The use of application software to collect information from the field in a standardised way is recommended, which necessitates engaging stakeholders as part of the monitoring process. Applications software should be designed intentionally, and only after clear objectives for the monitoring program have been defined. Making hunting data open access will improve collaboration and information transfer to scientific and professional sectors. Our recommendations can be adapted to other European countries, which would make hunting data more useful for population monitoring and wildlife policy-making at large spatial scales. Initiatives such as the "European Wildlife Observatory" (www.wildlifeobservatory.org), a network of wildlife observation and monitoring points in Europe, may improve data exchange and standardise protocols, leading to better utilisation of hunting statistics for European wildlife population monitoring.

AB  - Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in maritime power networks have led to the integration of renewable energy resources into hybrid AC shipboard microgrid (hSMG) systems. However, challenges are introduced in maintaining voltage and frequency within acceptable limits due to the stochastic nature of power injection from renewable energy sources, the intermittent nature of the load due to the propulsion or the hotel loads and the sensors/communication link time delays. This article introduces for the first time a hardware-in-loop implementation of combining load frequency control and automatic voltage regulation within an autonomous hSMG comprising wave power generation, photovoltaic, diesel generator, proton exchange membrane fuel cell energy unit, battery energy storage system and flywheel energy storage system. The analysis also considers the significance of addressing time delays resulting from communication links between the sensors and the controllers. The stability of the hSMG model is assessed through comprehensive analysis under different scenarios and comparative performance of various controllers. The parameters of the controllers are fine-tuned using a recently developed bio-inspired approach, the Gazelle Optimization Algorithm. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the best controller found is carried out. Experimental results demonstrate the resilience and effectiveness of the proposed frequency/voltage control approach.

AB  - Birds are a remarkable example of how sexual selection can produce diverse ornaments and behaviours. Specialised fighting structures like deer's antlers, in contrast, are mostly absent among birds. Here, we investigated if the birds' costly mode of locomotion-powered flight-helps explain the scarcity of weapons among members of this clade. Our simulations of flight energetics predicted that the cost of bony spurs-a specialised avian weapon-should increase with time spent flying. Bayesian phylogenetic comparative analyses using a global spur dataset corroborated this prediction. First, extant species with flight-efficient wings (which presumably fly more frequently) tend to have fewer or no bony spurs. Second, this association likely arose because flying more leads to more frequent evolutionary loss of spurs. Together, these findings suggest that, much like pneumatic bones, absence of weaponry may be another feature of the avian body plan that allows birds to efficiently explore the aerial habitat.

AB  - Nitrogen fixation is often cited as an important nitrogen source for termites. However, the rate of nitrogen fixation between experiments and termite species is highly variable due to termite diversity and sampling limitations. New evidence suggests that subterranean termites (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki) (Blattodea, Rhinotermitidae) seek alternative dietary nitrogen sources for colony growth and development. This study compares N2 fixation rates and nitrogenase gene expression rates to a diverse assemblage of feeding groups. It was observed that nitrogenase expression was much higher in one-piece nesting termites from the family Kalotermitidae which lack access to soil. On the other hand, subterranean termites from the family Rhinotermitidae fix nitrogen at much lower rates, not differing from ambient nitrogenase activity in soil.

AB  - Many prey organisms adaptively respond to predation risk by inducible defenses with underlying tradeoffs in resource allocation. Cyanobacterial blooms expose zooplankton to poor food conditions, affecting the herbivores' fitness. Given the interferences on resources allocation and life history traits, poor-quality cyanobacteria are predicted to affect the adaptive predator-induced responses in zooplankton. Here, we exposed two clones (i.e., clones SH and ZJ) of the cladoceran Daphnia mitsukuri to different combinations of fish predation cues and diets containing toxic Microcystis aeruginosa (0%-30%). D. mitsukuri matured at a small size and had elongated relative tail spine as adaptive responses to fish cues. Despite the comparable tail spine defense, fish cue-induced changes in growth and reproduction in the clone SH were more pronounced than those in the clone ZJ under no M. aeruginosa. Animals accumulated microcystin in the whole body with increasing abundance of M. aeruginosa. However, the inducible enhanced tail spine allometry was not affected, resulting in unchanged tail spine defense by Daphnia under all M. aeruginosa treatments. By contrast, M. aeruginosa remarkably decreased the adaptive maturation size and the offspring number in all animals. However, the inducible reproductive effort tended to increase or remain unchanged depending on clones associated with the constant or decreased responses of the somatic growth effort under increasing M. aeruginosa. Our results suggested that toxic M. aeruginosa did not alter the resource allocation to antipredator morphological defense but affected the somatic growth and reproduction in D. mitsukuri under fish cues. The present study highlights the different effects of toxic cyanobacteria on adaptive predator-induced responses in zooplankton, promoting the understanding for the morphological defense-mediated predator-prey interactions in eutrophic environments.

AB  - Structure of the chymosin gene of Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) was established for the first time and its exon/intron organization was determined. Coding part of the chymosin gene of C. pygargus was reconstructed by the Golden Gate method and obtained as a DNA clone. Comparative sequence analysis of the roe deer, cow, and one-humped camel prochymosins revealed a number of amino acid substitutions at the sites forming the substrate-binding cavity of the enzyme and affecting the S4 and S1 ' + S3 ' specificity subsites. Integration vector pIP1 was used to construct a plasmid pIP1-Cap in order to express recombinant roe deer prochymosin gene in CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1-CYM-Cap pool cells were obtained, allowing synthesis and secretion of recombinant prochymosin into the culture fluid. As a result of zymogen activation, a recombinant roe deer chymosin was obtained and its total milk-clotting activity was estimated to be 468.4 +/- 11.1 IMCU/ml. Yield of the recombinant roe deer chymosin was 500 mg/liter or approximate to 468,000 IMCU/liter, which exceeds the yields of genetically engineered chymosins in most of the expression systems used. Basic biochemical properties of the obtained enzyme were compared with the commercial preparations of recombinant chymosins from one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) and cow (Bos taurus). Specific milk-clotting activity of the recombinant chymosin of C. pygargus was 938 +/- 22 IMCU/mg, which was comparable to that of the reference enzymes. Non-specific proteolytic activity of the recombinant roe deer chymosin was 1.4-4.5 times higher than that of the cow and camel enzymes. In terms of coagulation specificity, recombinant chymosin of C. pygargus occupied an intermediate position between the genetically engineered analogs of B. taurus and C. dromedarius chymosins. Thermostability threshold of the recombinant roe deer chymosin was 55 degrees C. At 60 degrees C, the enzyme retained <1% of its initial milk-clotting activity, and its complete thermal inactivation was observed at 65 degrees C.

AB  - Transportation facilities are characterized by high population density and significant passenger turnover. These environments provide optimal conditions for the transmission of airborne microorganisms. We collected airborne microbial samples in transportation facilities in the Republic of Korea and characterize bacterial and fungal communities, and respiratory disease-associated viruses using qPCR, and derived regression equations. inhalation exposure levels were estimated based on the air concentration of microbiomes and the average weight and inhalation rate of Koreans. Microbial copy numbers were compared for significant differences based on facility type and season. The concentrations of bacteria (p < 0.001) and influenza A virus (p < 0.01) differed depending on the facility, whereas fungi showed variations based on the season (p < 0.001). Significant variations were noted, particularly in relation to the human rhinovirus, both in terms of seasonal patterns (p < 0.05) and between different facilities (p < 0.05). We found that human adenovirus (p < 0.01) and influenza A virus (p < 0.05) were positively influenced by particulate matter, while human rhinovirus was negatively affected by temperature (p < 0.05). Bacteria were positively influenced by CO2 (p < 0.001) and particulate matter (p < 0.01), whereas fungi were positively influenced by relative humidity (p < 0.001). The microbial inhalation exposure level among male children exceeded that among adult males (p < 0.05). Additionally, inhalation exposure to microbes was higher in trains than in train stations, which was attributed to the differences in usage times.

AB  - Taeniids are multi-host parasites with an indirect life cycle that strictly depends on a predator-prey relationship. Parasites with a complex life cycle may exhibit different degrees of host-specificity at each life stage. Knowing the host breadth is a fundamental concept of the biology and epidemiology of these multi-host parasites. Morphological identification of tapeworms is challenging and occasionally may produce misdiagnosis. Thus, molecular investigations were carried out for the identification of parasitic cysts detected from muscle tissues in a male roe deer necropsied at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Umbria e delle Marche "Togo Rosati" (Central Italy). Sanger sequencing showed 99% query cover, 2e-109 e-value, and 100% identity with Taenia serialis. The exact definitive host was not revealed in this report, but red foxes and Italian wolves may play a significant role as being widespread within the area. Wildlife surveillance is crucial to monitor for human and animal health since global distribution and flexibility in intermediate hosts of many and even more critical taeniids species may enlarge their host range.

AB  - Elucidating factors influencing home range size is fundamental to the ecology and management of wildlife species, particularly those of conservation concern, because they can provide insight into how species utilize and interact with their environment. Variation in home range size can be related to intraspecific competition and social organization, energetic requirements in relation to habitat productivity, allometric relationships, and population density. The Mexican Gray Wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) is an endangered subspecies of the Gray Wolf whose home range size has not yet been studied. We examined ecological and social drivers of home range size of 22 Mexican Wolf packs between 2017 and 2021 across 4 biological time frames: annual; denning; post-denning; and non-denning. We used a 95% Brownian Bridge Movement Model home range estimator and generalized linear mixed-effect models to assess these relationships. Home range size was inversely correlated with estimated ungulate biomass, which was the most influential driver of home range size at annual and post-denning time frames. Larger packs utilized larger ranges during denning and post-denning time frames, while packs with larger litters had smaller ranges during the denning season. Snow depth was inversely related to home range size during the non-denning season. Our results indicate that both ecological and social factors are important and seasonally dependent in driving Mexican Wolf home range size. Use of a multiscale approach in future home range studies could discern relevant factors for species during time frames of interest.

AB  - Spermatozoa require the capacitation, a series of biochemical events, to perform fertilization. Many toxic compounds can interfere in this process, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which belong to the perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Since both substances are found in many everyday materials and are highly persistent, they accumulate in organisms where they have been associated with fertility problems. This study analyzes the effects of PFOS and PFOA on the functionality of boar spermatozoa, and changes in the plasma membrane (PM) during capacitation. The median lethal concentrations (LC50) of PFOS and PFOA were 460 and 1894 mu M, respectively, while the mean inhibitory concentrations of capacitation (ICC50) were 274 mu M and 1458 mu M, respectively. The ICC50 of PFOA was insufficient to reduce the capacitation, but 950 mu M (1/2 LC50) of PFOA and the ICC50 of PFOS significantly reduced the number of capacitated spermatozoa. PFOS and PFOA also impeded the progesterone (P4)-induced acrosomal reaction (iAR). These effects occur despite the accumulation of [Ca2+](i) under capacitating conditions. The accumulation of [Ca2+](i) produces saturation, which prevents its entry through ionophore A23187 and P4 in the presence of PFOS. Membrane potential (Emv) was deregulated. Both PFAS affected lipid membrane conductance mediated by valinomycin. The spermatozoa presented 49% and 47% of membrane dysfunction with PFOS and PFOA, respectively. By causing membrane damage, both substances prevented the release of cholesterol and altered the organization of membrane microdomains (MMDs). Data indicate that both PFAS caused alterations in PM functionality.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent years, the soaring price of corn-soybean meal has led to an increase in the price of feed, which has brought significant challenges to the pig industry. The addition of more grains to pig diets will help develop new feed resources and improve profits. In this study, we focused on the effects of yeast culture (YC) supplementation on growth performance, meat quality, and gut microbiota of growing-finishing pigs. Three experimental diets were compared: a corn-soybean-based diet (CON), a wheat-rice-based diet (GRA), and a wheat-rice-based diet supplemented with YC. The growth performance of pigs on the wheat-rice-based diet was similar to that of pigs on the corn-soybean-based diet, but the feed cost reduced by 6.7% compared with CON. The dressing percentages of pigs in GRA and YC also increased by 1.43% and 2.15%, respectively. Meat color and antioxidant capacity improved after YC supplementation. YC supplementation promotes the proliferation of probiotics, inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria, and improves intestinal health. Application of a cereal-based diet and YC supplementation in growing pigs appears to be a very promising strategy for cost saving and economic benefits for the swine industry. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) supplementation on the growth performance, meat quality, gut health, and microbiota community of growing-finishing pigs. A total of 45 growing-finishing pigs were randomly allocated to three treatments: a corn-soybean-based diet (CON, n = 15), a wheat-rice-based diet (GRA, n = 15), and GRA supplemented with 500 mg/kg yeast culture (YC, n = 15). The results show that compared to the CON group, the GRA group exhibited no significant differences in feed intake, daily gain, or feed conversion ratio, but had significantly reduced feed cost per kilogram BW gain of the finishing pigs (p < 0.05). Compared to that of the CON group, the GRA and YC groups showed an increase in the dressing percentage (p < 0.1). The meat color redness of the YC group increased (p < 0.1), whereas the b* value at 24 h decreased (p < 0.1). Meanwhile, the addition of YC significantly increased total superoxide dismutase activity on day 30 and catalase activity on day 60 (p < 0.05), and decreased serum urea nitrogen content on day 60 (p < 0.05). Furthermore, YC supplementation increased the gene expression of the duodenal anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 (p < 0.05), while it significantly decreased the gene expression of the ileal pro-inflammatory factor IL-8 (p < 0.05). The intestinal microbial identification results show that compared to the CON group, the YC group showed an increase in the relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium in the colon, and a decrease in the relative abundances of Bacteroidea, Clostridae, and Prevotella in the cecum. In conclusion, the growth performance of pigs on a wheat-rice-based diet was similar to that of pigs on a corn-soybean-based diet. Supplementation of 0.5% YC in the wheat-rice-based diet could improve the dressing percentage and meat color of growing-finishing pigs, which might be due to the increase in nitrogen utility and antioxidant capacity, and the improvement of the immune system and changes in microbiota communities.

AB  - Neonatal seizures are common in newborn infants after birth asphyxia. They occur more frequently in male than female neonates, but it is not known whether sex also affects seizure severity or duration. Furthermore, although stress and diurnal, ultradian, circadian, or multidien cycles are known to affect epileptic seizures in adults, their potential impact on neonatal seizures is not understood. This prompted us to examine the effects of season, daytime, sex, and stress on neonatal seizures in a rat model of birth asphyxia. Seizures monitored in 176 rat pups exposed to asphyxia on 40 experimental days performed over 3 years were evaluated. All rat pups exhibited seizures when exposed to asphyxia at postnatal day 11 (P11), which in terms of cortical development corresponds to term human babies. A first examination of these data indicated a seasonal variation, with the highest seizure severity in the spring. Sex and daytime did not affect seizure characteristics. However, when rat pups were subdivided into animals that were exposed to acute (short-term) stress after asphyxia (restraint and i.p. injection of vehicle) and animals that were not exposed to this stress, the seizures in stress-exposed rats were more severe but less frequent. Acute stress induced an increase in hippocampal microglia density in sham-exposed rat pups, which may have an additive effect on microglia activation induced by asphyxia. When seasonal data were separately analyzed for stress-exposed vs. non-stress-exposed rat pups, no significant seasonal variation was observed. This study illustrates that without a detailed analysis of all factors, the data would have erroneously indicated significant seasonal variability in the severity of neonatal seizures. Instead, the study demonstrates that even mild, short-lasting postnatal stress has a profound effect on asphyxia-induced seizures, most likely by increasing the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. It will be interesting to examine how postnatal stress affects the treatment and adverse outcomes of birth asphyxia and neonatal seizures in the rat model used here. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background The continuous accessibility of local animals for sustainable use is being eroded annually. Thus, a strategic vision for the conservation of biodiversity is of far-reaching emphasis to deal with unprecedented challenges in the local population extension facing in the future. This study aimed to establish and cryopreserve endangered Markhoz goat (Capra hircus) fibroblast cell lines in vitro. Methods and results These primary fibroblast cells were isolated from 58 Iranian Markhoz goats and individually cultured by explant technique in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-Glutamine, in the presence of Penicillin (200 U/ml)-Streptomycin (200 mg/ml) during the first passage number. The extracted cell lines were confirmed morphologically as fibroblast cells. The population doubling time for DMEM-cultured cells was 23 +/- 0.5 h. Chromosomal analysis indicated a total chromosome number of 2n = 60 with > 95% frequency. The cultured cells were checked for bacteria, fungi, yeast, and mycoplasma contaminations and the results were reported negative. The efficiencies of the fluorescent protein encoded by VSV-G (pMDG) and lentiviral pCSGW vectors reported in a range of 65% value. According to the species identification analysis, the goat cell lines were banked and confirmed without any miss- and cross-contamination. Conclusions The significant issue in this paper can be concluded about the first report of the establishment of endangered Markhoz goat cell banking inside the country. This study demonstrated the successful establishment of a genetically stable fibroblast bank as a valuable genetic resource for the endangered Iranian Markhoz goat breed.

AB  - The Liaoning cashmere goat is a unique breed in China. It has an excellent germplasm resource with high villus yield, fine villus fibre quality, stable genetic performance and significant economic benefits.In this study, the effects of different concentrations of 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 on the proliferation of skin fibroblasts was detected via CCK8 assay, while the expression of genes and proteins related to villus growth in Liaoning cashmere goat were detected by qRT-PCR and Western Blot. Treatment of Liaoning cashmere goat skin fibroblasts with 0.01 ng/L of 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 for 72 h significantly promoted the proliferation of Liaoning cashmere goat skin fibroblasts, increased the expression of VDR, WNT10B, LEF1 and & beta;-catenin genes, and decreased the expression of BMP4 and BMPRIB genes, indicating that 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 plays a positive role in regulating hair follicle growth and development through the WNT and BMP signaling pathway, which positively regulates the growth and development of hair follicles. VDR interacting proteins were screened using Co-IP combined mass spectrometry. After treatment of cells with 0.01 ng/L of 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 for 72 h, VDR interacting proteins were enriched to PI3K-AKT signaling pathways associated with hair follicle growth and development. Moreover, mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein S100, protein disulfide bond isomerase protein, FLII actin remodeling protein and multifunctional proteoglycan protein related to the growth and development of hair follicles were upregulated, indicating that a positive regulatory effect of 1.25(OH)(2)D-3 on hair follicle growth and development.

AB  - Air pollution (AP) represents one of the main environmental threats to public health and exposure to AP has been connected to upper airway (UA) disease. We evaluated the relationships between the ENT urgent referrals recorded at the Hospital of Padua and the daily levels of particulate matter (PM) as well as other environmental factors in a single year. Patients with UA disorders were included in the study group while those referred for facial trauma or foreign body inhalation formed the control group. Daily PM concentrations, meteorological data and the concentrations of the commonest aeroallergens were obtained. 6368 patients formed the study group and 910 the control one. The concentration of compositae allergens showed a positive effect on the total number of admissions (p = 0.001). PM10 did not demonstrate an effect on the total number of admissions or either the study or control groups admissions (p = 0.25). Alternaria positively influenced admissions of patients in the study group (p = 0.005). Significant relationships were found between the following: PM10 measured on the seventh day before A&E admission and rhinosinusitis (p = 0.007), PM10 on the fifth day and laryngitis (p = 0.01), PM10 on the second day and otitis media (p = 0.03), PM10 on the admission day and epistaxis (p = 0.0198). Our study confirms the causal relationship between aeroallergen concentration and ENT admissions. The levels of PM10 at specific days preceding A&E admission correlated with certain UA disorders. This study strongly points towards the harmful effects of pollution and climate change on UA disease.

AB  - In this study, we conducted a comprehensive and integrated test of tropical cyclone track prediction using deep learning technologies, aiming to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the prediction methods. We employed the Best Track dataset from the China Meteorological Administration's Tropical Cyclone Data Center, which covers the Northwest Pacific region from 1949 to 2023. This dataset provides comprehensive coverage, encompassing critical tropical cyclone details like time, latitude, longitude, and wind speed. Our focus was on evaluating and comparing different deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), for their effectiveness in handling complex time series data. Through detailed analysis of various model configurations, including factors such as input-output lengths, hidden size, the number of layers, the implementation of bi-directional networks, and attention mechanisms, we discovered that LSTM and GRU models significantly outperform traditional RNN models in dealing with long-term dependencies and enhancing prediction accuracy. Moreover, the LSTM model, used to forecast key tropical cyclones during the 2023 Pacific tropical cyclone season, achieved mean errors of 21.84 km, 37.56 km, and 26.12 km for Typhoons Mawar, Doksuri, and Saola, respectively. This method also demonstrated high efficiency in rapid response to extreme weather changes, processing each tropical cyclone's forecast in just about 8 s. The results not only illustrate the practical utility of deep learning in tropical cyclone track prediction but also provide new, effective tools for disaster prevention and mitigation efforts.

AB  - Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) are a large-bodied species of flatfish that are important culturally, economically, and as a key predator in marine systems in the USA and Canada. The species has a wide distribution, and complex life history including large-scale migrations to spawn and feed, making it potentially susceptible to climate change impacts. We examined the potential changes in halibut distribution and relative abundance that may arise from changing temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations using species distribution models (SDMs) and future climate scenarios downscaled by two regional ocean models. SDMs were fit with both environmental variables (depth, near-bottom temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration) and spatial random field components (representing unknown habitat-related variables). The best-fitting models, trained on data from 2009 to 2013, were able to account for 33 % and 53 % of the variation in small and large halibut catch-per-unit-effort in the annual set-line survey data from 2014 to 2020. The results suggest that the response of Pacific halibut to climate change in British Columbia and Washington waters is likely to depend on changes in dissolved oxygen concentration. Pacific halibut appear sensitive to changes in dissolved oxygen, yet relatively tolerant to increases in temperature. Projections for 2046-2065 period suggest that future decreases in near-bottom dissolved oxygen in shallow waters that small halibut inhabit are likely to result in moderate decreases in relative abundance. Projected changes in relative abundance are less certain for large Pacific halibut, due to disagreement in the regional ocean models near-bottom dissolved oxygen projections at mid depths (300-600 m) where large Pacific halibut are more common. Overall, the relative abundance of Pacific halibut is expected to decrease in most areas of British Columbia. Future management strategies will need to account for the projected changes in distribution and abundance and their uncertainty.

AB  - Heather, Calluna vulgaris, is a non-native plant that displaces indigenous vegetation in Tongariro National Park (TNP), New Zealand (NZ), and was targeted for biocontrol with introductions of European heather beetle, Lochmaea suturalis. Heather beetle was chosen as a biocontrol agent for NZ because in its native Europe it is a host-specific, outbreak-pest of low-fertility, heather-dominated ecosystems. However, when released in NZ in the 1990s heather beetle did not perform as expected: establishing field populations proved difficult, and population growth rates were lower than in European outbreaks. European research links heather beetle outbreaks to air pollution that causes increased host-plant nitrogen (N). We hypothesized that low N in NZ heather, probably caused by low air pollution combined with low-fertility soils, contributes to poor heather beetle performance. We confirmed that heather in TNP has low mean N (1.14% dry weight) compared to UK samples (1.48%). In TNP, fertilizing heather increased mean N to 1.35%, which, in caged bioassays increased heather beetle oviposition (by 35%) and adult body mass (by 28%). From 2001 to 2015 in TNP a field release trial showed improved heather beetle performance on fertilized heather plots versus controls. We conclude that low host-plant N probably contributed to poor heather beetle performance in TNP. Further research is needed to make a causal link between low N in heather in TNP and low air pollution, and to determine the underlying mechanisms for reduced performance of heather beetle, such as reduced fecundity, increased overwintering mortality, and/or Allee effects. Host-plant quality has rarely been implicated in poor performance of weed biocontrol agents and deserves further investigation.

AB  - On the Iberian Peninsula, abrupt climate shifts during the Late Pleistocene impacted human and natural systems. Our knowledge of human adaptive responses to these climatic perturbations has improved in recent years with the development of new radiocarbon techniques that have increased the temporal resolution of cultural chronologies. At the same time, new high-resolution paleoclimatic records from Greenland ice cores, deep-sea sediment cores, speleothems, and microfaunal assemblages have permitted detailed paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Combined with the archaeological record of culture change, these data sets allow for a better understanding of the nature of human socio-ecological systems during the Late Pleistocene. Here we present new data on the Gravettian occupations at Lapa do Picareiro, a cave site in Portugal with a long continuous stratigraphic sequence spanning MIS 3 and 2. The ongoing excavation of Lapa do Picareiro has revealed at least three Gravettian levels with very different patterns of raw material use and technological reduction. The Early Gravettian levels contain a quartzite flake assemblage with several refitting clusters and a small chert assemblage with nosed endscrapers and bladelet technology. The Late or Terminal Gravettian level contains carinated endscraper/core-bladelet technology, mainly quartz, with chert blade production, and a few bone tools. The faunal assemblages also have a different character. Both contain a similar range of medium and large ungulates but the earlier Gravettian has a much richer and more diverse assemblage of small animals. These combined archaeological data sets provide a new perspective on Gravettian human adaptations in response to climate shifts, especially Heinrich Event 3 and Greenland Interstadials 4 and 3.

AB  - Tortoiseshell and deer antler gelatin has been used to treat bone diseases in Chinese society. A pepsin-digested gelatin peptide with osteoblast-proliferation-stimulating properties was identified via LC-MS/MS. The resulting pentapeptide, TSKYR, was presumably subjected to further degradation into TSKY, TSK, and YR fragments in the small intestine. The above four peptides were chemically synthesized. Treatment of tripeptide TSK can lead to a significant 30- and 50-fold increase in the mineralized nodule area and density in osteoblast cells and a 47.5% increase in the number of chondrocyte cells. The calcium content in tortoiseshell was relatively higher than in human soft tissue. The synergistic effects of calcium ions and the peptides were observed for changes in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, these peptides can enhance the expression of RUNX2, OCN, FGFR2, and FRFR3 genes in osteoblasts, and aggrecan and collagen type II in chondrocyte (patent pending).

AB  - Non-papilionate and actinomorphic flowers have evolved independently in Papilionoideae, and few ontogeny studies are available about them. The objective of the present study was to better understand the ontogenetic processes that result in papilionate and non-papilionate flowers in a sister group of the Pterocarpus clade. Inflorescences, flower buds and flowers of Discolobium pulchellum and Riedeliella graciliflora were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy and histochemistry of the secretory structures of floral organs. The differentiation of the petals is initiated by the petal standard followed by the keel petals and finally by the wing petals in Discolobium, in contrast to a unidirectional development of the petals in the corolla of Riedeliella. The order of sepals and antesepalous stamen is unidirectional in D. pulchellum and modified unidirectional in R. graciliflora; however, the order of petal and antepetalous stamen initiation, stamen symmetry and early appearance of carpel are similar in both species. Hypanthium and floral nectary are present only in D. pulchellum and colleters in R. graciliflora. Glandular trichomes and idioblasts are present in both species. The presence of secretory structures is possibly related to the protection against herbivores, to pollination and pollinator's attraction since different secondary compounds are present in reproductive structures. The development of the actinomorphic corolla of Riedeliella graciliflora has no similarity in terms of floral development to the other representatives of actinomorphic symmetry in Papilionoideae.

AB  - Crop-wild gene flow may alter the fitness of the recipient i.e., crop-wild hybrids, then potentially impact wild populations, especially for the gene flow carrying selective advantageous crop alleles, such as transgenes conferring insect resistance. Given the continuous crop-wild gene flow since crop domestication and the occasionally stressful environments, the extant wild populations of most crops are still "wild. " One interpretation for this phenomenon is that wild populations have the mechanism buffered for the effects of crop alleles. However, solid evidence for this has been scarce. We used wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) and transgenic (Bt/CpTI) rice (O. sativa) as a crop-wild gene flow model and established cultivated, wild, and F7 hybrid rice populations under four levels of insect (Chilo suppressalis) pressure. Then, we measured the trait performance of the plants and estimated fitness to test the compensatory response of relatively high fitness compared to the level of insect damage. The performance of all plants varied with the insect pressure level; wild plants had higher insect-tolerance that was expressed as over- or equal-compensatory responses to insect damage, whereas crop and hybrids exhibited under-compensatory responses. The higher compensation resulted in a better performance of wild rice under insect pressure where transgenes conferring insect resistance had a somewhat beneficial effect. Remarkable hybrid vigour and the benefit effect of transgenes increased the fitness of hybrids together, but this joint effect was weakened by the compensation of wild plants. These results suggest that compensation to environmental stress may reduce the potential impacts of crop alleles on wild plants, thereby it is a mechanism maintaining the "wild " characteristics of wild populations under the scenario of continuous crop-wild gene flow.

AB  - The use of 2-dimensional representations (e.g. photographs or digital images) of real-life physical objects has been an important tool in studies of animal cognition. Horses are reported to recognise objects and individuals (conspecifics and humans) from printed photographs, but it is unclear whether image recognition is also true for digital images, e.g. computer projections. We expected that horses trained to discriminate between two real-life objects would show the same learnt response to digital images of these objects indicating that the images were perceived as objects, or representations of such. Riding-school horses (N = 27) learnt to touch one of two objects (target object counterbalanced between horses) to instantly receive a food reward. After discrimination learning (three consecutive sessions of 8/10 correct trials), horses were immediately tested with on-screen images of the objects over 10 image trials interspersed with five real object trials. At first image presentation, all but two horses spontaneously responded to the images with the learnt behaviour by contacting one of the two images, but the number of horses touching the correct image was not different from chance (14/27 horses, p > 0.05). Only one horse touched the correct image above chance level across 10 image trials (9/10 correct responses, p = 0.021). Our findings thus question whether horses recognise real-life objects from digital images. We discuss how methodological factors and individual differences (i.e. age, welfare state) might have influenced animals' response to the images, and the importance of validating the suitability of stimuli of this kind for cognitive studies in horses.

AB  - Genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most variable identified in vertebrates. Pathogen-mediated selection is believed to be the main force maintaining MHC diversity. However, relatively few studies have demonstrated contemporary selection on MHC genes. Here, we examine associations between MHC variation and several fitness measurements including total fitness and five fitness components, in 3400 wild Soay sheep (Ovis aries) monitored between 1989 and 2012. In terms of total fitness, measured as lifetime breeding success of all individuals born, we found haplotypes named C and D were associated with decreased and increased male total fitness respectively. In terms of fitness components, juvenile survival was associated with haplotype divergence while individual haplotypes (C, D and F) were associated with adult fitness components. Consistent with the increased male total fitness, the rarest haplotype D has increased in frequency throughout the study period more than expected under neutral expectations. Our results demonstrate contemporary natural selection is acting on MHC class II genes in Soay sheep and the mode of selection on specific fitness components can be different mode from selection on total fitness.

AB  - Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) is a worldwide quarantine pest that has a wide range of host plants. Quercetin is a secondary metabolite involved in chemical defense processes in plants. To understand how H. cunea adapt to quercetin in its host plants, we determined the effects of quercetin on larval mortality, growth, nutritional indices, and the activity or content of detoxification enzymes in H. cunea larvae by feeding them an artificial diet containing different concentrations of quercetin. Our results showed that 0.50% quercetin treatment significantly prolonged the development duration of H. cunea larvae and inhibited growth of H. cunea. Nutritional indices analysis indicated that quercetin significantly affected nutrient use, including effects on the approximate digestibility, consumption index, relative growth rate, and efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance. Furthermore, our results revealed that quercetin reduced the content of carboxylesterases, and increased the activity or content of glutathione S-transferases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and ATP-binding cassette transporters in H. cunea larvae. These results provide a foundation for revealing the adaptation that H. cunea use to adapt to quercetin in host plants.

AB  - Plants have evolved elegant defense strategies against biotic and abiotic stresses by principally using the secondary metabolites alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids; phenolics, etc. Secondary metabolites (e.g. alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolics) play roles in constitutive defenses (e.g., tomatine) and induced responses (e. g., phytoalexins), that enable plants effective defense against pathogens and herbivores. This review integrates current information on biosynthesis and ecological roles of secondary metabolites ranging from biotrophic, and hemi-biotrophic to necrotrophic pathogens in the activation of such a metabolic diversity. This present discussion is about the regulation of response via their key signaling molecules, namely jasmonic acid and salicylic acid, and their function from both sides of defense trade-offs. Overview of recent advances in genetic engineering and metabolic engineering approaches for engineering the production of metabolites to replace synthetic agrochemicals sustainably. This review emphasizes the role of secondary metabolites in integrated pest management and sustainable agriculture, despite their potential pharmaceutical applications. In the future, research should address the molecular base of secondary metabolism and open ways for biotechnological tools to develop climate-resilient crops. This review integrates basic concepts of plant defense with an applied biotechnology theme to provide lessons learned on the use of secondary metabolites to promote sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are intracellular carriers of bioactive lipids and play a role in the trafficking of endocannabinoids as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids. Mice lacking the FABP5 gene have memory impairments. Environmental enrichment is a potent manipulation known to rescue or improve memory performance. The extent to which the memory impairments in FABP5 knockout (KO) mice can be rescued or improved through environmental conditions remains to be understood. To address this, we raised wild type (WT) and FABP5 KO mice in either socially isolated or environmental enrichment conditions during adolescence. Once in adulthood, mice were tested for Novel Object Recognition (NOR), T-maze, and Morris Water Maze (MWM) to evaluate memory performance. Mice were then euthanized to assess hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations. MWM results showed that male FABP5 KO mice performed worse compared to WT counterparts. Male and female mice raised in an enriched environment improved performance regardless of genotype. Results on the NOR test showed that male FABP5 KO mice displayed lower object recognition compared to WT counterparts across both environments. No differences of genotype or environment were seen in female mice. T-maze findings revealed impaired performance in socially isolated FABP5 KO mice. Adolescent environmental enrichment rescued this deficit in male, but not female, FABP5 KO mice. Lastly, environmental enrichment increased hippocampal BDNF levels in male WT mice only. Our results corroborate the previously observed role of the FABP5 gene on memory performance and identify an important interaction with the environment during adolescence.

AB  - Host plant shifts are central to diversification in insect herbivores. Many mechanisms can cause host shifts in insects, but one relatively unexplored mechanism is whole-genome duplication (WGD) in the host plant. WGD, or polyploidy, is common in plants and causes spontaneous changes in physiology, morphology, and palatability that could impact the ability of herbivores to feed and develop on newly formed polyploids (neopolyploids). Here the authors tested if WGD affected the preference and performance of the specialist aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (pea aphids). Pea aphids seasonally form specialised lineages or 'host forms' on many host plant species including alfalfa and red clover. Aphid host forms on alfalfa and red clover naturally exist on different cytotypes of their respective hosts, with red clover aphids feeding on diploid clover and alfalfa aphids feeding on tetraploid alfalfa. Therefore, the authors predicted that these host forms would have a higher preference for and performance on their respective natal host cytotype. Neither host form exhibited a preference for a particular cytotype, but there were modest changes in aphid performance based on host cytotype. Specifically, aphids specialised to red clover had higher fecundity on diploid red clover than on neotetraploid red clover. Together, these results showed that both host forms were able to recognise and accept different cytotypes of the two host species, but only one host form experienced trade-offs in performance when feeding on neotetraploids. These results suggest that WGD may act as a mechanism of host expansion in pea aphids as plants speciate via WGD.

AB  - The present study aimed to assess the efficiency of zeolite in mitigating the nitrogen (N) losses through ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from pig slurry (PS) applied to Italian ryegrass (IRG)-maize fields under a crop rotation system and the consequent effect on nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for forage production. PS was applied at rates of 150 and 200 kg N ha -1 for the IRG and maize growing seasons, respectively, with or without zeolite. Soil mineral N content and NH3 and N2O emissions were measured periodically throughout the year-round cultivation of IRG and maize. Forage yield and nutritional composition were also analyzed at the harvest time of each crop. The PS with/without zeolite application effects were interpreted by comparison with those obtained for the negative control (no -N fertilization). Soil ammonium (NH4+) content in the PS-applied plots sharply increased within the first week, then progressively decreased in both the IRG and maize growing seasons. Soil NH4+ contents in the zeolite-amended plots were higher compared to the treatment without zeolite except for the first 1 or 2 weeks after PS application when soil nitrate (NO3-) contents significantly decreased. The increase in soil NH4+ content as affected by zeolite application was more distinct in the maize growing season than in the IRG growing season. NH3 emission was predominant at the early 2 weeks after PS application. Zeolite application reduced the cumulative emission of NH3 from PS by 16.7% and 24.4% and that of N2O by 15.6% and 31.5% in the IRG growing and maize growing seasons, respectively. NUE for dry matter (DM) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) production significantly improved in annual yield basis of the IRG-maize cropping. Zeolite application in PS-applied field may represent effective management in mitigating N losses through odorous NH3 and greenhouse gas (N2O) emissions, thereby improving NUE forage production.

AB  - Leaf-cutting ants manage their waste continuously to avoid risks of colony contamination. The presence of residues or their odor near foraging areas is enough for ants to stop attacking plant tissues. However, to date, no study has demonstrated an interspecific effect of nest waste on the deterrence of leaf-cutting ants. Here, we tested whether a hydroalcoholic extract of nest refuse (NR) of the leaf-cutting ants Acromyrmex balzani Emery, 1890 and Atta opaciceps Borgmeier (Hymenoptera: Formicidae, Attini) causes an interspecific deterrent effect. Field colonies of Ac. balzani (n = 30) and A. opaciceps (n = 36) were used. For each colony, we offered baits made with plastic straws covered by citrus pulp and sprayed with a hydroalcoholic solution of 20% (vol/vol) alcohol/water (Control) or an extract of 20% (vol/vol) of NR from Ac. balzani and/or A. opaciceps. Over 20-30 minutes we recorded the amount of baits removed and data were compared through survival analysis and Linear Mixed Effect (LME) model. Ants avoided collecting baits sprayed with NR resulting in less than 20% of these baits being carried to the nest versus 80% of control baits. The deterrence was both intra and interspecific, considering that the response was similar for baits from both species. Such results reinforce the premise that the presence of nest refuse alters the foraging behavior of ants and paves the way for new studies that can verify its effectiveness in reducing foliar consumption on a larger spatial scale.

AB  - This study investigates the volatile organic compound (VOC) diversity of Anthemis cotula L., an European native species that has adapted to grow as both summer and winter annual in the Kashmir Himalaya, and explores whether differences in VOC profiles between these growth forms could shed light on their potential role in the plant's invasiveness and prolific spread in the region. This study identifies 167 VOCs, with winter annuals exhibiting significantly greater VOC diversity (143) compared to summer annuals (88), as also confirmed by significantly higher Shannon and Simpson diversity indices in winter annuals (p < 0.0001). Winter annuals produced 79 unique VOCs, while summer annuals had 24, with plants of both growth cycles sharing 64 compounds. Terpenes, particularly sesquiterpenes, and monoterpenes, dominated in both growth cycles, but winter annuals showed higher diversity, including a higher abundance of esters (34 vs. 21). VOC profiles also varied by plant part: flowers were rich in esters, while roots and leaves had more terpenes. Elevation had a moderate impact on VOC composition, with the greatest variability observed at higher elevations (2350 masl). Functional Hill diversity was significantly higher in winter annuals (p < 0.0001), suggesting a broader biosynthetic diversity. Redundancy analysis revealed that VOC distribution in plant parts was influenced by environmental variables, with altitude showing a stronger correlation in roots. Molecular network analysis showed VOC segregation in distinct clusters, highlighting the biosynthetic pathway complexity and intricate relationships between chemical compounds of different organs in both growth forms. These findings provide critical insights into the potential role of VOC diversity in the invasiveness of A. cotula, particularly its winter annuals in the Kashmir Himalayan region with potential implications for its management.

AB  - The study of the BMPRIB gene polymorphisms has become of great importance in sheep, because it provides critical genetic tools to improve reproductive efficiency in ewes. The purposes of this study were: to assess the genetic diversity of the 90-bp deletion polymorphism within the BMPRIB gene in 52 various sheep breeds; to examine its linkage to the p.Q249R variant in the same gene, as well as to analyze its association with litter size. Herein, a total of 2313 various sheep individuals were used to detect the presence of the 90-bp deletion, among them the six breeds (Australian White (AUW), SmallTail Han (STH), Guiqian semi-fine wool (GQSFW) sheep, etc.) were genotyped using PCR-based genotyping technology (n = 1636), and 47 breeds worldwide (including STH sheep) were genotyped via whole genome sequencing (WGS) method (n = 677). Genotyping outcomes revealed that the polymorphism was segregated in 45 of 52 breeds with varying frequencies (0.05-0.93). It is pertinent to note that the 90-bp deletion is not linked to the famous p.Q249R SNP in population of interest, except in high prolific Hu sheep. The association analysis indicated that the Del-90-bp variant showed no significant association (P > 0.05) with litter size in AUW (n = 625), GQSFW (n = 75) and STH (n = 38) ewes. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed on the importance of the Del-90-bp variant as a DNA marker that could possibly serve as an additional selection criterion in breeding ewes with high productivity.

AB  - Pregnancy success is closely related to the molecular mechanisms that control energy metabolism balance. However, the mechanisms have not been fully understood. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) plays a physiological role by regulating energy metabolism in numerous tissues. In this study, we determined the expression and hormone regulation of UCP2 in goat uterus. UCP2 is expressed in the luminal and glandular epithelia of goat uterus during early pregnancy, as revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry conducted on pregnant goats. The signals were detected from day 0 (D0) to D30 of pregnancy, though weak on D16 (the adhesion period). The low levels of UCP2 on D16 were confirmed by RT-qPCR and western blot. In goat uterus and endometrial epithelial cells (EECs), UCP2 was up-regulated by progesterone and estrogen. In addition, after goat EECs were treated with genipin (an inhibitor of UCP2), not only UCP2 expression but also cell proliferation was inhibited. Collectively, UCP2 is dynamically expressed in goat uterus and can affect EEC proliferation, suggesting that it may participate in regulating the energy metabolism balance of goat uterus during early pregnancy.

AB  - Horse flies are known as vectors of various species of trypanosomatids. The aim of this study was to investigate Trypanosoma in the Tabanidae family collected in different localities in Lithuania. Our objectives were to examine the genetic diversity of Trypanosoma sp. detected in tabanids, assessing the relationships between parasite lineages and tabanid species. The present study reports on the molecular detection and genetic diversity of trypanosomes in 10 species of tabanids, with two of them being reported for the first time. The findings suggest that different strains of the T. theileri complex are not related to different tabanid species. Trypanosomatids from the Tabanidae family have not been studied in Lithuania in any detail. In this study, a nested PCR amplifying the DNA fragment coding the SSU rRNA was used to determine the Trypanosoma spp. prevalence and diversity in the Tabanidae family collected in Lithuania in 2018-2019. In total, 101 Tabanidae individuals were investigated from six areas in Lithuania, and 14 different species were identified. The overall positivity of Trypanosoma spp. DNA in tabanids was 50.5% (51/101). Tabanus maculicornis was the most abundant species and yielded the highest prevalence of trypanosomatids (84.62%, 22/26), while Hybomitra nitidifrons showed a high prevalence as well, reaching 77.8% (14/18). In flies of some species (Hybomitra lapponica and Hybomitra lurida), Trypanosoma was detected for the first time. Nine different haplotypes were detected as being distributed in different tabanid species. Analysis showed that most sequences obtained during our study were identical or extremely close to two major T. theileri subclades: TthI and TthII. Our data analysis suggests the presence of different Trypanosoma genotypes in the same tabanid species, meaning that different lineages of Trypanosoma could be more related to the vertebrate host and not the fly species. This is the first study of trypanosomatid parasites in tabanids from Lithuania, and our results are valuable in providing data on the diversity of these parasites in different Tabanidae species.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants consist of a broad range of gasses which serve purposes such as protecting against herbivores, communicating with insects and neighboring plants, or increasing the tolerance to environmental stresses. Evidence is accumulating that the composition of VOC blends plays an important role in fulfilling these purposes. Constitutional emissions give insight into species-specific stress tolerance potentials and are an important first step in linking metabolism and function of co-occurring VOCs. Here, we investigate the blend composition and interrelations among co-emitted VOCs in unstressed seedlings of four broad-leaved tree species, Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica, Betula pendula, and Carpinus betulus. VOCs of Q. robur and F. sylvatica mainly emitted isoprene and monoterpenes, respectively. B. pendula had relatively high sesquiterpene emission; however, it made up only 1.7% of its total emissions while the VOC spectrum was dominated by methanol (similar to 72%). C. betulus was emitting methanol and monoterpenes in similar amounts compared to other species, casting doubt on its frequent classification as a close-to-zero VOC emitter. Beside these major VOCs, a total of 22 VOCs could be identified, with emission rates and blend compositions varying drastically between species. A principal component analysis among species revealed co-release of multiple compounds. In particular, new links between pathways and catabolites were indicated, e.g., correlated emission rates of methanol, sesquiterpenes (mevalonate pathway), and green leaf volatiles (hexanal, hexenyl acetate, and hexenal; lipoxygenase pathway). Furthermore, acetone emissions correlated with eugenol from the Shikimate pathway, a relationship that has not been described before. Our results thus indicate that certain VOC emissions are highly interrelated, pointing toward the importance to improve our understanding of VOC blends rather than targeting dominant VOCs only.</p>

AB  - Solanum is one of the world's largest and economically most important plant genera, including 1245 currently accepted species and several major and minor crops (e.g., tomato, potato, brinjal eggplant, scarlet eggplant, Gboma eggplant, lulo, and pepino). Here we provide an overview of the evolution of 25 key morphological traits for the major and minor clades of this giant genus based on stochastic mapping using a well-sampled recently published phylogeny of Solanum. The most evolutionarily labile traits (showing >100 transitions across the genus) relate to plant structure (growth form and sympodial unit structure), herbivore defence (glandular trichomes), pollination (corolla shape and colour), and dispersal (fruit colour). Ten further traits show evolutionary lability with 50-100 transitions across the genus (e.g., specialised underground organs, trichome structure, leaf type, inflorescence position and branching, stamen heteromorphism). Our results reveal a number of highly convergent traits in Solanum, including tubers, rhizomes, simple leaves, yellow corollas, heteromorphic anthers, dioecy, and dry fruits, and some unexpected pathways of trait evolution that could be explored in future studies. We show that informally named clades of Solanum can be morphologically defined by trait combinations providing a tool for identification and enabling predictive phylogenetic placement of unsampled species.

AB  - Animals often consume resources from multiple energy channels, thereby connecting food webs and driving trophic structure. Such 'multichannel feeding' can dictate ecosystem function and stability, but tools to quantify this process are lacking. Stable isotope 'fingerprints' are unique patterns in essential amino acid (EAA) delta C-13 values that vary consistently between energy channels like primary production and detritus, and they have emerged as a tool to trace energy flow in wild systems. Because animals cannot synthesize EAAs de novo and must acquire them from dietary proteins, ecologists often assume delta C-13 fingerprints travel through food webs unaltered. Numerous studies have used this approach to quantify energy flow and multichannel feeding in animals, but delta C-13 fingerprinting has never been experimentally tested in a vertebrate consumer. We tested the efficacy of delta C-13 fingerprinting using captive deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus raised on diets containing bacterial, fungal and plant protein, as well as a combination of all three sources. We measured the transfer of delta C-13 fingerprints from diet to consumer liver, muscle and bone collagen, and we used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and isotopic mixing models to estimate dietary proportions compared to known contributions. Lastly, we tested the use of published delta C-13 source fingerprints previously used to estimate energy flow and multichannel feeding by consumers. We found that EAA delta C-13 values exhibit significant isotopic (i.e. trophic) fractionation between consumer tissues and diets. Nevertheless, LDA revealed that delta C-13 fingerprints are consistently routed and assimilated into consumer tissues, regardless of isotopic incorporation rate. Isotopic mixing models accurately estimated the proportional diets of consumers, but all models overestimated plant-based protein contributions, likely due to the digestive efficiencies of protein sources. Lastly, we found that delta C-13 source fingerprints from published literature can lead to erroneous diet reconstruction. We show that delta C-13 fingerprints accurately measure energy flow to vertebrate consumers across tissues with different isotopic incorporation rates, thereby enabling the estimation of multichannel feeding at various temporal scales. Our findings illustrate the power of delta C-13 fingerprinting for quantifying food web dynamics, but also reveal that careful selection of dietary source data is critical to the accuracy of this emerging technique.

AB  - Paternal programming is the concept that the environmental signals from the sire's experiences leading up to mating can alter semen and ultimately affect the phenotype of resulting offspring. Potential mechanisms carrying the paternal effects to offspring can be associated with epigenetic signatures (DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNAs), oxidative stress, cytokines, and the seminal microbiome. Several opportunities exist for sperm/semen to be influenced during development; these opportunities are within the testicle, the epididymis, or accessory sex glands. Epigenetic signatures of sperm can be impacted during the pre-natal and pre-pubertal periods, during sexual maturity and with advancing sire age. Sperm are susceptible to alterations as dictated by their developmental stage at the time of the perturbation, and sperm and seminal plasma likely have both dependent and independent effects on offspring. Research using rodent models has revealed that many factors including over/under nutrition, dietary fat, protein, and ingredient composition (e.g., macro-or micronutrients), stress, exercise, and exposure to drugs, alcohol, and endocrine disruptors all elicit paternal programming responses that are evident in offspring phenotype. Research using livestock species has also revealed that sire age, fertility level, plane of nutrition, and heat stress can induce alterations in the epigenetic, oxidative stress, cytokine, and microbiome profiles of sperm and/or seminal plasma. In addition, recent findings in pigs, sheep, and cattle have indicated programming effects in blastocysts post-fertilization with some continuing into post-natal life of the offspring. Our research group is focused on understanding the effects of common management scenarios of plane of nutrition and growth rates in bulls and rams on mechanisms resulting in paternal programming and subsequent offspring outcomes. Understanding the implication of paternal programming is imperative as short-term feeding and management decisions have the potential to impact productivity and profitability of our herds for generations to come.

AB  - Indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants covers various aspects, including ethnobotany. Ethnobotany means human knowledge of botany and the ecology of plants. In this study, an ethnobotanical and phytochemical evaluation of Withania coagulans (Stocks) Dunal was performed in Khash city in Sistan and Baluchestan province. The data collection was performed through a structured questionnaire (150 questionnaires). The data was analyzed using RFC (Relative Frequency of Citation) and CI (Cultural Importance Index). The questions were related to the plant organ used, plant harvest time, type of livestock user and growth place. To investigate which chemical compounds in the plant cause people to use this drug in the treatment of certain diseases, the chemical compounds of the species were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Results showed that the best season of plant collecting was spring. The most used part of the plant was seeds. The plant grows mainly in plains. Camel (51.40%) and sheep (42.05%) have the maximum use of the plant. The maximum chemical compositions were related to the Ar-tumerone terpene and Pentadecanone with 95.5% and 93.8% probability, respectively. Also, the percentage of saturated fatty acids such as Palmitic acid, Tetradecanoic acid and unsaturated fatty acids such as Oleic acid has the highest percentage. In total, indigenous people use this plant in treating diabetes due to the presence of a compound such as Ar-tumerone, which is consistent with the chemical compounds identified in this study. The importance of plant seeds in cheese making by indigenous peoples is related to acidic compounds such as Palmitic acid, Linoleic acid and Oleic acid.

AB  - Prior damage can alter a plant's susceptibility to future herbivory and yield potential, which is mediated, in part, by the plant's ability to regrow and changes in nutritional content. In perennial sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), herbivory by lepidopteran stem borers early in a growing season can increase the probability of conspecific herbivory later in the crop year. However, it is unknown whether the effects of prior borer damage either to vegetatively propagated seed cane or to standing plants can impact conspecific herbivory or crop yield in subsequent crop years. Using a long-term dataset and two field studies, we investigated the impacts of prior sugarcane borer (SCB; Diatraea saccharalis [F.]; Lepidoptera: Crambidae) damage on levels of conspecific damage across crop years. We also evaluated long-term impacts of SCB damage on plant quantity and quality, aspects that may alter future herbivory and yield. We found that prior SCB damage to either seed cane or standing crops did not alter conspecific damage in subsequent crop years. This prior SCB damage also did not impact plant quality (fiber, sucrose, and carbon content). However, foliar nitrogen was lower in plots without SCB damage in the first year but damaged in the second crop year. Metrics of plant quantity (tiller emergence and aboveground biomass) and total sugar yield were not impacted by prior years' SCB damage. Taken together, our data indicate that although SCB herbivory can significantly increase conspecific herbivory and impact sugarcane plants within a crop year, these effects were not sustained post-harvest following regrowth of aboveground biomass.

AB  - Estrogenic effects on astrocytes improve glutamate recycling and water homeostasis for neuroprotection in pathology. Estrogens also enhance spatial learning and memory. The current study looked at the effect of 17 beta estradiol (E2) on astrocytic glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) and dorsal hippocampus (dHC), areas active in spatial (allocentric) working memory in comparison to dorsolateral striatum (dlStr) which is involved in response or egocentric learning. Ovariectomized, female, Long Evans rats received 0, 4.5 mu g/kg, or 45 mu g/kg of E2 in a sesame oil vehicle 24 and 48 h prior to a delayed spontaneous alternation task (dSA). In line with previous research dSA performance significantly improved with administration of E2 as compared to sesame oil vehicle. AQP4 and GLT-1 levels were brain area specific and E2 enhanced AQP4 and GLT-1 in brain areas associated with spatial working memory (PrL and dHC) as compared to dlStr. Additionally, AQP4 was found to have the highest density in the unmyelinated axon rich hilus while GLT-1 showed the highest density in the synaptically dense molecular layer. However, AQP4 density in the stratum radiatum was similar to the hilus after dSA, potentially supporting dynamic changes in AQP4 response to natural cognitive activity. Hilar and prelimbic AQP4 area stained was also negatively correlated with performance on the dSA, which supports the theory of increased polarity of AQP4 with healthy cognitive function. These data suggest astrocytic water and glutamate homeostasis shift with high levels of estrogens to support spatial strategies.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of fasted live-weight gain during the cashmere non-growing period on cashmere production performance and secondary hair follicle activity, to provide a theoretical basis for appropriate supplementary feeding of cashmere goats. Fifty Inner Mongolian cashmere goats aged 2-4 years old were randomly selected and weighed in May and September 2019, respectively. Based on fasted live-weight gain between the two weights, the experimental ewe goats were divided into two groups: 0-5.0 kg group (n = 30) and 5.0-10.0 kg group (n = 20). Skin samples and cashmere samples were collected. Results of a Pearson correlation analysis showed that fasted live-weight gain during the cashmere non-growing period had a moderate and strong positive correlation with cashmere yield (p = 0.021) and cashmere staple length (p = 0.002), respectively, but did not correlate with cashmere diameter (p = 0.254). Compared with cashmere goats with a fasted live-weight gain of 0-5.0 kg, cashmere goats with a fasted live-weight gain of 5.0-10.0 kg had a 17.10% increase in cashmere yield (p = 0.037) and an 8.09% increase in cashmere staple length (p = 0.045), but had no significant difference in cashmere diameter (p = 0.324). Results of a Pearson correlation analysis showed that there was a strong positive correlation between fasted live-weight gain and the population of active secondary hair follicles in the skin of cashmere goats (p < 0.01). Compared with cashmere goats with a fasted live-weight gain of 0-5.0 kg, cashmere goats with a fasted live-weight gain of 5.0-10.0 kg had an increase in the population of active secondary hair follicles (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the fasted live-weight gain during the cashmere non-growing period had a significant effect on secondary hair follicle activity and cashmere production performance in cashmere goats. Since fasted live-weight gain reflects nutritional level to a certain extent, this study suggests that nutritional manipulations such as supplementary feeding during cashmere non-growing periods can increase cashmere production performance. However, specific nutritional manipulations during the cashmere non-growing period need further research to increase cashmere production performance.

AB  - Simple Summary Conflicts with wolves arise because wolves kill farm animals, especially sheep, or approach humans. It is expected that young wolves learn from their parent pack (PP) what their prey is and if it is safe to be near humans. To confirm this, we researched whether the behavior of young migrating wolves (loners), after they leave the pack, resembles PP behavior. Fourteen loners entering the Netherlands between 2015 and 2019 could be identified and genetically linked to their PPs. Loner and PP behavior was similar in 10 out of 14 cases. Like their PPs, some young wolves killed sheep and were near humans, others killed sheep and did not approach humans, while two loners were unproblematic, they did not kill sheep nor were they in proximity to humans. Thus, the PP behavior did predict loner's behavior and conflicts may be similar between young wolves and their PPs. However, conflicts need not arise. To achieve that, new prevention methods are proposed to teach wolves in the PP not to approach sheep and humans. As a result, new generations may not be problematic when leaving the PP. Transmission of experience about prey and habitat supports the survival of next generation of wolves. Thus, the parent pack (PP) can affect whether young migrating wolves (loners) kill farm animals or choose to be in human environments, which generates human-wolf conflicts. Therefore, we researched whether the behavior of loners resembles PP behavior. After being extinct, 22 loners had entered the Netherlands between 2015 and 2019. Among them, 14 could be DNA-identified and linked with their PPs in Germany. Some loners were siblings. We assessed the behavior of each individual and PP through a structured Google search. PP behavior was determined for the loner's rearing period. Similarity between loner and PP behavior was significant (p = 0.022) and applied to 10 of 14 cases: like their PPs, three loners killed sheep and were near humans, five killed sheep and did not approach humans, while two loners were unproblematic, they did not kill sheep, nor were they near humans. Siblings behaved similarly. Thus, sheep killing and proximity to humans may develop during early-life experiences in the PP. However, by negative reinforcement that can be prevented.

AB  - Simple Summary Many studies on parturition detection have been conducted on large ruminants, but only a few have been conducted on small ruminants. The parturition detection system for Korean native black goats developed in this study may detect labor pains in goats and assist in the timely initiation of kid nursing to reduce stunted growth and mortality. However, applying this system to other Korean Native Black Goats or other breeds of goats will require further research due to different breed characteristics and specification conditions.Abstract Korean Native Black Goats deliver mainly during the cold season. However, in winter, there is a high risk of stunted growth and mortality for their newborns. Therefore, we conducted this study to develop a KNBG parturition detection system that detects and provides managers with early notification of the signs of parturition. The KNBG parturition detection system consists of triaxial accelerometers, gateways, a server, and parturition detection alarm terminals. Then, two different data, the labor and non-labor data, were acquired and a Decision Tree algorithm was used to classify them. After classifying the labor and non-labor states, the sum of the labor status data was multiplied by the activity count value to enhance the classification accuracy. Finally, the Labor Pain Index (LPI) was derived. Based on the LPI, the optimal processing time window was determined to be 10 min, and the threshold value for labor classification was determined to be 14 240.92. The parturition detection rate was 82.4%, with 14 out of 17 parturitions successfully detected, and the average parturition detection time was 90.6 min before the actual parturition time of the first kid. The KNBG parturition detection system is expected to reduce the risk of stunted growth and mortality due to hypothermia in KNBG kids by detecting parturition 90.6 min before the parturition of the first kid, with a success rate of 82.4%, enabling parturition nursing.

AB  - Bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates in the hindgut has considerable potential for the stimulation or inhibition of the growth of distinct bacteria within microbiota. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether high levels of rye affect porcine gut microbiota composition with subsequent effects on the load of Salmonella Typhimurium, an intestinal pathogen with zoonotic relevance. Therefore, forty-two 25-day-old piglets were allocated to two groups and fed a diet containing either 69% wheat or 69% rye for 35 days. One week after introducing the two different diets, the piglets were experimentally infected with Salmonella Typhimurium. The microbiota composition of cecal and fecal samples of the piglets were evaluated 28 days after infection. In the cecum, promoted growth of Bifidobacterium, several lactic acid bacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were seen in pigs fed the diet containing 69% rye. Bacterial species belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium and Catenisphaera were associated with differing bacterial counts of Salmonella Typhimurium detected in the cecal contents of all piglets in both feeding groups via cultural cultivation. The high intake of rye instead of wheat seems to promote the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria accompanied by impaired growth conditions for the foodborne pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium.

AB  - Although all hystricomorph rodents have the colonic furrow or groove that is the anatomical prerequisite for a 'mucous trap' colonic separation mechanism linked to coprophagy or cecotrophy, the taxon that gives this group its name, the porcupines, have been claimed to not practice coprophagy. Absence of coprophagy has repeatedly been claimed for hystricomorph species in which it was later confirmed. Here, we report the observation of a characteristic posture-sitting on one hindleg, with the other hindleg lifted and the snout covering the anogenital region-that is the typical posture during coprophagy in other large hystricomorph rodents, in two zoo-managed Indian crested porcupines (Hystrix indica). Together with other circumstantial evidence, these observations are suggestive of coprophagy in porcupines, and support claims that it may be wise to assume all hystricomorph rodents can use this strategy.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) originating from high-intensity pig farms has caused a global air pollution problem. In this study, a deodorizing spray net device (DSND) is designed, which is inexpensive and achieves a good deodorizing effect. The DSND comprises a steel frame, three spray layers, two 12-needle nylon mesh layers and a backflow device. The device exerts the least impact on the wind speed at a given pig farm when installed at a distance of 2.5 m from blower fans. The device reaches an NH3 reduction rate of 73 %. To further reduce operating costs, microbial liquid is collected and sprayed in cycles according to the peak pig farm NH3 emissions. After two microbial liquid recycling steps, the NH3 reduction rate still reaches 71 %. The construction cost of the device is $3200, and the annual operation cost reaches $2600. Through microbial diversity determination and redundancy analysis (RDA), we find that the reasons for the higher NH3 reduction rate of the device may include the higher dust removal rate and both the higher denitrifying bacterial abundance and lower pH and electrical conductivity (EC) values of the sprayed microbial liquid. The device provides a practical solution to resolve the NH3 problem in mechanically ventilated livestock housing system.

AB  - Vigilance allows animals to quickly detect threats from conspecifics and predators to avoid or minimize costly encounters. Time spent vigilant is usually traded-off against other fitness-enhancing activities, such that fitness returns are expected when allocation to vigilance increases. We assessed the proximate factors influencing vigilance and investigated whether vigilance correlates with fitness in wild mountain goats. We first studied which extrinsic and intrinsic factors influenced alert duration and frequency using focal observations recorded over 12 years on individually-marked adult females. We found that females increased vigilance in forested areas compared with open areas and were less vigilant when they were surrounded by conspecific neighbours. Reproductive females were more frequently vigilant and for longer periods compared with females without offspring. Mothers also tended to perform longer alerts when their offspring was > 10 m away than at shorter distances, suggesting that variation in offspring's vulnerability to predation influences mother's vigilance. Thus, predation risk and offspring vulnerability were the main mechanisms driving variation in vigilance. To assess fitness returns, we then used a joint modelling framework to estimate the latent correlations at the individual level among vigilance traits (alert duration, alert frequency, and total time spent vigilant) and fitness components (adult female survival and offspring survival) while accounting for the drivers observed to influence vigilance. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence that vigilance is associated with fitness returns, with only some traits being at best weakly positively correlated with survival of offspring and adult females. This might arise because vigilance incurs costs that outweighs its potential benefits, or because vigilance metrics are not repeatable due to their high plasticity, challenging the commonly assumed positive relationship between vigilance and fitness.

AB  - Vitamin C (vitC) deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease; while several putative mechanistic links have been proposed, functional evidence supporting a causal relationship is scarce. In this study, we investigated how vitC deficiency affects coronary artery vasomotor function and the development of coronary atherosclerotic plaques in guinea pigs subjected to chronic dyslipidemia by a high-fat diet regime. Female Hartley guinea pigs were fed either a control (low-fat diet and sufficient vitC) (N = 8) or a high-fat diet with either sufficient (N = 8) or deficient (N = 10) vitC for 32 weeks. Guinea pigs subjected to the high-fat diet developed significant atherosclerotic plaques in their coronary arteries, with no quantitative effect of vitC deficiency. In isolated coronary arteries, vasomotor responses to potassium, carbachol, nitric oxide, or bradykinin were studied in a wire myograph. Carbachol, bradykinin, and nitric oxide mediated relaxation in the coronary arteries of the control group. While vasorelaxation to carbachol and nitric oxide was preserved in the two high-fat diet groups, bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation was abolished. Interestingly, bradykinin induced a significant contraction in coronary arteries from vitC-deficient guinea pigs (p < 0.05). The bradykinin-induced contraction was unaffected by L-NAME but significantly inhibited by both indomethacin and vitC, suggesting that, during vitC deficiency, increased release of arachidonic acid metabolites and vascular oxidative stress are involved in the constrictor effects mediated by bradykinin. In conclusion, the present study shows supporting evidence that poor vitC status negatively affects coronary artery function.

AB  - Relatively little effort has been directed towards elucidating the role of physiological stress pathways in mediating avian responses to global heating. For free-ranging southern pied babblers, Turdoides bicolor, daily maximum air temperatures (T-max) between similar to 35 and similar to 40 degrees C result in reduced foraging efficiency, loss of body mass and compromised breeding success. We tested the hypothesis that very hot days are experienced as stressors by quantifying relationships between T-max and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels in naturally excreted droppings. On days when T-max<38 degrees C, fGCM levels were independent of T-max (mean +/- s.d. 140.25 +/- 56.92 ng g(-1) dry mass). At T-max>38 degrees C, however, fGCM levels increased linearly with T-max and averaged 190.79 +/- 70.13 ng g(-1) dry mass. The effects of T-max on fGCM levels did not carry over to the following morning, suggesting that very hot days are experienced as acute stressors.

AB  - Introduction: Parasitic plants can damage crop plants and consequently cause yield losses and thus threaten food security. Resource availability (e.g., phosphorus, water) has an important role in the response of crop plants to biotic attacks. However, how the growth of crop plants under parasitism are affected by environmental resource fluctuation is poorly understood.
   Methods: We conducted a pot experiment to test the effects of the intensity of Cuscuta australis parasitism and the availability of water and phosphorus (P) on soybean shoot and root biomass.
   Results and discussion: We found that low-intensity parasitism caused similar to 6% biomass reduction, while high-intensity parasitism caused similar to 26% biomass reduction in soybean. Under 5-15% water holding capacity (WHC), the deleterious effect of parasitism on soybean hosts was similar to 60% and similar to 115% higher than that under 45-55% WHC and 85-95% WHC, respectively. When the P supply was 0 mu M, the deleterious effect of parasitism on soybean was 67% lower than that when the P supply was 20 mu M. Besides, the biomass of C. australis was highest when both the water and the P availability were lowest. Cuscuta australis caused the highest damage to soybean hosts under 5 mu M P supply, 5-15% WHC, and high-intensity parasitism. Additionally, C. australis biomass was significantly and negatively related to the deleterious effect of parasitism on soybean hosts and to the total biomass of soybean hosts under high-intensity parasitism, but not under low-intensity parasitism. Although high resource availability can promote soybean growth, the two resources have different impacts on the response of hosts to parasitism. Higher P availability decreased host tolerance to parasites, while higher water availability increased host tolerance. These results indicate that crop management, specifically water and phosphorus supply, can efficiently control C. australis in soybean. To our best knowledge, this appears to be the first study to test the interactive effect of different resources on the growth and response of host plants under parasitism.

AB  - Introduction: Most youths who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) lose their diagnosis in the first 1-2 years. However, there are few studies on this brain mechanism, and the heterogeneity of the findings is partially due to the different stimuli applied and the mixed trauma history. Therefore, the use of trauma-related/unrelated stimuli to study the remittance mechanism of earthquake-induced PTSD could advance our knowledge of PTSD and inspire future treatment.
   Methods: Thirteen youths with PTSD, 18 remitted participants, and 18 control participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while viewing trauma-related pictures, trauma-unrelated negative pictures, and scrambled pictures.
   Results: Under trauma-unrelated condition, the neural activity of the left hippocampus in the remitted group was between the two other groups. Under trauma-related condition, the PTSD and the remitted group exhibited higher neural activity in the right middle occipital gyrus than controls. The remitted group showed higher neural activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus and right lingual gyrus under trauma-related condition than trauma-unrelated condition, while no significant difference was found in PTSD group.
   Conclusion: PTSD status-related group differences are mainly reflected in the left hippocampus under the trauma-unrelated condition, while the hyperactivity in the right middle occipital gyrus under trauma-related condition could be an endophenotype for PTSD.

AB  - The potential spreading of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) into agricultural fields and crops represent a fundamental limitation on the use of organic fertilization in food production systems. We present here a study of the effect of spreading four types of organic soil amendments (raw pig slurry, liquid and solid fractions, and a digested derivative) on demonstrative plots in two consecutive productive cycles of corn harvest (Zea mays), using a mineral fertilizer as a control, following the application of organic amendments at 32-62 T per ha (150 kg total N/ha) and allowing 5-8 months between fertilization and harvest. A combination of qPCR and highthroughput 16S rDNA sequencing methods showed a small, but significant impact of the fertilizers in both ARG loads and microbiomes in soil samples, particularly after the second harvesting cycle. The slurry solid fraction showed the largest impact on both ARG loads and microbiome variation, whereas its digestion derivatives showed a much smaller impact. Soil samples with the highest ARG loads also presented increased levels of tetracyclines, indicating a potential dual hazard by ARG and antibiotic residues linked to some organic amendments. Unlike soils, no accumulation of ARG or antibiotics was observed in corn leaves (used as fodder) or grains, and no grain sample reached detection limits for neither parameter. These results support the use of organic soil amendments in corn crops, while proposing the reduction of the loads of ARGs and antibiotics from the fertilizers to greatly reduce their potential risk.

KW  - TPH genes

AB  - Seasonal breeding is widespread in sheep and significantly affects the development of the housed sheep industry. To improve and balance the reproduction performance of sheep, year-round breeding has the goal of modern sheep farming. The tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which initiates and regulates biosynthesis of melatonin, is an important player in the formation of mammalian year-round breeding. However, little is known about its role in regulation of sheep seasonal breeding. In this study, a missense mutation, T865G in TPH1 gene was detected in 328 individuals of six Mongolian sheep groups. It was positively selected among Mongolian sheep. This mutation may appear between 13,683 and 350,973 years ago and only exist in Hu sheep now. In Hu sheep, the frequency of allele T was 89.66%, and that of allele G was 10.34%. The TPH1 protein structure and property analysis suggested that this mutation from T to G affect the three-dimensional structure and reduce the hydropathicity of catalytic core. When the allele is T, the protein activity is twice that of the allele G, and their difference was significant (p < .05). In conclusion, T865G is an ancient mutation of TPH1 gene and affects the function of TPH protein, which may contribute to the genetic potentiality of Mongolian sheep to year-round breeding.

AB  - Methods for estimating population densities of unmarked species using camera traps are still under development. One such method is called 'random encounter model (REM)' and, to our knowledge, has never been used to estimate densities of mountain-dwelling ungulates. In this study, we tested the REM method to estimate the density of Balkan chamois (Rupicapra r. balcanica) in a Mediterranean habitat, Mt. Biokovo. To meet the assumptions of REM, we systematically placed 25 camera traps throughout the known range of the population (approximately 65 km(2)) at the intersections of 2-km grid cells. Prior to data collection, population density was estimated by visual counts on sample plots in August 2020. Cameras were operational between July 2020 and September 2020 and active throughout the 24-h period. All parameters for REM (i.e. average movement speed, angle and radius) were estimated using exclusively camera trap data. We obtained 279 independent events of chamois from 2503 camera trap days. The density estimate obtained by REM resulted to be 20.65 +/- 5.27 ind. km(-2), slightly higher than the reference value obtained by visual counts: 17.33 +/- 0.98 ind. km(-2). Other parameters required to calculate density were speed (1.62 km center dot day(-1) +/- 0.21), detection radius (5.56 m +/- 0.21) and detection angle (1.16 + 0.05 radians). Therefore, REM has shown comparable results to visual counts and may have potential for estimating density of mountain ungulates, especially in rugged and inaccessible mountainous areas with low detectability where other approaches are inadequate or impossible.

AB  - We develop a machine learning approach to detect and discriminate elephants from other species, and to recognise important behaviours such as running and rumbling, based only on seismic data generated by the animals. We demonstrate our approach using data acquired in the Kenyan savanna, consisting of 8000 h seismic recordings and 250 k camera trap pictures. Our classifiers, different convolutional neural networks trained on seismograms and spectrograms, achieved 80%-90% balanced accuracy in detecting elephants up to 100 m away, and over 90% balanced accuracy in recognising running and rumbling behaviours from the seismic data. We release the dataset used in this study: SeisSavanna represents a unique collection of seismic signals with the associated wildlife species and behaviour. Our results suggest that seismic data offer substantial benefits for monitoring wildlife, and we propose to further develop our methods using dense arrays that could result in a seismic shift for wildlife monitoring.

AB  - Eusocial animals exhibit a sophisticated division of labour. The self-organized colony requires coordination of local interactions at the individual level. Termites are a well-known group exhibiting social organization among castes within a colony, and helper castes have facilitated their ecological and evolutionary success. Termites have soldier castes specialized in defence, but other castes are also known to exhibit defensive behaviour depending on the context. However, it is unclear how variation in the frequencies of defensive behaviour is emerged. Here, we investigate the effects of the presence of nestmates on individual defensive behaviour in the dampwood termite Zootermopsis nevadensis. We experimentally prepared three conditions and observed biting behaviour against the ant Camponotus obscuripes. First, the frequency of biting was significantly higher in soldiers than that in pseudergates (i.e. workers) under isolated conditions. Second, the results showed that the frequencies of biting exhibited by soldiers were much higher than those of pseudergates in the pseudergate-soldier pairs. Finally, we investigated the social conditions in the presence of the same castes, that is, pseudergate-pseudergate and soldier-soldier pairs. The frequencies of biting exhibited by first-biting individuals were significantly higher than those exhibited by second-biting individuals in both paired conditions. Our findings demonstrate that defensive behaviour can be frequently observed in first-biting individuals despite the presence of two individuals of the same caste, suggesting that the variation of defensive behaviour may be increased in the presence of nestmates.

AB  - Reducing chemical fertilizers is critical for maintaining soil health and minimizing environmental damage. Biochar-based organic fertilizers reduce fertilizer inputs, improve soil fertility, increase crop productivity, and reduce environmental risks. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse to assess the potential of biochar-based organic and inorganic fertilizers to improve soil fertility and Okra yield. Seven treatments with three replicates were arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD). Three treatments included biochar-blended formulations (i) biochar mixed with mineral NPK fertilizer (BF), (ii) biochar mixed with vermicompost (BV), and (iii) biochar mixed with goat manure (BM); two treatments included biochar enrichment formulations (iv) biochar enriched with cow urine (BCU) and (v) biochar enriched with mineral NPK fertilizer in aqueous solution (BFW), and the remaining two included control treatments; (vi) control (CK: no biochar and no fertilizers) and (vii) fertilized control (F: only recommended NPK fertilizer and no biochar). Mineral NPK fertilizers in BF, BFW, and F were applied at the recommended rate as urea, di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), and muriate of potash (MOP). Organic fertilizers in BV, BM, and BCU treatments were applied in equal quantities. All biochar-amended treatments showed improved soil chemical properties with higher pH, organic carbon, total N, and available P and K compared to the two non-biochar control plots (CK and F). Biochar blended with goat manure (BM) showed the highest effect on soil fertility and fruit yield. BM (51.8 t ha-1) increased fruit yield by 89% over CK (27.4 t ha-1) and by 88% over F (27 t ha-1). Similarly, cow urine-enriched biochar (BCU) (35 t ha-1) increased fruit yield by 29% and 28% compared to CK and F, respectively. Soil pH, OC, and nutrient availability (total N, available P, and available K) showed a significantly positive relationship with fruit yield. The study suggests that using biochar-based organic fertilizers, such as BCU and BM, could outperform recommended mineral fertilizers (F) and produce higher yields and healthy soils, thereby contributing to mitigating the current food security and environmental concerns of the country.

AB  - Light is perceived by photoreceptors in fungi and further integrated into the stress-activated MAPK HOG pathway, and thereby potentially activates the expression of genes for stress responses. This indicates that the precise control of light conditions can likely improve the conidial yield and stress resistance to guarantee the low cost and long shelf life of Trichoderma-based biocontrol agents and biofertilizers. In this study, effects of wavelengths and intensities of light on conidial yield and stress tolerance to osmotic, oxidative and pH stresses in Trichoderma guizhouense were investigated. We found that 2 mu mol photons/(m(2) x s) of blue light increased the conidial yield more than 1000 folds as compared to dark condition and simultaneously enhanced conidial stress resistance. The enhanced conidial stress resistance is probably due to the upregulated stress-related genes in blue light, which is under the control of the blue light receptor BLR1 and the MAP kinase HOG1.

AB  - To assess the impacts of sulfur (S) and molybdenum (Mo) fertilization on antioxidant capacity of grazing Nanjiang brown goat in copper (Cu)-polluted meadow, and explore the control methods of Cu pollution in natural pasture, fertilizer treatments and grazing experiments were carried out in Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of the Western Sichuan Plateau, Sichuan Province, Southwest China. 24 hm(2) Cu-polluted meadows were fenced and randomly divided into four groups (3 replications/group, 2 hm(2)/replication): (1) control group, no fertilizer; (2) treatment groups, applied 1 kg Mo+40 kg S, 2 kg Mo+80 kg S, and 3 kg Mo+120 kg S per hectare for group I, group II, and group III, respectively. Seventy-two healthy Nanjiang brown goats (1 year old, 30.9 +/- 1.1 kg) were randomly divided into 4 groups (3 replications/group, 6 goats/replication) and assigned to the tested pastures. The grazing experiment lasted for 60 days. The results showed that the contents of N, S, Mn, Zn, and Mo in herbage in fertilized pastures were higher than those in control group (P < 0.01). The contents of Cu and Se in herbage in fertilized pastures were lower than those in control group (P < 0.01). There were no differences among the fertilized pastures (P > 0.05). The contents of Mn, Zn, Mo, and S in serum and liver in the treatment goats were higher than those in control animals (P < 0.01). The contents of Cu and Se in serum and liver in the treatment goats were lower than those in control animals (P < 0.01). There was no difference in Fe and Co contents in herbage, serum, and liver among the four groups (P > 0.05). The levels of Hb, RBC, and PCV in blood in the treatment goats and the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, T-AOC, CAT, and Cp in serum were higher than those in control goats (P < 0.01). The contents of MDA in the treatment goats were lower than those in control animals (P < 0.01). The contents of serum Cu and Mo, and liver Cu in group III were lower than those in group I and group II (P < 0.01). Taken together, the combinations of S and Mo fertilization did not influence the mineral contents in herbage, serum, and liver, but reduced the toxicity of Cu in Cu-polluted grassland and improved antioxidant capacity in grazing Nanjiang brown goat from fertilized pastures.

AB  - Objective Wool is a high-grade raw textile material, and the physical properties of wool are directly related to the quality of the wool. The present study was to search for the genes affecting wool traits and to explore the complex molecular mechanism affecting wool traits. Methods This study selected 3 Suffolk sheep and 3 small-tailed Han sheep and took samples of their back skin tissue using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteome sequencing analysis of genes, proteins, and related signalling pathways that cause differences in wool traits. Results RNA-seq showed that after sequencing, 230 406 674 raw data points and 222 049 370 clean data points were obtained, of which the percentage of Q20 bases was over 99.9%, and the percentage of Q30 bases was over 98%. With a fold change (FC) >= 1.4 or FC <= 0.714 and P<0.05 as the standard, 1 213 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out, among which there were 644 upregulated genes and 569 downregulated genes in Suffolk sheep in comparison with small-tailed Han sheep. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment found that intermediate filament, calcium ion binding, and keratin filament were significantly enriched, indicating that they might be related to wool traits. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment found that the signalling pathway affecting wool traits might be the ECM-receptor interaction. Proteome sequencing showed that with FC >= 1.4 or FC <= 0.714 and P<0.05 as the standard, 99 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were screened out, among which there were 47 upregulated proteins and 52 downregulated proteins in Suffolk sheep in comparison with small-tailed Han sheep. The GO enrichment found that intermediate filament was significantly enriched, indicating that it might be related to wool traits. The KEGG enrichment found that the signalling pathways affecting wool traits might be the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and the ECM-receptor interaction. A combined analysis of RNA-seq and proteome sequencing found that a total of 15 significantly different genes were detected in both RNA-seq and proteome sequencing, of which 13 were positively correlated and 2 were negatively correlated. Intermediate filament was significantly enriched, KRT35, KRT13 and KAP13-1-like genes might be the key candidate genes to affect wool traits. The PPAR signalling pathway was significantly enriched and might be a key candidate pathway to affect wool traits. The FABP4 gene might be a key candidate gene to affect wool traits. Conclusion Among them, KRT35 might affect wool bending and diameter, KRT13 might affect wool differentiation, while KAP13-1-like might affect wool hardness and toughness, FABP4 might affect wool diameter. These results will expand our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms affecting sheep wool traits and provide a basis for subsequent studies.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical emerging pollutants that have attracted considerable attention. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins in cereal crops worldwide, arising severe health hazards to both humans and animals. Even if numerous researches argue in favor of a notorious influence of DON on the gut, the effects of dietary DON exposure on the ARG profile in poultry intestine remain obscure. In this study, two separate feeding experiments using Jing Tint 6 laying hens exposed to 4.5 or 9.0 mg/kg DON were performed to explore the impact of dietary DON exposure on the microbial community structure and the profiles of ARGs in the intestine via 16S rDNA sequencing and metagenomics sequencing, respectively. In addition, growth performance and intestinal barrier function were also determined to assess the feasibility of using DON- contaminated feedstuffs inappropriate for pigs' consumption in laying hens. Chronic ingestion of DON at 9.0 mg/ kg did not alter zootechnical parameters. However, histomorphological impairments were observed in liver and jejunum. Additionally, metagenomic sequencing revealed that dietary DON exposure at 9.0 mg/kg level dramatically changed the gut microbial structure and shifted the ARG profile. The abundance of tetracycline ARG subtype in the layer cecum was decreased, whereas the abundance of vancomycin ARG subtype was increased upon DON exposure. Co-occurrence network analysis identified that Prevotella was the major ARG host in the intestine of laying hens. In summary, our findings demonstrated that DON-contaminated feedstuffs inappropriate for pigs' consumption should be prudently used in hen production, and shed new light on the interactions between mycotoxins and ARGs in the poultry intestine.

AB  - Photobioreactors are a promising alternative for piggery wastewater treatment which allows to produce valuable biomass, but the presence of antibiotics or heavy metals in the pig manure can influence the biomass composition and the posterior valorization processes. This study evaluates the effect of these pollutants on mass, composition and hydrolysis yields of the consortia of microalgae and bacteria obtained in a 1280 L photobioreactor treating pig manure. The photobioreactor feed was doped with 1) veterinary antibiotics; 2) copper, zinc, and arsenic; and 3) combination of both pollutants. The pollutants presence decreased the mass of biomass grown in the photobioreactor by up to 35% while glucose content of the biomass by up to 42% and increased protein and xylose by 30% and 16% due to oxidative stress. Likewise, they increased the protein solubilization yield by acid hydrolysis at 120 degrees C by 32% while reduced glucose solubilization by 49% after alkaline hydrolysis at 120 degrees C. Applying enzymatic hydrolysis and ultrasound assisted enzymatic extractions, glucose and xylose recoveries were drastically reduced in presence of heavy metals (similar to 100%). Antibiotics increased xylose solubilization by ultrasonication (74%), but also its degradation, decreasing xylose recovery. Thus, the presence of all these pollutants in pig manure affected biomass production and valorization and these results must be considered for biorefinery processes.

AB  - Increasing genotypic crop diversity via cultivar mixtures is a promising sustainable approach to control insect pests and diseases, thereby improving yield. The effects of genotypic diversity have not been studied for many crops. We investigated the effects of cultivar mixtures in a tropical soybean ( Glycine max L . Merrill) cropping system on i) insect pest abundance, ii) natural enemy abundance, iii) diseases, and iv) yield. In the field trial, three soybean cultivars were used, two commercial and one traditional, with a randomized complete block design. Significant differences among cultivars and some mixtures were found for certain insect pest abundance (whitefly and brown bean bug), but no consistent mixture effects were observed. Significant increases in natural enemies (predatory ant, lady beetle, parasitoid wasp, and dragonfly) were detected in some cultivar mixtures, compared to single cultivars. Higher genetic diversity in cultivar mixtures increased the abundance of certain natural enemies at specific plant stages. The cultivar mixtures did not alter disease symptoms or yield. These results were obtained during a season with very low overall pest pressure, and the effects of cultivar mixtures might be altered at higher pest pressure, which should be further investigated. This study highlights trade-offs in cultivar selection when jointly considering pest and disease abundance and yield, as no single cultivar (or mixture) performed better in all observed aspects. Our study supports the hypothesis that increasing cultivar mixtures can promote the abundance of certain natural enemies, suggesting the potential of cultivar mixture effects for biological control and sustainable agricultural management.

AB  - Indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants covers various aspects, including ethnobotany. Ethnobotany means human knowledge of botany and the ecology of plants. In this study, an ethnobotanical and phytochemical evaluation of Withania coagulans (Stocks) Dunal was performed in Khash city in Sistan and Baluchestan province. The data collection was performed through a structured questionnaire (150 questionnaires). The data was analyzed using RFC (Relative Frequency of Citation) and CI (Cultural Importance Index). The questions were related to the plant organ used, plant harvest time, type of livestock user and growth place. To investigate which chemical compounds in the plant cause people to use this drug in the treatment of certain diseases, the chemical compounds of the species were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Results showed that the best season of plant collecting was spring. The most used part of the plant was seeds. The plant grows mainly in plains. Camel (51.40%) and sheep (42.05%) have the maximum use of the plant. The maximum chemical compositions were related to the Ar-tumerone terpene and Pentadecanone with 95.5% and 93.8% probability, respectively. Also, the percentage of saturated fatty acids such as Palmitic acid, Tetradecanoic acid and unsaturated fatty acids such as Oleic acid has the highest percentage. In total, indigenous people use this plant in treating diabetes due to the presence of a compound such as Ar-tumerone, which is consistent with the chemical compounds identified in this study. The importance of plant seeds in cheese making by indigenous peoples is related to acidic compounds such as Palmitic acid, Linoleic acid and Oleic acid.

AB  - Simple Summary Fibre inclusion in animals' diets can improve digestive health and protect the animal against diarrhoea. However, studies have shown that fibrous feedstuffs can have a variable effect on pig growth, health and production quality. Sugar beet pulp (SBP) is a cheap fibrous material which contains more lysine than wheat grain and has a similar gross energy and crude protein content compared to corn grains. Nevertheless, the effect of fibre supplementation in the diet, especially using SBP, on pork quality has not been widely reported. This study evaluated the effect of an SBP-supplemented diet (3%) on Large White/Norwegian Landrace piglets' growth performance, health parameters (blood characteristics and faeces microbial profile), carcass and meat quality. The tested diet reduced the average daily gain but improved the carcass quality. It also affected most of the blood parameters, the microbial profiles in pig faeces and the fatty acid and volatile compound profiles of pork meat. Higher drip loss, protein content and redness, along with a lower cooking loss, intramuscular fat content and lightness, were observed in the meat from pigs fed with SBP. Most of the sensory properties, as well as the overall acceptability, were more highly rated for this meat. The SBP-supplemented diet could be beneficial for the improvement of pigs' gut health and pork quality. However, further studies are needed to indicate which compounds of the SBP dietary fiber are responsible for these desirable changes. Fibrous feedstuffs can have a variable effect on pig growth, health and meat quality. The effect of sugar beet pulp (SBP) supplementation in the diet on pork quality has not been widely reported. This study examines the effect of an SBP-supplemented (3%) diet (TG-I group) on 300 Large White/Norwegian Landrace pigs in terms of growth performance, blood parameters, microbial profiling of faeces, carcass parameters and meat quality, including the profiles of biogenic amines (BAs), fatty acids (FAs) and volatile compounds (VCs). After 163 days of the experiment, TG-I pigs had a significantly lower average daily gain and feed conversion ratio than pigs in the control group, as well as a significantly higher percentage of carcasses in the S and KN classes and a lower percentage in the E and U classes (p <= 0.05). Faeces of TG-I contained significantly more bacteria that are considered probiotic. Significant differences (p <= 0.05) were found in most of the blood parameters, FA, VC profile and emotional responses between the two groups. Higher drip loss, protein content and redness, as well as lower cooking loss, intramuscular fat content and lightness were observed in the meat of TG-I. Most of the sensory properties, as well as overall acceptability, were rated higher for the meat of TG-I. Based on the results, a diet containing 3% of SBP could be beneficial for the improvement of pigs' gut health and pork quality. However, further studies are needed to indicate which compounds of the SBP dietary fiber are responsible for these desirable changes.

AB  - Two early validly published names for Assam tea (Camellia sinensis var. assamica "(Choisy) Kitam.)") are identified: Thea assamica Royle ex Hook. 1847 and T. assamica Hort. Belg. ex Bosse 1854; an amended synonymy and a neotypification (with D.-W. Zhao) for the name of Assam tea, C. sinensis var. assamica (Hook.) Steenis, are provided. The three editions (1829-1861) of Bosse's Vollstandiges Handbuch der Blumengartnerei are also the neglected places of publication of some plant-names (or their basionyms) in current use; Grevillea lawrenceana Bosse (neotype designated here by P.M. Olde) is an earlier name for G. curviloba McGill. (Proteaceae); Hedera algeriensis (Araliaceae), the name used by Bosse for a now much-cultivated ivy, was first published by Morren in 1853; an early valid, available name for the florist's cineraria (Senecio hybridus Bosse) is Cineraria xkewensis Rob. (Compositae), here neotypified (with D.J.N. Hind); the basionym for the well-known garden plant-name, "Erysimum xkewense" (Cruciferae) is identified and neotypified (with D.J.N. Hind), the accepted binomial validated. The currently accepted name for commercial fustic, Maclura tinctoria (Moraceae), was first validly published in Loudon's Hortus Britannicus (1830).

AB  - Anthracnose is a major disease of cultivated Camellia oleifera (tea-oil tree) in China, with serious negative impacts on the yield and quality of cooking oil. In 2020, symptoms of anthracnose were observed on the leaves of tea-oil trees in Hunan province, and Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from symptomatic leaf tissues. Morphological characterization and sequencing of ApMat gene region indicated that these isolates represented Colletotrichum aeschynomenes. Inoculation trial confirmed that C. aeschynomenes causes anthracnose on Ca. oleifera in China.

AB  - Extruded linseed (Linum usitatissimum) in ruminant diets has been investigated as a strategy to improve the nutritional value and healthiness of meat fat; however, increased polyunsaturated fatty acids may limit the shelf-life of meat. Oregano (Origanum vulgare) has a documented antioxidant activity. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with extruded linseed and oregano on goat milk quality and whether the characteristics of goat milk affect the physical and chemical features, fatty acid profile, meat lipid oxidation, and sensory properties of meat from suckling kids. Thirty-six male kids were weaned and divided into three homogeneous groups (n = 12); each group was either fed a control diet (C), or a diet containing 3% extruded linseed with or without the addition of 0.6% oregano ("L + O" and "L", respectively). The diets containing linseed lowered (p < 0.05) the saturated fatty acid content in meat, and increased (p < 0.05) monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid. Oregano addition to the linseed diet proved to be effective in preserving meat shelf-life, as shown by a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in the malondialdehyde concentration after 10 days of storage, and improved meat succulence, tenderness, juiciness, and overall acceptance.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential element and antioxidant that catalyzes the destruction of hydrogen peroxide formed during cellular oxidative metabolism. Doses of Se as selenomethionine (SeMe) by oral route are 0.1-0.3 mgSe/kg DM, while the dose by parenteral route with sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) is 0.1 mgSe/BW. The effects of supranutritional Se supplementation on normal kids have rarely been studied. The objective of the study was to evaluate both Se sources on growth performance, Se in tissues, histopathological findings, and meat characteristics. Forty-five kids of the Pastorena breed with 25-day age were distributed (4.7 +/- 1.13 kg) in three treatments: a) control group, C: consumption with goat milk (GM: containing 0.135 mgSe/g); b) NaSe: GM plus Na2SeO3 injectable, 0.25 mgSe/kg BW; c) SeMe: GM plus oral dosage, 0.3 mgSe as SeMe daily. Fifteen animals per treatment were slaughtered at 7, 14, and 21 days. Feed conversion improved (P < 0.05) with Se supplement (P < 0.05) at 7 and 14 days. SeMe had higher protein and fat meat content (P < 0.05). SeMe increased Se liver at 14 and 21 days. NaSe and SeMe had higher (P < 0.05) levels of Se kidney. SeMe-21d showed 42% mononuclear and periportal cell infiltration lesions. In conclusion, Se administered through milk in goat kids was insufficient to prevent nutritional muscular dystrophy. The supranutritional dose of 0.25 mg/kg as NaSe was sufficient to maintain the Se level in tissues. SeMe increased Se liver and kidney efficiently. Both Se sources improved the bioavailability of the mineral in kids.

AB  - Genome variation not only plays an important role in plant phenotypic modeling and adaptive evolution, but also enhances population genetic diversity and regulates gene expression. The tea tree (Camellia sinensis) has a large genome (similar to 3.0 Gb), making the identification of genome-wide variants time-consuming and expensive. With the continuous publication of a large number of different types of population sequencing data, there is a lack of an open platform to integrate these data and identify variants in the tea plant genome.
   To integrate the genetic variation confidence in the tea plant population genome, 238 whole-genome resequencing, 213 transcriptome sequencing, and 96 hybrid F1 individuals with a total of more than 20 Tb were collected for mutation site identification. Based on these variations information, we constructed the first tea tree variation web service database TeaPVs (http://47.106.184.91:8025/ and http://liushang.top:8025/). It supports users to search all SNP, Indel, SV mutations and SSR/Polymorphic SSR sequences by location or gene ID. Furthermore, the website also provides the functions of gene expression search of different transcriptome, sequence blast, sequence extraction of CDS and mutation loci, etc.
   The features of the TeaPVs database make it a comprehensive tea plant genetic variation bioinformatics platform for researchers, and will also be helpful for revealing new functional mutations in the tea plant genome and molecular marker-assisted breeding.

AB  - The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining animal health and is influenced by various factors, including light exposure; however, the response in laying hens of the gut microbiome to intermittent light regimes and the related impact on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) remain poorly understood. In this study, we divided 20-week-old laying hens into two groups. These groups were exposed to either continuous normal light or intermittent light for 8 weeks. The feces and cecal contents of laying hens were collected for analysis. Metagenomic analysis of both feces and cecal content samples revealed significant shifts in the microbial composition and abundance of ARGs under intermittent light exposure compared to normal light exposure (P < 0.05). Furthermore, metabolomic analysis of the cecal contents revealed substantial alterations in the abundance and composition of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in response to intermittent light exposure (P < 0.05). Network analysis revealed intricate co-occurrence patterns among bacterial communities, metabolites, and ARGs, highlighting correlations between Bacteroidetes species, ARGs, and metabolites. Although certain bacterial species showed differential associations, the dominant bacteria carrying ARGs or MGEs had relatively low numbers, suggesting that other bacterial communities may have had a greater influence on ARG dissemination. Moreover, our observations highlight the crucial role of metabolites as mediators between bacterial communities and ARGs, providing novel insights into the dynamics of antibiotic resistance development. Our findings underscore the impact of intermittent light exposure on ARG proliferation in poultry farming and emphasize interconnections among ARGs, bacterial communities, and metabolic pathways. The results underscore the importance of considering both microbial communities and metabolic processes to understand antibiotic resistance in agricultural settings.

AB  - Evidence suggests that camel milk (CM) can have insulin-like actions, although the mode of action is not understood. Using the pig as a monogastric model, this pilot experiment examined the effects of CM consumption on metabolic responses to an in vitro glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Twenty female Large White x Landrace pigs were individually housed for 6 wks and randomly allocated to one of the following four diets (fed ad libitum; n = 5): control (Con); high fat (HF; similar to 16% fat); raw CM (the HF diet plus 500 mL CM/ day); or pasteurized CM (PCM). Blood samples were collected on two occasions (weeks 2 and 5). At week 6, the pigs were fitted with an ear vein cannula and the following day an in vitro glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was conducted (0.3 g/kg BW glucose). Plasma fatty acids and cholesterol concentrations were greater in the pigs fed the HF diet and greatest in those fed CM, while there was no effect of diet on insulin concentrations. The pigs fed CM tended to have a reduced peak insulin (p = 0.058) and an increased glucose nadir (p = 0.009) in response to the IVGTT. These preliminary results tend to support the hypothesis that feeding CM can improve glycemic control in pigs.

AB  - Commercial pooled semen from boars of maternal and terminal genetic lines was analysed over two consecutive years, as part of an external quality control program. Semen doses were prepared for two total sperm counts (2.0 x 10(9)/75 ml [n = 578] and 1.5 x 10(9)/34 ml [n = 643]). Semen doses were evaluated for motility, morphology and bacterial contamination at days 1 and 4 after collection. Additionally, temperature during transport was tracked and correlated to sperm motility. Sperm motility and morphology were significantly affected by genetic line, but not by total sperm per doses. Total motility (TM) was affected (p < .05) by season. Progressive motility (PM) was lower (p < .05) in some winter months, and higher (p < .05) in summer for maternal-line doses. Normal sperm morphology was higher (p < .05) in some months of late fall and winter, with an apparent decrease in some summer months. In general, motility was significantly higher on day 1 than on day 4, and was also affected (p < .05) by temperature, especially for terminal-line doses. Semen doses exposed to >15 degrees C had higher (p < .05) TM, VSL (straight-line velocity) and linearity than doses exposed to <15 degrees C. Progressive motility and straightness increased (p < .05) proportionally with temperature. At day 1, motility, average path velocity (VAP) and VSL increased (p < .05) with temperature, and was higher than the corresponding group at day 4, except for VSL. Sperm motility and kinematics at day 4 were similar between temperature groups, except for doses exposed to >20 degrees C that had higher (p < .05) VAP and VSL than doses exposed to <12 degrees C. Microbiology evaluation revealed that less than 8.2% (15/184) of the semen doses had bacterial growth. Sphingobacterium lactis was the most prevalent bacterium identified. In conclusion, genetic line strongly influences sperm motility, while total sperm count does not have an impact. Transient reduced temperatures during shipping do not impair sperm quality after 4 days of storage. Seasonal and temperature effects on sperm motility of pooled boar semen are not overcome by pre-production ejaculate selection and semen pooling.

AB  - Simple Summary The Jipijapa region in the south of Manabi Province has the maximum contribution to the pig market in Ecuador. In this region, backyard pig production is important for the economy of the small family units. The main objective of this paper was to characterize the traditional systems of Jipijapa's small-scale pig producers and determine the farm categories according to the current characteristics of those systems for the implementation of the aid policy in the country. The study identified differences between the seven communities studied for social, productive, and local resource variables. Five types of farms were identified by multifactorial and hierarchic cluster analyses. The aspects that most contributed to the differences between those types of farms were the location, the age, the agricultural activities, the participation of women as owners of farms, the use of indigenous resources in construction, the genetics of the animals, and the food sources used. We determined that the rearing of pigs by small pig farmers of the Jipijapa region is, fundamentally, a social activity and is linked to the crops of each area. To characterize the traditional systems of small pig producers in Jipijapa (Manabi, Ecuador) and to classify farms into representative categories, we interviewed fifty-five farmers from seven communities considering four dimensions: social, organizational, production methods, and local food resources. Multiple correspondence analyses and hierarchical clusters were carried out using the Ward method. The analysis differentiated communities based on social, productive, and local resource variables, showing three factors that accounted for 85.3% of the total variance: the socioeconomic dimension, related to the welfare of families, explained 34.4% of the variation, the care provided to animals explained 30.9%, and the management practices for the supply of food explained 20%. We identified five clusters that shared common characteristics: Group 1 included farmers from Albajacal, wage workers, and Creole pig breeders, Group 2 included farmers raising pigs under lockdown conditions, Group 3 typified traditional farms from the La Cuesta community, Group 4 included landowners, and Group 5 included professionalized farmers in Colon Alfaro. We also studied the supplied alternative food formulations made up of crop surpluses. The role of small pig farmers is a social activity linked to the location, the crops of each area, and the specific practices for the care of animals.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the most commonly used artisanal fishing gear for capturing elasmobranchs along the coast of Maranhao State, within the Brazilian Amazon Coast. Interviews were conducted with 314 fishers across 17 coastal municipalities using semi-structured questionnaires. These gathered information on vessel characteristics, fishing gear, and elasmobranch species caught in the region. Six types of fishing gear were identified, with gillnets and longlines being the most frequently used. Of the 70 elasmobranch species identified along the Brazilian Amazon Coast, 35 are commonly captured. Among rays, the species most frequently cited by fishers were Hypanus guttatus, Rhinoptera bonasus, Hypanus geijskesi, Aetobatus narinari, Gymnura micrura, Mobula hypostoma, Mobula birostris, and Pseudobatos percellens. For sharks, the most frequently mentioned species included Carcharhinus acronotus, Sphyrna tudes, Carcharhinus leucas, Ginglymostoma cirratum, Galeocerdo cuvier, Rhizoprionodon porosus, and Carcharhinus porosus. Notably, all identified species are susceptible to capture by both gillnets and longlines. To mitigate the impact of these practices on population stocks, particularly for species threatened with extinction, it is essential to develop targeted conservation measures and management plans that address fishing gear, capture areas, and most vulnerable species.

AB  - Simple Summary Sustainable production of livestock farms mainly depends on efficient management and precise decisions. One of the most important managemental decisions that play a great role in the continuation of production and profitability is culling. Excluding non-efficient animals from the production cycle is a very critical decision as a wrong and aggressive culling decision may cause a certain loss in farm profitability by increasing costs of replacement. Identifying factors that affect culling risk can aid breeders in creating suitable interventions to maintain productive animals. In this study, logistic regression analysis was used to study the pattern of culling risk factors in primiparous Nubian goats. The effect of ten independent factors including season, reproductive traits, and milk production traits on the percentage of voluntary culling risk was studied. The presented outcomes clearly indicated that birth weight, total litter size at birth, litter size at weaning, number of kids dead, total milk yield, average daily milk yield, lactation period, and age at first kidding had significant effects on culling risk, while both the birth season of the dam and kidding season did not exhibit significant effects on culling risk. In practice, monitoring of traits that indicate milk imbalance and older age at first kidding could promote identifying goats at high risk of being culled. The purpose of the current study is to reconnoiter the relationships between season (birth season, BS, and kidding season, KS), reproductive traits (birth weight, BW; total litter size at birth, TLS; litter size at weaning, LSW; the number of kids dead, NKD, and; age at first kidding, AFK) and milk production (total milk yield, TMY; average daily milk yield, DMY, and; lactation period, LP), with voluntary culling risk in primiparous Zaraibi goats. Records of 637 primiparous does were collected during the period 2008-2014 from a herd of Zaraibi goats raised at the El-Serw Experimental Station, which belongs to the Animal Production Research Institute. Our data revealed that the voluntary and involuntary culling was 89.12% and 10.88%, respectively. Moreover, the BW, TLS, LSW, NKD, TMY, DMY, LP, AFK had significant effects on culling risk (p < 0.05), while both the season of birth and kidding did not exhibit significant effects on culling risk. The thinnest goats at birth were more likely to be culled compared to those with body energy reserves. Does with weaned twins and triplets kids were 9.5% (OR = 0.905) and 43% (OR = 0.570), respectively less likely to be culled compared to those with singles. Likewise, does with dead twins and triplets kids had 2.566 and 2.138 times, respectively higher odds of culling compared to those with singles. Interestingly, culling risk decreased with 74.6% (OR = 0.254), 79.8% (OR = 0.202), and 75.6% (OR = 0.244) in does with TMY, LP, and DMY more than 230 kg, 260 days, and 0.800 kg, respectively compared to their counterparts (less than 185 kg, 240 day, and 0.500 kg, respectively). Moreover, culling risk increased steadily along with increasing AFK; the animals with an AFK of more than 24 months had 2.974 times higher odds of culling compared to those with an AFK that varied between 22 and 24 months. It could be concluded that the most critical issues for higher culling probability in dairy goats were attributed to the lower TMY (<185 kg) and DMY (<0.5 kg), and shorter LP (<245 days), as well as older age at first kidding (>2 years).
   This putative information could be used as indicators to enhance the management and genetic approaches in dairy goats and thus sustain productivity with low cost.

AB  - Simple Summary The study aimed to compare the carcass measurements and the quality and composition of meat from male kids of the Polish Carpathian native goat breed slaughtered at the ages of 9 and 12 months. A dressing percentage was higher in older kids than in younger ones, as well as final weight and cold carcass weight. The weight of valuable cuts differed between groups, and it was significantly higher in 1-year-old kids. No differences were found in basic ingredients, such as moisture, protein, ash and vitamins A and E, depending on the kids' slaughter age. Significant differences occurred in relation to the physicochemical parameters, fatty acid profile and organoleptic properties. Roasted meat from the Carpathian kids scored high marks in the organoleptic assessment and the meat obtained from older animals was rated higher. The native breed of Carpathian goats, once abundant in the foothills of Poland, practically died out and was replaced by other, more efficient breeds. As a result of reintroduction activities and its inclusion in the genetic resources program, breeding was restored. The dynamically developing population of Carpathian goats is an extremely valuable element of biodiversity and a potential for the development of the market for its products, including goat meat. The study aimed to compare the carcass measurements and the quality and composition of meat from male kids of the Polish Carpathian native goat breed slaughtered at the ages of 9 and 12 months. Muscle samples were taken from the leg (m. biceps femoris) to determine the meat chemical composition and physicochemical and sensory parameters, as well as the fatty acid profile. The dressing percentage was higher in older kids (41.27%) than in younger ones (37.89%), as well as final weight and cold carcass weight. The weight of valuable cuts such as the loin and leg differed between groups, and it was significantly higher in 1-year-old kids. No differences were found in basic ingredients, such as moisture, protein, ash and vitamins A and E, depending on the kids' slaughter age. The fat concentration was significantly higher in the group of younger kids. Significant differences occurred in relation to the physicochemical parameters, fatty acid profile and organoleptic properties. The findings demonstrated that the meat of older kids was characterised by darker colour and a slightly higher pH, and it contained a higher concentration of hypocholesterolemic fatty acids (DFA) and a more favourable DFA/OFA ratio. Roasted meat from the Carpathian kids scored high marks in the organoleptic assessment and the meat obtained from older animals was rated higher.

AB  - Overcoming constraints that poorly structured lowland rice-growing soils of the Lower Mekong River Basin present for growing non-rice crops during the dry season would have a significant positive impact on the livelihood of smallholder farmers. This study investigated whether the use of soil organic amendments, bed architecture (conventional, flat and narrow) and water application methods (sprinkler, furrow and over-bed irrigation) could improve plant water availability in typical rice-growing soils of Cambodia and Laos by either improving the movement of water into beds or the growth of the root system. Five experiments were conducted over two dry seasons on peanut and maize grown in a bed/furrow system. Organic amendments assessed were rice straw, cow/goat manure, biochar, manure plus rice straw and biochar plus manure. Results showed that compared with conventional bed/furrow design, narrowing beds increased soil moisture availability for peanut, whilst higher grain yield and water productivity were achieved with sprinkler irrigation than furrow irrigation. Placing a layer of sub-surface straw within beds did not consistently enhance soil moisture or improve root development. The study showed that maize grown on soil amended with biochar plus cow manure under a furrow irrigation system and on rice straw under sprinkler irrigation produced yields above the average yield that models have simulated for maize grown on these soils. These findings present opportunities to enhance maize production on lowland soils across Cambodia and Laos. The contrary was observed for peanut production, which indicates that factors other than water might be detrimentally affecting crop yields.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusarium species are responsible for Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat, resulting in yield losses and mycotoxin contamination. Deoxynivalenol (DON) and enniatins (ENNs) are common mycotoxins produced by Fusarium, affecting plant, animal and human health. Although DON's effects have been widely studied, limited research has explored the impact of ENNs on insects. This study examines the influence of DON and enniatin B (ENB), both singularly and in combination, on the wheat aphid Sitobion avenae and one of its predators, the lacewing Chrysoperla carnea. RESULTS: When exposed to DON (100 mg L-1) or DON + ENB (100 mg L-1), S. avenae exhibited significantly increased mortality compared to the negative control. ENB (100 mg L-1) had no significant effect on aphid mortality. DON-treated aphids showed increasing mortality from 48 to 96 h. A dose-response relationship with DON revealed significant cumulative mortality starting at 25 mg L-1. By contrast, C. carnea larvae exposed to mycotoxins via cuticular application did not show significant differences in mortality when mycotoxins were dissolved in water but exhibited increased mortality with acetone-solubilized DON + ENB (100 mg L-1). Feeding C. carnea with aphids exposed to mycotoxins (indirect exposure) did not impact their survival or predatory activity. Additionally, the impact of mycotoxins on C. carnea was observed only with acetone-solubilized DON + ENB. CONCLUSIONS: These findings shed light on the complex interactions involving mycotoxins, aphids and their predators, offering valuable insights for integrated pest management strategies. Further research should explore broader ecological consequences of mycotoxin contamination in agroecosystems. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Sustainable transition to low carbon and zero waste economy requires a macroscopic evaluation of opportunities and impact of adopting emerging technologies in a region. However, a full assessment of current physical flow and waste is a tedious task, thus leading to a lack of comprehensive assessment before scale up and adoption of emerging technologies. Utilizing the mechanistic models developed for engineering and biological systems with the macroeconomic framework of Input-Output models, we propose a novel integrated approach to fully map the physical economy, that automates the process of mapping industrial flows and wastes in a region. The approach is demonstrated by mapping the agro-based physical economy of the state of Illinois, USA by using mechanistic models for 10 agro-based sectors, which have a high impact on waste generation. Each model mechanistically simulates the material transformation processes in the economic sector and provides the necessary material flow information for physical economy mapping. The model for physical economy developed in the form of a Physical Input-Output Table (PIOT) captures the interindustry physical interactions in the region and waste flows, thus providing insight into the opportunities to implement circular economy strategies i.e., adoption of recycling technologies on a large scale. In Illinois, adoption of technologies for industrial waste-water and hog manure recycling will have the highest impact by reducing >62% of hog industry waste outputs, >99% of soybean hull waste, and >96% of dry corn milling (corn ethanol production) waste reduction. A small % reduction in nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing waste was also observed. The physical economy model revealed that the urea sector had the highest material use of 5.52 x 10(8) tons and green bean farming with the lowest material use of 1.30 x 10(5) tons for the year modeled (2018). The mechanistic modeling also allowed elemental flows across the physical economy to be captured, with the urea sector using 8.25 x 10(7) tons of elemental carbon per operation-year (highest) and green bean farming using 3.90 x 10(4) tons of elemental carbon per operation-year (least). The approach proposed here establishes a connection between engineering and physical economy modeling community for standardizing the mapping of physical economy that can provide insights for successfully transitioning to a low carbon and zero waste circular economy.

AB  - Parasitic nematodes, particularly those in the Rhabditidae family, are vital components of belowground ecosystems, contributing to pest regulation and sustainable agriculture. This study investigated the chemotactic responses of three nematode species-Phasmarhabditis papillosa, Oscheius myriophilus, and O. onirici-to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by Brassica nigra roots under herbivory by Delia radicum larvae. Using a chemotaxis assay, the effects of five VOCs (dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, allyl isothiocyanate, phenylethyl isothiocyanate, and benzonitrile) were tested at two concentrations (pure and 0.03 ppm) and two temperatures (18 degrees C and 22 degrees C). The results revealed that VOCs and temperature significantly influenced nematode responses, while nematode species and VOC concentration showed limited effects. Benzonitrile consistently demonstrated strong chemoattractant properties, particularly for O. myriophilus and O. onirici. Conversely, allyl isothiocyanate exhibited potent nematicidal effects, inhibiting motility and causing mortality. Dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl sulfide elicited moderate to strong attractant responses, with species- and temperature-dependent variations. Significant interactions between VOCs, temperature, and nematode species highlighted the complexity of these ecological interactions. These findings emphasize the ecological roles of VOCs in mediating nematode behavior and their potential applications in sustainable pest management. Benzonitrile emerged as a promising candidate for nematode-based biocontrol strategies, while allyl isothiocyanate showed potential as a direct nematicidal agent. The study underscores the importance of integrating chemical cues into pest management systems to enhance agricultural sustainability and reduce reliance on chemical pesticides.

AB  - In many African countries, anthropogenic pressure and poor governance have led to the degradation of wildlife corridors, which are important for the long-term viability of wildlife populations. Yet the nature of such degradation is poorly understood, hindering our ability to reverse these trends. We studied a deteriorating wildlife corridor between Katavi and Mahale National Parks in western Tanzania. Using satellite imagery, we found that the corridor still contains large areas of natural vegetation, diverse terrain and numerous water sources. There has nonetheless been increasing encroachment of the corridor by people between 1990 and 2017, exemplified by a 9% reduction in the area covered by miombo woodlands and a fourfold increase in the area covered by settlements and agricultural land. We used three additional methods to assess deterioration over the last three decades: elephants' movement routes, peoples' perception of animal populations and incidents of human-wildlife conflicts. Elephants were primarily found only in the parts of the corridor adjacent to the two national parks. Tracking of elephant spoor revealed a much-diminished corridor use, suggesting that seemingly 'healthy' habitat within a wildlife corridor will not necessarily predict the presence of elephants or perhaps of other species. Other factors particularly the increasing presence of humans in the area are possibly more important for predicting elephant use of a corridor. Interviews with local residents and conservation experts suggested that, although use by some animal species has declined, many ungulates were still seen in the corridor and neighbouring villages, some of which were associated with human-wildlife conflict. All villages around the corridor were affected by the human-wildlife conflict; this comprised crop damage, livestock injury or killing and attacks on humans. We conclude that corridors could be restored if people were restricted from settling, but this would require governments to enact policies that balance the conservation of Natural Capital with survival of human populations; the latter may involve internal migration in response to growing population pressures.
   Dans de nombreux pays africains, la pression anthropique et la mauvaise gouvernance ont entra & icirc;n & eacute; la d & eacute;gradation des corridors de faune, qui sont importants pour la viabilit & eacute; & agrave; long terme des populations d'animaux sauvages. Pourtant, la nature de cette d & eacute;gradation est mal comprise, ce qui entrave notre capacit & eacute; & agrave; inverser ces tendances. Nous avons & eacute;tudi & eacute; un corridor de faune en cours de d & eacute;t & eacute;rioration entre les parcs nationaux de Katavi et de Mahale, dans l'ouest de la Tanzanie. Gr & acirc;ce & agrave; l'imagerie satellitaire, nous avons constat & eacute; que le corridor contient encore de vastes zones de v & eacute;g & eacute;tation naturelle, un terrain vari & eacute; et de nombreuses sources d'eau. N & eacute;anmoins, entre 1990 et 2017, l'empi & egrave;tement des populations sur le corridor s'est accru, comme en t & eacute;moignent la r & eacute;duction de 9% de la superficie couverte par les for & ecirc;ts de miombo et la multiplication par quatre de la superficie couverte par les zones d'habitation et les terres agricoles. Nous avons utilis & eacute; trois m & eacute;thodes suppl & eacute;mentaires pour & eacute;valuer la d & eacute;t & eacute;rioration au cours des trois derni & egrave;res d & eacute;cennies : les itin & eacute;raires de d & eacute;placement des & eacute;l & eacute;phants, la perception qu'ont les gens des populations animales et les incidents li & eacute;s aux conflits entre l'homme et la faune. Les & eacute;l & eacute;phants ne se trouvaient principalement que dans les parties du corridor adjacentes aux deux parcs nationaux. Le suivi des traces d'& eacute;l & eacute;phants a r & eacute;v & eacute;l & eacute; une utilisation tr & egrave;s r & eacute;duite du corridor, ce qui sugg & egrave;re qu'un habitat apparemment << sain >> au sein d'un corridor de faune ne permet pas n & eacute;cessairement de pr & eacute;dire la pr & eacute;sence d'& eacute;l & eacute;phants ou peut-& ecirc;tre d'autres esp & egrave;ces. D'autres facteurs, en particulier la pr & eacute;sence croissante de l'homme dans la r & eacute;gion, sont peut-& ecirc;tre plus importants pour pr & eacute;dire l'utilisation d'un corridor par les & eacute;l & eacute;phants. Les entretiens avec les r & eacute;sidents locaux et les experts en conservation ont sugg & eacute;r & eacute; que, bien que l'utilisation par certaines esp & egrave;ces animales ait diminu & eacute;, de nombreux ongul & eacute;s & eacute;taient encore observ & eacute;s dans le corridor et les villages voisins, certains d'entre eux & eacute;tant associ & eacute;s & agrave; des conflits entre l'homme et la faune. Tous les villages situ & eacute;s autour du corridor ont & eacute;t & eacute; touch & eacute;s par le conflit entre l'homme et la faune, qui s'est traduit par des dommages aux cultures, des blessures ou des abattages de b & eacute;tail et des attaques contre l'homme. Nous concluons que les corridors pourraient & ecirc;tre restaur & eacute;s si l'on emp & ecirc;chait les gens de s'installer, mais il faudrait pour cela que les gouvernements adoptent des politiques & eacute;quilibrant la conservation du capital naturel et la survie des populations humaines ; cette derni & egrave;re peut impliquer des migrations internes en r & eacute;ponse aux pressions d & eacute;mographiques croissantes.

AB  - Insect proteins are expected to be increasingly used for food and feed. Black soldier fly larvae (BSF, Hermetia illucens) can convert low quality organic substrates, such as manure, into protein-rich ingredients for food and feed. However, pig and chicken manure can contain residues from antibiotics and anti-parasitic drugs, resulting from treatments of the animals for diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of veterinary drugs on black soldier fly larvae rearing, including growth and survival, as well as on the presence of residues in the larvae. The study focused on regularly found veterinary drugs in manure. Five-days old larvae were exposed to either 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg flubendazole (FLUB), 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg ivermectin (IVM), 0.5 and 5 mg/kg doxycycline (DOX), 0.5 and 5 mg/kg flumequine (FLUM) or 0.5 and 5 mg/kg sulfadiazine (SULF) for one week. The growth of larvae reared on substrate with IVM (0.5 mg/kg) was significantly lower than the control, while the survival of the larvae was not affected. The growth and survival of the larvae was not affected by the other treatments. Chemical analyses showed that concentrations of the veterinary drugs in the larvae, after exposure, were generally low. Only DOX concentrations in the larvae were high; these levels would exceed the European Commission maximum limit for DOX in meat products. Mass-balance calculations showed possible degradation or metabolism of veterinary drugs by the larvae, except for SULF. In conclusion, when using manure as substrate for BSF rearing, the possible presence of veterinary drugs in manure should be carefully controlled to ensure optimal insect growth and safety of the insect products.

AB  - The Yangtze River Delta White Goat is the only goat breed in the world that can produce superior-quality brush hair. Previous studies have shown that some genes are expressed differentially in the skin tissues between the goats produced superior-quality and normal-quality brush hair. Studies also have shown that different gene play varied roles in regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of hair follicle stem cells. However, the biological function of MAP3K1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1) gene in hair follicle stem cells is not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the role of MAP3K1 knockdown during the proliferation and apoptosis of hair follicle stem cells. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to detect mRNA gene and protein expression level, CCK-8 and EdU assays were used to detect cell proliferation, and cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that the MAP3K1 expression level was significantly higher in the skin tissue of produced superior-quality brush hair than that in produced normal-quality brush hair. Moreover, functional studies indicated that si-MAP3K1 significantly inhibits the proliferation of hair follicle stem cells that came from a superior goat and promotes its apoptosis. Based on aforementioned assays, we speculated that MAP3K1 might play a regulatory effect in superior-quality brush hair traits.

AB  - Lesions in the motor cortex induced by contusions or pathological insults can exert the degeneration of afferent neurons lying distal to these lesions. Axon degeneration and demyelination are hallmarks of several diseases sharing pathophysiological and clinical characteristics. These conditions are very disabling due to the disruption of motor abilities, with lesions that affect this area proving to be a therapeutic challenge, which has driven increasing efforts to search for treatments. Cerebrolysin (CBL) contains a mix of pig brain-derived peptides with activity similar to neurotrophic factors. Here, the effect of cerebrolysin administration on the motor impairment produced by kainic acid (KA) lesion of the motor cortex was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley female rats (n = 27), defining its effect on motoneurons dendritic tree changes, dendritic spine density and GAP43 presence in the ventral thoracolumbar regions of the spinal cord. Ten days after the KA lesion of the motor cortex, rats were administered cerebrolysin, and their motor performance was evaluated using the "Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan" (BBB) and Bederson scores. Cerebrolysin administration improved motor activity according to the BBB and Bederson scales, along with increased dendritic intersections and dendritic spine density on motoneurons. There was also a significant increase in GAP43 protein, suggesting that CBL may promote plastic changes through this protein, among others. Hence, this study proposes that cerebrolysin could promote motor recovery following motor cortex lesions by driving neuronal changes and dendritic spine plasticity on motoneurons and an increase in GAP43 protein, along with other mechanisms.

AB  - Forest roads are necessary to provide access to forests and are also used by users other than forest owners and the timber industry. Their usage for recreation and hiking has been increasing in the last years. From 1/2020 to 12/2020, we performed research on traffic loads and the use of forest roads at an area of the University Forest Enterprise of Technical University in Zvolen. For this purpose, we selected two localities, namely Vcelien = A locality and Stagiar = B locality. We monitored transport intensity at selected localities with images obtained from two identical Trail Spromise S308 cameras. We examined the impact of lockdown periods during the COVID-19 pandemics on forest recreation in the year 2020 with the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA. Multiple comparisons of p values showed there were no differences in the recreational usage of forest roads between the lockdown periods and periods without restrictions. We found that recreation activities peaked in summer and spring. Recreation and transport at selected localities did not have a negative impact on animal occurrence, as the regression and correlation analysis revealed only a low negative relationship with r = 0.029. When considering the number of passages, roads were used for recreation and other non-forestry purposes at approximately 36%. From the perspective of the weight load, recreation accounted for about 10%.

AB  - Few paleotempestological studies have focused on coastal sinkholes, a common feature in Florida, which can receive and preserve storm overwash sediments. The major goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the characteristic signatures of storm sediments in sinkholes thereby determining reliability of these environments as proxies for hurricanes. Hurricane Irma as a category 5 storm provides an excellent case study for characterizing storm deposits in sinkholes on Big Pine Key. We cored at four sinkholes along a 350 m transect normal to the shoreline. Core sediments were characterized using physical description, short-lived radioisotope dating, sediment grain size analysis, loss-on-ignition, microfossil analysis, and x-ray fluorescence elemental analysis. We found that Irma deposits had higher abundances of marine foraminifera, less total organic matter and elevated Si/Al and Ca/Ti ratios, compared to pre- or post-Irma sediments. In addition, there was a thinning of the storm sediments along the inland transect. Consequently, we propose that sinkholes, particularly those that are closer to the shoreline, can provide reliable sites for paleotempestology studies.

AB  - Provision of competitiveness in the sphere of animal farming in Ukraine requires the introduction of innovative systems of tech-nological support involving modern microprocessor control-measurement systems and devices. The method of continuous auto-matic record of emissions of contaminants from animal premises reveals patterns in emissions of the main air contaminants and allows their mass concentrations and dynamics of emissions to be tracked over 24 h period. By employing this method, we deter-mined the coefficients of 24 h emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from premises for fattening young swine. The coefficients of 24 h emission of ammonia were found to be significantly lower in the sty with a slatted floor in pens for the winter, spring, and autumn periods compared with the sties with concrete floor. However, coefficients of 24 h emission of methane were significantly higher by 76.1-286.9% in the sty with a slatted floor, which is associated with the peculiarities of technology of the self-cleaning system. Two-times removal of manure from the sty with concrete floor significantly reduced the average annual coefficients of emission of carbon dioxide, ammonia, and methane, by 12.1%, 22.4%, and 13.5%, respectively. Analysis of emission of the main contaminants from the sties with slatted and concrete floor in pens indicated a significant effect of this factor on the amount ofemission, structure, and presence of seasonal and daily variability in those parameters. Accumulation of experimental materials regarding emission of contaminants will allow average actual parameters of emissions from small pig farms to be identified, which will allow adequate assessment of the effect their activity has on the environment, particularly in residential areas, and subst antiate the minimal allowable distances to sanitary-protective zones.

AB  - Severe fetal hypoxia poses a significant risk to lung development, resulting in severe postnatal complications. Existing chronic hypoxia animal models lack the ability to achieve pathologically reduced fetal oxygen without compromising animal development, placental blood flow, or maternal health. Using an established model of isolated chronic hypoxia involving the Extrauterine Environment for Neonatal Development, we are able to investigate the direct impact of fetal hypoxia on lung development. Oxygen delivery to preterm fetal lambs (105-110 d gestational age) delivered by cesarean section was reduced, and animals were supported using the Extrauterine Environment for Neonatal Development through the canalicular or saccular stage of lung development. Fetal lambs in hypoxic conditions showed significant growth restriction compared with their normoxic counterparts. We also observed modest aberrant vascular remodeling in the saccular group after hypoxic conditions, with decreased macrovessel numbers and microvascular endothelial cell numbers and increased peripheral vessel muscularization. In addition, fetal hypoxia resulted in enlarged distal airspaces and decreased septal wall volume. Moreover, there was a reduction in mature SFTPB (surfactant protein B) and processed SFTPC protein expression concomitant with a decrease in alveolar type 2 cell number. These findings demonstrate that maternally independent fetal hypoxia predominantly affects distal airway development, alveolar type 2 cell number, and surfactant production, with mild effects on the vasculature.

AB  - Cemeteries, traditionally reserved for mourning, are also valuable urban green spaces contributing to ecosystem services, wildlife habitats, and human well-being. This study focuses on London's Magnificent Seven cemeteries, which vary in habitat and usage, from semi-wild nature reserves to active burial sites. In autumn 2023, we conducted non-participatory observations of human activities and wildlife presence, and surveyed visitors (n = 176) regarding their perceptions of birds (crows, magpies, parakeets, robins, owls, blackbirds), mammals (fox, grey squirrel, bats, rats, cats, hedgehogs, rabbits, deer) and activities (e.g. biking, dog walking, picnicking). Our observations showed that visitors primarily engaged in solitary or accompanied walks. Observed animals included crows (Corvus spp.) and pigeons (Columba spp.), as well as grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Regarding visitor perceptions, wildlife was generally perceived positively, with invasive ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) as well as non-native grey squirrels occasionally evoking negative perceptions. Activities like grave visiting and solitary walks are widely accepted, while picnicking, biking and sports are less favored, with younger participants and locals generally being more accepting to more lively activities. Urban cemeteries play multifunctional roles beyond mourning, offering green spaces for recreation and wildlife habitats. This study highlights the importance of recognizing cemeteries as critical urban refuges for both people and wildlife, demonstrating that sacred grounds and urban wilderness can coexist to create restorative green spaces in busy cities. The future survival of inner-city cemeteries depends on their rejuvenation and integration into local communities, enabling them to act as nature-based solutions to withstand development pressures.

AB  - Trace conditioning and extinction learning depend on the hippocampus, but it remains unclear how neural activity in the hippocampus is modulated during these two different behavioral processes. To explore this question, we performed calcium imaging from a large number of individual CA1 neurons during both trace eye-blink conditioning and subsequent extinction learning in mice. Our findings reveal that distinct populations of CA1 cells contribute to trace conditioned learning versus extinction learning, as learning emerges. Furthermore, we examined network connectivity by calculating co-activity between CA1 neuron pairs and found that CA1 network connectivity patterns also differ between conditioning and extinction, even though the overall connectivity density remains constant. Together, our results demonstrate that distinct populations of hippocampal CA1 neurons, forming different sub-networks with unique connectivity patterns, encode different aspects of learning.

AB  - Sewage sludge (SS) contains potential toxic elements (PTEs) that are harmful to the environment, and their bioaccumulation in the food chain is a major environmental health concern. Vermicomposting has been shown to reduce PTEs during composting of sewage sludge. However, the extent of PTE's assimilation into the earthworm tissues during composting is largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential of vermicomposting to decrease PTEs (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) during composting of SS and whether the bioaccumulation of PTEs in earthworm tissue depends on feed quality. The initial SS was mixed in triplicate with varying proportions of pelletized wheat straw (PWS) (0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% (w/w)) along with a control (100% SS, no earthworms), and the variants were named VC1, VC2, VC3, VC4, and C0 (control), respectively. The experiment was conducted for 120 days using Eisenia andrei. In comparison to the control, mixing SS with PWS reduced Arsenic content by 14-67%, Cadmium content by 4-39%, Chromium contents by 24-77%, Copper content by 20-68%, Lead content by 39-75%, and Zinc content by 16-65%. The bioaccumulation factor's (BCF) ranges were 20-80% for Arsenic, 20-60% for Cadmium, 6-16% for Chromium, 32-80% for Copper, and 37-115% for Zinc, demonstrating that the accumulation of PTEs in the earthworm tissues explains the low content of PTEs in the vermicompost. In terms of removal rate, the sludge mixtures with bulking agent can be arranged in the following order: VC4 > VC3 > VC2 > VC1. The total carbon loss showed a significant relationship with BCFAs (r = 0.989, p < 0.011), BCFCd (r = 0.996, p < 0.004), BCFCr (r = 0.977, p < 0.023), BCFCu (r = 0.999, p < 0.000), and BCFZn (r = 0.994, p < 0.006). The variant containing 75% PWS (VC4) appeared to be a suitable SS mixture to reduce PTEs. Hence, it is suggested that vermicomposting reduces the content of PTEs in SS.

AB  - Dietary fibers (DFs) have many beneficial effects on intestinal health by ameliorating intestinal inflammation and modulating the microbial community composition, thereby affecting the barrier function. This study aims to characterize the gut microbiota of pigs fed with DFs, revealing a link between the intestinal microbiota and mucin chemotypes. Pigs (six per group) were randomly allotted to consume one of the following diets: control (CON) or a diet supplemented with 5% microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) or inulin (INU) for 72 days. We found that INU but not MCC enhanced the colonic barrier function by promoting the expression of ZO-1, Occludin and MUC2 and reducing the colonic crypt depth. INU increased sulfomucin production and mRNA levels of sulfotransferases Gal3ST1 and Gal3ST2. Goblet cells in the ileum were found to contain predominantly sialomucins while colonic goblet cells were dominated by sulfomucins with sialomucins absent. DF consumption increased the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of the ileum and colon compared to the CON diet. Moreover, the results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that DFs significantly altered the composition of ileal and colonic mucosal microbiota. Network analysis indicated that INU-induced changes in bacterial genera and SCFAs, such as Akkermansia and butyrate, were significantly related with sulfomucins and the mucosal barrier function-gene in pigs. Collectively, these findings suggest that the intestinal mucosal microbiota and SCFAs induced by INU play a crucial role in modulating the chemotypes of mucin and the barrier function.

AB  - The aquatic vegetable Brasenia schreberi Gmel. (Nymphaeales: Cabombaceae), widely cultivated in China, faces severe challenges from pest disturbances. With a field investigation, G. birmanica occurred for several generations in the Brasenia mono-cultivation system. The first visual peak on leaf surfaces appeared in July, with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults all being recorded. The highest number of flying adults were trapped in August in reverse to the absence of beetles on leaves, followed by an extraordinary high number of eggs in September. G. birmanica exhibited a conspicuous aggregation in distribution, with severely chewed areas having a G. birmanica abundance 21.6 times that of the non-chewed areas. Laboratory studies with GC-MS and two-choice tests revealed four volatiles significantly discrepant in contents released from chewed/intact leaves: cis-3-hexenyl acetate (917.33 +/- 29.56 vs. 604.034 +/- 23.24 ng, chewed vs. intact), 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (595.37 +/- 28.42 vs. 356.00 +/- 13.44 ng), undecane (771.44 +/- 34.72 vs. 1003.28 +/- 47.88 ng) and methyl salicylate (1079.84 +/- 49.39 vs. 532.11 +/- 18.23 ng); among them, 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate could significantly attract G. birmanica adults. Our study suggests that G. birmanica can be a severe threat to mono-cultivated B. schreberi, whereas the damaged leaves may sacrifice themselves by attracting the beetles with an herbivore-induced volatile, thus protecting the whole plant population from pest disturbance.

AB  - Background Intercropping, especially with legumes, as a productive and sustainable system, can promote plants growth and improves the soil quality than the sole crop, is an essential cultivation pattern in modern agricultural systems. However, the metabolic changes of secondary metabolites and the growth in tea plants during the processing of intercropping with soybean have not been fully analyzed. Results The secondary metabolomic of the tea plants were significant influence with intercropping soybean during the different growth stages. Especially in the profuse flowering stage of intercropping soybean, the biosynthesis of amino acids was significantly impacted, and the flavonoid biosynthesis, the flavone and flavonol biosynthesis also were changed. And the expression of metabolites associated with amino acids metabolism, particularly glutamate, glutamine, lysine and arginine were up-regulated, while the expression of the sucrose and D-Glucose-6P were down-regulated. Furthermore, the chlorophyll photosynthetic parameters and the photosynthetic activity of tea plants were higher in the tea plants-soybean intercropping system. Conclusions These results strengthen our understanding of the metabolic mechanisms in tea plant's secondary metabolites under the tea plants-soybean intercropping system and demonstrate that the intercropping system of leguminous crops is greatly potential to improve tea quality. These may provide the basis for reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizer and improve the ecosystem in tea plantations.

AB  - Inappropriate waste disposal imposes significant health risks in densely populated urban environments and schools, necessitating sustainable waste management. Therefore, a study was carried out at Al-Jazaer School, Kuwait, to evaluate rotary drum composting (RDC) of organic school waste comprising used paper, dry leaves, and vegetable food wastes in a 1:4:20 ratio. Feedstock comprising 42% organic school wastes, 42% horse manure, and 16% sawdust produced mature compost with a C:N ratio of 20.55 on the 43rd day of composting. Distinct mesophilic, thermophilic, cooling, and curing phases were observed during composting. Mature compost recorded a moisture content of 54.3%, pH 8.56, EC of 2.71 mS/cm, total nitrogen of 0.77%, total organic carbon of 18.25%, carbon content of 15.86%, and sulfur content of 0.14%. Soilless growing media comprising peat moss, perlite, and rotary drum compost in three proportions (1:1:1, 1:1:2, and 1:1:3), and peat moss, perlite, and commercial organic compost in a 1:1:3 ratio were evaluated for greenhouse vegetable production. The performance of cucumbers (Cucumis sativus cv. Ramos) raised in the lowest proportion of in-house prepared rotary drum compost (1:1:1 ratio) was comparable with that raised in the highest proportion of commercial compost (1:1:3). The study revealed the potential of RDC for decentralized sustainable waste management at the small-community scale and the suitability of compost from school wastes for soilless culture.

AB  - Anaerobic co -digestion (ACoD) of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) appears to be an efficient approach for biomethane production. This study conducted ACoD of yard waste (YW), food waste (FW), and pig slurry at varying percentages of YW, and the corresponding evolution of microbial community structure was observed. The results demonstrated that methane productivity increased with decreasing YW content. After 45 days, the system with 20%YW feedstock had the highest productivity with a maximum cumulative methane yield of 368.6 +/- 21.6 mL/gVS. Interestingly, our findings revealed important cellulose -degrading bacteria like Ruminofilibacter, Pantoea, and Blvii28 wastewater -sludge group, along with acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methane producers like Methanosaeta and Methanoculleus, respectively. The microbial community profile is a potential guideline for microbial enrichment to produce high -efficiency inoculum for biomethane production from yard, agriculture, and livestock waste.

AB  - In the western part of Gujarat, many farmers depend heavily on groundwater to grow their crops. They often use informal pump irrigation services, which help small and marginal farmers access water for their fields. This system has had positive effects, making water more fair, efficient, and sustainable, especially in regions like Gujarat where water is plentiful. However, in this type of economy, where pumps are crucial, energy and irrigation go hand in hand, forming what is known as the "energy-irrigation" nexus. Farmers mainly use electricity or diesel to power their pumps. Currently, most discussions focus on the link between electricity and irrigation. High electricity prices encourage the creation of water markets, benefiting small farmers. But because many rural areas lack electricity, farmers often rely on diesel, which has become more expensive, leading to a shortage of groundwater. This has hurt crop production and farmers' incomes. To address this, it is important to quickly bring electricity to rural areas and maintain affordable electricity rates. This would help support water markets and ensure small farmers can continue irrigating their fields. In Gujarat, using groundwater for farming has increased food production but caused problems by depleting water and polluting the environment. This study looked at pollution from groundwater farming in Gujarat, focusing on crops like mangoes, cotton, wheat, millet, and green gram. Results showed cotton emits the most CO2 due to heavy water needs, followed by mangoes and wheat. Declining groundwater levels have led to more energy use and CO2 emissions. Overexploitation of aquifers and changes in weather patterns has worsened water shortages in Gujarat. This affects food and freshwater security. This study was undertaken to assess the CO2 emission from groundwater irrigation in agriculturally dominant blocks (crops), which are Jalal pore (mango, banana), Valia (cotton), chital (cotton), Kodinur (wheat, millet, and green gram), and Sutra pada (wheat) of Gujarat in India. Groundwater depletion in India remains one of the most critical issues related to future food and freshwater security and has also influenced sustainable development goals (SDG 6, SDG 13). This study indicates that the CO2 emission from groundwater irrigation for the baseline scenario is the highest for cotton (17 MT of CO2) followed by mango (9 MT of CO2/ha/m), and wheat (8.4 MT of CO2). Higher CO2 emissions from cotton, rice, and wheat are due to more area under these crops as well as the huge extraction of groundwater. By improving the pump set and irrigation efficiencies together up to the achievable level, CO2 emissions can be reduced up to a certain amount for crops.

AB  - While diet is known to regulate the composition, function, and diversity of the human gut microbiome, its effects on wildlife remain understudied. Here, noninvasive sampling methods were first used to conduct metagenomic analyses of the gut microbiomes of 10 protected wild animals in the Wolong Nature Reserve. There were significant differences in microbiota composition and function between herbivores and carnivores. Herbivores exhibited higher microbial diversity and evenness (Shannon and Pielou indices), with Bacillota and Acinetobacter predominating, whereas carnivores were enriched in Pseudomonadota and Escherichia. Cellulose-degrading bacterium Ruminococcus champanellensis was abundant in herbivores, while Rhodococcus and Pediococcus, which were associated with toxin degradation and pathogen inhibition, were more prevalent in carnivores. Carnivores showed higher lipid metabolism and protein degradation, as evidenced by the enrichment of leucyl aminopeptidase and oligopeptidase B, while herbivores demonstrated superior cellulose and starch digestion, characterized by the enrichment of cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase. Stochastic processes shaped gut microbiome assembly, especially in herbivores. Potential health risks from pathogens such as Escherichia and Listeria were identified, and Escherichia abundance was positively correlated with niche width. Furthermore, the findings suggest that high-altitude environments may promote the persistence and spread of pathogens. Overall, our findings underscore the intricate linkages between diet, gut microbiota composition, assembly processes, and host ecology in protected wildlife, address a key knowledge gap, and provide important theoretical and practical insights for ecological conservation, species restoration, and environmental management.

AB  - The nutritional composition and in vitro gas production of barley and triticale forages at tillering, stem elongation, and ear emergence stages were studied. The mean crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content was higher in barley than triticale. The supplementation of wheat grain in in vitro incubation had no effect on the gas production of barley and triticale forage. The nutritive value of barley and triticale forages is highly influenced by growth stage and is high during the early stage of growth during tillering and stem elongation. Barley and triticale forages have potential as feed for dairy goats and although barley had a higher CP content, both have adequate ME and CP levels to meet the nutritional requirements of adult goats with 50 kg body weight in early lactation.

AB  - Due to the loss of wetlands, land-use change, and confrontations with humans, the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) is one of the largest land mammals currently threatened and classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The common hippo is found in protected and unprotected habitats, marshes, and inland major rivers of Ethiopia. However, little is known about the population status of hippos in the country. Hence, this study aimed to reveal the current population size of hippos and its conflicts with sugarcane plantation in Arjo-Dhidhessa Sugar Factory. Data on population size, diet composition, and potential hippo conflicts was also collected from August 2020 to February 2021. The complete on-foot count method was used to estimate the hippo population during the wet and dry seasons. The backtracking approach was used to determine the hippo's diet, which involved identifying and quantifying foraged species using quadrats. The total sugarcane stalk damage was counted in the sampled fields to determine sugarcane damage. Direct observation and interviews with sugarcane guards were used to identify mitigation methods employed to prevent hippo attacks. During the wet and dry seasons, a total of 96 and 182 hippos were documented in the upper Dhidhessa River, respectively. Hippos ate 23 plant species from 11 different families. The Poaceae family made up 51.32% of the hippo's diet. During the wet and dry seasons, a total of 662 (36.5%) and 1156 (63.5%) sugarcane stalks/ha were damaged, respectively. The best mitigation techniques against hippo assaults in the area were guarding, fencing, trenching, and burning fire. A sound conservation action plan for hippos along the Dhidhessa River and associated banks must be developed. Furthermore, while hippos are encircled by the Arjo-Dhidhessa sugarcane irrigation scheme, modern mitigation measures and corridors for hippos should be implemented.

AB  - In order to harmonize carcass grading, it was necessary to make sure that all methods used in the EU for assessing lean meat content give the same result when dissecting the same carcass. Research was conducted to establish the influence of the changes to the testing method introduced by the EU in 2018 on the meatiness value of pig carcasses. A question arose about whether this system would affect the results and, thus, change the lean meat content of domestic fattening pigs compared to the regression equations that are currently valid. In this study, the CGM-Sydel device was used. It was found that the form of the regression equation was not significantly affected by the new test procedure because the obtained SF (scaling factor), being equal to 0.89, was the same as the one used earlier by EU regulations. The change in the form of the regression equation was affected by the increase in the meatiness level of pig carcasses and their weight in the period from 2011 to 2023 in Poland. The implementation of the new equation for the CGM-device caused of the level of meatiness to be 0.58 pp.

AB  - Hierarchical N-mixture models have been suggested for abundance estimation from spatiotemporally replicated drone-based count surveys, since they allow modeling abundance of unmarked individuals while accounting for detection errors. However, it is still necessary to understand how these models perform in the wide variety of contexts and species in which drone surveys are being used. This knowledge is fundamental to plan study designs with optimal allocation of scarce resources in ecology and conservation. We conduct a simulation study to address N-mixture model (binomial and multinomial) performance and optimal survey effort allocation in different scenarios of local abundance and detectability of individuals, focusing on their application for drone-based surveys. We also investigate the benefits of using a double-observer protocol (either human or algorithm) in image review to decompose the detection process in availability and perception. Finally, we illustrate our simulation-based survey design considerations by applying them to abundance estimation of marsh deer in the Pantanal wetland (Brazil). Accuracy of abundance estimation with N-mixture models increases with local abundance in sites and especially with the availability of individuals. The optimal design requires more visits at fewer sites when the availability probability is lower, and the optimal design is more flexible as local abundance increases. Two observers checking images can increase the estimator performance even at very high perception probabilities. We quantified how much the use of a double-observer protocol in image review can reduce fieldwork effort while achieving the same accuracy. N-mixture models can deliver accurate abundance estimates from spatiotemporally replicated drone surveys in a wide variety of contexts while accounting for imperfect detection. The improvements achieved by a consciously planned design, rearranging survey efforts among sites and visits, as well as using a second observer in image review, can be crucial to detect trends when monitoring a population or to categorize a species as threatened or not.

AB  - The specific expression profile and function of circular RNA (circRNA) in follicular atresia remain largely unknown. Here, the circRNA expression profiles of granulosa cells derived from healthy follicles (HFs) and antral follicles (AFs) in buffalo were analyzed by RNA-seq, and the mechanism of a differentially expressed circRNA (DEcircRNA) circTEC regulating the granulosa cell function that affects follicular atresia was further explored. RNA-seq results showed that a total of 112 DEcircRNAs were identified. Among them, circTEC was highly expressed in HF, and its circular structure was confirmed by RNase R digestion assay, reversed PCR and Sanger sequencing. Functional experiments demonstrated that circTEC promotes the proliferation and steroid hormone synthesis of buffalo granulosa cells (bGCs), and it also inhibits their apoptosis. In-depth mechanism analysis showed that the expression level of circTEC in bGCs from AFs was adversely related to miR-144-5p and consistent with FZD3. CircTEC acts as an endogenous sponge of miR-144-5p to regulate the expression of the target gene FZD3 in AFs, which promotes the proliferation of bGCs and inhibits bGCs apoptosis, thereby inhibiting follicular atresia in buffalo. In summary, our study revealed the regulatory role of the circTEC/miR-144-5p/FZD3 axis during follicular atresia in buffalo. These results provided new insights into the biological mechanism underlying follicular atresia.

AB  - Hyalomma dromedarii is the predominant tick species parasitizing camels in Egypt which leads to mortalities in young animals that result in economic losses. It can transmit a lot of pathogens to animals and humans, such as the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, the Dhori virus, Kadam virus, Theileria annulata and spotted fever rickettsia. The continuous use of chemical acaricides has negative impact on the environment and almost led to acaricidal resistance, and hence the plant extracts represent alternative methods for controlling ticks. The present study was carried out to assess the histopathological effects on the ovary of fed female Hyalomma dromedarii following immersion in the ethanolic extract of fruits of Citrullus colocynthis (100 mg/mL). Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy observations provided evidence that Citrullus colocynthis caused extensive damage to oocytes. Destruction of the internal organelles of oocytes, along with delay and/or inhibition of vitellogenesis were demonstrated. This is the first histological study that points to damage in H. dromedarii ovaries following treatment with the ethanolic extract of fruits of C. colocynthis. The data presented suggest that the plant extract affects the ovary either directly by entering the oocytes and/or indirectly by damaging the gut cells and digestion of blood that interfere with the development of oocytes, so it can be used as a promising agent for tick control.

AB  - Tikopia Island, a small and relatively isolated Polynesian Outlier in the Southeast Solomon Islands, supports a remarkably dense human population with minimal external support. Examining long-term trends in human land use on Tikopia through archaeological datasets spanning nearly 3000 years presents an opportunity to investigate pathways to long-term sustainability in a tropical island setting. Here, we trace nutrient dynamics across Tikopia's three pre-European contact phases (Kiki, Sinapupu, Tuakamali) via stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of commensal Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) and domestic pig (Sus scrofa) bone and tooth dentine collagen. Our results show a decline in delta N-15 values from the Kiki (c. 800 BC-AD 100) to Sinapupu (c. AD 100-1200) phases, consistent with long-term commensal isotope trends observed on other Polynesian islands. However, increased delta N-15 coupled with lower delta C-13 values in the Tuakamali Phase (c. AD 1200-1800) point to a later nutrient rejuvenation, likely tied to dramatic transformations in agriculture and land use at the Sinapupu-Tuakamali transition. This study offers new, quantifiable evidence for deep-time land and resource management decisions on Tikopia and subsequent impacts on island nutrient status and long-term sustainability.

AB  - Simple Summary Knowledge about animal welfare-based lighting in pig farms is very limited, as there is little research on this topic. Legal requirements are often not scientifically supported and differ greatly among countries. However, negative effects of uncontrolled lighting on pig health and behaviour are known. In this study, the influence of different illuminance levels on the preference behaviour of pigs was determined. Piglets were given a free choice between two illuminance levels. We found that over time piglets preferred darker pen compartments to lie down and brightly lit ones to move around and defaecate. This knowledge could be used for future farm husbandry design and promotes the natural behaviour of pigs, thus reducing stress and promoting animal welfare. Little is known on the effect of light on pig behaviour. The choice behaviour of weaned piglets kept under two different light-emitting diode (LED) illuminance levels was investigated: 32 piglets (in two batches) were housed in a preference test room composed of two identical double pen units. One side of the pen unit was permanently illuminated with 600 lux, while the other was darkened to almost 0 lux (~0 lx); by using a passageway, piglets could move between the two sides. The "lying", "eating" and "activity" behaviours were evaluated during three days in the first, third and fifth experimental week based on video recordings and a 5-min time sampling method. At first, piglets preferred to stay in the 600 lux illuminated compartments. Then, this preference decreased for the "eating" and "activity" behaviours and reversed for the "lying" behaviour, with the darkened compartments being preferred. The results also show that pen soiling was higher under 600 lux, but feed consumption was not affected by the illuminance. Since pigs choose between the two illuminance levels to perform specific behaviours, illuminance could be used to divide the pens into functional areas and, thus, help in meeting pigs' behavioural needs.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to observe the changes in soil nitrogen pools (active organic and inorganic nitrogen fractions) after applying organic materials under drip irrigation with film mulching in a semi-arid soil. The two-year field experiment included four fertilization treatments: maize straw, fodder grass, sheep manure, and a control treatment with no organic material applied (CK). The results showed that the application of maize straw and sheep manure significantly increased the soil total nitrogen content by 9.02 similar to 13.33% and 11.02 similar to 17.27%, respectively, while no significant improvement was found with the use of fodder grass. Compared with CK, returning organic materials to the field increased the soil active nitrogen pools, except for ammonium nitrogen content. Meanwhile, the content of particulate organic nitrogen was significantly increased by 42.11 similar to 78.85% under the application of organic materials, which took the highest proportion of active nitrogen pools and was sensitive to fertilization treatments. Among the three organic materials, maize straw and sheep manure increased the soil active nitrogen content the most. In conclusion, both maize straw and sheep manure are the optimum organic materials, which could be applied for improving soil nitrogen storage under drip irrigation with film mulching within semi-arid areas.

AB  - Simple Summary Leaves can only toughen after they have finished growing and, as a result, many herbivorous insects specialize in newly developing leaves because softer leaves are easier to chew. The foliage of conifer trees is particularly tough, and so one would expect conifers to invest more defensive chemicals into soft vulnerable growing needles than into tough mature ones. We summarize the literature describing how chemical defenses of foliage change during the growing season in white spruce, an economically important conifer tree. We next report measurements of the toughness of white spruce buds as they swell, burst, and grow into young needles. As expected, buds soften as they swell in spring, but after budburst, needles become tougher until they are similar to previous-year foliage in mid-summer. Leaves grown in the sun are slightly tougher than leaves grown in the shade. However, there was no indication that trees invest more in chemical defense of growing leaves than of mature leaves. Changes during leaf ontogeny affect palatability to herbivores, such that many insects, including the eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)), are specialist feeders on growing conifer leaves and buds. Developmental constraints imply lower toughness in developing foliage, and optimal defense theory predicts higher investment in chemical defense in these vulnerable yet valuable developing leaves. We summarize the literature on the time course of defensive compounds in developing white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) needles and report original research findings on the ontogeny of white spruce needle toughness. Our results show the predicted pattern of buds decreasing in toughness followed by leaves increasing in toughness during expansion, accompanied by opposite trends in water content. Toughness of mature foliage decreased slightly during the growing season, with no significant relationship with water content. Toughness of sun-grown leaves was slightly higher than that of shade-grown leaves. However, the literature review did not support the expected pattern of higher defensive compounds in expanding leaves than in mature leaves, suggesting that white spruce might instead exhibit a fast-growth low-defense strategy.

AB  - Sleep is thought to be involved in the consolidation of new memories encoded during the day, as proposed by complementary learning systems accounts of memory. Other theories suggest that sleep's role in memory is not restricted to consolidation. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that new learning is implemented in the brain through strengthening synaptic connections, a biologically costly process that gradually saturates encoding capacity during wake. During slow-wave sleep, synaptic strength is renormalized, thus restoring memory encoding ability. While the role of sleep in memory consolidation has been extensively documented, few human studies have explored the impact of sleep in restoring encoding ability, and none have looked at learning beyond episodic memory. In this registered report we test the predictions made by the complementary learning systems accounts and the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis regarding adult participants' ability to learn new words, and to integrate these words with existing knowledge. Participants took a polysomnographically-monitored daytime nap or remained awake prior to learning a set of new spoken words. Shortly after learning, and again on the following day, we measured participants' episodic memory for new words. We also assessed the degree to which newly learned words engage in competition with existing words. We predicted that sleep before encoding would result in better episodic memory for the words, and facilitate the overnight integration of new words with existing words. Based on existing literature and theory we further predicted that this restorative function is associated with slow-wave and sleep spindle activity. Our pre-registered analyses did not find a significant benefit of napping prior to encoding on word learning or integration. Exploratory analyses using a more sensitive measure of recall accuracy demonstrated significantly better performance in the nap condition compared to the no-nap condition in the immediate test. At the delayed test there was no longer a significant benefit of the nap. Of note, we found no significant effect of slow-wave activity prior to encoding on episodic memory or integration of newly learned words into the mental lexicon. However, we found that greater levels of Stage 2 sleep spindles were significantly associated with greater improvements in lexical competition from the immediate to the delayed test. Therefore,

AB  - With the paradigm of bioculturality, ethnozoology can be considered as the conceptual and methodological framework for understanding the zoocultural heritage, in addition to the study of knowledge, worldview, and traditional practices, the tangible and intangible cultural products that arise from hu-- man-fauna interactions. To characterize the zoocultural heritage of the P'urhepecha, a bibliographic review, semi-structured interviews, and the construction of free lists were carried out. The elements of the tangible and intangible zoocultural heritage are described and analyzed; It was found that the ethnotaxaon with the greatest presence in zoocrafts, festivities, music, dance, and narrative is the deer. It is concluded that the biocultural heritage approach is adequate to study the human-fauna relationship and that the P'urhepechazoocultural heritage preserves a part of the heritage of the pre-Hispanic era, so it is pertinent to know, preserve, and disseminate.

AB  - Molecular de-extinction is an emerging field that identifies potentially useful molecules throughout evolution. Here, we computationally mine genomes, searching for molecules called defensins, which play a role in host immunity. Our approach leads to the discovery of six undescribed beta-defensins, five of which are derived from two different extinct bird species and one from a mammalian species. These organisms included an extinct moa species (Anomalopteryx didiformis) that inhabited New Zealand and the extinct Spix's macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii), which was endemic to Brazil, as well as the black rhino (Diceros bicornis minor). Evolutionary and structural analyses of the beta-defensins are performed to further characterize these molecules. This study identifies molecules from extinct organisms, revealing defensins and opening new avenues for antibiotic discovery.

AB  - The aim of the current study wat to comparatively assess the impact of different nitrogen (N) fertilization schemes on fresh pod yield and yield quality in either organically or conventionally grown common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Prior to common bean crop establishment, the experimental field site was cultivated following either organic (a) or conventional (b) farming practices with a winter non-legume crop (Brassica oleracea var. italica) (BR), or (c) with field bean (Vicia faba sp.) destined to serve as a green manure (GM) crop. At the end of the winter cultivation period the broccoli crop residues (BR) and green manure biomass (GM) were incorporated into the soil and the plots that accommodated the treatments (a) and (c) were followed by an organically cultivated common bean crop, while the conventional broccoli crop was followed by a conventionally cropped common bean crop. Additional to the plant residues (BR), sheep manure (SM) at a rate of 40 kg N ha(-1) was also applied to the organically treated common beans, while the plots with a conventionally cropped common bean received 75 kg N ha(-1). Organic common bean treated with SM + BR produced smaller pods of higher dry matter and bioactive compound content, responses that are correlated with limited soil N availability. No significant variations were observed on yield components and N levels of pods cultivated under organic (SM + GM) and conventional cropping systems. Pod sugar and starch content was not influenced by the different fertilization practices. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the combined application of SM + GM can be considered as an efficient N-fertilisation strategy for organic crops of common bean, benefiting their nutritional value without compromising yield.

AB  - Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an effective remote sensing approach for sampling acoustically active animal species and is particularly useful for elusive, visually cryptic species inhabiting remote or inaccessible habitats. Key advantages of PAM are large spatial coverage and continuous, long-term monitoring. In most cases, a signal detection algorithm is utilized to locate sounds of interest within long sequences of audio data. It is important to understand the demographic/contextual usage of call types when choosing a particular signal to use for detection. Sampling biases may result if sampling is restricted to subsets of the population, for example, when detectable vocalizations are produced only by a certain demographic class. Using the African forest elephant repertoire as a case study, we test for differences in call type usage among different age-sex classes. We identified disproportionate usage by age-sex class of four call types-roars, trumpets, rumbles, and combination calls. This differential usage of signals by demographic class has implications for the use of particular call types in PAM for this species. Our results highlight that forest elephant PAM studies that have used rumbles as target signals may have under-sampled adult males. The addition of other call types to PAM frameworks may be useful to leverage additional population demographic information from these surveys. Our research exemplifies how an examination of a species' acoustic behavior can be used to better contextualize the data and results from PAM and to strengthen the resulting inference.

AB  - Food availability and climate represent environmental factors that affect species' social behavior, ranging patterns, diet, and activity budget. From August 2012 to September 2013, we examined the effects of seasonal changes in food availability, temperature, and rainfall on the diet and behavioral ecology of Shortridge's langur (Trachypithecus shortridgei) an Endangered primate species inhabiting moist evergreen broadleaf forests in the Eastern Himalayas. Our field site represents the northernmost latitudinal distribution of this species. Data were collected using scan sampling at 10 min intervals, and analyzed based on generalized linear models. The results indicate that the langurs experienced two feeding peaks (9:00 and 17:00) and two traveling peaks (10:00 and 19:00) during each day. Periods of rest, mainly occurred between 10:00 and 13:00, and overnight. Feeding accounted for 38.5% of the daily activity budget, followed by resting (35%), traveling (24.5%), and socializing (2%). During periods when young leaves were most available, the langurs increased feeding time on young leaves (35% vs. 4%). During periods of maximum fruit availability, the langurs decreased total time spent feeding (36.6% vs. 40.4%), devoted more time to traveling (28.1% vs. 21%), and increased time spent consuming fruit (49.1% vs. 11.8%). During the winter, the langurs increased their consumption of mature leaves (44.5%) and reduced time spent traveling (20.2% vs. 25.4%). Overall, time spent resting was greatest in the spring (47.5%), time spent feeding was greatest during the summer (51.1%), and time spent in traveling was greatest in the autumn (33.2%). The frequency of social interactions remained relatively constant throughout the year. Foraging effort was greatest in the summer, when fruits dominated the diet. Like other species of temperate langurs, T. shortridgei devoted less time to resting, more time to feeding, and was characterized by a greater year-round foraging effort than tropical/subtropical langurs.

AB  - Simple Summary Ovine anaplasmosis is an emerging disease in Europe, able to cause relevant economic losses. This disease has great significance in tropical and subtropical areas; however, climate change has facilitated the wider spread of ovine anaplasmosis throughout Europe during the last few decades. Related to the first ovine anaplasmosis outbreak that occurred in Spain in 2014, an epidemiological study was carried out in the affected area. The results show a high presence of Anaplasma ovis in the analysed flocks, indicating the high transmissibility of the bacteria. Ovine anaplasmosis is a vector-borne disease caused by Anaplasma ovis and mainly transmitted through tick bites. In Spain, the first outbreak of ovine anaplasmosis occurred in 2014. An epidemiological study in fifty-one farms was carried out associated with this outbreak in the affected geographical area. An epidemiological questionnaire was performed. In addition, whole blood samples were taken for molecular analysis in 47 of these farms to determine the prevalence of infection of Anaplasma ovis. A. ovis was present in 44 out of 47 PCR-analysed farms (93.6%). However, only 40.4% of the studied farms showed severe clinical signs. The clinical signs affected mainly young animals, which showed severe anaemia, weakness, anorexia, cachexia and epiphora. The early culling of young animals was more frequently reported by severely affected farms than the analysed farms without clinical signs (71.4% vs. 12.5%, p < 0.001). The geographical area where the farm is located seems to be relevant for the presence of clinical signs of the disease. Ovine anaplasmosis is an emerging disease in Europe that spreads rapidly through tick bites and is capable of causing significant economic losses when it spreads in a naive area and causes an epidemic.

AB  - Mitigating human-wolf conflict is crucial, yet conventional approaches often overlook the broader socioeconomic challenges faced by farming communities. Wolves frequently become scapegoats for deeper rooted issues such as economic disadvantages, policy deficiencies, and rural depopulation. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 118 livestock farmers to examine (a) farmer profiles and wolf-related interactions, (b) professional challenges and proposed solutions, (c) reasons for perceiving wolves as a major problem, and (d) the impact of wolf presence on job dissatisfaction. Farmers reported low specialized education and job satisfaction, particularly regarding income. Many struggled to afford or find shepherds, especially sheep/goat farmers. Guardian dog poisoning incidents and dissatisfaction with the damage compensation system were prevalent. Key challenges included economic marginalization, wolf presence, climatic factors, inadequate grazing policies, infrastructure deficits, distrust in policy, rural depopulation, and a lack of services. Farmers who perceived wolves as a major problem implemented weaker preventive measures and moved herds seasonally over longer distances. Job dissatisfaction was linked to wolf presence, livestock type, and economic marginalization. Our findings emphasize that while wolves impact farmers, economic and policy-related factors play a greater role. Educational initiatives, supportive policies, effective depredation mitigation, and fair compensation systems are essential for sustainable livestock farming and coexistence with wolves. By tackling socioeconomic challenges, enhancing policies, and supporting farmers to adapt to evolving circumstances, the livestock farming sector can thrive while minimizing conflicts associated with wolves.

AB  - Macroevolutionary patterns in the association between plant species and their herbivores result from ecological divergence promoted by, among other factors, plants' defenses and nutritional quality, and herbivore adaptations. Here, we assessed the performance of the herbivores Lema trilineata daturaphila, a trophic specialist on Datura, and Spodoptera frugiperda, a polyphagous pest herbivore, when fed with species of Datura. We used comparative phylogenetics and multivariate methods to examine the effects of Datura species' tropane alkaloids, leaf trichomes, and plant macronutrients on the two herbivores & PRIME; performances (amount of food consumed, number of damaged leaves, larval biomass increment, and larval growth efficiency). The results indicate that species of Datura do vary in their general suitability as food host for the two herbivores. Overall, the specialist performs better than the generalist herbivore across Datura species, and performance of both herbivores is associated with suites of plant defenses and nutrient characteristics. Leaf trichomes and major alkaloids of the Datura species are strongly related to herbivores' food consumption and biomass increase. Although hyoscyamine better predicts the key components of the performance of the specialist herbivore, scopolamine better predicts the performance of the generalist; however, only leaf trichomes are implicated in most performance components of the two herbivores. Nutrient quality more widely predicts the performance of the generalist herbivore. The contrasting effects of plant traits and the performances of herbivores could be related to adaptive differences to cope with plant toxins and achieve nutrient balance and evolutionary trade-offs and synergisms between plant traits to deal with a diverse community of herbivores.

AB  - Simple Summary The treatment of urinary bladder dysfunction requires the knowledge of bladder function, which involves physiology, pathology, and even psychology. Several animal models are available to study a variety of bladder disorders. These models include animals from rodents, such as mice and rats, to nonhuman primates, such as rabbits, felines, canines, pigs, and mini pigs. This review adapted animal models to study bladder function according to facility, priority, and disease. The urinary bladder (UB) serves as a storage and elimination organ for urine. UB dysfunction can cause multiple symptoms of failure to store urine or empty the bladder, e.g., incontinence, frequent urination, and urinary retention. Treatment of these symptoms requires knowledge on bladder function, which involves physiology, pathology, and even psychology. There is no ideal animal model for the study of UB function to understand and treat associated disorders, as the complexity in humans differs from that of other species. However, several animal models are available to study a variety of other bladder disorders. Such models include animals from rodents to nonhuman primates, such as mice, rats, rabbits, felines, canines, pigs, and mini pigs. For incontinence, vaginal distention might mimic birth trauma and can be measured based on leak point pressure. Using peripheral and central models, inflammation, bladder outlet obstruction, and genetic models facilitated the study of overactive bladder. However, the larger the animal model, the more difficult the study is, due to the associated animal ethics issues, laboratory facility, and budget. This review aims at facilitating adapted animal models to study bladder function according to facility, priority, and disease.

AB  - Mangalore melon (Cucumis melo ssp. agrestis var. acidulus) is found in the Western Ghats of India. It is a breeding treasure for extending the shelf life of melons more than six months storability of fruits, and it is easily crossable with muskmelon. Despite these advantages, still it is remained as an underutilized vegetable crop, seldom grown in Southern India due to its subpar agronomic performance. In this study, the nutritional value and agronomic performance of the Mangalore melon cultivar sambar southe 17 (SS17) was assessed. The cultivar SS17 grown and maintained by farmers in and around Sirsi, Karnataka Province of India. The Mangalore melon cultivar SS17 is distinguished by its dark green leaves, which bears 4.1 vines on average measuring 195.9 cm long. The plants produce monoecious yellow flowers with a 9.06:1 male to female floral sex ratio. The male and female flowers begin to bloom 26.9 and 31 days after sowing, respectively. The stigma receptivity lasts in between 2 and 3 days, and anther dehiscence take place in between 7 to 9 AM. Well-pollinated flowers yield elongated fruits that weigh about 2.53 kg, the fruit have a smooth, thin peel, white or light green peel, solid, white, non-sweet, and non-aromatic flesh has little yellow seeds. Dark green foliage, which is produced by oval seeds with epigeal germination, is a distinctive feature of the Mangalore melon. The shelf life of Mangalore melon fruits is typically greater than six months and they are non-climacteric in nature. It contains high amounts of ascorbic acid (juice content: 33.75%, pulp content: 20%), carotene (0.5 mg/100 g), reducing sugar (2.46%), non-reducing sugar (3.43%), and total sugar (4.96%) with TSS (Juice: 3.38 degrees Brix, Pulp: 4.14 degrees Brix). Collection of cultivars/landraces/ecotypes by surveying, and their maintenance could aid to the genetic improvement, and breeding for sustainable and commercial production of the underutilized melons. The fundamental knowledge obtained by this work could be used to harness the genetic traits and their diversification in other melons.

AB  - Mange mites represent a serious problem in livestock farming due to their worse effect on animals health, reducing milk and meat production. The status of mange mites prevalence was unknown from the livestock present in Malakand Division, Pakistan. Hence, the present study was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors assessment of mange mites in livestock of Malakand Division, Pakistan. Villages and livestock herds were visited for data collection and sampling for one year from September 2017 to August 2018. The diagnosis of mange infestation was carried out from skin scrapings collected from symptomatic animals. A total of 1437 animals were screened (240 sheep, 658 cows, 340 buffalos, 199 goats) from selected localities of the Malakand Division. The overall prevalence was 2.37%, with the highest prevalence in buffalos (5.0%) and lowest (0.42%) in sheep (p < 0.05). The locality also significantly affect the prevalence of mange mites in livestock, with a higher percentage (8.14%) in the Ouch area. The prevalence was higher in winter (3.78%) than in summer (1.07%). The prevalence was high (p < 0.05) in young animals ( 1 year) (4.7%) as compared to adults ( 0.05). Herd size of less than ten animals had a significantly high prevalence rate (3.69%) compared to 10 animals (1.89%). Animals having an infection history >15 days infected more than animals having infection history <15 days. This study documented for the first-time epidemiology of mange mites in livestock of Malakand Division, Pakistan. Further studies involving molecular characterization of mange mites will increase our understanding on the spread of mange mites in Malakand Division livestock. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Radiocarbon dating of woolly mammoth remains from the Minusinsk Depression allows for the patterns of its distribution in southern Siberia in the Late Pleistocene to be specified. In the south of Siberia, mammoths are shown to have been most abundant in cold periods, the species having reached its maximum abundance in LGM. So far, there is no single mammoth record that would confidently refer to the warm time interval. During the warm intervals of the Late Pleistocene, the environment in southern Siberia could possibly have not favorable for the permanent habitation of the species Mammuthus primigenius. In general, the mammoths from the Minusinsk Depression retain species-specific features of the content of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in bone collagen compared to other large herbivores. They show the highest delta N-15 values with the lowest delta C-13, vs reindeer that, on the contrary, demonstrate the lowest delta N-15 values and a high delta C-13. The isotopic signal of other herbivorous mammal species lies between the values of mammoths and reindeer. A comparison of the obtained data on carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of the woolly mammoth remains from the Minusinsk Depression with similar parameters in animals from the north of eastern Siberia reveals significant differences. One of the possible reasons may lie in differences in the diet of animals of the Minusinsk Depression from mammoths of other populations. However, similar trends, i.e. a relatively lower delta N-15 and higher delta C-13 content in the Late Pleistocene, are characteristic of both reindeer and woolly rhinoceroses of the Minusinsk Depression. This suggests that the differences in the carbon and nitrogen isotope composition in the Minusinsk Depression mammoths from those from the northern territories are due not only to the type of food, but also to a slightly different isotopic background of the region, associated with the local environment.

AB  - Background and Research Aims Forest loss and fragmentation have a negative impact on large-sized predators and prey, whose populations are reduced or extirpated locally. We explored the spatiotemporal coexistence of the mesopredators (< 15 kg) coyote, ocelot, and white-nosed coati, with their potential prey (< 15 kg) Mexican agouti, lowland paca, and collared peccary in a defaunated rainforest. Methods We used two-species occupancy-detection models between mesopredators and their potential prey, overlap index of circular models, and latency time measurements to evaluate temporal and spatial segregation and habitat use of species. Results Presence of ocelot and coyote was influenced by an increase in the detectability and occupancy of the Mexican agouti. Among most mesopredator-prey species pairs, the correlation for both the capture rates at camera-trap stations and the 1-hr intervals were mainly moderate or low. Some mesopredator-prey species pairs showed low or inverse correlations suggesting species avoidance. The Mexican agouti exhibited a significant negative correlation with the presence of mesopredators. The coyote and ocelot showed a positive correlation with their use of low use trails by people. Conclusions Spatiotemporal tolerance was observed among mesopredator omnivores and prey herbivores. High temporal overlap of ocelots and potential prey (lowland paca) was observed compared to other tropical forests holding large-sized predators, suggesting behavioral shifts for increasing mesopredator-prey encounters. Furthermore, mesopredator coexistence was mediated by a displacement in the temporal peaks of activity and spatial segregation among species. Implications for Conservation Defaunated tropical forests need protection to ensure the conservation of remaining species and their ecological interactions.

AB  - Although crop leaf traits associated with acquisitive life strategies might largely be the result of inherence from their wild progenitors, more research is still needed to understand the roles that genotype and environment play in their expression. Given their importance for regulating photosynthesis and protecting plants from herbivores, it is surprising that only a handful of investigations have systematically explored how crop selection history influenced leaf evolution. Hence, we examined the direct and interactive effects of crop domestication and nitrogen (N) fertilization on leaf functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, relative chlorophyll content, and trichome density at leaf edges) across three Mexican crops. Overall, leaf traits were directly and interactively influenced by both genotype and environment. Specifically, we found that multiple acquisitive traits on domesticated phenotypes are either the direct plastic response to soil N availability or the result of an interaction between crop domestication and mineral fertilization (rather than solely arising as an evolutionary consequence of domestication itself). Moreover, it appears that crop domestication has impacted the capacity of plants to respond to N fertilization, likely due to alterations in phenotypic plasticity. Thus, our results will not only contribute to the growing literature of crop evolution, but demonstrate how domesticated plants may have adapted to agroecosystems via fundamental genotype-environment interactions.
   Aunque los caracteres de hojas asociados con estrategias de vida adquisitivas en cultivos podr & iacute;an ser en gran medida herencia de sus progenitores silvestres, se necesita m & aacute;s investigaci & oacute;n para comprender el papel que desempe & ntilde;an el genotipo y el ambiente en su expresi & oacute;n. Dada su importancia en la regulaci & oacute;n de la fotos & iacute;ntesis y en la protecci & oacute;n contra herb & iacute;voros, es sorprendente que solo unos pocos estudios hayan explorado sistem & aacute;ticamente c & oacute;mo las historias de selecci & oacute;n en plantas han influenciado la evoluci & oacute;n de hojas. Por ende, nosotros examinamos los efectos directos e interactivos de la domesticaci & oacute;n de cultivos y la fertilizaci & oacute;n con nitr & oacute;geno (N) en caracteres foliares funcionales (& aacute;rea foliar, & aacute;rea foliar espec & iacute;fica, contenido relativo de clorofila y densidad de tricomas en bordes de hojas) de tres cultivos mexicanos. En general, los caracteres de hojas estuvieron influenciados directa e interactivamente tanto por el genotipo como por el medio ambiente. Espec & iacute;ficamente, encontramos que m & uacute;ltiples rasgos adquisitivos en los fenotipos domesticados son, o bien una respuesta pl & aacute;stica directa a la disponibilidad de N en el suelo, o el resultado de una interacci & oacute;n entre la domesticaci & oacute;n de cultivos y la fertilizaci & oacute;n mineral (en lugar de surgir & uacute;nicamente como una consecuencia evolutiva del proceso de domesticaci & oacute;n en s & iacute;). Adem & aacute;s, aparenta que la domesticaci & oacute;n de cultivos ha impactado la capacidad de las plantas para responder a la fertilizaci & oacute;n con N, probablemente debido a alteraciones en la plasticidad fenot & iacute;pica. Por lo tanto, nuestros resultados no solo contribuir & aacute;n a la creciente literatura acerca de la evoluci & oacute;n de cultivos, sino que tambi & eacute;n demuestran c & oacute;mo las plantas domesticadas pudieron haberse adaptado a los agroecosistemas a trav & eacute;s de interacciones claves entre genotipo y ambiente.

AB  - Simple Summary Objectives: The goal of this study was to reveal the gut microbiota of pigs and chickens in central China and the dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes carried by microorganisms. Methods: Free range and factory-farmed Gushi chickens and Huainan pigs were divided into eight groups. Faecal samples were collected from each group, and the metagenomic sequencing method was used to detect each group of samples. Results: The resistance genes showed the following trend, from high to low relative abundance: tetW was the highest, followed by tetW/N/W, then lnuA; and others from high to low were mdtB, lnuC, ANT6-la, ErmB, mdtC, ErmQ, tetBP, vatE, evgS, acrB, cpxA, mefA, Escherichia coli-ampC, tetL, yojl, AcrF and mdtA. Conclusions: All groups administered enrofloxacin and oregano oil did not develop a drug-resistant phenotype during the 5-day treatment period, as grouped in this trial. In 2022, after Announcement No. 194 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in China, the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trend declined, but it did not fundamentally change, presumably due to the impact of environmental pollution caused by the long-term use of antimicrobials. Background: Basic data concerning the gut microbiota of the main animal husbandry breeds (pigs and chickens) are scarce in China. The dynamics of gut microbiota (pigs and chickens) in China and antibiotic resistance genes carried by microorganisms in the natural environment are unknown. Methods: Free range and factory-farmed Gushi chickens and Huainan pigs were divided into eight groups. Faecal samples were collected from each group, and the metagenomic sequencing method was used to detect each group of samples. Results: The resistance genes showed the following trend, from high to low relative abundance: tetW was the highest, followed by tetW/N/W, then lnuA; and others from high to low were mdtB, lnuC, ANT6-la, ErmB, mdtC, ErmQ, tetBP, vatE, evgS, acrB, cpxA, mefA, Escherichia coli-ampC, tetL, yojl, AcrF and mdtA.

AB  - Zoophytophagous predators can induce plant defence responses through phytophagous feeding. Since the zoophytophagous bug Orius sauteri lays eggs into plant tissues, we hypothesised that its oviposition behaviour may also induce plant defence responses with a negative impact on subsequent herbivore attacks. Pre-inoculation of O. sauteri females on tomato plants significantly reduced the fitness and reproduction of Frankliniella occidentalis, which also preferred the non-inoculated plants in indoor micro-environments. In the field, O. sauteri pre-inoculation also caused reduced population growth of F. occidentalis. All these tendencies were weaker with male compared to female O. sauteri pre-inoculation. Next, a transcriptome analysis showed that the MAPK signalling pathway, the plant hormone signal transduction and plant-pathogen interaction of defence-related pathways were significantly enriched in plants inoculated with O. sauteri females compared to untreated plants. We showed that three key genes of the JA pathway, allene oxide synthase (AOS), jasmonate ZIM-domain 2 (JAZ2), and proteinase inhibitor 1 (PI-1), were upregulated. This is evidence of plant defence activation, the likely mechanism by which O. sauteri pre-inoculation (through feeding and oviposition activities) reduced F. occidentalis fitness in the laboratory and population densities by almost three times in a greenhouse experiment. This mechanism could be promoted in IPM strategies through the early introduction of zoophytophagous biocontrol agents activating crop plant defences to enhance biological pest control.

AB  - Conventional pigs are typically raised under intensive conditions, which often do not meet pigs' basic needs regarding behavioural expression and cognitive challenge, likely threatening their welfare. Thus, enabling the experience of positive affective states and, consequently, positive welfare should be encouraged. We investigated the potential of salivary oxytocin (sOXT) and eye (i.e., lachrymal caruncle region) temperature measured by infrared thermography as indicators of environmental enrichment material valuing in 32 conventional Yorkshire x Landrace pigs (110-day-old, mean +/- SD body weight: 80.9 +/- 7.6 kg/pig) housed in 8 identical pens (3 female and 1 castrated male/pen; 3.3 m2/pig). 2 /pig). Pigs were subjected to two contexts/days: fulfilment of expectation for fresh straw (i.e., delivery of 200 g of fresh straw/pig) and violation of expectation (i.e., no straw delivered). Additionally, based on footage of individual pigs from-30 min to +30 min relative to the moment when an experimenter left the pen after straw had been delivered or not (reference moment), we labelled behaviours more extensively investigated as measures of affective states (body posture; locomotor-rotational play, LOC; social play, SOC; aggression; tail motion; tail posture; tail tip lateralisation). Individual saliva samples were collected at-10 min and +20 min for analysis of sOXT and cortisol (sCORT), and individual thermograms were recorded at-10 min,-5 min and +10 min relative to the reference moment. Pigs tended to move their tail more often and tended to display more aggressions following straw provision. Furthermore, pigs displayed more playful events after the reference moment than before this event, irrespective of straw availability. However, pigs were mostly inactive (i.e., sitting or lying down) across contexts and no clear behavioural differences between contexts were detected. Similarly, we found no clear differences in sCORT concentrations between contexts. Alternatively, eye caruncle temperature and sOXT concentrations were higher on days when straw was provided. Our results suggest that salivary oxytocin and lachrymal caruncle temperature can be useful non-invasive tools to detect short-term responses to non-social stimuli in fattening pigs. Further research is needed and this study supports continuous development and validation of measures of affective state in domesticated animals.

AB  - Manure production and its management in the livestock sector have been increasingly receiving global attention due to its contribution to generating greenhouse gases, especially methane (CH4). This study was conducted to quantify and characterize daily manure including its moisture, dry matter (DM), ash, volatile solid (VS) contents, and model CH4 production rate as a function of feed intake and mass of pigs. Two statistical (multiple linear regression and polynomial regression) and three machine learning algorithms (ridge regression, random forest regression, and artificial neural network) were employed to predict CH4 emission. The result showed body mass ranged from 60 to 90 kg pig produced around 4.78 kg of manure per day consisting of 67% moisture content and 33% DM. The manure's ash content was 28% DM (0.45 kg pig(-1) day(-1)), while the VS was 72% DM (1.21 kg pig(-1) day(-1)). Moreover, the average CH4 production rate was estimated as 0.018 kg pig(-1) day(-1) which was lower than IPCC's (2006) recommended value for Oceania, Western Europe, and even North America regions. The current study found that the performance of the ridge regression was comparatively better, where the model with a coefficient of determination (R-2) greater than 90% was suitable for describing the relationship between the explanatory (feed intake and mass of pigs) and the response (CH4 emissions) variables. Further research may be conducted to improve this model's prediction accuracy, providing a wider range of diets and management conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary Rice is often attacked by several herbivores and plant pathogens at the same time. Public research has mainly focused on enhancing rice resistance against these biotic stresses by selecting rice lines with resistance genes during breeding programs. However, rice resistance to biotic stresses is also affected by soil nutrients, including available nitrogen and silicon. Nitrogen tends to reduce resistance, but silicon can increase resistance. We assessed the effects of combining soil silicon with host plant resistance against rice planthoppers, blast disease, and bacterial blight disease. We used pure silicon (SiO2) to avoid the confounding effects of nutrients associated with silicates. We also assessed the effects of nitrogenous fertilizer on silicon-augmented resistance to planthoppers. We found that high nitrogen diminishes the capacity of soil silicon and host resistance to reduce planthopper fitness (i.e., nitrogen was antagonistic); but that silicon counters nitrogen-related reductions in rice antixenosis defenses (e.g., repellency) against gravid female planthoppers (i.e., an additive effect of silicon and resistance). Silicon augmented resistance against blast and bacterial blight, but the effects were most apparent on susceptible varieties. Plants infected with bacterial blight generally grew larger in silicon amended soils. We discuss how silicon improves seedling quality by augmenting broad-spectrum resistance. Soil silicon enhances rice defenses against a range of biotic stresses. However, the magnitude of these effects can depend on the nature of the rice variety. We conducted a series of greenhouse experiments to examine the effects of silicon on planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens [BPH] and Sogatella furcifera [WBPH]), a leafhopper (Nephotettix virescens [GLH]), blast disease (Magnaporthe grisea) and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae) in susceptible and resistant rice. We added powdered silica gel (SiO2) to paddy soil at equivalent to 0.25, 1.0, and 4.0 t ha(-1). Added silicon reduced BPH nymph settling, but the effect was negligible under high nitrogen. In a choice experiment, BPH egg-laying was lower than untreated controls under all silicon treatments regardless of nitrogen or variety, whereas, in a no-choice experiment, silicon reduced egg-laying on the susceptible but not the resistant (BPH32 gene) variety. Stronger effects in choice experiments suggest that silicon mainly enhanced antixenosis defenses. We found no effects of silicon on WBPH or GLH. Silicon reduced blast damage to susceptible and resistant (Piz, Piz-5 and Pi9 genes) rice. Silicon reduced damage from a virulent strain of bacterial blight but had little effect on a less virulent strain in susceptible and resistant (Xa4, Xa7 and Xa4 + Xa7 genes) varieties. When combined with resistance, silicon had an additive effect in reducing biomass losses to plants infested with bacterial blight (resistance up to 50%; silicon 20%). We discuss how silicon-containing soil amendments can be combined with host resistance to reduce biotic stresses in rice.

AB  - Active immunization is a process by which na & iuml;ve termites receive sublethal doses of pathogenic spores from infected termites through social contact to enhance their immune responses; this process significantly diminishes the termite biocontrol effect of commercial entomopathogenic products, such as Metarhizium anisopliae. We found that the expression of selenium-binding protein (SeBP) was significantly increased by active immunization of the nestmates of fungus-contaminated termites, suggesting a close relationship between SeBP and active immunization in termites. To elucidate this relationship, we used the fungus M. anisopliae to contaminate the termite Reticulitermes chinensis and then measured the changes in the grooming behavior, antifungal activity, immune gene expression and survival of the double-stranded SeBP (dsSeBP)-injected nestmates of these fungus contaminated termites. Our results showed that there was no significant change in the grooming behavior of the dsSeBP-injected nestmates of the fungus-contaminated termites, but the antifungal activity and expression of the immune gene Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein 2 (GNBP2) were significantly reduced. Moreover, the survival of the dsSeBP-injected nestmates of the fungus-contaminated termites was significantly decreased. These findings showed that SeBP knockdown disrupted the active immunization of R. chinensis and improved the lethal effect of M. anisopliae, which suggested that enhancing immune dysregulation by targeting SeBP was a sound strategy for the biological control of termites.

AB  - Sustainability and recycling of agricultural and animal husbandry waste are important. Pig manure contains relatively high concentrations of organic matter, such as nitrate-nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and phosphate, and a direct discharge can cause environmental pollution. This study successfully culturing four brackish water microalgae, including Tetraselmis chuii, Isochrysis galbana, Chlorella vulgaris, and Proteomonas sulcata, by using a diluted digestate solution of pig manure (NH3 concentration is lower than 10 mg/L). These microalgae can reach their highest cell concentration within 3-7 days of cultivation. The small microalgae, C. vulgaris and I. galbana, reached a cell density of 2.5 x 107 and 1.5 x 107, respectively, whereas lower cell densities were documented for large microalgae T. chuii (1.4 x 106) and P. sulcata (1.6 x 106). Our findings highlight the feasibility of sustainable treatment of animal manure using brackish water microalgae. These results provide opportunities to reduce freshwater usage and environmental pollutions, and support microalgae production for further aquaculture application.

AB  - The post-mortem changes that take place during the decomposition of corpses are extremely complex and have been the subject of considerable research because of their obvious importance to forensic scientists. Considerable advances have been made in understanding the interplay of the various factors that influence decay, and the timescales over which they operate. Similarly, changes to the chemistry and microstructure of bones, post-skeletonisation, are of intense interest to archaeological scientists and the past few decades has seen tremen-dous advances in our understanding of how post-burial diagenesis may impact endogenous evidence within ancient and fossil bones. In recent years it has been postulated that the early stages of putrefaction of a body have a profound effect on the microstructure of bones and that these changes persist over archaeological timescales. One of the most important mechanisms for post-depositional degradation of bones is bacterial bioerosion. The question of the origin of the bacteria responsible, and why some archaeological bones are bioeroded while others are not, has received considerable attention in recent years. The assertion by some that the bacteria originate in the gut, and infiltrate bone tissues via the vascular network during the putrefactive stages of decay, has led to a number of claims as to what can be inferred by the presence, or absence, of bacterial tunnelling in bones. These claims include evidence for human mummification, identification of stillborns and infanticide, and animal sacrifices. Here we present evidence from SEM histological examinations of bones from field experiments using intact pig carcasses interred in brick lined tombs; a forensic case of a body exposed on a concrete floor for ten years; together with de-fleshed bones from freshly slaughtered cows buried in tropical soils for 1-10 years. None of the decomposing pig carcasses, nor the human corpse, showed any signs of bacterial tunnelling in their bones. By contrast, the de-fleshed bones buried directly in soils showed evidence of tunnelling after only one year and considerable tunnelling after ten years. Our results cannot support the "enteric hypothesis" that the bone tunnelling microorganisms that degrade buried bones originate in the gut microbiota but rather suggest that gut bacteria play no role in the post-mortem degradation of buried bones. It therefore follows that no conclusions about post-mortem treatment of human or animal corpses can be deduced from the presence, or absence, of microbial tunnelling in skeletonised remains from an archaeological (or forensic) context.

AB  - Upon parasitism, many parasitoids inject symbiotic viruses and venom into their host. Thereby, they modify the hosts physiology including its saliva composition and, in turn, plant perception of herbivory. It has been hypothesised that parasitoids manipulate plant responses to increase their host performance and maximise their own fitness. However, it is still unclear whether parasitoids are under selective pressure to increase plant quality or whether indirect changes in plants due to parasitism are a by-product of the physiological changes induced in their host. We tested whether the parasitoids Hyposoter ebeninus and Cotesia glomerata manipulate induced plant responses through the host Pieris brassicae caterpillars to increase their own performance. During their entire lifespan, parasitised herbivores were fed with leaf material of Brassica oleracea plants that were left untreated or continuously exposed to feeding by either unparasitised, conspecific or heterospecific parasitised caterpillars. We measured the development time, weight, clutch size and mortality of parasitoids that emerged from caterpillars as proxy for their performance. Both parasitoid species did not perform significantly better when their host was fed with leaves from plants continuously induced by a conspecific parasitoid relative to unparasitised caterpillars. However, parasitoid species asymmetrically affected each other's performance through plant-mediated interactions. Our results do not support the hypothesis of parasitoids manipulating plant responses for their own benefit, suggesting that indirect plant-mediated interactions among parasitoids may be a by-product of host manipulation. However, our work confirms the significance of parasitoid-induced plant-mediated interactions in insect communities that to date are still understudied.

AB  - Sub-estrus buffaloes do not exhibit estrus signs despite being cyclic contributing to extended service periods and inter-calving intervals causing significant economic loss. The present study described the effect of synthetic prostaglandin (PGF(2 alpha)) on estrus behaviour, follicular and luteal morphometry, and serum estradiol (E-2) and progesterone (P-4) profile in sub-estrus buffaloes during the non-breeding season. The incidence of sub-estrus was 38.4% during the non-breeding season. The sub-estrus buffaloes (n = 33) were divided into two groups, viz., Control (n = 16) and PGF(2 alpha) treatment (Inj. Cloprostenol 500 mu g, i.m., n = 17). Estrus induction response was significantly greater in the treatment (100 vs. 18.75%, p < .001), and a relatively greater proportion of animals conceived in the treatment group (29.41 vs. 6.25%, p = .08). The time elapsed to induction of estrus and insemination following treatment was significantly lower in the treatment group than control. A significant increment in the follicle diameter (9.72 +/- 0.45 vs. 13.00 +/- 0.45 mm, P < .0001) and serum estradiol (E-2) concentration (66.01 +/- 11.92 vs. 104.9 +/- 13.21 pg/mL, p = .003) observed at the post-treatment period in the PGF(2 alpha) treatment group. At the same time, CL diameter was reduced significantly at a higher regression rate in the PGF(2 alpha) treated buffaloes than those of control. Of the responded buffaloes, only 30% showed high-intensity estrus attributed to the expulsion of cervico-vaginal mucus (CVM), uterine tonicity, micturition, and mounting response by a teaser bull. From this study, it can be concluded that the administration of PGF(2 alpha) could induce estrus in the sub-estrus buffaloes during the non-breeding season. Behavioural changes, along with sonographic observation of POF, regressing CL, and serum E-2 and P-4 concentration would be useful to determine the right time of insemination in sub-estrus buffaloes during non-breeding season.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of nicotinamide (NAM) applied to diets with different crude protein levels on immune function, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal flora in growing-finishing pigs. Forty barrows (37.0 +/- 1.0 kg) were randomly allocated to one of four dietary treatments (n = 10 per group). The diets in the two phases consisted of a basal diet with 30 mg/kg NAM, a basal diet with 360 mg/kg NAM, a low-protein diet with 30 mg/kg NAM, and a low-protein diet with 360 mg/kg NAM. The results showed that dietary addition of 360 mg/kg NAM decreased IL-12, malondialdehyde, IgG and IgM contents in the plasma and increased total superoxide dismutase activity and total antioxidant capacity in the colonic mucosa ( P < .05). Supplementing the diet with 360 mg/kg NAM increased mRNA expression of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and protein expression of nuclear factor kappa-B and toll-like receptor 4 in the colonic mucosa ( P < .05). The concentrations of acetic acid and butyric acid in the colonic contents and the abundance of Actinobacteriota in the colon at the phylum level were significantly decreased by feeding low- protein diets ( P < .05). Additionally, the addition of 360 mg/kg NAM to diets increased ( P < .05) the Sobs, Ace, and Chao indices of colonic microorganisms in pigs. Overall, the rational use of NAM can improve inflammatory status, enhance antioxidant capacity and intestinal barrier function, and increase colonic microbial diversity in growing-finishing pigs.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential use of a & ccedil;ai (Euterpe oleracea) seeds as a moisture sequestrant in Panicum maximum cv. Mombasa grass silage and its potential use in sheep diet. In this study, we conducted two experiments using Mombasa grass silage supplemented with a & ccedil;ai seeds at 0, 185, 225, 433, and 520 g.kg(-1) dry matter (DM). Experiment 1 was used to evaluate the effect of a & ccedil;ai seeds on DM, effluent loss (EL), chemical composition, and fermentation characteristics of the silage, while Experiment 2 was used to evaluate the effect of a & ccedil;ai seeds on the intake, digestibility, and nitrogen (N) balance of the sheep fed a & ccedil;ai seed-supplemented Mombasa grass silage. In Experiment 1, the DM content of the silages increased, and the EL decreased with an increase in the a & ccedil;ai seed concentration (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, the DM, organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber intake increased (P < 0.05), while the digestible energy intake and N balance were unaffected (P > 0.05) with increasing a & ccedil;ai seed concentration in the silage. A & ccedil;ai seeds, up to 520 g.kg(-1) DM inclusion level, are effective moisture sequestrants in the Mombasa grass silage because they reduce EL, increase the DM recovery of the ensiled material, and increase the DM intake of the animals. Furthermore, the use of a & ccedil;ai seeds as additives in silage is beneficial to the environment because of the reduction in waste production from the a & ccedil;ai pulp processing and subsequent reduction in the generation of effluents from silage.

AB  - Simple Summary The wisent (European bison) is a protected species. For this reason, we undertook the use of biotechnologies-such as in vitro maturation of oocytes, in vitro fertilization of matured oocytes, in vitro culture of embryos, and embryo vitrification-to establish a wisent embryo bank. The competencies of the vitrified embryos were tested by transferring the warming embryos to cattle (interspecies embryo transfer). The pregnancy was confirmed biochemically and using USG, and although the fetuses were resorbed, the embryos' competence for development was demonstrated. The results of these studies open the way for the cryoconservation of wisent germplasm. The wisent, or European bison (Bison bonasus), belongs to the same family (Bovidae) as the American bison and domestic cattle. The wisent is the largest mammal in Europe, and is called the "Forest Emperor". The wisent is listed as "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List, and is protected by international law. Achievements in reproductive biotechnology have opened new possibilities for the cryoconservation of the wisent germplasm. Therefore, this research aimed to improve a strategy for the protection and preservation of the European bison through the creation of a wisent germplasm bank, based on the following procedures: isolation and in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes, in vitro fertilization (IVF) of matured oocytes, in vitro embryo culture (IVC), and embryo cryopreservation. Wisent ovaries were isolated from females outside the reproductive season, and eliminated from breeding for reasons other than infertility. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were isolated from follicles greater than 2 mm in diameter and matured for 24 h and 30 h. After IVM, COCs were fertilized in vitro with wisent sperm. The obtained wisent zygotes, based on oocytes matured for 24 h and 30 h, were cultured for 216 h. Embryos at the morula and early blastocyst stages were vitrified and then warmed and transferred to interspecies recipients (Bos taurus). USG and biochemical tests were used to monitor pregnancies. This study obtained embryos in the morula and early blastocyst stages only after oocytes were fertilized and matured for 30 h. On average, per oocyte donor, 12.33 +/- 0.5 COCs were isolated, and only 9.33 +/- 0.61 COCs were qualified for in vitro maturation (75.68%), while 9.16 +/- 0.48 COCs were matured (84.32%). On average, per donor, 5.5 +/- 0.34 embryos were cleaved (59.96%) after 48 h post-fertilization (hpf), and 3.33 +/- 0.21 achieved the eight-cell stage (36.52%) after 96 hpf, while 1 +/- 0.21 morula and early blastocyst stages (10.71%) were achieved after 216 hpf. A total of six embryos (one morula and five early blastocysts) were obtained and vitrified; after warming, five of them were interspecies transferred to cattle (Bos taurus). On day 41 after fertilization, 3 out of 5 pregnancies were detected based on USG, P4, and PAG tests. However, no pregnancy was observed on day 86 after fertilization, indicating embryo resorption. This study shows that obtaining wisent embryos in vitro, and subsequent cryopreservation to create a wisent embryo bank, can be applied and implemented for the wisent protection program.

AB  - An LC-MS/MS method has been developed for the sensitive and selective determination of 35 mycotoxins (biomarkers of exposure) in pig urine samples. Sample preparation includes creatinine adjustment (with the developed LC-UV method) with enzymatic hydrolysis of pig urine samples followed by liquid-liquid (LLE) extraction. The LLE protocol, as well as enzymatic hydrolysis for indirect mycotoxin glucuronides determination, was optimized in this study. Additionally, two other sample preparation protocols were compared with the developed LLE method: immunoaffinity columns and solid-phase extraction cartridges (Oasis HLB). The detection and quantification of the biomarkers were performed using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The method was validated with regard to the guidelines specified by the EMEA (European Medicines Agency). The extraction recoveries were higher than 60% for 77% of the analytes studied, with the intra- and inter-day relative standard deviation being lower than 20% for most of the compounds at four different concentration levels. The limits of quantification ranged from 0.1 ng/mL for zearalenone and sterigmatocystin to 8 ng/mL for nivalenol. To the best knowledge of the authors, the matrix effect was evaluated for the first time in this study for six different urine samples, and the coefficient of variation was found to be lower than 15% for most analytes studied. Finally, the developed method was applied to analyse 56 pig urine samples. Deoxynivalenol (1-20 ng/mL), zearalenone (0.1-1.5 ng/mL) and ochratoxin A (1.5-15 ng/mL) were the main analytes detected in these samples. Moreover, the co-occurrence of alternariol monomethyl ether and alternariol in pig urine is reported herein for the first time.

AB  - Sacbrood virus (SBV) is a prevalent and serious disease affecting bees and their brood. The virus primarily targets larvae that are 2 to 3 days old, as well as adult bees. Under natural conditions, larvae become infected when they are fed by nurse bees, which themselves become infected while cleaning cells containing deceased larvae. The sacbrood virus damages the cells of the hypopharyngeal glands and the fatty body of both bees and larvae, often resulting in larval mortality and a decreased lifespan for adult bees. The clinical presentation of sac brood in bees is characterized by variegated brood, where the head ends of some larvae are visible, dead larvae appear in the shape of a'boat', many empty cells. Additionally, dead bee larvae are observed in the form of sacs filled with liquid. However, these larvae can only be detected in cases of severe infection. The discovery of insect viruses in honey indicates that healthy bees may become infected with these viruses through nectar collected from honey-producing plants. According to bibliographic monitoring, honey within the Russian Federation has not yet been studied for the presence of viruses. Today, the issue of bee infection with the SBV remains a significant concern. A clear clinical picture of the disease typically emerges only in severe cases. However, the disease can go undetected even with a low level of damage to the bee colony caused by the sac-brood virus. Up to 6% of bee larvae may die due to this insidious disease. There may be a correlation between the concentration of SBV in the brood and honey, as a virulent pathogen can persist in honey. Consequently, the detection of SBV in honey could serve as a non-invasive method for the early diagnosis of the disease. The purpose of this study is to identify the sacbrood virus in honey and bee larvae and to assess its potential virulence by infecting mammalian cell cultures. A veterinary examination of bee colonies in two apiaries located in Moscow Oblast was conducted, revealing a clinical presentation in seven colonies affected by the sacbrood virus (see Table 2). Molecular genetic analyses were performed at the Syntol LLC laboratory in Moscow, Russia. Samples of honey and bee larvae were tested for the presence of the sacbrood virus using real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) with the Iso Test-SBV (Syntol LLC, Moscow, Russia), following the manufacturer's guidelines. Amplification products were detected through real-time fluorescence on an ANK-32 analyzer. The following dyes were utilized: carboxyfluorescein (FAM-negative control) and carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX). The detection of the bee brood sac virus was conducted using the A4xL cell culture, which consists of pig kidney SPEV-TK cells and horse lymphocytes (an interspecific hybrid strain) at the Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Nutrient Media of RES, Moscow, Russia. Honey samples for infecting the cell cultures were prepared as follows: 0.5 g of honey was dissolved in 1 ml of physiological saline, then centrifuged in a T-24 centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to a test tube, and the centrifugate was filtered through a 0.45 mu m microfilter. As a result of the studies, it was revealed that the sacbrood virus was present in honey and bee larvae across all examined bee colonies (see Table 3). Experiments involving the infection of a cell culture with the SBV isolated from honey demonstrated that after 168 hours of cultivation on the A4xL cell culture, cell degeneration was observed.
   This included the disruption of the monolayer's integrity, destruction of the cell membrane, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, and pyknosis of the nuclei. In contrast, the control group exhibited 98% preservation of the cell monolayer. The sac-brood virus isolated from honey induces cytopathic effects (CPE) on mammalian cell cultures. It is possible to identify the SBV in honey from infected colonies using a hybrid culture of mammalian cells, A4xL. The CPE of the virus was noted on the seventh day, indicating its virulence and confirming the potential for infection of bee colonies through honey. Similar quantities of the virus were detected in both larvae and honey (see Fig. 1, A). A strong correlation was also observed between the SBV content in honey and that in the A4xL hybrid cell culture (see Fig. 1, B). We have demonstrated for the first time in vitro that honey from clinically affected colonies retains the virulent sacbrood virus for at least 10 days from the time of sampling. The analysis of honey using qRT-PCR to detect SBV, along with the assessment of the virus's virulence on A4xL cell culture, can serve as an additional diagnostic method for sacbrood disease in bees.

AB  - The plant Camellia fascicularis, belonging to family Theaceae, has high ornamental and medicinal value, and rare gene resources for genetic improvement of Camellia crops, but is currently threatened with extinction because of the unique and extremely small wild populations. Molecular markers have clarified the wild plant species' genetic diversity structure, new gene resources and relationship with crops. This will be beneficial for conservation of these valuable crop-related wild species and crop improvement. In this study, we identified 95,979 microsatellite loci from 155,011 transcriptome unigenes, and developed 14 polymorphic expressed sequence tag-derived simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) microsatellite markers for C. fascicularis. The number of alleles (Na) per locus was 2-8 with a mean of 4.86. The genetic diversity of 40 individuals from four natural populations of C. fascicularis was analysed using these polymorphic markers. The number of alleles (Na) for EST-SSR ranged from 2 to 5, with the expected heterozygosities (He) and observed heterozygosities (Ho) in all loci ranging from 0.183 to 0.683, and from 0.201 to 0.700, respectively, implying a rich genetic variation present in wild C. fascicularis populations. Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis among four populations, using the 14 EST-SSR markers developed in this study, grouped 40 individuals into three groups, which coincide with their geographic distribution. These results showed that 14 EST-SSR markers are available for the analysis of genetic variation in C. fascicularis populations and genetic improvement of new Camellias cultivars by interspecific hybridization, and are beneficial for conservation of the endangered species.

AB  - Few studies have investigated group movements of domestic ungulates in farming conditions where the groups are subjected to repeated composition changes across years. We stocked a beef cow herd (23-34 cows; some with a calf) maintained in a farm in a grazing plot comprising two subplots, and monitored inter-subplot movements of cows on 39 days for 6 years. Movements of the entire cow herd, pooled over the two directions, occurred 4-23 times daily. Time required for individual movements ranged from < 1 to 34 min, with nearly 90% of the movements being completed within 10 min. Daily movement orders of cows were consistent (Kendall's W = 0.13- 0.36, P < 0.05) on 34 days out of the 39, with some cows appearing in the first three (front) or last three (rear) positions more frequently than the chance (binomial P < 0.05). The front- and rearpositioned cows did not differ (P = 0.05) in age, body weight, years from the first introduction into the herd, days from the last calving, days in pregnancy, or proportion of days with a calf. More studies are needed to understand the factors affecting leadership to use this trait for management of herd movements.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a unique woody edible oil tree species in China, and the ovule development affects the yield of seeds. This study selected three different types of C. oleifera clones and used LC-MS, RNA-seq, and other techniques to compare the endogenous hormone contents, gene expression levels, and metabolite changes between normal and aborted ovules. The results showed that high levels of ABA, JA, and SA may lead to the phenotype of ovule abortion. A total of 270 differential metabolites were identified in the metabolome, with L-methionine, citrulline, L-tryptophan, L-phenylalanine, and indolepyruvate being downregulated to varying degrees in the aborted ovules. Genes involved in plant hormone synthesis and response, such as GH3.1, IAA14, PIN1, AUX22, ARF1_2, BZR1_2, GA2ox, ERFC3, ABF2, and PYL8, responded to ovule development. This study elucidates the physiological, metabolic, and transcriptional responses to ovule abortion, providing a theoretical basis for understanding ovule development and yield regulation in C. oleifera.

AB  - In South-Kivu province, cattle farming is an integral component of farmers' livelihoods and one of the few income-generating opportunities for smallholders. However, very few studies have been conducted to characterize smallholders' cattle production systems. This study documents cattle production systems to better understand their current situation, constraints they face and opportunities they offer. For that purpose, an investigation was conducted based on a structured survey questionnaire and participatory interviews with 863 farmers in South-Kivu province. Collected data were analysed using factorial analysis of mixed data and clustering techniques. The results revealed three types of smallholder cattle farms differing mainly in their herds' sizes and landholding. The first category is the most common and includes farmers raising small herds (6.3 +/- 6.7 cattle) of local breeds in herding system (in this work, "herding system" refers to a rearing system for which the farmer drives and stays with his animals on pastures and fallow land during the day) and grazing fodder in community pastures, fallow lands and roadside grasses, while land constitutes a scarce resource. In the second category, some farmers have small tracts of land (< 5 ha) and others have large tracts (> 5 ha), but all have medium-size herds (45.1 +/- 19.4 cattle) made up of local breeds, which they rear in herding system. They also exploit community pastures, fallow land and roadside fodder for animal feeding. The third and last category includes farmers with large cattle herds (78.1 +/- 28.1 cattle) of local, crossbred and exotic breeds raised free range in the fenced paddocks on vast areas of land (> 5 ha) found in high-altitude regions. However, while being different according to the above-considered characteristics, the three categories of cattle farming remain extensive pastoral farms dominated by male farmers. Agriculture and/or animal husbandry are their main source of income while their livestock are also composed of goats and poultry, beside cattle. Still, the three farming groups require more inputs and improvement strategies for increased productivity in the challenging environment characterized by low land accessibility and high demand for milk and meat. Fodder cultivation and crop-livestock integration through agro-ecological systems as well as access to credit and extension services are the proposed strategies for the improvement of this economic sector.

AB  - Simple Summary The low developmental efficiency of cloned pig embryos limits the application of the pig cloning technique. In this study, a small molecule drug called CPI was added to the culture medium of nuclear donor cells to enhance the developmental capacity of subsequent cloned pig embryos. CPI treatment of nuclear donor cells changed the cellular energy metabolism status from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, and significantly improved the developmental competence of subsequent cloned pig embryos. This study provides a simple approach to facilitate the development and application of pig cloning technology.Abstract Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology holds great promise for livestock industry, life science and human biomedicine. However, the development and application of this technology is limited by the low developmental potential of SCNT embryos. The developmental competence of cloned embryos is influenced by the energy metabolic status of donor cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CPI, an oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor, on the energy metabolism pathways of pig fibroblasts and the development of subsequent SCNT embryos. The results showed that treatment of porcine fibroblasts with CPI changed the cellular energy metabolic pathways from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and enhanced the developmental ability of subsequent SCNT embryos. The present study establishes a simple, new way to improve pig cloning efficiency, helping to promote the development and application of pig SCNT technology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While the mother knows best/preference performance hypothesis has been well tested in natural ecosystems, how these ecological principles differ in agroecosystems is less explored. In this study, we investigated the ovipositional preference and offspring performance of fall armyworm (FAW) across vegetative and reproductive stages of soybean. RESULTS: We examined trichomes, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and assessed electroantennogram (EAG) measurements to understand how olfactory responses are affected by volatiles at different phenological stages during photoperiodism (photophase and scotophase). We found that gravid FAW preferred the vegetative compared to reproductive stage of soybean. Although VOC and EAG responses was not statistically different (P > 0.05) between photophase and scotophase, but vegetative stage exhibited significantly (P <= 0.05) higher emissions and responses than the reproductive stage during both photophase and scotophase. Additionally, reproductive stage had lower trichomes compared to the vegetative stage. Interestingly, no significant difference was observed in offspring performance between the vegetative and reproductive stages of soybean. This suggests that oviposition preference does not necessarily correlate with offspring performance, which was confirmed through offspring mass and mass gain studies. Olfactory and sensory cues from soybean at reproductive stage reduced oviposition by mother FAW. CONCLUSION: Collectively, we show that while mother knows best may not fit FAW-Soybean interaction, muffled volatile emission in reproductive stages can have positive consequences for host success. The results from this study will enhance our understanding of FAW behavior across different phenological stages of host plants, that can be used to develop alternative and sustainable management strategies.

AB  - Surveys on detritivorous moths were carried out at three locations in Kyushu, Japan, in 2019, using bait traps. The trap material consisted of dead leaves or rice straw, baited with dog food, chicken manure, or bat guano. A total of 293 moth individuals, comprising 25 species belonging to 17 families, were trapped during the experiment. The emerged moths included 285 detritivore individuals of 17 species in nine families and eight herbivore individuals of eight different families. Most moth individuals emerged from the traps made of dead leaves with dog food, which contains several nutrients, as the bait. Of these individuals, species such as Phaeoses sp. (Tineidae) and Pyralis farinalis(Pyralidae), which often emerge from bird nests but are difficult to collect, were also found. This is the first study to collect detritivorous moths using traps with different baits.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of dietary niacinamide supplementation on blood parameters, antioxidant status, and intestinal health in finishing pigs fed low-protein diets. Sixty-four pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire; 80.4 +/- 0.1 kg) were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments supplemented with 30 (NAM30), 130 (NAM130), 230 (NAM230), and 330 (NAM330) mg/kg niacinamide for 30 days. Each treatment had four replicate pens and four pigs per pen. Growth performance was not significantly affected. However, the NAM130 group showed higher (p < 0.05) hemoglobin levels, reduced (p < 0.05) serum malondialdehyde and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) concentrations, and altered intestinal microbiota composition, including lower Streptococcus abundance (p < 0.05). Serum alanine aminotransferase levels increased quadratically (p < 0.05) with niacinamide supplementation, with a breakpoint at approximately 221 mg/kg. These results suggest that dietary supplementation with 130 mg/kg niacinamide improves antioxidant status, modulates inflammation, and supports intestinal microbial balance, with a safety threshold to avoid hepatic stress.

AB  - Problems with plant-parasitic nematodes remain a major challenge in most field vegetable crops worldwide. In agricultural fields in Belgium, these problems have increased in recent years. A major problem is the quarantine root-knot nematode Meloidogyne chitwoodi. The host plant status of the most commonly grown cultivars of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and the damage threshold for M. chitwoodi were determined in a climate-controlled glasshouse and in a naturally infested field. The yield data with the final population densities were fitted to Seinhorst's yield and population dynamic models, respectively. The damage threshold values (T) for the relative fresh weight yield were 0.14, 1.08, 11.53 J2 (100 cm(3) soil)(-1), minimum yield (m) of 0.84, 0.64, 0.52 and maximum yield (Y-max) of 12.51, 12.44 and 9.60 for 'Gnu', 'Meerkat' and 'Whale' spinach cultivars, respectively. The maximum multiplication rates (a) were 3.81, 2.38 and 2.72, whilst the maximum population densities (M) were 563, 916, and 922 J2 (100 cm(3) soil)(-1) for 'Gnu', 'Meerkat' and 'Whale', respectively. Meloidogyne chitwoodi had an impact on the spinach yield. The higher the nematode density the lower the yield and vice versa. The tested cultivars were all hosts for M. chitwoodi but differences between cultivars occurred. 'Kolibri' and 'Rhino' were tested as the least sensitive cultivars for M. chitwoodi during the host screening test and bring opportunities for resistance breeding. This is the first report of spinach as a host for M. chitwoodi.

AB  - There is currently limited information on the benefits of increasing the concentration of Trichanthera gigantea leaves in pelleted diets offered to lambs reared under tropical conditions in the Caribbean. Twelve crossbred Barbados Blackbelly rams aged 5 months were used to determine the effects of increasing the concentrations of T. gigantea in pelleted diets, on the nutritive value and intake of grass forage plus pellets offered to lambs. Animals were randomly assigned to a basic diet (4 kg) of chopped Cenchrus purpureus plus 1 of 6 pelleted diets (500 g) comprised of either 100% intact commercial pellets or a pelleted mixture of ground commercial pellets and ground (dry fallen) T. gigantea leaf in the following ratios (T. gigantea leaves:ground commercial pellets): 20:80 (T20); 40:60 (T40); 60:40 (T60); 80:20 (T80); and 100:0 (T100). Total intakes of forage and pellets (TPI) were measured at the end of each day during a period of 7 days, and the average daily nutrient intakes of the different treatment diets were calculated. Overall, there was no significant difference in the intakes of pellets containing 0 to 80% T. gigantea leaves (P 0.05) but intakes of pellets comprising 100% T. gigantea leaves were significantly lower (P<0.0001). Both CP and soluble protein intakes declined progressively as the percentage of T. gigantea leaves in the pellets increased. While level of T. gigantea leaves in pellets fed to lambs did not generally affect total intakes of pellets, grass, or grass+pellets, animal performance on these various rations cannot be assumed to be similar until longer-term feeding studies have been performed, as reduced protein and energy concentrations in the pellets could significantly lower weight gains as level of leaf in the pellets increased.

AB  - Domestication often alters plant traits, leading to cascading effects on ecological interactions, particularly in tri-trophic relationships among plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies. While recent studies have investigated the influence of domestication on plant-derived food sources, its effect on guttation-a nutrient-rich exudate produced by many plants-remains unexplored. In this study, we examined the effects of guttation droplets from wild and cultivated highbush blueberries on the fitness (longevity and fecundity) and feeding preferences of three insect species from different trophic guilds: an herbivore (Drosophila suzukii), a parasitoid (Trichopria drosophilae), and a predator (Chrysoperla carnea). Additionally, we analyzed and compared the size and nutritional composition-specifically, total sugar and protein content-of guttation droplets between wild and cultivated blueberry plants. Our results indicated that guttation from wild plants enhanced the longevity of all three insect species, often surpassing that of cultivated plants and diets containing only sugar or sugar plus protein. In choice assays, all three insect species consistently preferred guttation from wild plants over that from cultivated ones. Although the guttation droplets from cultivated plants were larger, those from wild plants contained higher concentrations of sugars (six times more) and proteins (five times more), which likely contributed to the insects' enhanced fitness and preference for wild plant guttation. These findings indicate that domestication has reduced the ecological functionality of guttation in blueberries by potentially influencing tri-trophic interactions. Understanding how domestication affects plant-derived food sources like guttation could have important implications for the conservation of natural enemies in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of including green forage in the diet of Italian Mediterranean dairy buffaloes on the ruminal microbiota, CAZymes profile, functional biomolecules and total antioxidant activity in bulk milk. Sixteen buffaloes were randomly assigned according to lactation number and daily milk production to two homogeneous groups, and for 60 days received each: Group 1, a standard total mixed ration (TMR) or group 2, TMR + ryegrass green forage (30% of diet). The diets of the two groups were iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic and differed only in the proportion of green forage. Buffaloes that received TMR + green feed had a higher (p < .01) representation of bacteria belonging to the orders Veillonellales, Selenomonadales and Bradymonadales compared with buffaloes that received TMR. The former buffaloes also had a greater (p < .01) abundance of CAZymes of the GT class (GHT4, GT14, GT20, GT26, GT39) and AA class (AA1, AA3, AA6). The milk of buffaloes that received TMR + green feed had a higher (p < .01) antioxidant capacity and greater (p < .01) amounts of the functional biomolecules l-carnitine, propionyl-l-carnitine, acetyl-l-carnitine and delta-valerobetaine. The findings have provided evidence for metabolic and biosynthetic pathways that link green forage with rumen bacteria, CAZymes and the synthesis of amino acids and functional biomolecule in buffaloes.

AB  - Background: The typification of the name Aegilops tauschii Coss. (Poaceae: Triticeae) is revisited. Several authors cited a gathering from Iberia as the locality and Buxbaum as the collector of as the type, but no actual specimens from this collection have been located, nor is there evidence that such a gathering existed. In 1994, van Slageren designated as lectotype an illustration from Buxbaum's Plantarum minus cognitarum centuria I (1728), which, although original material, is not the only element cited in the protologue. The protologue mentions several gatherings, some of which are represented by identifiable herbarium specimens qualifying as syntypes. Methods: This work is based on the analysis of the protologue of Aegilops tauschii and the study of specimens conserved in several herbaria. According to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN, Shenzhen Code 2018), an illustration does not hold the same nomenclatural weight as preserved specimens cited in the protologue. Therefore, van Slageren's lectotypification does not comply with Art. 9.12 of the ICN and must be superseded. Results: The original material includes multiple elements, and a new lectotype is designated from a specimen at PRC from Azerbaijan.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. In this study, we examined the effects of compound C20, a selective positive allosteric modulator of the TRPC6 channel, on the cognitive and motor function of 5xFAD mice, a transgenic model of AD. Our results demonstrate that C20 effectively improves hippocampus-dependent ("Morris's water maze", "Novel object recognition" tests) and hippocampus-independent ("Fear conditioning") memory, which is consistent with its ability to restore synaptic plasticity. However, C20 had no effect on motor impairment in the "Beam walking" test. Thus, C20 exhibits an effect of protection of cognition but does not affect motor function in 5xFAD mice. These findings support the potential of TRPC6 as a target for the treatment of cognitive impairment in a course of AD and highlight the need for further investigation of the mechanisms underlying motor deficits.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) during pregnancy adversely affects uterine vascular perfusion and foetal development. L-arginine (L-Arg), a nitric oxide (NO) precursor, has been proven to enhance an organ's vascular perfusion. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of L-Arg administration on the pregnant buffaloes' uterine haemodynamics and uteroplacental thickness under environmental HS conditions. For this purpose, pluriparous (n = 12) HS-pregnant buffaloes (mid-gestation, 180-190 days; temperature humidity index >85) were haphazardly assigned into two groups, either administered a single intravenous (IV) bolus of 5 mg/kg BW of L-Arg Hcl (n = 6; ARG) or received normal saline (0.9%; IV; 25 ml) that served as a control group (n = 6; CON). Combined uteroplacental thickness (CUPT, mm), middle uterine arteries' (MUA) diameter (mm) and uterine Doppler haemodynamics (ipsilateral and contralateral to the pregnant horn) were examined utilizing B-mode and colour Doppler ultrasonography, respectively. The serum levels of progesterone (P4), estradiol 17 beta (E2), nitric oxide (NO) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were assayed using commercial kits. The experimental time points were - 1, 0, 2, 4, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h post-L-Arg administration. The ARG group showed higher (p < .05) CUPT and MUA diameter values starting at 24 h post-treatment and onward than the control buffalo cows. In addition, there were improvements (p < .05) in the blood flow parameters in the ipsilateral MUA after L-Arg treatment evidenced by lower values of pulsatility and resistive indices starting at 48 and 4 h, respectively and onward, and higher values of peak systolic velocity, coloured areas towards the pregnant uterine horn (both 24-72 h). Increases in the NO levels were found during the period between 4 and 120 h in the ARG group compared to the CON group. Moreover, significant increases in the E2 and P4 means were noted in the ARG group, especially at 24 h onward, respectively compared to the CON group. Concerning the TAC status, neither the administration nor the hours affected serum TAC levels in the HS pregnant buffaloes (CON and ARG). In conclusion, L-Arg administration improved uteroplacental thickness and enhanced uterine haemodynamics, NO levels, and steroids production in mid-pregnant buffalo cows under environmental heat stress conditions which could improve foetal growth and development.

AB  - The study of growth and development of lambs (Ovis aries) is essential in sheep farming, and melatonin plays an important role in the physiology of growing lambs. The effects of an exogenous melatonin treatment on several physiological characteristics in fattening lambs at weaning were studied. Eight lambs were assigned to one of two groups; those that did (melatonin group, n = 4) or did not (no-melatonin group, n = 4) receive two subcutaneous melatonin implants at weaning. At the end of the fattening period, to quantify locomotor activity (LA), each lamb was fitted with a triaxial accelerometer, for 7 days. Simultaneously, lambs received a surgically implanted subcutaneous temperature (T) and heart rate (HR) biologger, which was programmed to record data every 5 min. HR variability (HRV) variables (SDNN, the standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals, and RMSSD, the root mean square of consecutive deviations between normal heartbeats) were measured. All of the variables exhibited 24-h circadian rhythms. Time of day (daytime vs. nighttime) had a significant effect on LA, T, and HR, but considering both treatment with melatonin and time, differences between time for these variables were only observed in melatonin-treated lambs. Exogenous melatonin did not affect LA or T, but melatonin-treated lambs had lower HR, SDNN, and RMSSD than did non-treated lambs. In conclusion, the use of subcutaneous biologgers and triaxial accelerometers in growing lambs demonstrated circadian rhythms in LA, T, HR, and HRV, and melatonin treatment negatively affected HRV, but its effects on the other physiological variables differed between day and night.

AB  - Purpose Increase in global population and food demands have necessitated the need to enhance the health status of agricultural soils to overcome retrogresses in crop yields. Thus, amply use of animal manures is critical to improving low fertility status that characterised most agricultural soils in the tropics.
   Method This study investigated the effects of various animal manure types on soil properties and performance of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L) grown on a degraded coarse-textured ultisol. The treatments were: T1, poultry manure; T2, cow manure; T3, pig manure applied at 702 g pot(-1) (equivalent to 30 t ha(-1)) to a 10 kg potted soil and T4, control unamended soil.
   Results Amended treatments had 0.73-10.9% increase in organic matter, 191-370% increase in soil N, 30.4-170% and 25.5-76.5% increase in soil P and K, respectively relative to the control treatment. Amended treatments recorded significantly higher (p <0.05) plant height, stem girth, okra biomass and yields compared with the control treatment. Poultry manure showed superiority over cow manure and pig manure for pH, soil nutrients, okra yield, okra growth and yield parameters measured.
   Conclusion The results indicate that animal manure application increased okra yield and enhanced the fertility status of a degraded coarse-textured ultisol. Thus, application of animal manures can help overcome low fertility challenges associated with degraded tropical soils.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) migrate from their Antarctic feeding grounds to their north-west Australian breeding grounds. North-west Australia has experienced rapid development of the mining and petroleum industry, and remains under increasing human pressure. The aim of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of humpback whales across the north-west: North West Cape, Pilbara and Exmouth Gulf. Aerial surveys (n = 184) were conducted from 2000 to 2010. After accounting for survey effort, kernel density estimation was used to assess the monthly distribution of whales. The largest density hotspot of whale groups was the centre to western edge of Exmouth Gulf. The highest encounter rate of mother-calf pairs was in October in Exmouth Gulf (0.0447 +/- 0.0082 groups/km), which was significantly higher than in the North West Cape and Pilbara (0.0005 +/- 0.0002 and 0.0011 +/- 0.0005 groups/km, respectively). The comparison among the three regions confirms and quantifies Exmouth Gulf as an important nursery area for humpback whale mother-calf pairs. Nursery areas are important for lactating humpback whale mothers as they carry the highest energetic demands in the population. It is crucial that nursery areas remain relatively undisturbed from human pressures so mothers can rest to conserve energy and nurse their young.

   The IL-4 and IL-4R cytokine genes are responsible for immune response in the reproductive system and are related to embryonic implantation and fetal survival during pregnancy in females. However, to date, their effects on litter size traits in pigs have been not elucidated. Therefore, the present study was conducted to verify the porcine IL-4 and IL-4R polymorphisms and assess how they affect litter size traits in commercial pigs. The findings suggested that the porcine IL-4 g.134993898T > C and IL-4R c.1577A > T polymorphisms were associated with the litter size traits. Therefore, the porcine IL-4 and IL-4R genes may be potentially effective genetic markers to improve the litter size traits in pigs.
   The interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) are cytokines that are involved in the immune and reproductive systems. This study aimed to verify the polymorphisms in the porcine IL-4 and IL-4R genes and to assess their effects on litter size traits in commercial pigs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the porcine IL-4 and IL-4R genes were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. A non-coding SNP of IL-4 g.134993898T > C and a non-synonymous SNP of IL-4R c.1577A > T (amino acid change at position 526, Q526L) were found to be segregating in Landrace sows. The IL-4 g.134993898T > C polymorphism was significantly associated with the number of piglets weaned alive (NWA) trait. The IL-4R c.1577A > T polymorphism was significantly associated with the number born alive (NBA) and NWA traits. Moreover, the accumulation of favorable alleles of these two SNP markers revealed significant associations with the NBA, NWA, and mean weight of piglets at weaning (MWW) traits. These findings indicate that the porcine IL-4 and IL-4R genes may contribute to the reproductive traits of pigs and could be used as candidate genes to improve litter size traits in the pig breeding industry.

AB  - Organic fertilization has become a common agricultural practice in Sri Lanka, but currently there is lack of assessment regarding the potential dissemination of opportunistic pathogens by animal manure usage. Here, raw manure and stored manure of four kinds of animals (swine, poultry, cattle and goat), commercial fertilizer, manure-amended soil, and green leaves were collected in wet zone of Sri Lanka. We tracked bacterial community, virulence factors and eleven gene markers of opportunistic pathogens along manure-soil-leaf continua using multiple molecular and bioinformatic approaches. Bacterial composition was primarily influenced by storage process rather than animal types. Among virulence factors, relative abundance of exotoxin genes in raw cattle and goat manure (0.14 and 0.10 copies/cell) was higher than that in raw swine and poultry manure (0.019 and 0.013 copies/cell), but all of them decreased to < 0.0030 copies/cell after storage. One- to two-log reduction of opportunistic pathogens were achieved by manure storage process. Abundance of exotoxin genes and opportunistic pathogens was significantly higher in manure-amended soil than in control soil (P < 0.05). Notably, dominant pathogens changed from E. coli in raw manure to Enterococcus and Bacillus cereus in stored manure, soil and leaf phyllosphere, and shifts of pathogens mainly droved shifts of virulence factors. Metagenomic binning results further illustrated the transfer of Enterococcus from raw manure to stored manure, receiving soil and leaves. Overall, this study highlights benefits of manure management in reducing microbial risk in livestock environment in Sri Lanka and other developing countries, and research need on further interruption of Enterococcus transmission.

AB  - Biochar could be used as a green and efficient carbon-based material for activation of PMS to degrade antibiotics. In this study, different carbon structured bio-chars were prepared from sheep manure by varying the pyrolysis method and conditions. The biochar was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, electron microscopy scanning, elemental analysis and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms to establish the conformational relationships between different carbon structures and the degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) by activated PMS. The results showed that the pyrolysis temperature accelerates the generation of biochar pore structures, the nitrogen atmosphere facilitates the generation of mesoporous structures, and the appropriate residence time effectively reduces the polarity and enhances the aromaticity of the biochar. When the dosages of G600-1.0 h and PMS were 0.6 and 0.5 g.L-1, respectively, 10 mg.L-1 of SDZ could be completely removed within 50 min and still had good activation efficiency after 3 cycle tests. The results of the radical quenching test, electron paramagnetic resonance analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the defective structure on the surface of G600-1.0 h activates the radical pathway of PMS (SO4 center dot-, center dot OH and O-2(center dot-)), while the C=O group and graphitic nitrogen promote the production of the non-radical pathway (O-1(2)). In the degradation of SDZ, the radical pathway was dominated by the production of SO4 center dot-. In summary, a new biochar-based PMS activator was designed and prepared by optimizing the pyrolysis conditions, with a view to providing new technological support for a green, efficient and low-cost treatment method for antibiotic wastewater, as well as a new option for the resource utilization of manure sources.

AB  - Rangeland management decisions require cattle producers to select practices that improve the sustainability of rangelands to maintain cattle production while remaining profitable. The invasion of Eastern red cedar ( Juniperus virginiana) across the Great Plains due to fire suppression is limiting grazeable land for cattle. Woody plant encroachment (WPE), combined with drought impacts and high input costs, becomes expensive for cattle producers who are forced to supplement, destock, or both. Patch-burn grazing is a practice based on the understanding of the interaction of fire and grazing (pyric herbivory) that divides a pasture into sections, burning one section rotationally each year. It offers improved rangeland productivity by providing high-quality forages, mitigation for drought impacts, and control of WPE. Despite these benefits, the adoption of patch-burn grazing by cattle producers is limited. Our goal involved increasing awareness of the benefits of patch-burn grazing by estimating the costs and long-term economic benefits and comparing them to those of one of the more traditional approaches of burning an entire pasture every 3 yr. In building an economic analysis, our objectives were to calculate utilization costs and quantify the benefits of high-quality forages and drought impact mitigation. Results indicated that patch-burn grazing will cost approximately $5.94 more per hectare per year than burning the entire pasture every 3 yr. The benefit of cows having continual access to high-quality forages in recently burned areas results in savings of $20 per head per year in winter supplementation costs. Additionally, utilizing patch-burn grazing before a drought, not burning during a drought, and resuming after the drought reduce supplementation and burn costs by 4.5% and increase future value of savings by $100.21 per cow compared with those caused by traditional management practices after 6 yr. An economic analysis of patch-burn grazing provides beneficial economic information to aid cow-calf producers in the decision-making process of rangeland management. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - This study aimed to describe the shedding pattern of gastrointestinal parasite eggs by a wild population of desert bighorn sheep (DBS; Ovis canadensis) in northern Mexico. Seventy-five fresh faecal samples were collected from the ground in each season within an hour after being expelled by these animals. The generalized linear mixed model showed that eggs per gram of faeces were highest in winter (577 +/- 399) and lowest in summer (260 +/- 198). Generalized linear models revealed that Strongyloides spp. predominated during most seasons with a peak in summer (85% of faecal samples analysed) and the absence of this helminth in winter. Nematodirus spp. was another helminth present in three seasons, with the presence of this nematode in 35% of the faecal samples in spring and 0% in summer. Other parasites in DBS faeces included Bunostomun spp., Trichostrongylus spp., Cooperia spp., Mecistocirrus digitatus, Haemonchus contortus, Chabertia ovina and Eimeria ovinoidalis. There were differences among seasons in the percentage of these helminths and coccidia in faecal samples for all these parasites. It was concluded that helminths egg output in DBS in a semi-arid rangeland is lowest in summer and spring and highest in autumn and winter. Furthermore, it was shown that DBS in the study site do not suffer from severe parasite burden. Therefore, this nematode parasite burden is compatible with the conservation and well-being of this particular population.

AB  - Upper respiratory tract diseases are a major concern in sheep, causing economic losses and affecting animal welfare. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. This case-based study assessed the use of computed tomography for diagnosing these diseases in sheep. Thirty-three sheep showing clinical signs of one or more upper respiratory tract diseases underwent computed tomography scans, which were compared to clinical diagnoses and postmortem examinations. Results showed that clinical diagnosis matched the postmortem findings in 26 of 38 cases, while computed tomography diagnosis matched in 36 of 38 diagnosed conditions, demonstrating higher accuracy. Computed tomography provided detailed anatomical reconstructions of the respiratory tract, allowing precise detection of lesions, identification of their origin or content, and clear visualisation of surrounding structures. Despite limitations such as high costs, risks related to general anaesthesia, and radiation exposure, its accuracy makes it a valuable tool for managing these diseases. The creation of extensive databases on common diseases affecting sheep could improve the accessibility and effectiveness of computed tomography in veterinary clinics.

AB  - Tea, as a global nonalcoholic beverage, is widely consumed due to its economic, health and cultural importance. Polyploids have the ability to solve the problems of low yield, cold resistance and insect resistance in tea tree varieties. However, the response mechanism to aluminum and heavy metal remains unclear. In this study, the content of Al, Cu and Cd were measured in the leaves and roots of 'Qianmei 419' and 'Qianfu 4', respectively. The content of Al, Cd and Cu in the roots of the 'Qianmei 419' tea variety were significantly higher than in 'Qianfu 4' roots. Only the content of Cu in the leaves of the 'Qianmei 419' tea variety was significantly higher than that in the roots of the 'Qianfu 4' tea variety. Moreover, we found that the content of Al, Cu and Cd in the soil around the root of 'Qianfu 4' were higher than in the soil around the root of 'Qianmei 419'. RNA-seq was performed to identify the DEGs involved in the accumulation of Al, Cu and Cd between 'Qianmei 419' and 'Qianfu 4'. A total of 23,813 DEGs were identified in the triploid tea variety, including 16,459 upregulated DEGs and 7354 downregulated DEGs. Among them, by analyzing the expression levels of some metal transporter genes, it was found that most of the metal transporter genes were downregulated in the triploid tea plants. In short, through the analysis of transcriptome data and metal content, it was found that changes in metal transporter gene expression affect the accumulation of metals in tea plants. These results provide candidate genes to enhance multi-metal tolerance through genetic engineering technology.

AB  - Insect herbivores and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) often occur simultaneously on a host plant, altering plant morphological and biochemical traits and thereby not only affecting each other's performance, but also plant interactions with subsequent above- or belowground herbivores. Here, we investigate the combined effects of AMF and above- and belowground herbivory on plant productivity and performance of subsequent above- and belowground herbivores. We conducted a 3 x 2 full-factorial experiment with three levels of 'Herbivory (no herbivory, leaf herbivory, and tuber herbivory) and two levels of 'AMF inoculation' (no AMF inoculation and AMF inoculation) in the tuber-plant, potato (Solanum tuberosum). We showed that both AMF and tuber herbivory increased tuber biomass and tuber primary metabolites (protein, starch). Tuber herbivory reduced the performance of subsequent conspecifics feeding on leaves potentially via increased leaf levels of phenolics, alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine. By contrast, it increased the performance of subsequent conspecifics feeding on tubers potentially via increased protein, however, only in plants inoculated with AMF. This indicates that the belowground facilitation among conspecific insects was contingent upon the presence of AMF. Leaf herbivory did not affect subsequent above- or belowground insect performance. These feedings improve our understanding of the ecological consequences of antagonists and mutualists interactions mediated by phytochemistry, especially for agroecosystems.

AB  - The Neotropical subfamily Edessinae Amyot & Serville, 1843 has 14 genera: Edessa Fabricius, 1803, Ascra Say, 1832, Anisoedessa Nunes & Fernandes, 2019, Brachystethus Laporte, 1832, Doesburgedessa Fernandes, 2010, Grammedessa Correia & Fernandes, 2016, Graziaedessa Eger, 2021, Hypoxys Amyot & Serville, 1843, Olbia St?l, 1862, Paraedessa Silva & Fernandes, 2013, Plagaedessa Almeida & Fernandes, 2018, Pantochlora St?l, 1870, Peromatus Amyot & Serville, 1843 and Pygoda Amyot & Serville, 1843. Most of these genera were described or resurrected recently (Fernandes 2010; Silva et al. 2013; Santos et al. 2015; Correia & Fernandes 2016; Fernandes et al. 2018; Almeida et al. 2018; Nunes et al. 2019; Nunes et al. 2020; Eger in press ). The largest number of species and the greatest morphological diversity inside Edessinae can be found in Edessa (about 300 described species). This genus is known as the ?garbage-group? of the species of the subfamily (Fernandes & van Doesburg 2000a).
   The E. ovina group of species is proposed here to include Edessa ovina Dallas, 1851 from Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina (new records) and Guyana; E. impura Bergroth, 1891 from Brazil and Argentina (new record); E. sahlbergii St?l, 1872 restricted to Brazil; and E. graziae sp. nov. from Brazil and Argentina. The E. ovina group can be identified by the apex of the second pair of wings narrowing distally and by a tumid area on the ventral surface of the pygophore (male genitalia) projected posteriorly. Descriptions, measurements, and illustrations of the metasternal process, external and internal genitalia of male and female are provided. A map with the distribution of the species is presented. The holotype of Edessa ovina is designated here. Edessa argali Breddin, 1903 is considered a junior synonym of E. impura. Females of E. ovina and E. impura, and male of E. sahlbergii are described for the first time.

AB  - Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the inclusion impacts of macroalgae Gigartina skottsbergii (Gs) for grazing sheep. Experiment (Exp.) 1 studied the effect of Gs on in vitro gas production (IVGP), dry matter (DM) digestibility (IVDMD), and methane (CH4) emission using three fistulated sheep and 96 h incubation of samples. In Exp. 2, ten Dohne Merino ewes [5-year-old; 47 +/- 0.14 kg body weight (BW)] were randomly assigned to dietary treatments supplemented with Gs at 0 or 450 g DM/d per animal. The study lasted 31 days and was preceded by an adaptation period of 9 days. The BW, body conditional score (BCS), and blood were sampled at the first and the last day of the trial. The results of Exp. 1 showed that Gs supplementation reduced (MCP, p = 0.026) gas production (A), lag time (p = 0.013), and IVDMD (p = 0.071), while it enhanced partition factor (PF96; p = 0.004) and microbial crude protein (MCP) (p = 0.054). The concentration of CH4 decreased after 3 h (p = 0.0002), 6 h (p = 0.013), and 12 h (p = 0.010) with a tendency at 9 h (p = 0.109) and 24 h (p = 0.068). In Exp. 2, there were no diet effects on the initial BW (IBW, p = 0.77), final BW (FBW, p = 0.91), and average daily gain (ADG, p = 0.24) of ewes; however, Gs supplementation decreased BCS (p = 0.004). Of all blood parameters, only the concentration of glucose (p = 0.021) and albumin (p = 0.011) decreased in the Gs group. Overall, our results revealed that the dietary inclusion of Gs (at 450 g DM/d) affected neither the BW nor ADG of ewes; however, Gs was accompanied by lesser IVGP and CH4 emission.

AB  - Haemonchus contortus is known for its high pathogenicity in sheep, and the uncontrolled use of anthelmintics resulted in the emergence of multiple drug-resistant populations. Breeding sheep for gastrointestinal nematode resistance is a sustainable alternative to reduce dependence of anthelmintic drugs, and differences in the degree of resistance between breeds have been reported. Here we compare two sheep breeds (Santa Ines and Ile de France), concerning the differences in innate and adaptive immune response involved in the resistance against H. contortus infection. Immunohistochemical analyses of the abomasum were conducted in na & iuml;ve Santa Ines (n = 14) and Ile de France (n = 12) lambs randomized into four groups: infected Santa Ines (n = 8), non-infected control Santa Ines (n = 6), infected Ile de France (n = 8), and non-infected control Ile de France (n = 4). The infected lambs were initially infected with H. contortus infective larvae at 14 days of age, and multiple infections were conducted every second day until they reached 66 days of age. There was a significant effect (P < 0.001) of the infection with increase in numbers of CD3+ + T; CD79 alpha+ + B; GATA3+ + Th2/ILC2; POU2F3+ + tuft cells; FOXP3+ + T reg; and IgE + cells in the fundus of the abomasal mucosa in both Santa Ines and Ile de France lambs. Nevertheless, the infected Santa Ines lambs presented the highest averages for CD79 alpha+ + B; GATA3+ + Th2/ILC; IgE + cells; and POU2F3+ + tuft cells and there was a significant association of the breed and infection status with regards to POU2F3+ + tuft cells, with the highest mean in the infected Santa Ines group. The infected Santa Ines group had three lambs with high degree of resistance and five lambs that showed a moderate infection. Our results suggest a mechanism of synergistic coordination between different immune-cell types in promoting resistance of suckling lambs under H. contortus infection.

AB  - Background The univoltine leaf beetle Phyllotreta ochripes (Curtis, 1837b) is native to the Palaearctic Region from Japan to western Europe. This species was previously evaluated as a potential biological control agent against invasive populations of the woodland weed Alliaria petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara & Grande (Brassicaceae) in North America, but rejected because it could harm native and at-risk populations of Brassicaceae. New information First North American records are presented for Phyllotreta ochripes (Curtis, 1837). Specimens were examined from the USA: Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Internet photographs of apparent additional individuals from USA: Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Canada: Ontario were also examined. DNA barcoding analysis showed high genetic variability and possible cryptic species within European populations of P. ochripes. Diagnostic information is presented to distinguish P. ochripes. from other North American Chrysomelidae and a species distribution model to assess its potential spread in North America is presented. Phyllotreta ochripes breeds on invasive garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara & Grande (Brassicaceae) and also non-native Rorippa amphibia (L.) Besser and other species of Brassicaceae. A species distribution model and the range of its host plant A. petiolata, indicates the most suitable conditions for this species are in humid areas of eastern North America. However, most of the known records of this species were discovered in areas projected to have low suitability. This is likely a consequence of sampling bias towards western Europe and away from the eastern Asian portion of its native range. The United States of America and Canada are now known to be home to 72 or more species of adventive Chrysomelidae.

AB  - Melatonin is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms and is implicated in seasonal reproduction in sheep. In several physiological mechanisms, it acts as an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory molecule, regulating energy metabolism. This work investigated the effects of melatonin implants at 30 days of age on locomotor activity (LA), body temperature, and growth of fattening female and male lambs. Sixty lambs were divided into two groups: one of which received melatonin (MEL, 15 males, 16 females) and a control group (CTR, 16 males, 14 females). In the melatonin group, two 18 mg melatonin implants were placed at 30 days of age. Lambs were fattened for 6 weeks from weaning (45 days of age) to slaughter (85 days). The feed conversion rate (FCR) was calculated based on live weight and the amount of concentrate consumed. LA was measured weekly by actigraphy, and circadian rhythmicity was calculated. Rectal (Trec) and surface temperatures (Tsur) were recorded in the last week of fattening, and subcutaneous fat thickness (FT) over the longissimus dorsi muscle was measured by ultrasound scanning. Treatment did not affect FCR, although MEL female lambs consumed significantly (P < 0.001) less concentrate than CTR lambs. Treatment and sex had a significant (P < 0.05) interaction effect on FT; specifically, FT was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in female MEL lambs (3.22 +/- 0.21 mm) than in female CTR lambs (2.57 +/- 0.24 mm), but FT in males did not differ between MEL (2.77 +/- 0.21) and CTR (2.94 +/- 0.24 mm) lambs. Overall activity was significantly (P < 0.001) lower in the MEL lambs (72.22 +/- 0.10 counts/min) than in the CTR lambs (78.89 +/- 0.12 counts/min). MEL lambs had a significantly (P < 0.01) lower Trec (CTR: 39.00 +/- 0.07; MEL: 38.68 +/- 0.10) and Tsur for all body regions evaluated than the CTR lambs. In conclusion, treatment with exo-genous melatonin at 30 days of age increased food efficiency in fattening female lambs, probably, because of the lower metabolism in treated lambs, which was reflected by the lower body temperature and LA exhibited by these animals. In addition, the study has demonstrated the effect of exogenous melatonin in the growth performances of post-weaning lambs, and that its effects depend on animal sex, which suggests that treatments that target females might be most appropriate in the fattening period.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The frequent use of antibiotics in artificial insemination promotes the development of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, alternatives must be considered. In this study, putative bioactive microalgae and hop extracts were examined to estimate their effect on quality and bacterial load of preserved porcine semen when used a lowtemperature storage at 5 degrees C in Androstar (R) Premium (ASP) extender (Minitiib). Firstly, five algae extracts (Neochloris oleoabundans (NEO), Pseudococcomyxa simplex (PSEY), Phormidium ambiquum (PHA), Schizochlamydella minutissima (SCH), Cyanidioschyzon merolae (CYA)) and one hop extract (Humulus lupulus (HOP)) in four concentrations (0.2, 2, 20 and 200 mu g/mL) were tested on their sperm-compatibility at 17 degrees C. All extracts in the concentrations 0.2 and 2 mu g/mL appeared to be sperm compatible. After 72 h of storage at 5 degrees C, variants showed an increase of total bacterial subcultures from 103 (ASP w/o supplements) to 113/136/135/136/126/118 (ASP w/NEO/PSEY/PHA/HOP/SCH/CYA). Even though bacterial growth was not inhibited in general, all extracts showed an antimicrobial effect on specific bacteria, including Gram-positive (Trueperella pyogenes, Streptococcus porcinus) and Gram-negative bacterial species (Alcaligenes faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ralstonia sp., Pasteurella sp., Proteus sp., Providencia stuartii, and Escherichia coli). While the proportion of these species was 10% in the control (ASP w/o supplements), their proportion in the supplemented variants ranged from 8% (NEO, HOP) to as low as 3% (PSEY). Although the tested extracts are not suitable to replace conventional antibiotics due to their lack of broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, they nevertheless present promising opportunities for bacteria-specific, customizable usage in boar semen extenders combined with antibiotics or other antimicrobial agents.

KW  - EXPRESSION
AB  - Early embryonic development relies on intricately regulated gene expression, and miRNAs influence zygotic genome activation (ZGA), cleavage, and cell fate determination through post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. miR-192 is expressed in early pig embryos and participates in various reproductive processes. However, its role in pre-implantation pig embryo development remains poorly understood. In this study, we microinjected the miR-192 agonist (miR-192 agomir) into parthenogenetically activated pig embryos to evaluate its effects on early pig embryo development. Our findings indicate that compared to the control group (agomir NC), miR-192 agomir impairs the developmental capacity of parthenogenetic pig embryos to reach the 2-cell, 4-cell, and blastocyst stages. This impairment leads to imbalances in the oxidative-reductive system and abnormalities in mitochondrial function during the 4-cell stage, resulting in the significant accumulation of ROS, notable decreases in the expression of antioxidant enzymes CAT and SOD1 mRNA, reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, and induction of apoptosis in pig blastocysts. Additionally, the overexpression of miR-192 inhibits the expression of its target genes YY1 and the pluripotency factor NANOG mRNA. In conclusion, this study reveals that the overexpression of miR-192 adversely affects early pig embryo development, providing new evidence for understanding the role miR-192 plays in reproduction.

AB  - Contrawise to mosquitoes, there is no country-wide long-term surveillance of ticks in Germany, leading to large gaps in coverage for distribution data. Here we report on results from two consecutive tick studies in northern Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany, conducted in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, a new focus of the ornate sheep tick Dermacentor marginatus was detected at a military training area east of Coblenz (,,Schmidtenh & ouml;he") which is partially managed as a nature reserve where old races of cattle and horses are grazing. Two unexpected further foci were discovered north and west of the city in 2024. In 2023, repeated flagging in a small area of a forest southwest of Coblenz ("Stadtwald") revealed four nymphs of the passerine bird tick Ixodes frontalis. However, over 99% of all flagged ticks turned out to belong to the species Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus, 1758).

AB  - Soil-borne Trichoderma spp. have been extensively studied for their biocontrol activities against pathogens and growth promotion ability in plants. However, the beneficial effect of Trichoderma on inducing resistance against insect herbivores has been underexplored. Among diverse Trichoderma species, consistent with previous reports, we showed that root colonization by T. virens triggered induced systemic resistance (ISR) to the leaf-infecting hemibiotrophic fungal pathogens Colletotrichum graminicola. Whether T. virens induces ISR to insect pests has not been tested before. In this study, we investigated whether T. virens affects jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and defense against fall armyworm (FAW) and western corn rootworm (WCR). Unexpectedly, the results showed that T. virens colonization of maize seedlings grown in autoclaved soil suppressed wound-induced production of JA, resulting in reduced resistance to FAW. Similarly, the bacterial endophyte Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84 was found to suppress systemic resistance to FAW due to reduced JA. Further comparative analyses of the systemic effects of these endophytes when applied in sterile or non-sterile field soil showed that both T. virens and P. chlororaphis 30-84 triggered ISR against C. graminicola in both soil conditions, but only suppressed JA production and resistance to FAW in sterile soil, while no significant impact was observed when applied in non-sterile soil. In contrast to the effect on FAW defense, T. virens colonization of maize roots suppressed WCR larvae survival and weight gain. This is the first report suggesting the potential role of T. virens as a biocontrol agent against WCR.

AB  - As an important task in precision breeding, accurately tracking dairy goats is essential for their disease prediction and abnormal behavior recognition. For efficiently capturing local features in Transformer and reducing the noise in the template of dairy goat, we develop an innovative dairy goat tracking algorithm that introduces an asymmetric fusion architecture and Kullback Leibler loss to improve accuracy and generate a low-noise template. Based on TrDiMP, we construct a fusion mechanism that embeds high-dimensional timing information into its evaluation branch to enhance discrimination ability. Then, we exploit an asymmetric attention mechanism to incorporate convolutional features of different sizes and raise the percentage of local linear information in smaller features. Finally, we incorporate Kullback Leibler divergence to train the loss between current frames and the goat template, guiding the template to conform to the probability density distribution of dairy goats and reducing noise. The AUC (Area Under Curve) and Precision of the improved TrDiMP reach 77.56% and 66.10%, respectively, which are 2.91% and 4.55% higher than that of TrDiMP. The average tracking speed of the improved TrDiMP is 14.90 FPS (frames per second), 0.36 FPS faster than that of TrDiMP. The overall results demonstrate that our model can track dairy goats and provide an effective approach to capture their dynamic movement in a real pasture.

AB  - Kazakh sheep are vital to the production system of the Barkol prairie. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of nano-copper oxide (Nano-Cu2O) on the antioxidant system of Cu-deficient Kazakh sheep in the Barkol prairie in Xinjiang, China. We analyzed mineral contents in soil, forage, and animal tissues. Blood parameters were also measured at the same time. The results showed that compared with healthy grassland, the Cu content in the soil and forage in Cu-deficient pastures was significantly lower than that in healthy grassland (P < 0.01). The Cu content in the blood, wool, and liver of Cu-deficient Kazakh sheep was significantly lower than that of healthy animals (P < 0.01). After Kazakh sheep were supplemented with Nano-Cu2O or CuSO4, the blood Cu concentration increased significantly (P < 0.01). From the 5th day, the Cu content of the Nano-Cu2O group was significantly higher than that of the CuSO4 group. The levels of hemoglobin (Hb), erythrocyte count (RBC), and packed cell volume (PCV) in the two experimental groups were significantly higher than those in Cu-deficient Kazakh sheep (P < 0.01). Compared with Cu-deficient Kazakh sheep, the serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) level of the two experimental groups increased significantly (P < 0.01), while the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) decreased significantly (P < 0.01). Compared with Cu-deficient Kazakh sheep, the activities of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in Nano-Cu2O and CuSO4 groups increased significantly (P < 0.01), while the level of serum malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased significantly (P < 0.01). Therefore, Nano-Cu2O could not only significantly increase the Cu content in the blood of Cu-deficient Kazakh sheep, but also greatly improve the antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Simple Summary Visna/Maedi is a disease caused by a small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV), with different symptoms in adult sheep such as pneumonia, arthritis, encephalitis and mastitis. SRLV infection in sheep is widespread across the world, with Europe showing the highest individual prevalence. There is currently no effective treatment for SRLV infections and, due to their constant changes, effective vaccine development has been and is still challenging. The dynamics of the sheep immune response to these virus infections is unclear, and changes in gene expression can help to explain the processes occurring in infected sheep. In this study, a gene expression microarray was used to identify the differentially expressed genes in infected and diseased sheep by comparing animals with different serologic statuses and with the presence of VM-characteristic clinical lesions in the lungs. The expression profile analysis revealed many interesting genes that may be associated with the viral infection process (such as OXT and a number of genes implicated in the Toll Like Receptors signaling network and complement pathway). This work improves our understanding of the sheep immune response against SRLVs. Visna/Maedi virus (VMV) is a lentivirus that infects the cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in sheep, goats and wild ruminants. Infection with VMV causes a multisystemic inflammatory disorder, which includes pneumonia, encephalitis, mastitis or arthritis. The immune response to VMV infection is complex, and the infection and pathogenesis of this virus are not totally characterized yet. In this work, a gene expression microarray was used to identify the differentially expressed genes in VMV infection and disease development by comparing sheep with different serologic status and with presence of VM-characteristic clinical lesions. The expression profile analysis has revealed many interesting genes that may be associated with the viral infection process. Among them, the OXT gene appeared significantly up-regulated, so the oxytocin-secreting system could play an essential role in VM disease. Moreover, some of the most significantly enriched functions in up-regulated genes appeared the complement pathway, which (in combination with the Toll-like receptor signaling network) could compose a mechanism in the VMV pathogenesis. Identifying the host genetic factors associated with VMV infection can be applied to develop strategies for preventing infection and develop effective vaccines that lead to therapeutic treatments.

AB  - Plant morphological attributes diversely affect the biocontrol agents of phytophagous insects. In the current study, the effect of physical plant features on life table characteristics and functional response of Orius albidipennis (Rueter) females feeding on Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) was investigated on two common wheat cultivars (Falat and Pishtaz) differing in leaf morphological features. The trichome density considerably influenced a broad spectrum of attributes related to the performance of O. albidipennis. Although Orius predators exhibited type III of functional response on both cultivars, they had lesser searching efficiency and higher handling time on Pishtaz than on Falat cultivar. The maximum attack rate was greater on Falat than on Pishtaz. Lesser maximum predation and greater handling time of the Orius predators on Pishtaz might be imputed to the significantly more condensed surface trichomes of its leaves than that of Falat leaves, which physically prevented movement of the bugs and decreased prey encounter rate. Moreover, an increase in trichome density negatively influenced the foraging behaviour of the predatory bug. Females were also found to prefer leaves with fewer trichomes as oviposition hosts. It seems that trichomes provided hindrance to the Orius bug. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was significantly greater on Falat than on Pishtaz cultivar. Similarly, the net reproductive rate and finite rate of increase were greater on Falat than on Pishtaz. To recapitulate, it could be stated that the efficiency of O. albidipennis in controlling S. graminum on wheat may be more beneficial in cultivars with lower trichome density.

AB  - IFITM2 is interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2, which plays an extremely key role in anti-tumor and anti-virus diseases. In this study, the 602 bp cDNA sequence of the yak (Bos grunniens) IFITM2 (BgIFITM2) gene was obtained. Moreover, the prokaryotic expression vector of BgIFITM2 protein was constructed and expressed successfully, with a molecular weight of 33.680 kDa. The proliferation activities and migration abilities of HepG2 cells were significantly inhibited after treatment with BgIFITM2 protein (0.1 and 1 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). The expressions of B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2)/BCL2-associated X (BAX) and molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes were significantly decreased, but the expressions of BAX gene were significantly increased after treatment with BgIFITM2 protein (0.1 and 1 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). The expression of BAX protein was also significantly increased after treatment with 1 mu g/mL BgIFITM2 protein (P < 0.05). Finally, the addition of BgIFITM2 protein attenuated the formation of tumor lesions in mice, and the pathological damage of the lung was less than that in the model group. The expression of Ki67 protein in the model group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05), but the expression of Ki67 protein in the BgIFITM2 group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.05). Taken together, BgIFITM2 protein could inhibit the proliferative activity of HepG2 cells by regulating apoptosis-related genes, and reduce the invasiveness of HepG2 cells in mice lung tissue. These results facilitate further studies on the function of BgIFITM2 protein.

AB  - Emotion regulation is integral to well-being and adaptive behavior. Differing regulation strategies have important downstream consequences. Evidence suggests that reappraisal use can improve memory and reduce emotional reactivity to previously regulated stimuli. Reappraisal is cognitively demanding and dependent on prefrontal-based cognitive control processes typically enhanced by motivation. We recently demonstrated that motivational incentives increased reappraisal use and decreased negative affect during emotion regulation. It is currently unknown how incentive manipulations of emotion regulation affect later memory and affective response: some accounts suggest that motivation boosts memory relatively automatically, via dopamine input to hippocampus, whereas others suggest that motivated memory might depend on control allocation at encoding. In a 2-day online study, we examined how motivated emotion regulation relates to downstream memory and affect. Participants completed an emotion regulation task under baseline and incentive conditions, with recognition memory and affect examined similar to 24-hours later. Surprisingly, for stimuli encountered under incentive, memory decreased, challenging the hypothesis that motivational enhancements of memory occur automatically. Additionally, Day 2 affect did not significantly differ for stimuli encountered in baseline and incentive contexts, suggesting that incentive-related affective benefits were short-lived. In contrast, reappraisal predicted increased memory and reduced negative affect upon reencounter. These results suggest that incentive may have promoted global, potentially automatic changes in affect, independent from regulatory control processes that also could lead to affective change. Further characterization of these multiple pathways will be important for advancing a mechanistic understanding of emotion regulation and its consequences across motivational contexts.

AB  - This review examines-with a focus on Peru-the distribution, life-history, ecology, fisheries, historic and contemporary cultural importance, commerce, and management of the Pacific guitarfish Pseudobatos planiceps. In the eastern Pacific, Peru represents its most important habitats. The only 2 identified Important Shark and Ray Areas for this species are in Peru for feeding purposes. Other critical habitats are unidentified (e.g. reproductive). Most demographic parameters are unknown, since only length-at-maturity and fecundity have been determined. This species is a mesopredator that feeds on benthic invertebrates but also on Peruvian anchoveta. This trophic plasticity is unique among species within this genus. Globally, Peru has one of the longest species-specific landing datasets (56 yr) and one of the largest catches among countries that report guitarfish landings. This dataset shows a 98% decrease in landings from a peak in 1981 to a low in 2004, while fishing effort increased during this period, suggesting that depletion occurred in the early 1980s. The Pacific guitarfish is the third most landed ray species by artisanal fisheries in Peru, mainly between the central and northern regions. Adults are mainly caught using gillnets and as bycatch in trawling fisheries. Mid-northern Peru has a millennia-old tradition in Pacific guitarfish capture and consumption, and catch is not regulated. Along its distributional range, fisheries in Peru are the main cause of population decline; therefore, there is an urgency to halt this trend to protect the Pacific guitarfish. This review establishes a baseline, identifies information gaps, and provides recommendations to guide research and management for the species.

AB  - Molybdenum (Mo), an essential mineral, plays a key role in the vital activity of the organism. However, excess Mo in the forage will cause loss of appetite, diarrhea, emaciation, bone injury, joint abnormalities, and anemia in animals. In order to study molybdenosis in the Procapra picticaudata in the animal rescue center, samples of soils, forages, blood, and liver were collected. The mineral contents of all samples were determined, and the blood parameters were also measured. The results showed that the Mo level in the soil and forage in the animal rescue center was significantly higher than that in healthy pastures (p < 0.01). The Mo concentrations in the blood and liver in the P. picticaudata from the animal rescue center were also noticeably higher than those in healthy animals (p < 0.01). The level of Cu in the blood and liver were noticeably lower than those in healthy P. picticaudata (p < 0.01). The superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and catalase (CAT) were significantly lower than those in healthy animals. Supplementing copper sulfate (CuSO4) could significantly decrease the Mo content in the blood, and cure molybdenosis. In summary, the excessive Mo content in the soil and forage in the animal rescue center had greatly affected physiological parameters and antioxidant capacity. It is likely that the molybdenosis of the P. picticaudata is caused by the high Mo contents in soils and forages. CuSO4 may alleviate molybdenosis in P. picticaudata.

AB  - Fasciola gigantica can modulate host immune mechanisms through excretory-secretory products (ESP). As one of the components of ESP, it is unknown whether Abelson tyrosine protein kinase (Abl) is involved in parasite-host immune interaction. To investigate the immunoregulatory function of Abl in Fasciola gigantica, we cloned and expressed the Fasciola gigantica Abl protein and assessed its effect on specific immune functions of buffalo peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Recombinant F. gigantica Abelson tyrosine protein kinase (rFgAbl) was expressed in Escherichia coli. Western blot analysis was performed to assess the reactivity of anti-rFgAbl antibodies with rFgAbl, serum from F. gigantica-infected buffalo, and excretion and secretion products of F. gigantica. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to determine the localization of FgAbl in tissues from larval stages and adult worms of F. gigantica. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis was utilized to evaluate the binding ability of the rFgAbl protein to buffalo peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as well as to investigate the effects of varying concentrations of rFgAbl protein (5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mu g/mL) on the functional responses of PBMCs. Anti-rFgAbl antibodies specifically recognize rFgAbl, serum from buffalo infected with F. gigantica, and FgESP. rFgAbl is localized in the cecum and capsule of juvenile worms, as well as in the testis and viellaria of adult worms. Additionally, rFgAbl enhances cell proliferation, migration, nitric oxide (NO) production, and phagocytosis, while also increasing the transcription levels of cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-12, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-beta). The results indicate that rFgAbl can influence the immune function of PBMCs. Further investigation into the immunomodulatory properties of the rFgAbl protein will enhance our understanding of the immune interaction mechanisms between trematodes and their hosts.

AB  - Min pigs, a prominent local breed from Northeast China, have diverged into two distinct breeds, Ermin (EM) pigs and Hebao (HB) pigs, through prolonged natural and artificial selection. Although these two breeds exhibit distinct differences in body size, the genetic mechanisms underlying this variation remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing and transcriptome analysis on EM and HB pigs to elucidate the genetic basis of body size variation in Min pigs through genome-wide selection signal analysis and the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The analysis of genetic diversity and population genetic structure across 14 pig breeds revealed that, compared with other breeds, Min pigs present relatively high genetic diversity and a unique genetic structure. Notably, EM pigs exhibited significant genetic differentiation from HB pigs. Integrated analysis of whole-genome resequencing and transcriptome data revealed candidate genes associated with body size variation in Min pigs, including ENPP1, ENPP3, SPP1, CLU, ITGA11, ITGB1, IQGAP2, BMP7, and F2RL2. These genes are enriched primarily in pathways related to ECM-receptor interactions; pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis; starch and sucrose metabolism; nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; pyrimidine metabolism; nucleotide metabolism; cellular responses to lipids; biomineral tissue development; biomineralization; and other pathways related to cell signaling, metabolic responses, lipid deposition, and skeletal development. Notably, ITGB1 on chromosome 10 showed strong positive selection in EM pigs, with an SNP locus exhibiting a significant G/A allele frequency difference between EM pigs (G = 52.94%, A = 47.06%) and HB pigs (G = 0%, A = 100%). Our findings suggest that Min pigs potentially modulate lipid metabolism efficiency in adipose tissue through variations in the expression of the ITGB1 gene, potentially contributing to body size differences. These results provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying body size variation in domestic pigs and serve as a valuable reference for identifying and breeding pig breeds with distinct body sizes.

AB  - Melatonin potentially regulates the female animal reproductive function, but its regulatory mechanism in the apoptosis of sheep endometrial epithelial cells (SEECs) remains to be elucidated. In the present study, immu-nofluorescence staining, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to detect the distribution of melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) in the uterus of sheep and the effect of melatonin via the receptor and non-receptor pathways on the apoptosis of SEECs in vitro. The results showed that melatonin inhibits the apoptosis of SEECs to varying degrees to regulate the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PGR) via its interaction with MT1 and MT2. In addition, the ER antagonist partially relieved the inhibitory effect of melatonin on the apoptosis of SEECs, while the PGR antagonist did not. Thus, melatonin mediates endometrial epithelial apoptosis through the MT receptors and also by regulating estrogen function. This study provides evidence of the regulatory mechanism of melatonin on the physiological function of the sheep uterus.

AB  - 1. Environmental surveillance can allow early detection of diseases, which increases management options and can improve disease trajectories. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids is a significant prion disease that has been spreading across North America since the 1960s, leading to cervid population declines and concern from hunters and state wildlife agencies. White-tailed deer have a unique breeding season behaviour called scraping, where they deposit urine and saliva at shared sites. Since both these fluids can contain CWD prions, scrape sites have the potential to serve as sentinel sites for environmental surveillance of CWD.
   2. To examine this potential, we used camera traps to monitor deer behaviour and collected environmental samples from 105 scrape sites. The 48 km2 study site was located at the centre of the CWD zone in southwestern Tennessee, where CWD prevalence is similar to 50%. We also sampled scrapes in northern Mississippi at the leading edge of the same CWD distribution to test the potential for early CWD detection using scrape sampling.
   3. From camera data, we identified 218 unique bucks visiting 105 scrapes, with a mean of 12.2 +/- 7.5 bucks per scrape (mean +/- SD, range 1-39) and individual bucks visiting a mean of 5.9 +/- 4.6 monitored scrapes each (range 1-23).
   4. Using real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), we detected prion seeding activity in 20% of the soil and 41% of the licking branches of the scrape sites within the CWD study area, and in 25% of the soil and 11% of the licking branches of scrape sites sampled at the edge of the known CWD distribution.
   5. Our data show there is environmental prion contamination at scrape sites. This supports the idea that scrapes could serve as early warning sentinel sites for CWD surveillance through testing soil and licking branches for prion seeding activity, especially in areas with limited access to harvested deer samples.

AB  - Recent climate change has produced a wide range of shifts in the phenology of species and consequent changes in the relationships among them. However, a dearth of studies exists that evaluates an entire trophic pyramid over an extended period. Here I characterize changes in several important variables on such a multitrophic suite of species, which contains two primary producers (sensitive and marsh ferns Onoclea sensibilis and Thelypteris palustris), one herbivore (caterpillars of the fern moth Herpetogramma theseusalis), one primary parasitoid (the braconid wasp Alabagrus texanus), and three facultative hyperparasitoids (including the eulophid wasp Aprostocetus sp.). I ask how the abundance of these species changes over time, how parasitism and mortality change along with the plants an herbivore selects, how the relationships between the different trophic levels change, and what effect these results play in the makeup of a trophic pyramid. Herbivores prospered most on sensitive fern, while levels of parasitism and mortality on herbivores and primary parasitoids remained relatively similar over the study period. However, facultative hyperparasitoids declined strikingly, and the few remaining individuals increased their exploitation of caterpillars (vs. Alabagrus), further decreasing the impact of the fourth trophic level. Since a previous study demonstrated that phenological change by these primary parasitoids exceeds that of their herbivore, further breakdown of the system appears likely.

AB  - Detecting animals to estimate abundance can be difficult, particularly when the habitat is dense or the target animals are fossorial. The recent surge in the use of thermal imagers in ecology and their use in animal detections can increase the accuracy of population estimates and improve the subsequent implementation of management programs. However, the use of thermal imagers results in many hours of captured flight videos which require manual review for confirmation of species detection and identification. Therefore, the perceived cost and efficiency trade-off often restricts the use of these systems. Additionally, for many off-the-shelf systems, the exported imagery can be quite low resolution (<9 Hz), increasing the difficulty of using automated detections algorithms to streamline the review process. This paper presents an animal species detection system that utilises the cost-effectiveness of these lower resolution thermal imagers while harnessing the power of transfer learning and an enhanced small object detection algorithm. We have proposed a distant object detection algorithm named Distant-YOLO (D-YOLO) that utilises YOLO (You Only Look Once) and improves its training and structure for the automated detection of target objects in thermal imagery. We trained our system on thermal imaging data of rabbits, their active warrens, feral pigs, and kangaroos collected by thermal imaging researchers in New South Wales and Western Australia. This work will enhance the visual analysis of animal species while performing well on low, medium and high-resolution thermal imagery.

AB  - Thirty-two Kiko crossbred male goats (10 mo old, BW = 42.2 +/- 2.28 kg) were offered a supplement containing 0, 25, 50, or 75% tannin-rich peanut skin (PS; Arachis hypogaea L.) to determine the effect of PS on physicochemical characteristics of goat meat (chevon). After a 57 d feeding trial, goats were harvested using the USDA standard procedures. After 24 h chilling storage (2 degrees C), Longissimus muscle (LM) pH was measured from individual carcasses and then were fabricated into primal cuts, and collected 2.5-cm thick loin chops and fat depots to analyze the physicochemical characteristics of chevon. The LM pH values of goats supplemented with the four different concentrations of PS were not significantly different. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in the carcass traits among experimental goats. Loin chops from goats supplemented with 75% PS had higher (P < 0.05) CIE L* (lightness), a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) values than those from goats fed 0% PS supplement (control). The LM from goats supplemented with 50% PS had a higher (P < 0.05) fat content than that from goats fed the control. Furthermore, the LM from goats supplemented with 25% PS had higher (P < 0.05) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values than that from goats fed the control. No significant differences were found in the Warner-Bratzler shear values and cooking losses of loin chops from goats supplemented with the four different concentrations of PS. Compared with goats fed the control, goats supplemented with 50% PS had a lower (P < 0.05) level of palmitic acid (C16:0) in the LM (intramuscular fat); and a lower (P < 0.05) level of myristic acid (C14:0), but a higher (P < 0.05) level of arachidic acid (C20:0) in the kidney fat. Furthermore, goats supplemented with either 25% or 75% PS had lower concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid (C18:2, CLA) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n6) or palmitoleic acid (C16:1n7) and vaccenic acid (C18:1n11, trans), respectively. The results indicated that supplementing tannin-rich peanut skin in the meat goats' diet might improve the appearance of chevon and increase its intramuscular fat content, whereas the resulting chevon might be more susceptible to the lipid oxidation.

AB  - The gut microbiota of the marine herbivorous fish Kyphosus sydneyanus are thought to play an important role in host nutrition by supplying short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) through fermentation of dietary red and brown macroalgae. Here, using 645 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from wild fish, we determined the capacity of different bacterial taxa to degrade seaweed carbohydrates along the gut. Most bacteria (99%) were unclassified at the species level. Gut communities and CAZyme-related transcriptional activity were dominated by Bacteroidia and Clostridia. Both classes possess genes CAZymes acting on internal polysaccharide bonds, suggesting their role initiating glycan depolymerization, followed by rarer Gammaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobiae. Results indicate that Bacteroidia utilize substrates in both brown and red algae, whereas other taxa, namely, Clostridia, Bacilli, and Verrucomicrobiae, utilize mainly brown algae. Bacteroidia had the highest CAZyme gene densities overall, and Alistipes were especially enriched in CAZyme gene clusters (n = 73 versus just 62 distributed across all other taxa), pointing to an enhanced capacity for macroalgal polysaccharide utilization (e.g., alginate, laminarin, and sulfated polysaccharides). Pairwise correlations of MAG relative abundances and encoded CAZyme compositions provide evidence of potential inter-species collaborations. Co-abundant MAGs exhibited complementary degradative capacities for specific substrates, and flexibility in their capacity to source carbon (e.g., glucose- or galactose-rich glycans), possibly facilitating coexistence via niche partitioning. Results indicate the potential for collaborative microbial carbohydrate metabolism in the K. sydneyanus gut, that a greater variety of taxa contribute to the breakdown of brown versus red dietary algae, and that Bacteroidia encompass specialized macroalgae degraders.

AB  - Nichols' common goby Rhinogobius cliffordpopei (Nichols, 1925) is a small-bodied benthic carnivorous fish, and native to central and southeast China. Due to the interregional commercial exchanges of aquaculture and aquatic trade, it has widely introduced numerous water bodies outside the original range in China, but has not been found in Tibet. During a fish survey in May 2022, we collected 22 individuals of R. cliffordpopei, including five juveniles, from four sites in the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet. This finding suggests that R. cliffordpopei has established wild populations in the Yarlung Zangbo. To protect the endemic species, government departments should strictly limit the release to reduce the potential risks of non-native species.

AB  - Simple Summary Cases of newborn connected twins, so-called Siamese twins, are well known in humans, laboratory mammals, domestic and wild birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. This report describes a unique case of newborn conjoined twins in guinea pigs (Cavia aperea f. porcellus). Connected twins in guinea pigs have been very rare, and there are only a few previous reported cases. This report is only the fourth described case of the birth of conjoined guinea pigs. They were born in breeding in the Czech Republic in 2020. The conjoined twins were males connected in the upper body by a cephalopagus-type connection, which has occurred in all three previous reports. The skeletons of both the bodies were connected by a broad shared skull and sternum. Both of the fused bodies had their own hearts and livers, but the lungs were mutual. The issue of this anomaly has not yet been clearly explained. The report describes a unique case of newborn conjoined twins in guinea pigs (Cavia aperea f. porcellus). Connected twins in guinea pigs have been very rare, and there are only a few previous reported cases. The newborns were stillborn in breeding in the Czech Republic in 2020 as two bodies conjoined into one. The external and internal structure of the body and the type of connection of both of the bodies are described. The weights of selected internal organs of the twins are compared with those of normally developed newborn guinea pigs.

AB  - Fluoride exposure has a detrimental effect on neurodevelopment, while the underlying processes remain un-known. The goal of this study was to investigate how fluoride impacts synaptogenesis, with a focus on the phosphorylation of Creb1 (p-Creb1)-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) pathway. We generated a sodium fluoride (NaF) model using C57 BL/6 J mice exposed to 100 mg/L NaF from gestation day 1 (GD1) to GD20. It was identified that NaF treatment impaired the learning and memory abilities of the male offspring, reduced dendritic spine density, lowered postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) and syn-aptophysin (SYN) expression in the male offspring's hippocampus, indicating that synaptic dysfunction may contribute to the cognitive impairment in the NaF model. In addition, in vivo experiment demonstrated that the protein abundance of BDNF and the ratio of p-Creb1 to Creb1 were increased in the hippocampus of NaF offspring, while the level of TrkB was reduced. Similarly, PC12 cells treated with NaF also showed increased expression of BDNF and decreased levels of TrkB. Notably, fluoride treatment increased p-Creb1 in vitro, while inhibiting p-Creb1 by 66615 significantly alleviated the effects of NaF exposure, indicating that p-Creb1 exerts a regulatory function in the BDNF-TrkB pathway. Altogether, these results demonstrated prenatal fluoride expo -sure triggered neurotoxicity in the male offspring hippocampus was linked to synaptogenesis damage caused by activating p-Creb1, which disrupted the BDNF-TrkB pathway.

AB  - The provision of opportunities to express rewarding behaviours is a promising concept to support a better quality of life for intensively farmed pigs. Play behaviour has been associated with excitement and fun, suggesting that playing animals experience pleasurable states. Pigs play intensively between 2 and 6 weeks of age and this decreases with age thereafter. To determine if the provision of play opportunities could enhance the quality of life of pigs, this study investigated if play can be promoted and sustained in pigs beyond the natural period of expression in a commercial setting. Whether play is positive for pigs and the effect of play on average daily gain and stress physiology was also explored. Growing pigs (n = 288, 10 weeks of age), housed in standard partly-slatted pens, were assigned to either a Control treatment with no play interventions (CON, 1 m(2)/pig); or to a Novelty (NOV) or Play pen (PLP) treatments, with play promotion between 10 and 21 weeks delivered through play sessions 3x/week. Play treatments received the intermittent provision of destructible novel objects provided either in the home pen (NOV, 1 m(2)/pig), or in an enclosed 'play pen' area providing extra space (PLP, 2.9 m(2)/pig). To understand if play is positive, the frequency and duration of anticipatory behaviour were recorded before play sessions, whilst play behaviour, along with indicators of emotional valence such as vocalization, tail, and ear postures, were recorded during play sessions on focal pigs (n = 144) at 11, 16 and 21 weeks. To explore the physiological response to play, saliva was collected pre and post play, and analysed for cortisol and alpha-amylase, and growth rate was calculated from trial entry and exit weights. Pigs in PLP and NOV played more frequently (p = 0.002) and for a longer duration of time (p < 0.001) across weeks compared to CON. NOV and PLP did not differ in play frequency and duration, except for week 21 when PLP played more frequently. Play treatments expressed more anticipatory behaviour and behavioural indicators associated with a positive experience (ears relaxed and forward, tail wagging, barks) compared to CON. Cortisol was elevated only in NOV compared to CON after the play session, but alpha-amylase and growth rate did not differ. Play was successfully promoted and sustained until the finishing period and equally expressed regardless of extra space. Pigs with play opportunities expressed indicators that play is a rewarding and motivating behaviour and could enhance the quality of life of farmed pigs when supported.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA virus in the Asfarviridae family and the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF). ASFV causes a hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in domestic and wild pigs. ASFV contains an open reading frame named EP152R, previous research has shown that EP152R is an essential gene for virus rescue in swine macrophages. However, the detailed functions of ASFV EP152R remain elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that EP152R, a membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), induces ER stress and swelling, triggering the PERK/eIF2 alpha pathway, and broadly inhibiting host protein synthesis in vitro. Additionally, EP152R strongly promotes immune evasion, reduces cell proliferation, and alters cellular metabolism. These results suggest that ASFV EP152R plays a critical role in the intracellular environment, facilitating viral replication. Furthermore, virus-level experiments have shown that the knockdown of EP152R or PERK inhibitors efficiently affects viral replication by decreasing viral gene expression. In summary, these findings reveal a series of novel functions of ASFV EP152R and have important implications for understanding host-pathogen interactions.

AB  - The neonatal increase in circulating luteinizing hormone (LH) is crucial for testicular development. In male pigs, blood LH levels start to increase approximately 1 week after birth and return to basal level by 5-6 weeks of age. This study tested the hypothesis that neonatal treatment with a combination of estrogens and androgens suppresses LH secretion and thereby inhibits testicular development. On Day 1 after birth, piglets received a slow-release implant containing estradiol (E-2, 8-40 mg) and trenbolone acetate (TBA, 40-200 mg) or remained intact. At 4 weeks of age, mean serum LH concentrations were similar to 7 ng/mL in untreated males, whereas pigs with implants had serum LH concentrations < 1 ng/mL. Despite this reduction, LH was still detected in the pituitary glands of treated pigs. Interestingly, neonatal castration also lowered circulating LH, highlighting the importance of testis physiology in the early establishment of the reproductive axis. The higher dose (20 mg E2 + 100 mg TBA) inhibited testis function more effectively, as evidenced by lower circulating testosterone concentrations compared to intact pigs. Furthermore, E2 + TBA treatment had a lasting impact on testicular growth, resulting in smaller testes at 26 weeks of age and the presence of immature Leydig cells. Overall, neonatal E2 + TBA treatment suppressed the postnatal LH rise and testicular growth until market age, offering a potential non-surgical alternative to castration in male pigs.

AB  - The northern Mediterranean reptiles and amphibians show contrasting biogeographic histories during the Plio-Pleistocene. The influence of European climate changes on the evolution of the biogeographic ranges of taxa with a rich fossil record is determined herein combining different proxies to obtain well-supported palaeoclimatic scenarios. Ecological Niche Modelling through the ensemble modelling approach was used to reconstruct the climatic niche of selected reptile and amphibian genera, combining modern occurrences with seven independent bioclimatic variables. The obtained model was then projected on past scenarios using fossil data to crosscheck the validity of the climatic explanation for the selective extirpations. Palaeobotanical proxies and the hypsodonty of mammals were used to reconstruct the humidity pattern of the last million years in the studied area. The climate of the Italian Peninsula during the Last Glacial Maximum was proved herein to be unsuitable for many reptile taxa, which persisted in this area until the Early or Late Pleistocene, whereas they survived till the present day in the Iberian and/or Balkans peninsulas. On the contrary, all the proxies agree that Italy was comparably more humid than the other peninsulas during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, therefore allowing the prolonged survival of amphibian taxa (including the still living Salamandrina and Speleomantes), which became extinct or extirpated elsewhere in Europe. An intensification of the conservation efforts concerning amphibians, particularly sensitive to the global climate change, is recommended in the Italian Peninsula, which acted as an amphibian refugium for Europe due to its peculiar climatic history.

This study focused on ticks found in a nature reserve in southern Italy, highly frequented for recreational activities and inhabited by wild boars. Using molecular techniques, 214 ticks, including questing ticks and those removed from wild boars, were examined for tick-borne pathogens (TBPs), with a focus on zoonotic pathogens. Six tick species were identified: Hyalomma lusitanicum, Rhipicephalus pusillus, Rh. sanguineus s.l., Rh. bursa, Rh. turanicus, and Dermacentor marginatus, several of which are known vectors of zoonotic pathogens. Overall, 14% of ticks were positive for TBPs, mainly bacteria of Rickettsia genus. Molecular analyses detected Rickettsia slovaca, R. massiliae, Candidatus R. shennongii, R. conorii, R. felis, and R. barbariae. Additionally, single detections of Coxiella burnetii and Theileria annulata were recorded. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on Rickettsia sequences. The range of ticks and TBPs present in this area highlights potential public health concerns. New associations between tick species and TBPs were documented, though vector roles need further investigation. The study highlights the importance of monitoring tick populations in both rural and urban environments to protect public health and prevent tick-borne disease spreading.

AB  - Simple Summary: The dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in economic animals affects food safety in our life cycle. The pig gut microbiome can be a reservoir of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. As a result of the comparison of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and the existence of ESBL genes, we found no difference between antibiotic- and nonantibiotic-using farms. We suggest a basal level of ESBL E. coli persistence on pig farms, which may not depend on antibiotic usage. Direct detection of antimicrobial-resistant genes from pig fecal samples reduced cumbersome bacterial culture processes. The enhanced sensitivity of the nPCR technique facilitates the surveillance of AMR genes, leading to effective control. The commensal Escherichia coli in the gut of pigs is a major reservoir of antimicrobial resistance and can result in possible transmission to humans through the food chain. Direct detection of E. coli from fecal samples is challenging and can be used as a bioindicator of antimicrobial resistance. This study aimed to compare the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles in commensal E. coli from antibiotic- and nonantibiotic-using pig farms and developed the direct detection of ESBL genes in pig fecal samples using nested PCR (nPCR) and multiplex PCR (mPCR) techniques. All direct genotypic results were validated with the results of PCR sequencing of isolated E. coli colonies. The ESBL-producing E. coli were found in 98.6% (145 isolates) and 96.6% (144 isolates) of antibiotic-using and nonantibiotic-using farms, respectively, predominantly CTX-M-55. The nPCR decreased the limit of detection (LOD) from sPCR about 100 times, and the lower LODs of 10(2), 10(1), and 1 CFU/mL were reached after incubating samples in an enrichment medium for 2, 4, and 8 h, respectively. The mPCR, sPCR, and nPCR techniques showed sensitivities of 30.15%, 69.85%, and 91.91%, respectively, compared to PCR sequencing. The stability and recycling of ESBL genes were independent of antibiotic usage in commensal E. coli originating in pig farms.

AB  - The present study was conducted to examine whether pretreatment with melatonin would enhance ovarian follicular functions and increase response to estrous synchronization and fixedtime AI (TAI) during the nonbreeding season in lactating dairy buffalo. In Experiment 1, buffalo cows without a detectable corpus luteum (CL) were assigned on Day-20 (D-20) to three groups: control (n = 12); melatonin (n = 13); progesterone (P-4) (n = 15). Cows in the melatonin group were implanted with melatonin on D-20. From D0 to D9, there was imposing of an estrous synchronization treatment regimen using either a standard Ovsynch protocol (control, melatonin) or a P-4-based Ovsynch treatment regimen (P-4). There were no differences (P > 0.05) among groups for the presence of a CL at D0, size of the largest follicle at D0, ovulation to GnRH injection at D0 and D9, or the time to ovulation after injection of GnRH at D9. In Experiment 2, there was imposing of the same treatment regimens as in Experiment 1, with inclusion of TAI. Females of the P-4 group had a greater (P = 0.001) pregnancy/AI percentage (60 %) than those in the control (17 %) and melatonin (23 %) groups. Females of the P-4 group also had a larger (P = 0.005) CL at D20 compared with those in the control and melatonin groups. Findings indicate treatment with melatonin for 20 days did not affect ovarian functions or the response to an estrous synchronization treatment regimen and TAI during the nonbreeding season in lactating dairy buffalo.

AB  - Regulatory sequences and transposable elements (TEs) account for a large proportion of the genomic sequences of species; however, their roles in gene transcription, especially tissue-specific expression, remain largely unknown. Pigs serve as an excellent animal model for studying genomic sequence biology due to the extensive diversity among their wild and domesticated populations. Here, we conducted an integrated analysis using H3K27ac ChIP-seq, H3K4me3 ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq data from 10 different tissues of seven fetuses and eight closely related adult pigs. We aimed to annotate the regulatory elements and TEs to elucidate their associations with histone modifications and mRNA expression across different tissues and developmental stages. Based on correlation analysis between mRNA expression and H3K27ac and H3K4me3 peak activity, results indicated that H3K27ac exhibited stronger associations with gene expression than H3K4me3. Furthermore, 1.45% of TEs overlapped with either the H3K27ac or H3K4me3 peaks, with the majority displaying tissue-specific activity. Notably, a TE subfamily (LTR4C_SS), containing binding motifs for SIX1 and SIX4, showed specific enrichment in the H3K27ac peaks of the adult and fetal ovaries. RNA-seq analysis also revealed widespread expression of TEs in the exons or promoters of genes, including 4 688 TE-containing transcripts with distinct development stage-specific and tissue-specific expression. Of note, 1 967 TE-containing transcripts were enriched in the testes. We identified a long terminal repeat (LTR), MLT1F1, acting as a testis-specific alternative promoter in SRPK2 (a cell cycle-related protein kinase) in our pig dataset. This element was also conserved in humans and mice, suggesting either an ancient integration of TEs in genes specifically expressed in the testes or parallel evolutionary patterns. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that TEs are deeply embedded in the genome and exhibit important tissue-specific biological functions, particularly in the reproductive organs.

AB  - Reverse cholesterol transport or cholesterol efflux is part of an extensive plasma membrane remodeling process in spermatozoa that is imperative for fertilization. For ram spermatozoa, sheep serum is well known to support in vitro fertilization (IVF), but knowledge of its explicit role is limited. Though, it is postulated to elicit cholesterol efflux owing to the presence of highdensity lipoproteins (HDLs) that interact with transmembrane cholesterol transporters, such as adenosinetriphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI). In this study, we report that both sheep serum and HDLs were able to elicit cholesterol efflux alone by up to 20-40% (as measured by the boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-cholesterol assay). Furthermore, when the antagonists glibenclamide and valspodar were used to inhibit the function of ABCA1 and SR-BI or ABCA1 alone, respectively, cholesterol efflux was only marginally reduced (8-15%). Nevertheless, it is likely that in ram spermatozoa, a specific facilitated pathway of cholesterol efflux is involved in the interaction between cholesterol acceptors and transporters. Interestingly, exposure to HDLs also induced hyperactivated motility, another critical event required for successful fertilization. Taken together, this study details the first report of the dual action of HDLs on ram spermatozoa, providing both an insight into the intricacy of events leading up to fertilization in vivo as well as demonstrating the possible application of HDL supplementation in media for IVF.

AB  - Simple Summary Goat's milk has beneficial effects on health condition maintenance, physiological function, and nutrition of both children and elderly people, and according to some authors, can be consumed without inducing adverse symptoms by people suffering from cow milk allergy. The content of bioactive ingredients (fatty acids, vitamins, micro, and macroelements) in goat's milk and its products varies greatly and depends on many factors, for example, breed, animal husbandry conditions, lactation phase, and feeding. The nutritional importance of goat's milk increases in response to the growing interest of consumers. In Poland, the commercial offer of goat's milk products increases constantly. Local breeders and sellers appear on the market, offering their products, often of organic origin. Despite the growing popularity of goat products, the knowledge of their composition, including their health-promoting ingredients, is still incomplete. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the contents of selected compounds, such as fatty acids, with particular emphasis on the content of cis9trans11 C18:2 (CLA) acid, minerals, and folates, in organic and commercial goat's milk and fermented goat's milk drinks available on the Polish market. The present study aimed to determine the content of health-promoting compounds, and fatty acids, with particular emphasis on the content of cis9trans11 C18:2 (CLA) acid, selected minerals, folates in organic and commercial goat's milk and fermented goat's milk drinks. The analyzed milk and yoghurts had various contents of particular groups of fatty acids, CLA, minerals, and folates. Raw organic goat's milk had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher content of CLA (3.26 mg/g fat) compared to commercial milk (2.88 mg/g fat and 2.54 mg/g fat). Among the analyzed fermented goat's milk drinks, the highest CLA content (4.39 mg/g fat) was determined in commercial natural yoghurts, while the lowest one was in organic natural yoghurts (3.28 mg/g fat). The highest levels of calcium (1322.9-2324.4 mu g/g), phosphorus (8148.1-11,309.9 mu g/g), and copper (0.072-0.104 mu g/g) were found in all commercial products and those of manganese (0.067-0.209 mu g/g) in organic products. The contents of the other assayed elements (magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, and zinc) did not depend on the production method, but only on the product type, i.e., the degree of goat's milk processing. The highest folate content in the analyzed milks was found in the organic sample (3.16 mu g/100 g). Organic Greek yoghurts had a several times higher content of folates, reaching 9.18 mu g/100 g, compared to the other analyzed fermented products.

AB  - Electric field-assisted composting technology is a novel and efficient approach to composting; however, it has various challenges, such as the emission of nitrogenous gases and limited electrical conductivity. This compost set up electric field assisted aerobic compost (CK), biochar (BC) + electric field assisted aerobic compost (T2) and FeBTC/BC+ electric field assisted aerobic compost (T1) respectively, and carried out compost experiments for 27 days. Purpose to develop a novel additive Fe-BTC/BC and examine its effects on nitrogenous gas emissions during electric field-assisted composting. Incorporating Fe-BTC/BC reduced NH3 and N2O emissions by 47.05 % and 19.83 %, respectively, compared with that of the control, and led to an increase in peak temperature from 66.4 degrees C to 71.2 degrees C and a shortened composting period from 16 d to 9 d. Microbiological analysis indicated that Fe-BTC/BC enhanced the abundance of nitrifying functional microbial community, such as Bacillus (from 24.09 % to 27.18 %), and reduced that of denitrifying functional microbial community (from 5.08 % to 3.91 %).RDA indicated that NH3 emission is in connection with nitrifying microbial community (Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Corynebacterium). In addition, reduction-oxidation (REDOX) activity was enhanced upon the addition of Fe-BTC/BC. These findings indicate that Fe-BTC/BC has a synergistic effect that improves nitrogen conversion efficiency by altering the abundance of microorganisms and accelerating electron transfer. This study provides an important scientific basis for the development of novel materials to reduce the emission of nitrogenous gases during electric field-assisted composting.

AB  - The aim of the experiment was to determine the effects of starch, neutral detergent fiber from forage (FNDF) levels and their interaction on milk yield, milk composition, methane production, and blood metabolites in lactating buffaloes. Sixteen multiparous Nili Ravi buffaloes (averaging 9 f 1.58 kg/d of milk yield, 5.00 f 1.61% of milk fat, 534 f 83 kg of BW, and 46 f 20 DIM, mean f SD at the start of the study) were enrolled and received 4 treatments with 2 different levels of FNDF according to a changeover design with 6-wk periods under restricted feed intake. Within each FNDF supply level, the buffaloes received 2 different starch levels of concentrate with 3-wk subperiods. Corresponding to the following treatments: (1) 39% FNDF and 33% starch, (2) 39% FNDF and 49 % starch, (3) 50% FNDF and 33% starch, and (4) 50% FNDF and 49% starch. Milk production was increased by 4.27%, when low FNDF was fed compared with high forage NDF. Milk fat and lactose yields were increased by 7.50, 14.6%, respectively, in low FNDF. Energy-corrected milk (ECM) was increased by 5.09% in low FNDF diets than high forage NDF. Predicted enteric methane intensity decreased with high starch and low FNDF level. It is concluded that milk production, milk fat, and lactose yield increased in early lactating buffaloes fed low FNDF compared to high FNDF. Production efficiencies also improved with the low FNDF diet. However, no interaction between FNDF and starch levels was observed for the parameters investigated.

AB  - Purpose : Floral waste, as a frequently overlooked resource for sustainable agriculture, can be harnessed to produce nutrient -rich soil amendments resulting in an enhancement of soil fertility and augment crop yields. This study was aimed to explore the potential of rose distillation waste and other organic amendments as sustain -able alternatives to traditional synthetic chemicals, particularly in the context of rose production. Method : The data was collected experimentally in a controlled greenhouse condition. A complete randomized block design with three replicates was applied to conduct the experimental units. The study investigated the combined effects of three organic amendments: goat manure rose distillation waste, and compost, as well as a bio-stimulant containing both Mycorrhizae and Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria. Results : Rose distillation waste proved to be a promising organic amendment with a significant positive effect on the growth and development of seedlings. Rose distillation waste substrate showed a remarkable increase in terms of leaf area and a maximum apical internode growth of 1.5 mm. The incorporation of bio-stimulant in the rose distillation waste substrate resulted in significant stem height growth of 11.3 cm and a high bud break rate of 73.3%. Conclusion : The findings of the study offer valuable insights into the sustainable management of rose production. The use of rose distillation waste as an organic amendment not only enhances plant growth but also positively impacts nutrient content in leaves. This highlights the potential of rose distillation waste as a sustainable and easily available resource for use in organic agriculture.

AB  - The aim of the present study was the characterization of three different types of cheese-whey (CW) effluents, originating from the production of different Greek goat and sheep cheese types, and the detailed design of CW based media for Chlorella biomass production. One of these CW originated from the primary stage (PCW) and two from the second stage (SCW) of cheese production. Initially, the experimental approach included the detailed characterization of these CW fractions by well established methods. On the second part of this work, CW-based media were designed and used for Chlorella biomass production. It has been shown through this study that CWs exhibit a high polluting potential by exhibiting a high concentration of solids (1.5-5.7 g L-1), organic carbon (25-34.1 g L-1) as well as biochemical and chemical oxygen demand (26-37.5 and 65.394.1 g L-1 respectively). Furthermore, CW types exhibited 0.79-2.52 g L-1 nitrogen, 366-549 mg L-1 phosphorous and 56.6-80.1 g L-1 lactose. Chlorella cultivation experiments showed that the addition of a trace minerals solution was crucial to achieve cell growth was. Chlorella cultivated in PCW exhibited high photosynthetic efficiency and the growth was comparable to that of control cultures. On the other hand, the increase of salt concentration in SCW caused a decrease of cell growth and photosynthetic efficiency. It was shown through this study that the detailed characterization of a wastewater type, as well as the detailed design of media, are the most important steps to achieve an algal biomass production, with perspective applications the valorization of CW.

AB  - Symbiotic gut microbiota in the herbivorous marine fish Kyphosus sydneyanus play an important role in digestion by converting refractory algal carbohydrate into short-chain fatty acids. Here we characterised community composition using both 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun-metagenome sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on lumen and mucosa samples (radial sections) from three axial sections taken from the hindgut of wild-caught fish. Both lumen and mucosa communities displayed distinct distributions along the hindgut, likely an effect of the differing selection pressures within these hindgut locations, as well as considerable vari-ation among individual fish. In contrast, metagenomic sequences displayed a high level of functional similarity between individual fish and gut sections in the relative abundance of genes (based on sequencing depth) that encoded enzymes involved in algal-derived substrate degradation. These results suggest that the host gut envi-ronment selects for functional capacity in symbionts rather than taxonomic identity. Functional annotation of the enzymes encoded by the gut microbiota was carried out to infer the metabolic pathways used by the gut microbiota for the degradation of important dietary substrates: mannitol, alginate, laminarin, fucoidan and galactan (e.g. agar and carrageenan). This work provides the first evidence of the genomic potential of K. sydneyanus hindgut microbiota to convert highly refractory algal carbohydrates into metabolically useful short-chain fatty acids.

AB  - Cardiac xenotransplantation is the potential treatment for end-stage heart failure, but the allogenic organ supply needs to catch up to clinical demand. Therefore, genetically-modified porcine heart xenotransplantation could be a potential alternative. So far, pig-to-monkey heart xenografts have been studied using multi-transgenic pigs, indicating various survival periods. However, functional mechanisms based on survival period-related gene expression are unclear. This study aimed to identify the differential mechanisms between pig-to-monkey post-xenotransplantation long- and short-term survivals. Heterotopic abdominal transplantation was performed using a donor CD46-expressing GTKO pig and a recipient cynomolgus monkey. RNA-seq was performed using samples from POD60 XH from monkey and NH from age-matched pigs, D35 and D95. Gene-annotated DEGs for POD60 XH were compared with those for POD9 XH (Park et al. 2021). DEGs were identified by comparing gene expression levels in POD60 XH versus either D35 or D95 NH. 1,804 and 1,655 DEGs were identified in POD60 XH versus D35 NH and POD60 XH versus D95 NH, respectively. Overlapped 1,148 DEGs were annotated and compared with 1,348 DEGs for POD9 XH. Transcriptomic features for heart failure and inhibition of T cell activation were observed in both long (POD60)- and short (POD9)-term survived monkeys. Only short-term survived monkey showed heart remodeling and regeneration features, while long-term survived monkey indicated multi-organ failure by neural and hormonal signaling as well as suppression of B cell activation. Our results reveal differential heart failure development and survival at the transcriptome level and suggest candidate genes for specific signals to control adverse cardiac xenotransplantation effects.

AB  - The lack of available genetic resources for species of conservation concern is a significant barrier to assessments of their genetic diversity, which can provide unique insights into population health, demography, and resilience. Highly variable microsatellite markers are typically developed de novo as part of population genetic studies and are rarely tested systematically for their broader applicability, limiting their potential use in a conservation context. Here, we develop a new panel of cDNA-linked microsatellite loci for the pot-bellied seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis), and systematically screen these loci, together with other available seahorse markers, across a taxonomically-diverse sample of seahorse species. We characterize panels of 7-24 microsatellite loci for all seahorses, including a variety of IUCN-listed species that have not yet been the target of genetic analysis, and use these loci to obtain baseline data on their genetic diversity. The comparative analysis of these data identifies a number of genetically-depauperate lineages that should be considered priority areas for more in-depth genetic assessment.

AB  - Nijhum Dweep National Park lacks a detailed inventory of aquatic fauna including fish. This study reported the diversity and abundance of fish along with their conservation status from the surrounding waters of the national park to fill the knowledge gap. Fish samples were collected randomly from 16 spots of surrounding water of the park between October 2017 and March 2018. There were 47 fish species recorded belonging to 10 orders, 27 families and 44 genera. Odontamblyopus rubicundus was the dominant fish species that comprised 20.24% of the total catch, followed by Rhinomugil corsula (15.54%), Mystus gulio (12.03%) and Eleutheronema tetradactylum (9.92%). One nationally Endangered fish species (Clupisoma garua) and three Vulnerable fish species (Gudusia chapra, Sicamugil cascasia and Wallago attu) were recorded. Fish diversity of the park was rich but exceeding extraction rate, huge disposal of by catch, and presence of exotic omnivorous fish species was disconcerting that require monitoring and further studies.

AB  - The use of organic acids from citrus plants such as lemon and lime as a coagulant in the making process of soft cheese has been widely practiced. However, the use of wuluh starfruit (Averrhoa bilimbi L.) is still very rarely done, especially in the making of cottage cheese from goat milk. Wuluh starfruit, which has a distinctive taste and aroma and is not shared by other citrus fruits, has the potential to be utilized in the making of cottage cheese. This study aimed to determine and study the effect of using a natural coagulating agent, wuluh starfruit juice as a coagulant in the process of making cottage cheese from goat milk from a local dairy farm. Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with six levels of treatment and three replications was used as the research design. The treatments were variations in the addition of wuluh starfruit juice, namely as follows: SKA0 = control, citric acid 0.4%, SKA1 = 10%, SKA2 = 20%, SKA3 = 30%, SKA4 = 40%, and SKA5 = 50%. Cottage cheese from treatment SKA3 was the most preferred by the panelists based on the organoleptic evaluation with an acceptability value of 5.66 +/- 0.84 (like moderately) and physicochemical properties of yield (26.43 +/- 1.13%), moisture (62.21 +/- 0.20%), ash (1.70 +/- 0.03%), protein (16.36 +/- 0.25), fat (18.28 +/- 0.19%), pH (3.66 +/- 0.02), vitamin C (224.36d +/- 0.01 mg/kg), antioxidant activity (69.44 +/- 1,60%) and salt (50.33 +/- 0.58 ppm).

AB  - Aggressive behavior of group-housed pigs seriously affects farm economy and animal welfare. Automatic and accurate recognition of aggressive behavior of group-housed pigs is thus important for farm production management. This study proposes a hybrid model that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to differentiate aggressive and other behaviors from surveillance videos. The CNN network served as a spatial feature extractor to learn appearance representations of behavior in each individual frame, while the GRU network served as a temporal feature extractor to learn motion representations of behavior in a behavior episode. More importantly, to focus on the saliency features in both the spatial domain and the temporal domain of behavior, a specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism was designed and integrated in the CNN-GRU hybrid model to improve the effect of aggressive behavior recognition. To evaluate the proposed model, a behavior video dataset consisting of 5530 behavior episodes about 10 piglets. The accuracy of the proposed hybrid model conducted on the test set were 94.8 %. The results showed that the proposed hybrid model integrated with spatio-temporal attention performed better than the model with an independent spatial or temporal attention and the model without attention mechanism, and achieved a competitive performance of aggressive behavior recognition over the state-of-the-art approaches. We shared our behavior video dataset at htt ps://github.com/IPCLab-NEAU/Aggressive-Behavior-Recognition for precision livestock farming research community.

AB  - DNA synthesis and methylations are crucial during pre-implantation embryonic development, and are mediated by one-carbon metabolism of folates. Folates, transported into the cells via folate receptors (FOLR1 and FOLR2) and carriers (SLC19A1), are metabolized by various enzymes involved in folate-methionine cycle. However, the variations in temporal expression of folate transporters and folate-methionine cycle enzymes during preimplantation embryo development is obscure. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the differential expression of the genes for folate transporters and folate-methionine cycle enzymes. We also examined the expression of folate transport proteins in different pre-implantation development stages. Immature buffalo oocytes were matured in maturation medium followed by in vitro fertilization and culture at standard culture conditions. The temporal pattern of gene expression in buffalo, when compared to previous studies, indicated an inter-specific variation. The transcripts of some enzymes and folate transporters were significantly upregulated after zygotic genome activation. The transcripts as well as proteins for FOLR1, FOLR2 and SLC19A1 were present in oocytes and all the pre-implantation embryo stages. FOLR1 was present in the nuclei of different stages of developing embryos but not in the metaphase (MII) oocytes. As a result, the present study advocates the existence of active folate transport in buffalo oocytes and pre-implantation embryos. The data provided by the analysis of differential gene expression of folate transporters and metabolic enzymes would likely contribute to a better understanding of the role of folates in embryo development as well as advancements in assisted reproductive technologies.

AB  - Simple Summary Feedlotting lactating goats is a strategy to improve their productivity and the quality of their milk and dairy products. However, feedlotting is associated with increases in production costs, due mainly to the concentrate component of the diet. The use of agro-industrial byproducts allows the reduction of feed costs by replacing costly ingredients, as the former are more easily accessible. We tested the dietary inclusion of palm kernel cake (PKC), a byproduct of the biofuel industry, at the levels of 0, 80, 160 and 240 g kg(-1), to evaluate its impact on the qualitative aspects of milk and cheese. The inclusion of up to 80 g kg(-1) PKC is recommended for the diet of goats whose milk will be used in the production of Minas Frescal cheese. We investigated the effect of including palm kernel cake (PKC) at the levels of 0, 80, 160 and 240 g kg(-1) in the diet of lactating goats on the quality and sensory parameters of Minas Frescal cheese. Twelve goats were used in a triple 4 x 4 Latin square design. The dietary addition of PKC was associated with a reduction in moisture (p = 0.004), which compromised the cheese yield (p = 0.030). The ether extract content showed a quadratic response. There was a decrease in caproic (p = 0.014), caprylic (p = 0.011), capric (p = 0.003) and palmitic (p = 0.049) acids and an increase in lauric (p = 0.012) and myristic (p = 0.02) acids. Monounsaturated fatty acids increased (p = 0.008), whereas the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (p = 0.022) and thrombogenicity index (p = 0.023) decreased. Principal component analysis indicated that control treatment and the treatment with 80 g kg(-1) PKC were the most acceptable to the cheese tasters. The use of palm kernel cake is a good alternative for lactating goats when added to the diet at levels up to 80 g kg(-1).

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning is a stressful period for pigs that causes gastrointestinal disruption and low growth rates. For a long time, zinc oxide at pharmacological doses, along with different antibiotics, has been used prophylactically during this phase to reduce the incidence of these gastrointestinal problems. Nowadays, the increasing concern about the environment, along with the global and constant growth of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, has led to the prohibition of the prophylactic use of zinc oxide in diets for piglets in the EU, along with the implementation of new regulations on the use of antibiotics. Consequently, the pig sector faces the important challenge that supposes developing alternatives to the classical system based on the use of these antimicrobial compounds. This study is the first step to achieving this goal by minimizing the use of various antibiotics and zinc oxide in weanling pigs by supplementing citrus flavonoids and only one antibiotic (amoxicillin). Accordingly, the influence of zinc oxide plus antibiotics and citrus flavonoids plus amoxicillin in weaned pigs has been investigated and its impact on growth performance, gut microbiology profile, gut signaling, intestinal architecture, and serum biomarkers indicative of stress and inflammatory responses have been evaluated. Citrus flavonoids plus amoxicillin improved growth performance and gut health, evidencing a positive microbial modulation, stress status reduction, and a positive effect on the gastrointestinal barrier, and other digestive functions. Additionally, the expression of some bitter taste receptors in the intestine has been increased when supplementing both dietary strategies, the one based on zinc oxide or the one based on citrus flavonoids supplementation. Consequently, the present study shows that in weanling piglets, the supplement of citrus flavonoids with amoxicillin might be a promising alternative to the dietary use of pharmacological doses of zinc oxide with more than two antibiotics, therefore minimizing the use of antimicrobial compounds without detrimental effects on performance. Since citrus flavonoids have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, it was hypothesized that these compounds would become a suitable alternative to the use of therapeutic doses of zinc oxide at weaning. A total of 252 weaned pigs ([LargeWhite x Landrace] x Pietrain) were distributed according to BW (5.7 kg +/- 0.76) into 18 pens (6 pens per diet, 14 pigs/pen). Three experimental diets for the prestarter (0-14 d postweaning) and starter (15-35 d postweaning) period were prepared: (i) a nonmedicated (CON) diet, (ii) a CON diet supplemented with zinc oxide at 2500 mg/kg, amoxicillin at 0.3 mg/kg and apramycin at 0.1 mg/kg (ZnO), and (iii) CON diet with the addition of a commercial citrus flavonoid extract at 0.3 mg/kg and amoxicillin at 0.3 mg/kg (FLAV). Pig BW, ADG, ADFI, and FCR were assessed on d7, d14, and d35. Samples of intestinal tissue, cecal content, and serum were collected on day seven (18 piglets). FLAV treatment achieved greater BW and ADG during the starter and for the entire experimental period compared with the CON diet (p < 0.05), whereas ZnO pigs evidenced intermediate results. Jejunum tissue analysis showed that pigs fed the FLAV diet overexpressed genes related to barrier function, digestive enzymes, and nutrient transport compared to those pigs fed the CON diet (p < 0.05). An increase in the abundance of bacterial genera such as Succinivibrio, Turicibacter, and Mitsuokella (p < 0.
   05) was observed in the FLAV compared with the CON and ZnO piglets. ZnO and FLAV increased the expression of TAS2R39, while ZnO pigs also expressed greater TAS2R16 than CON (p < 0.05) in the intestine. FLAV treatment improved the gut function, possibly explaining a higher performance at the end of the nursery period. Consequently, citrus flavonoids supplementation, together with amoxicillin, is a promising alternative to the use of zinc oxide plus amoxicillin and apramycin in weanling pigs, minimizing the use of antibiotics.

AB  - The Late Pleistocene archaeological record in the Turkana Basin is important for studying Homo sapiens evolution, but the record in this region is poorly documented, despite a long history of significant paleoanthropological discoveries. Ambiguity around ages and site formation processes are paramount problems. We investigated the chronometric, geological, archaeological, and paleoenvironmental context of GaJj17, a locality with an artifact-bearing deposit in the Koobi Fora region. Sedimentological facies analysis coupled with micromorphological evidence indicate the depositional environment at the site changed over time from a fluvial system to an aeolian one, forming the remnant lunate feature seen today. Caliche caps the site and likely mitigated erosion of the site during high lake stands; similar deposits (similar to 25 m(2)) are found within a 2 km radius and are archaeologically sterile. Optically stimulated luminescence dating indicates the deposit and associated artifacts and fossils were emplaced circa 52-43 thousand years ago. Small (average length similar to 3.5 cm) flakes dominate the stone artifact assemblage and include unretouched triangular flakes on diverse raw materials indicating shared affinity with Middle and Late Pleistocene lithic toolkits elsewhere in eastern Africa. Hippopotamus, crocodiles, and fish are well-represented in the faunal assemblage, along with a small sample of terrestrial ungulate specimens. More taphonomic research to understand the accumulating agent(s) of the faunal assemblages is needed. These results contribute to our understanding of Late Pleistocene archaeological site formation processes in lacustrine contexts of the Omo-Turkana Basin.

AB  - Two variants of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), PRRSV 1 and PRRSV 2, have caused abortion in pregnant sows and respiratory distress in nursery pigs worldwide. PRRSV 2 has been thoroughly researched in Taiwan since 1993; however, the first case of PRRSV 1 was not reported until late 2018. To decipher the genetic characteristics of PRRSV 1 in Taiwan, open reading frame 5 (ORF5) genes of PRRSV 1 strains collected from 11 individual pig farms in 2019-2020 were successfully sequenced. All Taiwanese ORF5 sequences were closely related to Spanish-like PRRSV strains, which are considered to share a common evolutionary origin with the strain used for the PRRSV 1 vaccine. Analyses of amino acid (aa) and non-synonymous substitutions showed that genetic variations resulted in numerously specific codon mutations scattered across the neutralizing epitopes within the ORF5 gene. The PRRSV 1 challenge experiment disclosed the pathogenetic capability of the NPUST2789 isolate in nursery pigs. These findings provide comprehensive knowledge of the molecular diversity of the PRRSV 1 variant in local Taiwanese fields and facilitate the development of suitable immunization programs against this disease.

AB  - The study of human and animal paleodiets, representing the unique subsistence strategies and human-environment interactions adopted over evolutionary time, has attracted intensive research attention. Historically, the western Loess Plateau (WLP) served as a key area for the evolution of human-land relationship. The human subsistence patterns in the WLP changed significantly from prehistoric to historical periods based on archaeobotanical data. However, the trajectory and influencing factors of ancient human and animal diets in the WLP remain unclear, mainly due to the lack of isotopic data in the upper reaches of the Wei River. In this paper, we reported 172 human and animal isotope samples (C and N) and 23 radiocarbon dates from three sites in the middle-lower reaches of the Hulu River Valley (HRV). At least three periods of dietary patterns for humans were observed in the WLP from the late Neolithic to Ming Dynasty. During 5300-4000 Before Present (BP), humans and domesticated animals such as pigs and dogs consumed a greater proportion of millets and millet byproducts. Between 3000 and 2200 BP, the diets of pigs and dogs remained largely comprised of C-4 foods, while humans consumed both C-3 and C-4 foods, which contradicted the evidence of an overwhelming proportion of wheat and barley (C-3 crops) from the contemporaneous cultural sediment. The contradictions between plant remains and human diets are probably related to geopolitical factors. Between 1000-500 BP, human diets were more diverse and heterogeneous in this region. Combined with environmental and archaeological evidence, the changes in diets and subsistence strategies over the three periods can be attributed to the comprehensive influence of regional cultural development, geopolitics and technological innovation. This paper not only reveals the trajectory and influencing factors of ancient human and animal diets in the middle-lower HRV, but also explores how subsistence strategies, particularly in terms of dietary structure, will change in the context of cultural exchange and diffusion, and emphasizes the important influence of geopolitical interactions in the WLP.

AB  - Simple Summary Rumen development is important to the health and performance of ruminants. The proteins YAP1 and TAZ are key regulators of the mammalian epithelium. However, it is unclear whether YAP1/TAZ mediates the development of rumen epithelium. Therefore, we assessed the effects of YAP1/TAZ on rumen epithelial cell proliferation. Sodium butyrate is a nutrient that can be used to promote rumen development. We also assessed whether sodium butyrate mediated rumen epithelial development through the activation of YAP1/TAZ. The results indicated that YAP1/TAZ activation could promote rumen epithelial cell proliferation but not short-chain fatty acid metabolism, and sodium butyrate did not function in a YAP1/TAZ-dependent manner.Abstract Promoting rumen development is closely related to the health and efficient growth of ruminants. The transcriptional co-activators Yes1-associated protein (YAP1) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (TAZ) are key regulators of the mammalian epithelium. In the present study, we assessed the impact of YAP1/TAZ on rumen epithelial (RE) cell proliferation using their activator GA-017 (GA) and inhibitor verteporfin (VP). We also investigated whether YAP1/TAZ-dependent alteration was involved in the RE developmental process induced by sodium butyrate (SB). The results indicated that GA promoted RE cell proliferation, while VP disrupted RE cell proliferation. The Hippo, Wnt, and calcium signaling pathways were altered following the regulation of YAP1/TAZ. Upon YAP1/TAZ activation, the expression of CCN1/2 increased. However, when YAP1/TAZ was inhibited, the expression of BIRC3 decreased. In the SB-treated cells, YAP1/TAZ-induced changes were not observed. SB increased the expressions of differentiated cell marker genes and genes involved in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, while YAP1/TAZ did not. Thus, YAP1/TAZ could be potential targets for regulating RE cell proliferation but not for SCFA metabolism. SB could not affect YAP1/TAZ. These findings broaden our understanding of the role of YAP1/TAZ and their regulators in RE development.

AB  - In precision feeding, non-contact and pressure-free monitoring of sheep feeding behavior is crucial for health monitoring and optimizing production management. The experimental conditions and real-world environments differ when using acoustic sensors to identify sheep feeding behaviors, leading to discrepancies and consequently posing challenges for achieving high-accuracy classification in complex production environments. This study enhances the classification performance by integrating the deep spectrogram features and acoustic characteristics associated with feeding behavior. We conducted the task of collecting sound data in actual production environments, considering noise and complex surroundings. The method included evaluating and filtering the optimal acoustic features, utilizing a customized convolutional neural network (SheepVGG-Lite) to extract Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms and Constant Q Transform (CQT) spectrograms' deep features, employing cross-spectrogram feature fusion and assessing classification performance through a support vector machine (SVM). Results indicate that the fusion of cross-spectral features significantly improved classification performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.47%. These findings highlight the value of integrating acoustic features with spectrogram deep features for accurately recognizing sheep feeding behavior.

AB  - The aim of the first study was to determine the influence of the calf handling (restricted or full contact) and fenceline bull stimulation on performance of mothers and their calves. The aim of the second study was to determine the relative impact of calf-bull contact, comparing the result of restricted calf and no bull with that of fenceline calf contact and direct bull contact on the performance of mother buffaloes and their calves. In Experiment 1, 24 mother-calf dyads were allocated to three treatments: NCB (no calf-mother-bull contact), RC-FBC (restricted calf and fenceline bull contact) and FC-FBC (fenceline calf and fenceline bull contact). In Experiment 2, another 24 mother-calf dyads were allocated to two treatments: RC-NB (restricted calf and no bull contact) and FC-DBC (fenceline calf and direct bull contact). In Experiment 1, average daily gain (ADG) was greater in FC-FBC than RC-FBC and NCB calves (p < .05). Average dry matter intake (DMI) was greater in FC-FBC than RC-FBC and NCB calves. DMI of buffaloes was greater in FC-FBC than RC-FBC and NCB. Daily milk yield of buffaloes was more (p < .05) in FC-FBC (10.2 +/- 0.2 kg) than RC-FBC (8.4 +/- 0.2 kg) and RC-FBC (7.8 +/- 0.2 kg). There were no statistical differences observed in the interval from calving to first oestrus, first service, service period among three groups. In Experiment 2, ADG's and DMI were greater in FC-FBC calves than RC-FBC (p < .05). DMI of buffaloes was greater in FC-DBC than RC-NBC (p < .05). Daily milk yield of buffaloes was greater (p < .05) in FC-DBC (11.6 +/- 0.2 kg) than RC-NBC (8.3 +/- 0.2 kg). The first oestrus (51.5 +/- 3.1 vs. 103.2 +/- 7.2), days to first service (74.8 +/- 3.5 vs.112.0 +/- 7.6) and service period (78.8 +/- 4.8 vs.118.9 +/- 8.3 days) were lower (p < .05) in FC-DBC than RC-NBC buffaloes. The fenceline calf-mother contact increased the growth rate, FCR, and feeding efficiency of buffalo calves; reduced some stress responses and improved the productive performance of buffalo mothers. Further, mother-bull contact stimulated the post-partum reproductive performance of buffaloes in fenceline calf contact.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the dietary effects of replacing corn with different proportions of fermented straw on the growth performance and intestinal health of finishing pigs. A total of 275 healthy commercial finishing pigs aged 126 days (average body weight, 82.96 +/- 3.07 kg) were randomly allocated into three groups: the control (CTR, basal diet) group, the 5% fermented straw (FJJG5, replacing 5% of the corn) group, and the 10% fermented straw (FJJG10, replacing 10% of the corn) group. There were six replicates in each group and 14-16 pigs per replicate. On day 39 of the experiment, one animal from each replicate was slaughtered for sampling and for further analysis. The results showed that the finishing pigs in the FJJG10 group had a reduced average daily weight gain and an increased feed-to-gain ratio. The FJJG5 group had reduced total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein in their serum, while the FJJG5 and FJJG10 groups had reduced contents of lactate dehydrogenase. In addition, the FJJG5 group exhibited increased T-SOD activity and MDA content in the colon, while the FJJG10 group also showed increased T-AOC activity in their serum and increased contents of MDA in the colon. The FJJG5 group exhibited increased activities of jejunal disaccharidase and lipase, while the FJJG10 group exhibited decreased jejunal crypt depths. Moreover, the FJJG5 group presented an increased relative expression of APOA4, LPL, and MUC2 but decreased SLC7A7 and IL-10 in the jejunum and APOA4 in the colon. The FJJG10 group exhibited a decreased relative expression of SLC7A7 and IL-10 in the jejunum and decreased MMP13, KCNJ13, APOA4, SLC7A7, LPL, and IL-10 in the colon. Furthermore, the FJJG5 group exhibited an increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus in colon contents, while the FJJG10 group had a reduced relative abundance of streptococcus. In conclusion, 5% fermented straw can improve the lipid metabolism and colon microbiota structure of finishing pigs, while 10% fermented straw has adverse effects on the growth performance and intestinal health of finishing pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary: The aphid species Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae is a highly polyphagous pest that poses a significant threat to global agriculture. Biological control using natural enemies, such as the harlequin ladybird (Harmonia axyridis), is important for managing this pest. Our study evaluated the predation ability of H. axyridis in controlling R. nymphaeae. We examined the functional and numerical response of larva and adult H. axyridis preying on R. nymphaeae. Our results showed that the predation rate of individual H. axyridis on R. nymphaeae nymphs significantly increased as prey density increased. It was noted that fourth instar and adult H. axyridis were identified as optimal developmental stages in controlling R. nymphaeae. In addition, variations in intraspecific interference and self-interference exhibited by H. axyridis under increasing predator density were observed. The water lily aphid (Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae) is a highly polyphagous herbivore that causes severe damage to many terrestrial and aquatic plants, especially lotus. Due to environmental concerns about water pollution and other issues caused by chemical control methods, there is an urgent need to develop effective and sustainable control methods. The harlequin ladybird (Harmonia axyridis) is a well-known aphid predator and may pose a potential threat to R. nymphaeae. To study the predation ability of H. axyridis at different developmental stages on R. nymphaeae, we assessed the functional response, attack rate, and search effect of H. axyridis larvae and adults preying on R. nymphaeae. The numerical response of this process was also evaluated under a constant ladybird-to-aphid ratio and constant aphid density conditions, respectively. Our results showed that all predator stages exhibited type II functional responses. The predation rate of individual H. axyridis on R. nymphaeae nymphs significantly increased as prey density increased. In contrast, the search effect of H. axyridis gradually decreased with an increase in prey density. Meanwhile, H. axyridis at different developmental stages possess varying predation abilities; fourth instar and adult H. axyridis were found to be highly efficient predators of R. nymphaeae. H. axyridis adults exhibited the highest predation ability and predation rate, while both the adult and fourth-instar larvae exhibited the highest attack rate. Moreover, fourth-instar larvae exhibited the highest search effect value at initially lower prey densities, although adults surpassed them at higher prey densities. Our results also indicated that H. axyridis exhibited varying degrees of intraspecific interference and self-interference influence as predator density increases. These results strongly support H. axyridis as an effective biocontrol agent for R. nymphaeae.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of male goat kid breeds on the basic chemical, fatty and amino acid composition, colour and sensory evaluation of fresh meat. The meat of the Carpathian kids was characterised by a lower content of protein and cholesterol, and a higher content of fat. Despite the higher collagen content, the meat was characterised by lower shear force, less hardness and chewiness, being a more delicate meat compared to the meat from Saanen goats. The meat of native goats was higher concerning the content of phenylalanine, histidine, proline, alanine and tyrosine, as compared to the meat of the Saanen goats. The fat of Carpathian goat meat was characterised by a higher content of monounsaturated acids and a more favourable (lower) saturation index. Goats provide valuable products that are appreciated by consumers who are looking for food that is not only tasty but also healthy, and, probably, one of them is goat meat. Breeding of local breeds such as the native Carpathian goat has been gaining importance in recent years, which creates an opportunity for the development of the goat meat market. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of goat breed on the basic chemical, fatty and amino acid composition, colour and sensory evaluation of meat. The research material consisted of Carpathian goats from the NRIAP experimental plant located in the southern part of Poland, and goats from a farm keeping Saanen goats in south-eastern Poland. Ten male goat kids from each breed were taken to the NRIAP farm. The quality of meat obtained from the leg (m. biceps femoris) of male goat kids about 150 days old at slaughter was analysed. The meat of the Carpathian goat was characterised by a lower content of protein and cholesterol (p < 0.01), and a higher content of fat and general collagen compared to the meat from Saanen goats (p < 0.05). Cholesterol content in goat meat of both breeds was similar and ranged from 55.08 mg/100 g (Carpathian) to 56.79 mg/100 g (Saanen). Despite the higher collagen content, the goat meat of Carpathian breeds was characterised by lower shear force, less hardness (p < 0.05) and chewiness, being a more delicate meat. The fat of Carpathian goat breeds was characterised by a higher content of monounsaturated acids, mainly C 18:1n:9, and a more favourable (lower) saturation index, S/P (p < 0.05). The meat of Carpathian goats was characterised by a higher health-promoting quality compared to the meat from Saanen goats. In the goat meat of both breeds, there were no differences between the total content of exogenous and endogenous amino acids. The essential/nonessential amino acids (EAA/NEAA) ratio in the meat of the analysed breeds was 0.88:0.89. However, the meat of the Carpathian goats was statistically significantly higher concerning the content of phenylalanine, histidine, proline, alanine and tyrosine, as compared to the meat of the Saanen goats. The obtained results confirm the high quality of the meat of the local Carpathian breed in comparison to the Saanen breed.

AB  - Organic fertilizers could be useful for agricultural sustainability. Therefore, this study explored green cultivation techniques to improve the grain yield of oilseed flax in dry areas of the Loess Plateau of China. With no fertilization (CK) as the control, the effects of sheep manure (S1: 12.5 t ha-1; S2: 25 t ha-1), poultry manure (C1: 5.8 t ha-1; C2: 11.6 t ha-1), and chemical fertilizers (F1: N 112 kg ha-1, P 75 kg ha-1, K 67.5 kg ha-1; F2: N 225 kg ha-1, P 150 kg ha-1, K 135 kg ha-1) on the growth and development, the grain filling characteristics, and the yield of the Zhangya 2 oilseed flax (Linum usitatisimum L.) variety were compared and analyzed based on a two-factor split plot experiment. The results showed that the application of manure significantly increased the emergence rate (ER) of oilseed flax. Poultry manure increased plant height while sheep manure increased stem diameter. The dry matter production was higher in the 25 t ha-1 sheep manure treatment by 2.47-40.11% compared with that of the other treatments, and it promoted the distribution ratio of dry matter to grains after anthesis. The observed relationship was in accordance with that presented by the logistic equation between grain weight and days after anthesis, and there were significant positive correlations between the 1000-grain weight and the average filling rate (V-ave), the maximum filling rate (V-max), and the growth at the maximum filling rate (W-max). The application of organic manure accelerated the grain filling rate (GFR); under the treatment with 25 t ha-1 sheep manure, V-ave, V-max, and W-max increased by 4.84-22.72%, 1.16-17.54%, and 4.58-22.63%, respectively, and the grain yield and the net income per unit area increased by 6.35-39.25% and 3.04-95.07%, respectively, compared with those under the other treatments. Consequently, the treatment with 25 t ha-1 sheep manure can significantly promote the growth and development of oilseed flax plants, optimize the grain filling characteristics, and increase the grain yield and net income, making it a suitable fertilization technique for oilseed flax in dry areas of the Loess Plateau of China.

AB  - In Pamplona pea production is based on the use of high doses of chemical fertilizers that cause environmental damage and human health. Therefore, in this study the effect of different organic fertilizers was compared with chemical fertilization through six treatments: T0: control; T1: vermicompost full dose (7831,00 kg/ha); T2: vermicompost half dose (3915.50 kg/ha) + chemical fertilizer (FQ 15N 15P2O515K2O) half the dose (703.50 kg/ha); T3: chicken manure + goat manure + sugarcane residues full dose (ABOB: 10573.00 kg/ha): T4: ABOB half dose (1407.00 kg/ha) plus CF half dose (703.50 kg/ha); T5: CF full dose (1407.00 kg/ha); T6: CF half the dose (703.50 kg/ha). It was evaluated: plant height (AP), pods per plant (NVP); pod length (LV) and yield (kg/ha). A 5% analysis of variance and a Tukey test for separation of means were applied. The mean AP was higher in T2 (172.27 cm). NVP was higher in T3 and T5 with respect to the control, however, between treatments no statistical differences were observed. LV was statistically higher in the treatments compared to the control, although there was no variation between treatments. Although no statistical differences were observed in the performance between treatments, T1 and T4 presented a performance superior to the control of 42.85% and 39.99%, respectively. It is possible to substitute or supplement chemical fertilizer with organic amendments and reduce the negative effect of pollution that they generate on the environment and the health of the people.

AB  - Enterospora epinepheli is an intranuclear microsporidian parasite causing serious emaciative disease in hatchery-bred juvenile groupers (Epinephelus spp.). Rapid and sensitive detection is urgently needed as its chronic infection tends to cause emaciation as well as white faeces syndrome and results in fry mortality. This study established a TaqMan probe-based real-time quantitative PCR assays targeting the small subunit rRNA (SSU) gene of E. epinepheli. The relationship between the standard curve of cycle threshold (Ct) and the logarithmic starting quantity (SQ) was determined as Ct = -3.177 lg (SQ) + 38.397. The correlation coefficient (R-2) was 0.999, and the amplification efficiency was 106.4%. The detection limit of the TaqMan probe-based qPCR assay was 1.0 x 10(1) copies/mu L and that is 100 times sensitive than the traditional PCR method. There is no cross-reaction with other aquatic microsporidia such as Ecytonucleospora hepatopenaei, Nucleospora hippocampi, Potaspora sp., Ameson portunus. The intra-assay and inter-assay showed great repeatability and reproducibility. In addition, the test of clinical samples showed that this assay effectively detected E. epinepheli in the grouper's intestine tissue. The established TaqMan qPCR assays will be a valuable diagnostic tool for the epidemiological investigation as well as prevention and control of E. epinepheli.

AB  - BackgroundPerennial grain roots grow continuously, enhancing soil carbon sequestration and forming a "holobiont" with the microbiome, essential for nutrient acquisition and stress resilience. Consequently, perennial grains serve as ideal models for investigating long-term dynamics between root systems and the rhizosphere environment. Despite their potential, the rhizosphere environment of perennial grains remains underexplored. This research utilizes an untargeted metabolomic approach to characterize the root-rhizosphere molecular signals in four new perennial grain (NPGs) lines named 235a, 280b, 11,955, and OK72, across four years of growth.ResultsMetabolomic analysis annotated 2,527 metabolites, most of which originated from fungi (30.3%), bacteria (23%), and plants (15.5%). Principal component analysis explained 54.8% of the variation between rhizosphere and root metabolites, with 8.7% variation separating 1st and 4th year root metabolites, while rhizosphere metabolites showed less variation between years. The comparison between the annual durum wheat variety and NPGs revealed 616 differentially abundant metabolites in roots and 15 in the rhizosphere, already at the 1st year of growth. In the 4th year, NPGs metabolomes diverged significantly from Thinopyrum intermedium, which stood in the soil for 11 years, with 184 root and 138 rhizosphere differentially abundant metabolites. Comparison between genotypes diversified NPGs in the 1st year, showing a higher abundance of root metabolites for OK72 compared to the other lines, including key modulators of root architecture like glutathione and serotonin, and compounds from alpha-linoleic acid metabolism, which are known to induce systemic resistance against pathogens and herbivore defense. Differences among NPGs also emerged in the 4th year, with OK72 separating from the other three, sharing with Thinopyrum intermedium a higher abundance of purine nucleosides and diazanaphthalenes.ConclusionsThe metabolomic analysis revealed that starting from the 1st year, the roots of NPGs produce a set of metabolites distinct from those of the annual durum species, many of which are defense molecules against biotic and abiotic stresses (e.g., syringic acid, glutathione, and alpha-linoleic acid pathway compounds). The OK72 genotype, which exhibits below-ground traits more aligned with perennialism, differs from the other lines in the abundance of several interesting metabolites, confirming it as an ideal parental candidate for developing new perennial wheat lines.

AB  - Narcine entemedor and Rhinoptera steindachneri are 2 viviparous batoid species of commercial importance on the Pacific coast of Mexico. However, no adequate management plan has been set forth for either of them to ensure sustainable use. The aims of this study were to assess the reproductive potential and the potential rate of population increase (r') of both species, as well as contrasting their reproductive strategies, to infer how susceptible they are to fishing exploitation. Comparatively, among batoids, N. entemedor females have an early age at maturity, relatively high fecundity, and an intermediate lifespan, while R. steindachneri females have an early age at maturity, low fecun-dity, and a relatively short lifespan. According to our estimates, however, both species have relatively high reproductive potential, which N. entemedor exhibits by investing energy in maximizing fecundity and R. steindachneri by increasing the embryo's body mass. Therefore, N. entemedor has better capacity to recover from relatively high overfishing (r' = 0.48) in comparison with R. steindachneri (r' = -0.18). The methodology used in this study proved to be a good option to assess the risk of overfishing in species for which there is limited data.

AB  - To determine factors affecting compost maturity and gaseous emissions during the rapid composting of kitchen waste, an orthogonal test was conducted with three factors: moisture content (MC) (55%, 60%, 65%), aeration rate (AR) (0.3,0.6 and 0.9 L.kg(-1)DM.min(-1)) and C/N ratio (21, 24, 27). The results showed that the importance of factors affecting compost maturity was: C/N > AR > MC, optimal conditions were: C/N of 24, AR of 0.3 L.kg(-1)DM.min(-1)and MC of 65%. For gaseous emissions, the sequence of essential factors affecting NH3 emissions was: C/N > MC > AR, and the optimal parameters for NH3 reduction were: C/N of 27, MC of 65%, and AR of L.kg(-1)DM.min(-1). The important factors affecting N2O and H2S emissions are both: MC > C/N > AR, while their best parameters were different. The optimal parameters for N2O emission reduction were MC of 60%, AR of 0.3 L.kg(-1)DM.min(-1) and C/N of 24, while these for H2S were MC of 55%, AR of 0.3 L.kg(-1)DM.min(-1) and C/N of 21. The C/N mainly affected the compost maturity and AR further affected the maturity and pollutant gas emissions by influencing the temperature and O-2 content. Considering comprehensively the maturity and gaseous reduction, the optimal control parameters were: MC of 60%-65%, AR of L.kg(-1)DM.min(-1), and C/N of 24-27.

AB  - Foraging and acquiring of food is a delicate balance between managing the costs (both energy and social) and individual preferences. Previous research on solitarily foraging free-ranging dogs showed that they prioritise the nutritionally highest valued food, but do not ignore other less valuable food either, displaying typical scavenger behaviour. We conducted a similar experiment on 136 groups of dogs with the same set-up to see the change in foraging strategies, if any, under the influence of social cost like intra-group competition. We found multiple differences between the strategies of dogs foraging alone versus in groups with competition playing an implicit role in the dogs' decision making when foraging in groups. Dogs continually assessed and evaluated the available resources in a "patch," transitioning from random foraging to systematic foraging with time and more information. Dogs in groups used an, "eat first, sample afterwards" strategy whereas individual dogs sampled thoroughly before eating. Additionally, dogs in groups were quicker and more likely to respond to the experimental set-up and eat from it. The dogs adjusted their behaviour in terms of effort and time allocated according to the quality of the "patch." Foraging in groups also provided benefits of reduced individual vigilance. The various decisions and choices made lend support to the optimal foraging theory wherein the dogs harvested the nutritionally richest patch possible with the least risk and cost involved but were willing to compromise if that was not possible. This underscores the cognitive, quick decision-making abilities and adaptable behaviour of these dogs, which is likely to have influenced the process of dog domestication.

AB  - Juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) remain in neritic areas throughout the year, mainly feeding on marine algae and seagrasses, although some individuals migrate and consume gelatinous prey. In this study, we examined the differences in foraging behavior and nutritional status between two regions, based on their food items. This study was conducted from 2013 to 2024 in Kuroshima (24 degrees 14'13"N, 124 degrees 00'35"E) and Sanriku (38 degrees 17 '-39 degrees 40 ' N, 141 degrees 24 '-142 degrees 05 ' E) in Japan, where different food resources are available to green turtles. A biologging experiment was used to examine foraging behaviors, while body condition index (BCI) and biochemical analysis were used to determine nutritional status. According to video data, turtles in Kuroshima (n = 8, straight carapace length (SCL): 55.2 +/- 8.1 cm) were herbivorous, with 1-908 bites h-1 on marine algae and seagrasses and no consumption of gelatinous prey. In contrast, turtles in Sanriku (n = 10, SCL: 49.7 +/- 5.4 cm) were omnivorous, with 0-21 bites h-1 on algae and seagrasses and 0-9 bites on gelatinous prey. Omnivorous green turtles in Sanriku were more active but fed less frequently than herbivorous green turtles in Kuroshima. BCI and blood protein levels were higher for omnivorous green turtles than herbivorous ones, indicating higher nutritional status. These results suggest that gelatinous prey is an important food resource for green turtles, with its benefits outweighing disadvantages such as greater foraging effort.

AB  - Starting in the summer 2023 and peaking in late 2023, large amounts of Sargassum were observed floating off the coast of Madeira Islands, Portugal. The analysis of the samples revealed the presence of the three most common morphotypes of the two known species of pelagic Sargassum: S. natans I, S. natans VIII, and S. fluitans III. This is the first record for the subtropical eastern Atlantic Ocean for S. natans VIII and S. fluitans III. Both species were found entangled, and even though the main purpose of the study was to document the occurrence of pelagic Sargassum in the Madeira archipelago, some associated fauna were also recorded: the crab Planes minutus (Linnaeus, 1758), the amphi-Atlantic shrimps Latreutes fucorum (Fabricius, 1798) and Hippolyte coerulescens (Fabricius, 1775), and the nudibranch Scyllaea pelagica Linnaeus, 1758. The last two are new records for the Madeira archipelago.

AB  - Food-derived bioactive peptides are considered as the important sources of natural bioactive ingredients. Approximately 3094 peptides were identified by nESI-LC-MS/MS in the hydrolyzed yak milk residue. Peptide KALNEINQF (T10) is the strongest antioxidant peptide. The damage model of H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was used to evaluate the antioxidant effect. After treatment with 25, 50, or 100 mu g/mL T10 peptide, T10 obviously decreased H2O2-induced damage and increased the cell survival. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were significantly increased 1.03, 1.1, and 1.33 times, and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were significantly increased 1.11, 1.30, and 1.43 times, respectively. Malondialdehyde (MDA) also reduced 1.41, 1.54, and 1.72 times, respectively. T10 inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVECs, and protein expressions of the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2 and bax were increased and decreased by 1.95 and 1.44 times, respectively, suggesting T10 decreases apoptosis of the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, the RNA expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.00, 2.11, and 1.94 times; the protein expressions of p-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.67, 1.73, and 1.04 times; and Keap1 was downregulated by 3.9 and 1.32 times, respectively. T10 also regulated the Nrf2 pathway and expressions of related genes (Keap1, HO-1, and NQO1), and blocking the Nrf2 pathway in the model decreased the protective effect of T10. Taken together, T10 peptide isolated from yak milk residue has a protective effect against H2O2-induced damage in HUVECs and the molecular mechanisms are involved in the regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and cell apoptosis.

AB  - Implantation of composite scaffolds could be potentially associated with the risk of hemostatic disturbances in a recipient. However, there is a lack of information on possible alterations in clotting mechanisms resulting from such a procedure. The aim of the present work was to investigate changes in hemostatic parameters in sheep implanted with a scaffold composed of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) and hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate (9:4.5:4.5), settled previously with mesenchymal stem cells stimulated by fibroblast growth factor-2 and bone morphogenetic protein-2. Nine Merino sheep were examined for 7 days, and measurements of clotting times (PT, aPTT), activities of antithrombin, protein C and clotting factors II-XII, and concentrations of fibrinogen and D-dimer were carried out before and 1 h, 24 h, 3 days and 7 days after scaffold implantation. The introduction of scaffold initially resulted in a slowdown of the clotting processes (most evident 24 h after surgery); PT and aPTT increased to 14.8 s and 33.9 s, respectively. From the third day onwards, most of these alterations began to return to normal values. The concentration of fibrinogen rose throughout the observation period (up to 8.4 g/L), mirroring the ongoing inflammatory reaction. However, no signals of significant disturbances in hemostatic processes were detected in the sheep tested.

AB  - The coast of the Great Australian Bight contains perhaps the largest concentrations of clifftop dunes in the world. It consists of 1350 km of calcarenite and limestone cliffs of which 508 km are capped by clifftop dunes covering an area of 958 km(2). To develop a preliminary chronology of dune emplacement and an assessment of triggering mechanisms, 89 OSL dates were obtained from clifftop dunes spread around the Bight. Starting in the east, dunes were sampled for dating on Kangaroo Island, southern Yorke Peninsula, western Eyre Peninsula, Bunda (Nullarbor) Cliffs, Hampton Bluffs, Twilight Cove, Baxter Cliffs and the Wylie Scarp. In addition, the large Roe Plain dune complex that merge with the Baxter-Hampton clifftop dunes were also dated. The dunes are carbonate-rich in the east and center, to grading to quartz-rich to the west. Examining the entire Bight dune systems in a chronological order, the oldest dunes (>164 ka) were located on Kangaroo Island in the far east and are quartzrich, but overlain by subsequent carbonate deposits, which also date >136 ka. Next were dunes deposited during sea-level highstands along the Baxter Cliffs during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a (similar to 80 ka) and MIS3 with dates between 60 and 40 ka, followed by reactivation during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) by strong westerly winds between 26-16 ka, particularly across the Roe Plain and on some Eyre Peninsula headlands. Initial Holocene clifftop emplacement accompanied the sea level transgression and stillstand between 10-6 ka. Most beaches and sand ramps that supplied the dunes have since been eroded, though ongoing reactivation on top of the cliffs has occurred at scattered sites throughout the late Holocene, a fact exacerbated by the general aridity, with some sites showing evidence to two to three reactivations. More dating is required to determine if the reactivation is periodic or more random together with a more complete chronology of the dune systems, including their initial emplacement.

AB  - Environmental conditions have a significant influence on the physiological processes that regulate the reproduction of fish. However, there is less information on this subject for chondrichthyans, and particularly for males. This study describes the spermatogenic cycle of the narrownose smooth hound shark Mustelus schmitti related to sex steroid plasma levels and the potential influences of photoperiod and temperature as reproductive cues. A total of 70 males were caught bi-monthly for over a year in the coastal waters of Argentina. Testicular samples were taken for histological characterization and blood samples were taken for the measurement of testosterone (T) and progesterone (P-4) plasma levels from each male. Bottom temperature was recorded at each sampling point and the daily photoperiod was estimated from Julian Day Calendar. Histological assessment revealed that the complete cycle of spermatogenesis in M. schmitti lasts just over a year, with the onset of the new spermatogenic cycle (spermatocyte formation) overlapping with the end (spermiation and filling of the seminiferous ducts) of the previous cycle. This particular phase was associated with the peak in T plasma levels, which was found to be significantly explained by the increase in photoperiod in spring. The rise in temperature above 15-16 degrees C at the end of spring was significantly associated with a reduction in T plasma levels. Additionally, an elevation in P-4 plasma levels was observed after the photoperiod increase phase. Males would be ready to mate from mid-spring, following female parturition and just before ovulation/pregnancy.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are emerged as promising power sources for implantable devices, offering excellent form factor and performance. For these applications, EBFCs require customer tailored structure and more than 10 mu W power. In this study, flexible and stretchable EBFCs are suggested, assessing their performance using tube -type artificial blood vessel (TABV) cell kit with sheep blood fuel. To fabricate the EBFCs, buckypaper (BP) is molded to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to fabricate BP@PDMS electrode that shows excellent strain rate (95 %) and durability (1500 cycles) in tensile and fatigue tests. Additionally, electrochemical evaluations are implemented to measure the performance of anode and cathode fabricated with BP@PDMS. In anode including 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione and glucose dehydrogenase, maximum reactivity of glucose oxidation is 1.05 mA/cm 2 , while in cathode including bilirubin oxidase, that of oxygen reduction is 0.61 mA/cm 2 . Regarding flexibility, anode and cathode are little affected by current density irrespective of bending angle, proving that the fabricated anode and cathode have good flexibility. To emulate the behavior of EBFCs in actual blood vessel, EBFCs are implanted in TABV cell kit, fueling sheep blood. Observed open circuit voltage of 0.59 V and maximum power of 26 mu W reveals that fabricated EBFCs have superior potential to be considered as power sources for implantable devices.

AB  - We used acoustic telemetry to assess site fidelity, movement patterns, and habitat use within the lower Maeklong River, Thailand, by 22 giant freshwater whipray Urogymnus polylepis. This study is the first of its kind for this rare, endangered species, and it begins to fill critical information gaps about its ecology and life history. Study animals were tagged subcutaneously in the dorsal area with acoustic transmitters and tracked for 12 months using a fixed array of eight receivers. Receivers were positioned within an 18 rkm section of the Maeklong, starting approximately 4 rkm upstream from the mouth. We calculated individual residency indices, tracked longitudinal movements, and assessed annual and seasonal patterns of site use. We also investigated spatial use patterns, diel activity patterns, and relationships of temperature and site fidelity. We detected 86% of our tagged whiprays, 53% of which were detected for the majority of the study period. Whiprays exhibited high site fidelity across seasons. Individuals made long longitudinal movements within the site for much of the study period but seemed to remain closer to the estuary during the second half of the rainy season and early winter. All receivers had large numbers of detections, but upstream receivers were visited for longer time durations than downstream receivers. A receiver in the middle of the study area had the highest detection rate, but low detection durations, suggesting that this receiver is in a migration corridor. A mix of immature and mature males and females was present in the site throughout the study period, suggesting that this area is not exclusively a breeding or nursery site. However, the high site fidelity suggests that this is an important aggregation site for the species. Effective conservation measures may include conservation zones and a shrimp reintroduction program upstream, ensuring fish passage through the middle of the site, and regulating traffic and pollution downstream. We found acoustic telemetry to be an effective study method and encourage its use to improve understanding of the giant freshwater whipray.

AB  - The emergence of drug-resistant parasitic nematodes in both humans and livestock calls for development of alternative and cost-effective control strategies. Barbervax((R)) is the only registered vaccine for the economically important ruminant strongylid Haemonchus contortus. In this study, we compared the microbiome, genome-wide diversity, and transcriptome of H. contortus adult male populations that survived vaccination with an experimental vaccine after inoculation in sheep. Our genome-wide SNP analysis revealed 16 putative candidate vaccine evasion genes. However, we did not identify any evidence for changes in microbial community profiling based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing results of the vaccine-surviving parasite populations. A total of fifty-eight genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed, with six genes being long non-coding (lnc) RNAs and none being putative candidate SNP-associated genes. The genes that highly upregulated in surviving parasites from vaccinated animals were associated with GO terms belonging to predominantly molecular functions and a few biological processes that may have facilitated evasion or potentially lessened the effect of the vaccine. These included five targets: astacin (ASTL), carbonate dehydratase (CA2), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), glutamine synthetase (GLUL), and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP3). Our tertiary structure predictions and modelling analyses were used to perform in silico searches of all published and commercially available inhibitor molecules or substrate analogs with potential broad-spectrum efficacy against nematodes of human and veterinary importance.

AB  - Establishing an appropriate model of intestinal inflammation in vitro is crucial for studying the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While immortalized cell lines have long been employed to investigate intestinal cell functions and host-pathogen interactions in sheep, they inadequately mimic the physiological characteristics of ovine intestinal inflammation and may lose critical genetic features. The emergence of organoids has revolutionized in vitro intestinal inflammation modeling by offering superior structural and functional fidelity to native tissues. In this study, we developed an IL-1 beta-induced intestinal inflammation organoid model derived from East Friesian sheep ileal crypts. Our data demonstrate that treatment with 30 ng/mL IL-1 beta significantly increased inflammatory factor secretion, the apoptosis of intermediate cells, and disrupted barrier integrity while simultaneously reducing bud formation capacity, organoid area, and stem cell proliferation. RNA-seq analysis revealed that IL-1 beta activated the NF-kappa B/TNF/IL-17 signaling pathway in intestinal organoids, thereby orchestrating the inflammatory response. This study establishes a novel sheep-derived intestinal inflammation organoid model, providing a physiologically relevant platform to investigate intestinal inflammation pathogenesis. These findings offer a translational tool for advancing drug development and pharmacological mechanism exploration in ovine intestinal inflammation research.

AB  - The escalating global volume of sewage discharge presents a formidable challenge for sewage treatment facilities, necessitating the efficient utilization of sewage. Given the substantial demand on water resource during anaerobic digestion (AD), this study investigated the feasibility of substituting pure water with sewage as the main water source for AD using six diverse lignocellulosic wastes (rice straw, vinegar residue, cattle manure, sheep manure, napkin, and office wastepaper) as feedstocks. The results showed that the methane production of lignocellulosic waste + raw wastewater (WW) during AD increased by at least 5% compared with the control groups. Specially, the cumulative methane yield of napkin mixed with the WW reached to 218.3 mL/gVS with the increase of 47.8% compared with the control group (147.7 mL/gVS). The results indicated that the relative abundance of characteristic bacteria and methanogenic archaea during AD was closely related to the kinds of feedstocks and water source. The addition of WW increased the relative abundance of bacteria and archaea in the digester, which might be the main reason for the higher methane production with the addition of WW. Treated wastewater and reclaimed water had a relatively neglectable impact on the microbial community structure in AD. This study not only saved water resources in AD but also provided a strong reference for resource utilization of sewage and organic solid waste.

AB  - Clostridia are one of the largest genera of eubacteria inhabiting water, soil, human and animal intestine. The genus Clostridium includes both pathogenic and nonpathogenic species. The members of this genus occupy a leading position among all types of bacteria in producing diverse toxins. Due to the ability to form spores, these microorganisms are able to survive in the most unfavorable conditions. Antibiotic-resistant clostridia that are transferred into the environment in the manure of farm animals represent a special environmental hazard. In the present work, the effect of different methods of processing (aeration, acidification, addition of surfactants) the liquid fraction (LF) of pig manure effluents (MEs) on the species composition and number of clostridia was studied. It was established that Cl. septicum and Cl. perfringens occupy a dominant position in the MEs of manure accumulation baths. Both species are actively involved in the ammonification of organic compounds, releasing a wide spectrum of volatile substances with an unpleasant odor into the environment. The highest portion of clostridia was detected in biofilms forming on the surface of MEs under anaerobic conditions. Such conditions develop when LF is stored in covered lagoons, which increases the environmental risks of transferring undesirable microorganisms into the environment. A 24-h aeration and acidification of MEs to pH 5.5 contributed to a decrease in the number of clostridia. The appropriate conditions led to the formation of consortia of microorganisms, in which fungi occupied a dominant position. Cl. difficile (32.52%), Cl. putrificum (31.62%), and Cl. septicum (30.72%) dominated in the biofilms of acidified MEs; Cl. difficile (69.98-95.26%), in the variants with the addition of surfactants. The highest relative number of pathogenic Cl. difficile (95.26%) was observed in the variant with the addition of a cation-active surfactant (benzalkonium chloride).

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Deer velvet (DV) has been extensively used in traditional Oriental medicine to treat various diseases. Its pharmacological spectrum encompasses tonicity, longitudinal bone growth of adolescence, blood retention, hemopoiesis facilitation, enhancement of organ function, physical function improvement, and augmentation of physical vitality. Among its myriad effects, DV notably exhibits anti-fatigue properties; however, its specific mode of action is yet to be fully elucidated. Aim of the study: This study was undertaken to investigate the anti-fatigue and exercise performance-enhancing effects of YC-1101(HENKIV (R)), an enzymatically derived DV extract, in C2C12 cell lines and forced swimming mouse models. Materials and methods: The effect of YC-1101 on increasing cell growth and lowering lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was assessed in C2C12. The antioxidative effects of YC-1101 and its mechanistic underpinnings were also evaluated in C2C12 cells. Moreover, mice were subjected to an exhaustive swimming test subsequent to 3 weeks of YC-1101 extract administration. Fatigue-associated biochemical parameters, such as LDH activity and lactate, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde levels, were measured in serum and muscle tissues. Results: YC-1101 significantly promoted myoblast growth and reduced LDH activity, indicative of a cellproliferative effect. Notably, free radical scavenging assays and analysis of reactive oxygen species production and antioxidant-related mRNA expression corroborated the significant involvement of YC-1101 in antioxidation, an important mechanism in anti-fatigue processes. Furthermore, animal experiments demonstrated prolonged swimming endurance and inhibition of muscle LDH accumulation in forced swimming mouse models. Serum biochemical analysis further revealed significant modulation of the expression of anti-fatigue-related biomarkers. Various bioactive low-molecular-weight DV peptides were enriched in YC-1101 compared to YHC-BE-2038 (a DV extract without enzymatic digestion). The anti-fatigue effect of YC-1101 was significantly stronger than that of YHC-BE-2038. Conclusions: These findings suggest the potential of YC-1101 as a nutraceutical adjunct in ameliorating fatigue, concurrently facilitating muscle damage recovery, and exerting antioxidant effects via the nuclear factor E2related factor 2-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 pathway. It can be assumed that the complex action of low-molecular-weight DV peptides produced during the enzymatic degradation process was effective, and the further research is needed.

AB  - In social environments, survival can depend upon inferring and adapting to other agents' goal-directed behavior. However, it remains unclear how humans achieve this, despite the fact that many decisions must account for complex, dynamic agents acting according to their own goals. Here, we use a predator prey task (total n = 510) to demonstrate that humans exploit an interactive cognitive map of the social environment to infer other agents' preferences and simulate their future behavior, providing for flexible, generalizable responses. A model-based inverse reinforcement learning model explained participants' inferences about threatening agents' preferences, with participants using this inferred knowledge to enact generalizable, model-based behavioral responses. Using tree-search planning models, we then found that behavior was best explained by a planning algorithm that incorporated simulations of the threat's goal-directed behavior. Our results indicate that humans use a cognitive map to determine other agents' preferences, facilitating generalized predictions of their behavior and effective responses.

AB  - Simple Summary Pig production has environmental impacts such as global warming and eutrophication. This is closely linked to the feed efficiency of production, i.e., how much feed is required to produce a given quantity of pig meat; this depends on traits such as growth rate, feed intake, and litter size. Commercial pig breeding creates genetic improvement in those traits, and this should reduce the environmental impact. We applied two life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to quantify this reduction. In the first LCA, we compared the environmental impact of pigs in 2021 to the predicted impact for 2030, and we found a 7-9% improvement over those 9 years. In the second LCA, we compared the impact of pigs from a particular breeding company to the North American pig industry average, and we found that those pigs have a 7-8% lower impact. We conclude that commercial pig breeding delivers positive environmental outcomes as a result of its selection for production and reproduction traits.Abstract Lifecycle assessment (LCA) quantified changes in environmental impact categories (global warming, eutrophication, etc.) from 2021 to 2030 due to genetic trends in (re)production traits in pig lines of the breeding company Genus-PIC. The 2030 levels were projected with selection index theory based on weightings of traits in the breeding goals and genetic covariances among them. The projected improvement was 0.9% annually for most impact categories. Another LCA compared the impacts of 2021 North American pig production based on PIC genetics versus the industry average. Software openLCA converted material and energy flows to impact categories of frameworks ReCiPe-2016, PEF-3.1, and IPCC-2021. Flows came from data recorded by customers (1.1/4.7 million sows/finishing pigs) and by subscribers to a third-party data aggregator (1.3/9.1 million). PIC genetics have a 7-8% better impact than industry average for 13/18 categories of ReCiPe-2016, 19/25 of PEF-3.1, and all categories of IPCC-2001. Pig breeding delivers positive environmental outcomes as correlated responses to selection for profitability-oriented breeding goals. This trend is additive; technology development will increase it. Different investment levels in breeding population structure and technology and different operational efficiencies of breeding companies cause substantial differences in the environmental impact of pig production.

AB  - Aquaculture is often referred to as "livestock production" with a proper "future-facing" strategy. Fish productivity varies greatly, and feeding is a significant expense for farmers. Despite the increased interest in waste valorization, a biorefinery strategy to reduce feed costs has been developed. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the growth of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in cement ponds fed with feed formulas containing fermented pig manure in various ratios and to verify the digestibility of Nile tilapia fed with fermented pig dung-based diets. The 120-days experiments were conducted in 20 cement ponds to determine the nutritional content of pig manure collected from a fermented system and the permissible level of digested manure to be utilized as a raw material to formulate alternative tilapia feed. Fermented pig manure (diet) has a high protein content and other nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, manganese, and zinc. Furthermore, the quantities of phytoplanktons in cement pond water associated with manure diets of 0, 5, 10, and 15% are estimated. The diet with 15% manure produced the most weight gain and yield (75.3 g and 1002.80 g, respectively). The findings of this study emphasize the new technique of feeding fermented pig manure to fish, opening up a wide range of possibilities for achieving a sustainable protein source for aquaculture.

AB  - The acute activation of serotonin 1 A (5-HT1A) receptors appears to disrupt maternal behavior in rats; however, the underlying neuroanatomical mechanisms remain poorly understood. We employed two approaches to investigate the role of 5-HT1A receptors in maternal behavior to address this knowledge gap. First, we used realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to analyze 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression in female rats at different reproductive stages. We identified stage- and region-specific expression patterns, including temporary increases in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), as well as a temporary decrease in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, hippocampus, and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) during the perinatal, early, and middle postpartum periods. These findings suggest that coordinated 5-HT1A activity across these brain regions is critical for normal maternal behavior. Second, we used c-Fos immunohistochemistry to elucidate the central mechanisms underlying the effects of the acute and repeated administration of 8-OH-DPAT (a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 1.0 mg/kg, sc.) on maternal behavior. Acute 8-OH-DPAT administration disrupted maternal behaviors, including pup retrieval, pup licking, nest building and hovering over pups, while simultaneously increased c-Fos expression in the mPFC, ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vBNST), NAc shell, lateral septum (LS), and medial amygdala (MeA). Disruptions in pup retrieval, pup licking and nest building persisted following five days of repeated 8-OH-DPAT treatment, whereas hovering over pups showed substantial recovery, returning to near-normal levels. Concurrently, c-Fos expression increased in the vBNST but decreased in the mPFC, MeA, and DRN. These results suggest that acute and repeated 8-OH-DPAT administration disrupts maternal behavior via distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor mechanisms. This study highlights the complex regulatory role of 5-HT1A receptor activity in maternal care and provides insights into the neuroanatomical and neurochemical mechanisms underlying maternal behavior.

AB  - Sampling skin fragments has been an important strategy for genetic studies and ex situ conservation, aiding in the preservation of genetic diversity in Neotropical deer and other wild species. From the moment of collection in the field, transport media must ensure tissue viability by providing the necessary nutrients until laboratory processing for culture or cryopreservation. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of temperature and storage duration on tissue viability and cell growth using two types of skin transport media: Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 0.9% physiological saline solution. Skin fragments were collected from the inguinal region of five captive gray-brocket deer (Subulo gouazoubira) and divided into small samples, which were randomly assigned to each transport medium. The samples were stored at 5 degrees C and 24 degrees C for 24 and 72 hours, followed by cryopreservation and thawing to assess histomorphology, apoptosis (TUNEL test), cell growth, viability (Trypan blue and MTT assay), and mitotic index. The results showed that physiological saline solution is as efficient as DMEM in maintaining tissue viability, with 80% of viable cells observed and no significant difference after storing in different skin transport media (p > 0.05). Cell morphology and apoptosis did not change in response to media, temperature, or storage duration. We recovered metaphases from all skin tissue storing conditions, with a similar mitotic index to those presented in other cell culture studies from deer biopsies. These results showed the feasibility of storing skin tissue samples during 24 and 72 hours at 5 degrees C and 24 degrees C in different transport media guaranteeing the cell growth and viability for genetic studies and reproductive biotechnologies. The study may contribute to sampling collection in places where displacement with large equipment is limited, allowing the establishment of simplified skin transport protocols as an important step to accessing genetic material from individuals inhabiting isolated localities.

AB  - Industrial-scale agriculture creates a mosaic of large monocultures in the landscape, where seasonal cropping cycles generate discontinuous resource availability for insect predators both spatially and temporally. In this environment, selection will favor predator movement and reproductive behaviors that optimize the location and effective utilization of resource (prey) pulses that are both patchy and ephemeral in nature. Using a model system to study predator movement and reproduction, we tested how discontinuous periods of food resource access that mimic fluctuating resource populations (aphids) would influence flight behavior and reproduction of a highly mobile predator, Hippodamia convergens (convergent lady beetle), and possibly modify energetic trade-offs between these behaviors. Adult beetles were provided either short (3 h) or long (6 h) food pulses daily (continuous availability) or short (6 h) or long (12 h) food pulses every other day (discontinuous availability). We measured preoviposition period, fecundity, and fertility during an 18-day oviposition period, and female tethered flight activity (3 h) before and after the oviposition period. We found that discontinuous food access delayed the onset of oviposition in the high food quantity treatment; fewer females laid eggs overall, and 18-day fecundity was lower compared with continuous provision of the same food quantity. A longer preoviposition period was associated with fewer reproductive days and lower fitness. Flight distance and fecundity were negatively correlated, suggesting that energetic expenditure in flight can deplete energetic reserves otherwise used for subsequent reproduction. The negative effects of discontinuous resource access at fine temporal scales reveal how gaps in resource availability could influence lady beetle population dynamics and their ecosystem services within the agricultural landscape.

AB  - Five cartilaginous fish species were recognized and identified as by-catch species during studying the catch of gill nets operated in the coastal area of Alexandria City from the Egyptian Mediterranean Waters during the study periods from Feb. 2018 to June 2018 and from Dec. 2019 to Nov. 2020. The by-catch included the first record of Pteroplatytrygon violacea, the closely related species Dasyatis pastinaca and Dasyatis tortonesei, the rarely found species Rhinoptera marginata, and the blackchin guitarfish Glaucostegus cemiculus. Among these five species, four species are listed in the IUCN Red List; as least concern for P. violacea, data deficient for D. pastinaca in the Mediterranean Sea, near threatened for R. marginata, and critically endangered for G. cemiculus. Morphological characters and morphometric measurements were studied to provide identification of these species. The species have been dissected for more biological information.

AB  - We tested the monophyly of Ceracis Melli & eacute;, 1849 based on a phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters. Ceracis was confirmed to be polyphyletic, with the furcifer-group and several Ceracis-like lineages recognized as separate clades. We describe seven new genera: Abebaeocis gen. nov., Alcecis gen. nov., Anartioscelos gen. nov., Atomocis gen. nov., Gyraleosomus gen. nov., Insolitocis gen. nov., and Lipedanicis gen. nov.; and twelve new species: Abebaeocis phiaronotus sp. nov., Anartioscelos aptenus sp. nov., Anartioscelos involucris sp. nov., Anartioscelos lawrencei sp. nov., Atomocis carinatus sp. nov., Atomocis melanus sp. nov., Gyraleosomus boliviensis sp. nov., Insolitocis panamensis sp. nov., Lipedanicis adelphus sp. nov., Lipedanicis agastor sp. nov., Lipedanicis epamphoterus sp. nov. and Lipedanicis geminus sp. nov. The following new combinations are proposed, based on species excluded from Ceracis: Abebaeocis taurulus (Jacquelin-Duval, 1857) comb. nov., Alcecis particularis (Pic, 1922) comb. nov., Anartioscelos bifurcus (Gorham, 1898) comb. nov., and Anartioscelos laticornis (Pic, 1922) comb. nov. Anartioscelos hoseri (Makhan, Saeizad et Hawkeswood, 2013) comb. nov. is proposed for a species currently placed in Falsocis Pic, 1916. Lectotypes are designated for Ceracis bifurcus Gorham, 1898, Ceracis bison Reitter, 1878, Ceracis laticornis Pic, 1922, Ceracis particularis Pic, 1922 and Ennearthron taurulus Jacquelin-Duval, 1857. We redescribe species and provide identification keys when necessary, and discuss the morphological affinities of the new genera within Ciidae.

AB  - Several factors, including environmental modifications, stimulate neuroplasticity. One type of neuroplasticity consists in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Neurogenesis is modulated by environmental enrichment (ENR, tunnels plus running wheel) and affected by the time of exposure to ENR. Despite the wide use of ENR to stimulate neuroplasticity, the degree to which ENR variations modeled by temporally changing the level of environmental complexity affect hippocampal neurogenesis and anxiety is still unclear. Thus, we investigated the effects of five housing conditions on young adult male Balb/C mice exposed for 42 days. The groups were as follows: standard conditions without ENR, constant ENR complexity, gradual increase of ENR complexity followed by a gradual decrease of ENR complexity, gradual increase of ENR complexity followed by constant ENR complexity, and constant ENR complexity followed by a gradual decrease of ENR complexity. On day 44, mice were exposed to the elevated plus-maze to evaluate anxiety. Further, we analyzed neurogenesis and quantified corticosterone levels. In an additional experiment, we explored the effect of voluntary physical activity on anxiety, neurogenesis, and corticosterone during the variations in ENR complexity. Our results showed that any change in ENR complexity over time reduced anxiety. Also, voluntary physical activity alone or in the context of a complex environment increased doublecortin cell maturation in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus. Finally, our study supports that physical activity acts proneurogenic, whereas any change in environmental complexity decreases anxiety-like behavior. However, the decrease in corticosterone levels elicited by physical activity was lower than the decrease produced by the decrement in environmental complexity.

AB  - The Oryctes rhinoceros (Scarabaeidae: Coleoptera) is a common coleopteran insect in tropical and subtropical areas with many potential uses. Its larvae are commonly found in dead coconut trees and hay piles in the wild and are widely distributed in the northern hemisphere. This study investigates the environmental factors influencing the growth of Oryctes rhinoceros beetle larvae and provides valuable insights into their breeding conditions versus their potential applications. The research examined three key affecting factors of larval development over time, namely, moisture content, growth space and soil content. Results of a pretest run revealed that moisture content, but not the soil content, affected the larval survival greatly. A reasonable confinement on feed moisture (i.e., 30%-60%) was included in the later conducted three-factor factorial experiment. At last, results of the factorial run suggested that: (1) for a consistent and massive larval breeding, environmental factors, setting moisture content at 60%, larval space at 100 cm3/larva and no soil addition, are deemed appropriate, (2) for nutritional purpose, setting moisture content at 60%, larval space at 300 cm3/larva and no soil addition are recommended, and (3) for soil pollution remediation, setting moisture content at 60%, larval space at 100 cm3/larva and a soil-to-feed (S/F) ratio of 2:1 is concluded. This study marks the first engineering breeding exploration of Oryctes rhinoceros larvae, offering practical recommendations for various research purposes and applications.

AB  - The intramandibular joint (IMJ) is a secondary point of movement between the two major bones of the lower jaw. It has independently evolved in several groups of teleost fishes, each time representing a departure from related species in which the mandible functions as a single structure rotating only at the quadratomandibular joint (QMJ). In this study, we examine kinematic consequences of the IMJ novelty in a freshwater characiform fish, the herbivorous Distichodus sexfasciatus. We combine traditional kinematic approaches with trajectory-based analysis of motion shapes to compare patterns of prey capture movements during substrate biting, the fish's native feeding mode, and suction of prey from the water column. We find that the IMJ enables complex jaw motions and contributes to feeding versatility by allowing the fish to modulate its kinematics in response to different prey and to various scenarios of jaw-substrate interaction. Implications of the IMJ include context-dependent movements of lower versus upper jaws, enhanced lower jaw protrusion, and the ability to maintain contact between the teeth and substrate throughout the jaw closing or biting phase of the motion. The IMJ in D. sexfasciatus appears to be an adaptation for removing attached benthic prey, consistent with its function in other groups that have evolved the joint. This study builds on our understanding of the role of the IMJ during prey capture and provides insights into broader implications of the innovative trait.

AB  - Understanding the influence of biophysical variables on spatial distribution and seasonal locations of elephants is valuable inter alia in understanding their movement patterns, and the carrying capacity to optimise the conservation of their habitats. Furthermore, understanding elephant distribution in time and space is beneficial for predicting locations for tourist viewing and determining potential areas of human-wildlife conflicts. In this study, we examined the environmental drivers of seasonal variations in elephant ranges and movement using telemetry data. Using the elephant tracking data and biophysical characteristics, the Adaptive-Local Convex Hull (a-LoCoH) and the Maximum Entropy Modelling (MaxEnt) algorithm were adopted to determine their potential locations and distribution in a protected area. The jackknife approach was used to assess the environmental factors influencing seasonal elephant movements based on collar data from ten individual elephants tracked between December 2015 and April 2018. The performance of the elephant distribution models for the two seasons was assessed using the area under the curve from the receiver operating characteristic based on a 30% test holdout data. Results showed that the core a-LoCoH home of elephants was larger in the dry than wet season (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; W = 3, Z = 2.4973, p < 0.012). However, no noticeable differences were observed (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; W = 10, Z = 1.7838, p < 0.07) between the dry and wet season for the total (90%) aLoCoH ranges. The MaxEnt modelling results showed that distance to the artificial water holes was the most influential variable in predicting the potential elephant spatial distribution in both wet and dry seasons, while the normalised difference vegetation index, a proxy for forage availability, was more influential in the dry season in predicting elephant distribution. The study concludes that seasonal elephant space use is mostly influenced by water availability in both seasons, while forage availability and variability influence elephant distribution more strongly in the dry than wet season. The study provides valuable insight into the biophysical characteristics of elephant home ranges. This is useful for the sustainable management of elephants and their habitats.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of oxidative stress induced by excessive Se on autophagy of sheep Leydig cells and its underlying mechanism. Leydig cells isolated from the testis of 8-month-old sheep were purified using a discontinuous Percoll density gradient. Cells were divided into four treatment groups (0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 mu mol/L of Se). After treatment with Se for 48 h, cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay kit. The biochemical methods were used to evaluate the antioxidant status of Leydig cells. The mRNA transcript and protein abundance related to the AMPK-mTOR pathway and autophagy were detected by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. The results showed that the Leydig cells treated with 8.0 mu mol/L Se have the lowest cell viability. The greater ROS content and lower GSH-Px activity were also observed in the Se 8.0 group. The inclusion of 2.0 mu mol/L Se in the medium did not affect the autophagy of Leydig cells. However, the relative abundance of ATG5 protein and LC3II/I ratio were elevated in the Se 8.0 group. Oxidative stress induced by excessive Se (8.0 mu mol/L) dramatically improved the abundance of key proteins related to AMPK-mTOR pathway and led to an increase of phosphorylated AMPK, mTOR and ULK1. Compared with the Se 8.0 group, compound C could significantly inhibit the key molecules of AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway and mitigate the autophagy of Leydig cells induced by excessive Se. These results indicate that appropriate Se (2.0 mu mol/L) can enhance the viability of sheep Leydig cells. Oxidative stress caused by Se excess can induce cell autophagy via activating AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. The existed crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis could decide the fate of Leydig cells. This process could play a decisive role in the maintenance of normal male fertility and spermatogenesis by affecting the number of Leydig cells in testis.

AB  - The crown-of-thorns sea star (COTS, Acanthaster sp.) is an ecologically important coral predator that in aggregations causes major loss of coral in Indo-Pacific reefs. In the absence of coral prey, juvenile COTS can remain as herbivores for some time with ensuing growth stasis. Due to their cryptic habitat, they are difficult to study and so their biology is poorly understood. We documented body form transition in herbivorous juvenile COTS from the 5-armed metamorphosed juvenile to the advanced multi-armed stage to 10 months of age. Growth parameters (total diameter, central disk diameter, mouth diameter, arm number and length) were quantified. As the juveniles grew, they changed from the stellate form to a disk shape, developing a large central disk and adding arms. The central disk expanded to obscure the basal portion of the arms. Arm length on aboral view was similar to 50% of the oral ambulacral length. The large mouth occupied similar to 40% of the oral side of the disk. Morphological growth dynamics highlight the large size of the central disk region of the body to accommodate digestive-nutritive storage capacity and the voluminous stomach of the future adult, as a specialisation for corallivory.

AB  - The new plant bug Engytatus passionariussp. nov. from Formosa province in northern Argentina is described. This new dicyphine was always found in association with the sticky herbaceous vine Passiflora (Dysosmia) foetida L. (Passifloraceae), a species native to the Americas and an important invasive weed in some countries including Australia. The apparent host specificity, the ability to traverse the adhesive exudates of the glandular trichomes and the damage caused by nymphal and adult feeding make E. passionariussp. nov. an interesting option for further research as a biological control agent. In this paper, a diagnosis, description and illustrations of adult, including the male genitalia, of this new species, as well as a key to the Argentinian species of Engytatus are provided.

AB  - Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (NRAMPs) are a class of metal transporters found in plants that exhibit diverse functions across different species. Transporter proteins facilitate the absorption, distribution, and sequestration of metallic elements within various plant tissues. Despite the extensive identification of NRAMP family genes in various species, a full analysis of these genes in tree species is still necessary. Genome-wide identification and bioinformatics analysis were performed to understand the roles of NRAMP genes in copper (CuCl2) stress in Kandelia obovata (Ko). In Arachis hypogaea L., Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, Phaseolus vulgaris L., Camellia sinensis, Spirodela polyrhiza, Glycine max L. and Solanum lycopersicum, a genome-wide study of the NRAMP gene family was performed earlier. The domain and 3D structural variation, phylogenetic tree, chromosomal distributions, gene structure, motif analysis, subcellular localization, cis-regulatory elements, synteny and duplication analysis, and expression profiles in leaves and CuCl2 were all investigated in this research. In order to comprehend the notable functions of the NRAMP gene family in Kandelia obovata, a comprehensive investigation was conducted at the genomic level. This study successfully found five NRAMP genes, encompassing one gene pair resulting from whole-genome duplication and a gene that had undergone segmental duplication. The examination of chromosomal position revealed an unequal distribution of the KoNRAMP genes across chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 18. The KoNRAMPs can be classified into three subgroups (I, II, and SLC) based on phylogeny and synteny analyses, similar to Solanum lycopersicum. Examining cis-regulatory elements in the promoters revealed five hormone-correlated responsive elements and four stress-related responsive elements. The genomic architecture and properties of 10 highly conserved motifs are similar among members of the NRAMP gene family. The conducted investigations demonstrated that the expression levels of all five genes exhibited alterations in response to different levels of CuCl2 stress. The results of this study offer crucial insights into the roles of KoNRAMPs in the response of Kandelia obovata to CuCl2 stress.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to evaluate black soldier fly production using different diets, including typical Belgian agro-residues (Brussels sprout stems, endive roots and solid fraction pig manure). The LCA compared insect-based feed with soybean meal and fishmeal, and composting through insects versus conven-tional treatments. Underlying LCA data were derived through feeding experiments. To determine the sensitivity of the results, we tested the effect of alternative energy sources and dietary components. Non-residue insect feed and energy use contributed greatly to overall environmental impacts. Insect protein had greater impacts than protein from soybean meal or fishmeal due to the high energy consumption and, in some cases, agro-product demands. These should be areas of focus to make European insect production more sustainable. In the case of Brussels sprout stems and endive roots, conventional treatments outperformed com-posting by insects. Between industrial versus insect pig manure composting, the results varied greatly by energy source and impact category.

AB  - Stocks of demersal and pelagic fish species in the near-bottom layer over the outer shelf and upper part of the continental slope between Cape Olyutorsky and Cape Navarin (Olyutorsky-Navarin Area), northwestern Bering Sea, were assessed using data of a bottom trawl survey over depths 20-400 m conducted aboard the R/V Professor Levanidov in the summer of 2019. The total biomass of demersal fish in the surveyed area was estimated at 682 262 t. In this biomass, Pacific cod accounted for 51.50%; arrowtooth founder, 9.80%; great sculpin, 9.64%; northern rock sole, 4.60%; Alaska skate, 4.57%; fathead soles, 2.56%; and yellow Irish lord, 2.30%. The biomass of each of the other species was less than 2%. The total biomass of pelagic fish species in the near-bottom layer, estimated with the use of catchability coefficients differentiated for species, was 759 639 t. In this value, adult walleye pollock accounted for 85.12%; juvenile walleye pollock, 9.94%; and Pacific herring, 4.67%. The rest of the pelagic species together constituted only 0.27%. The proportions of the biomasses of the major commercial species that inhabiti waters beyond the area surveyed in 2019, that is, the Gulf of Anadyr and at depths greater than 400 m in the Olyutorsky-Navarin Area,were calculated using average long-term data of bottom trawl surveys conducted in 2005-2017. There such species as the yellow Irish lord, saffron cod, Pacific halibut, arrowtooth founder, great sculpin, Kamchatka founder, northern rock sole, and Aleutian skate had proportions from 0.5 to 69.2% of the biomass in the area surveyed in 2019. The proportions of Pacific cod, Pacific black halibut, Alaska skate, and walleye pollock were from 102.9 to 190.4%; the proportions of Alaska plaice, fishes of the genus Hippoglossoides, and Pacific herring, were from 533.4 to 1380.5%. The biomass values of the commercial stocks in the study area were determined both by the status of the stocks within their ranges and by their spatial and bathymetric redistribution due to the shrinkage of the St. Lawrence Cold Water Pool that forms in winter. The conclusion was made that fluctuations in the stocks of the commercial species under study are mainly caused by natural factors and are not associated with commercial fishery.

AB  - The cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in facilitating the successful completion of the meiotic maturation of oocytes. Its influence extends to the process of oocyte nuclear maturation and the proper functioning of various organelles during cytoplasmic maturation. The formin family of proteins plays a crucial role in the molecular regulation of cytoskeletal assembly and organization; however, its role in goat oocytes are not fully understood. Our study examined the inhibition of formins activity, which revealed its crucial role in the maturation of goat oocytes. We observed that the inhibition of formins resulted in meiotic defects in goat oocytes, as evidenced by the hindered extrusion of polar bodies and the expansion of cumulus cells. Additionally, the oocytes exhibited altered actin dynamics and compromised spindle/chromosome structure upon formins inhibition. The results of the transcriptomic analysis highlighted a noteworthy alteration in the mRNA levels of genes implicated in mitochondrial functions and oxidative phosphorylation in formins inhibited oocytes. Validation experiments provided evidence that the meiotic defects observed in these oocytes were due to the excessive early apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our findings demonstrate that the involvement of formins in sustaining the cytoskeletal dynamics and mitochondrial function is crucial for the successful meiotic maturation of goat oocytes.

AB  - Underwater pipelines are the channels for oil transportation in the sea. In the course of pipeline operation, leakage accidents occur from time to time for natural and man-made reasons which result in economic losses and environmental pollution. To avoid economic losses and environmental pollution, damage detection of underwater pipelines must be carried out. In this paper, based on the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM), a non-contact ultrasonic imaging method is proposed to detect the shedding damage of the metal underwater pipeline external anti-corrosion layer. Firstly, the principle of acoustic scattering characteristics for detecting the metal underwater pipelines is introduced. Following this, a HOG+SVM image-extracting algorithm is used to extract the pipeline area from the underwater ultrasonic image. According to the difference of mean gray value in the horizontal direction of the pipeline project area, the shedding damage parts are identified. Subsequently, taking the metal underwater pipelines with three layers of polyethylene outer anti-corrosive coatings as the detection object, an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) for underwater pipelines defect detection is developed to verify the detection effect of the method. Finally, the underwater ultrasonic image which used to detect the metal underwater pipeline shedding damage is obtained by acoustic sensor. The results show that the shedding damage can be detected by the proposed method. With the increase of shedding damage width, the effect of pipeline defect location detection is better.

AB  - This study simplifies fi es the complex relationship among grapevine plants, aphids, ladybirds, and ants, which is essential for effective pest management and ecological balance. This study investigated the impact of aphid attacks and the presence of ants and ladybirds on the volatile compounds profile fi le released into the chemosphere of the community consisting of the common vine Vitis vinifera, , the aphid Aphis illinoisensis, , the ladybird Coccinella undecimpunctata-and-and the ant Tapinoma magnum. . This study aims to analyze the volatile compounds emitted by the grapevine and surrounding insects in response to these intricate interactions. The extraction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was carried out using closed-loop stripping (CLS) and then analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and principles coordinated analysis (PCA) was performed. The grapevine was exposed to different types and order of treatments, including non-infested, aphid-infested, aphid-infested with ant, aphid-infested with ladybird, and various combinations of ant and ladybird. After the aphid attack, the outcomes uncovered massive alterations in the volatile compound profiles. fi les. Infested grapevine displayed distinct emissions of germacrene D (an alcohol) and an alkene compared to non-infested plants. The characteristic VOC profile fi le was the share of infested grapes in the presence of ants, with benzene derivatives and sesquiterpenes dominating the components. The coexistence of ladybirds with ants and aphids resulted in a different volatile profile fi le characterized by elevated levels of aldehydes, ketones, alpha-farnesene, and its hydroxy derivative. It was concluded that the emission of VOCs into the chemosphere of the grapevine communities varied qualitatively and quantitatively depending on the level of the relationship complexity within each community in response to the infestation of grapevines by aphids, the presence of ladybirds as natural predators, and the presence of ant as protector. The grapevine's ' s status-dependent compounds can serve as indicators of infestation status and contribute to non-destructive early-stage diagnosis of the aphid.

AB  - Chronic stress has long been hypothesized to play a role in driving population cycles. Christian (1950) hypothesized that high population density results in chronic stress and mass "die-offs" in small mammal populations. Updated variations of this hypothesis propose that chronic stress at high population density may reduce fitness, reproduction, or program aspects of phenotype, driving population declines. We tested the effect of density on the stress axis in meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) by manipulating population density in field enclosures over three years. Using fecal corticosterone metabolites as a non-invasive measure of glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations, we found that density alone was not associated with GC differences. However, we found that the seasonal relationship of GC levels differed by density treatment, with high-density populations having elevated GC levels early in the breeding season and decreasing towards late summer. We additionally tested hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor gene expression in juvenile voles born at different densities, with the hypothesis that high density may reduce receptor expression, altering negative feedback of the stress axis. We found that females had marginally higher glucocorticoid receptor expression at high density, no effect in males, and no detectable effect of density on mineralocorticoid receptor expression in either sex. Hence, we found no evidence that high density directly impairs negative feedback in the hippocampus, but rather female offspring may be better equipped for negative feedback. We compare our findings with prior studies to attempt to disentangle the complicated relationship between density, seasonality, sex, reproduction and the stress axis.

AB  - Species of extant nautiluses (in Nautilus and Allonautilus) have been anecdotally described as opportunistic scavengers. Here, we examine foraging and scavenging behaviors of Nautilus in field and laboratory settings. Given that nautiluses are nektobenthic, solitary animals living in resource-limited habitats, we predict that odor is the predominant cue used to locate prey. Here, we show that nautiluses display a stereotyped set of search postures in the wild. In field and laboratory trials, nautiluses displayed the same stereotyped foraging postures, suggesting it is a natural and functional reflex in nautilus, and can be replicated under controlled conditions. A series of foraging behaviors induced by olfaction is a highly desirable trait to scavenge for food in the deep-sea. Considering the recent conservation initiatives and regulations now in place to protect declining nautilus populations, understanding and describing feeding behaviors and the ecology of nautiluses are a critical component to support conservation efforts.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this work is to identify CNVs and perform a CNV-based population genetics analysis in five Italian sheep breeds (Barbaresca, Comisana, Pinzirita, Sarda, and Valle del Belxec;ce). We identified 10,207 CNVs and 365 CNV regions (CNVRs). The different approaches used to disclose the genetic relationship showed that the five breeds tend to cluster in distinct groups. Gene enrichment was described for the 37 CNVRs selected considering the top 10%. Gene Ontology analysis showed that several of these genes are involved in lipid metabolism, immune response, and the olfactory pathway. CNVs represent valuable molecular resources to provide useful information for separating the population. Copy number variants (CNVs) are one of the major contributors to genetic diversity and phenotypic variation in livestock. The aim of this work is to identify CNVs and perform, for the first time, a CNV-based population genetics analysis with five Italian sheep breeds (Barbaresca, Comisana, Pinzirita, Sarda, and Valle del Belxec;ce). We identified 10,207 CNVs with an average length of 1.81 Mb. The breeds showed similar mean numbers of CNVs, ranging from 20 (Sarda) to 27 (Comisana). A total of 365 CNV regions (CNVRs) were determined. The length of the CNVRs varied among breeds from 2.4 Mb to 124.1 Mb. The highest number of shared CNVRs was between Comisana and Pinzirita, and only one CNVR was shared among all breeds. Our results indicated that segregating CNVs expresses a certain degree of diversity across all breeds. Despite the low/moderate genetic differentiation among breeds, the different approaches used to disclose the genetic relationship showed that the five breeds tend to cluster in distinct groups, similar to the previous studies based on single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. Gene enrichment was described for the 37 CNVRs selected, considering the top 10%. Out of 181 total genes, 67 were uncharacterized loci. Gene Ontology analysis showed that several of these genes are involved in lipid metabolism, immune response, and the olfactory pathway. Our results corroborated previous studies and showed that CNVs represent valuable molecular resources for providing useful information for separating the population and could be further used to explore the function and evolutionary aspect of sheep genome.

AB  - Monitoring is a critical component of conservation land management and the choice of methods can influence the final inventory of species recorded. The use of camera trapping has increased in recent years as a cost-effective method to record more species and to identify more cryptic and rare species. In this study we first examined data from detailed field surveys (which did not employ camera trapping) in northern Queensland to examine the abundance and frequency of mammals detected by cage, box and pitfall traps, and spotlighting. We then used data from an additional set of sites that compared these methods with camera trapping. Twenty-five species were recorded in the first data set and 26 species were recorded in the second. Overall, mammals were recorded in exceedingly low numbers, and camera trapping only improved the detection of some species such as larger species that could not be trapped (i.e. dingo Canis familiaris and pig Sus scrofa) or were uncommon (i.e. northern quoll Dasyurus hallucatus and northern brown bandicoot Isoodon macrourus). Our results suggest that survey effort should be substantial and use the most suitable methods to identify management, threat and habitat relationships for potentially precarious wildlife communities.

AB  - Environmental factors such as undernutrition and environmental enrichment can promote changes in the molecular and behavioural mechanisms related to cognition. Herein, we investigated the effect of enriched environment stimulation in rats that were malnourished in the pre-and postnatal periods on changes in the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor in the hippocampus, as well as on anxiety traits and memory. Early undernutrition promoted weight reduction, increased the risk analysis, reduced permanence in the open arm of the elevated plus-maze and induced a reduction in the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin receptor kinase B. However, exposure to an enriched environment from 30 to 90 days' old maintained the malnourished phenotype, leading to weight reduction in the control group. In addition, the enriched environment did not alter the risk assessment in the undernourished group, but it did increase the frequency of labyrinth entries. Sixty-day exposure to the enriched environment resulted in a reversal in the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin receptor kinase B in the hippo-campus of malnourished rats and favoured of long-term memory in the object recognition test in the open-field. These results suggest that an enriched environment may have a protective effect in adult life by inducing changes in long-term memory and anxiety traits in animals that were undernourished in early life. Furthermore, reversing these effects of undernutrition involves mechanisms linked to the molecular signalling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin receptor kinase B in the hippocampus.

AB  - Portuguese farmers seek evidence that organic fertilisers, particularly manure-based ones, can be safely used as partial replacements for mineral fertilisers (MFs), taking advantage of their nutrient and organic matter (OM) content. This study aimed to clarify the effects of applying organic fertilisers, especially under no-till practices in maize production. The experiment involved replacing basal mineral nitrogen (N) fertilisation with composted animal manure (CM) and pig slurry (PS) across three contrasting fields with varying soil characteristics, tillage techniques, and OM supplementation. Results indicated that site 1, which had the lowest clay and OM content, benefited the most from organic fertilisers, particularly in enhanced nutrient absorption in both maize leaves and grain. In this site, partial nutrient balance of N was significantly higher in the PS treatment (0.56 kg grain N exported kg N applied-1) compared with the treatment with only MF (0.44). The impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions depended on site characteristics. CM led to higher emissions at site 2 (CH4) and site 3 (N2O), while PS did not increase GHG emissions at any site. Under no-till practices at site 3, CM resulted in higher global warming potential (154 kg CO2-eq ha-1) compared with the PS (128 kg CO2-eq ha-1) and MF (109 kg CO2-eq ha-1) treatments. Overall, this study suggests that organic fertilisers, particularly PS, can be a viable strategy for improving soil health and maintaining sustainable maize production in Portuguese agriculture. However, their effectiveness depends on factors such as soil texture, OM content, and tillage practices. In soils with lower OM content or under no-till practices, pig slurry emerges as a suitable alternative, replacing 30% of total mineral N fertilisation without compromising productivity or increasing GHG emissions.

AB  - Omnivory is a feeding habit in which animals prey on organisms from two or more trophic levels. Omnivorous species play important roles in predator-prey interactions, food web dynamics, and ecosystem functions. Although cricket species have been considered omnivores, quantified investigations of their feeding habits have not been carried out. Therefore, we compared the developmental time, body size and mortality rate of the band-legged ground cricket, Dianemobius nigrofasciatus (Matsumura) (Orthoptera: Trigonidiidae) reared on diets meant for carnivores and herbivores. Furthermore, to examine whether the crickets can balance their nutritional conditions through their food choices, we set up two additional diet treatments, which comprised diets for carnivores and herbivores provided simultaneously or by rotation. The mortality rate of the carnivore diet treatment was higher than that of the other diet treatments. This result suggests that D. nigrofasciatus is a "herbivore" that also obtains nutrients from resources other than plant materials. Although developmental time did not significantly differ among the dietary treatments, the body size of the crickets that were provided both diets simultaneously was significantly larger than that of the crickets provided with only the diets for either carnivores or herbivores. These results suggest that an appropriate amount of carnivorous feeding is advantageous for the development of the cricket, and indicates that crickets can balance nutrition on their own.

AB  - Simple Summary Pigs are social animals that live in groups with well-established social structures and have always been a key species in debates over farm animal welfare. However, intensive production systems often fail to adequately consider pigs' social needs. Group housing still presents major welfare concerns due to increased aggression for up to 48 h after pigs are mixed, with potentially chronic levels of aggression if stable social groups are not established. In our study we analyzed pig behavior, performance and physiological parameters after repeated mixing events. We compared individuals, using a dominance sociomatrix, and tested different hypothesis concerning pigs occupying different social ranking. The results suggest that hierarchical classification influenced feeding behavior and that pigs developed a possible compensation skill. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of hierarchy and its biological relevance in group-housed pigs. Having a better understanding of individual differences, according to their social rank, may help producers and researchers identify and implement management strategies to reduce agonistic interactions and promote affiliative behaviors. In recent years, an increased number of studies have dealt with the analysis of social dominance related to animal behavior, physiology, and performance. This study aimed to investigate whether hierarchical ranking affects the coping style, non-social behavior during open field and novel object tests, performance, and physiological parameters of pigs. A total of 48 growing pigs (24 barrows and 24 females) were mixed three times during the growing-finishing period. The social and non-social behaviors of pigs were directly noted, and three behavioral tests were performed during the experimental period. Performance and physiological parameters were also recorded. Statistical analysis considered hierarchical classification (dominant vs. intermediary vs. subordinate) and p-values <= 0.05 were considered significant. After three regroupings, the pigs in different hierarchical classifications showed no change in hair cortisol values and open-field and novel object tests. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and leukocyte values increased in intermediary pigs, and the lowest counts were found in pigs classified as dominants. Furthermore, dominant pigs visited the feeder more but spent shorter time there compared to subordinate and intermediary pigs. Our results suggest that hierarchical classification influenced feeding behavior and physiological parameters without affecting cortisol values and growth performance, demonstrating a possible compensation skill.

AB  - Southern Europe is hypothesized to have acted as a glacial refugium for hominin populations during the Pleistocene. Of particular importance is South-East Europe, which most likely played a dual role, both as refugium and dispersal corridor, especially during the Middle Pleistocene glaciations, when drastic climatic conditions led to major sea level drops in the Aegean. However, little is known about the palaeoenvironmental conditions at the time of hominin presence in this region, making these hypotheses difficult to test. Here we analyze biomarker data and leaf wax stable isotopic compositions of the MIS 12 Lower Palaeolithic site Marathousa 1 (Megalopolis Basin, Greece) to assess the climatic conditions accompanying the time of hominin presence in the area. Our data indicate a major cooling affecting the north Mediterranean/Aegean domain during this time interval, with lowest temperatures recorded between 440-432 ka. The glacial peak is associated with changes in vegetation (i.e., from more forested to more open landscape), reduction of humidity and water availability (i.e., moisture depletion, increased evaporation). Hominins are present at the Marathousa 1 location at the end of this interval (434-432 ka), confirming that the Megalopolis Basin served as a refugium for hunter-gatherer groups during periods of harsh climatic conditions. Additionally, the progressive cooling is associated with an important sedimentary hiatus between 465-440 ka reflected in all circum-Mediterranean records (both marine and continental), indicating a regional impact of the MIS 12 glaciation over surface processes.

AB  - The number of coral reefs around the world is slowly declining due to environmental and anthropogenic reason, and Pterois volitans also put extra stress on coral reefs by decreasing the number of herbivorous fishes (parrotfish). Moreover, uncontrolled growth of algae interrupts the growth of corals since corals and algae grow together on algal turf. Here Parrotfish also play an important role in the enhancement of corals by grazing. In this paper, parrotfish and P-volitans are taken as prey and predator, respectively, and the fear effect on the dynamics of the system is investigated. The effect of prey refuge is also shown. Constant harvesting policy for both fishes is included. Stable coexistence region for two parameter spaces: Hopf bifurcation and saddle-node bifurcation, is shown and formulated for the system. Numerical simulations are illustrated to verify the authenticity of the analytical calculations.

AB  - Wild animal diets are challenging to quantify, and the various methods for doing so have strengths and weaknesses. Combining multiple methods can allow ecologists to assess their level of confidence in particular results, increase sample size, and investigate diet over varying time scales. The biases of traditional gut content-based methods are mostly well understood. Newer methods may have important biases that can only be worked out through comparison to established ones. We collected data on the diet of wild Plains Hog-nosed Snakes (Heterodon nasicus) using multiple, fundamentally dissimilar methods, combined analytically using a Bayesian framework to describe an ontogenetic dietary shift. Gut contents were the most straightforward, but yielded a small sample size that fell below any reasonable threshold for making generalizations. Stable isotopes indicated an obvious ontogenetic dietary shift, but were labor-intensive, and conclusions are limited by multiple methodological caveats including similarity among prey groups, maternal carryover effects, and uncertainty in trophic enrichment factors. Fecal environmental DNA (eDNA) was intermediate in terms of effort, yielding results congruent with the other two methods, but the interpretation of which would likely have been confounded by contaminants had we not used all three methods in tandem. Several apparent artifacts are discussed. There are some reassuring similarities among methods. There are also several differences. The most complete picture uses data from all methods taken together. Future studies should attempt to compare the biases, expense, and potential drawbacks of these and other methods in greater detail.

AB  - Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) operated under microbial fuel cell (MFC) mode and microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) mode occupy different elimination capacities of organic pollutants. To explore the underlying mechanism, an electroactive biofilm is established rapidly in a sponge-like polyaniline @ carbon nanotube (PANI@CNT) electrode for gaseous toluene removal, and the response of the multilayered structure and activity of it to the mode switch from MFC to MEC is investigated in this work. Affected by the switch, the height, area proportion of microbial cells, and amount of living cells of the biofilm increase by 1.22-, 2.52-, and 2.68-fold, respectively. The PANI@CNT-MEC exhibits a highest elimination capacity of 216.7 g m- 3 h-1, which is much greater than the literature values. Moreover, it is revealed that the enhanced toluene adsorption of PANI@CNT, the low-resistance mass transport into the biofilm, and the enriched functional microorganisms all contribute to the homogeneous biofilm activity and the superior toluene degradation ability. These findings could provide valuable insights into the design and operation of BESs for efficient pollutant removal.

AB  - Data collected from mark-recapture programmes have proven invaluable in assessing the movements and growth of numerous fishery species along the South African coastline. This short note reports on tag and recapture information on the Vulnerable endemic lesser guitarfish Acroteriobatus annulatus. This species appears to exhibit site-affinity behaviour, with an observed mean distance moved of 38.5 km (SD 121.4, range 0-726 km). The recapture of two individuals (tagged as adults; & SIM;100 cm total length) 6 and 12 years after tagging suggests that the maximum age for this species is likely more than double the current maximum recorded age of 7 years (estimated from vertebral ring counts). This has major implications for the management of this bycatch species (with a declining population trend), and for other guitarfish species occurring in South Africa for which the maximum age is currently unknown.

AB  - In Hungary, where intensive and non-intensive pig production co-exist, in-depth interviews were used to explore the views and priorities of pig producers regarding animal welfare and ethical animal production. Farmers using confinement systems and those with alternative, non-confinement systems shared certain core values such as attachment to animals and to traditional community values. Both groups agreed on most key elements of animal welfare (health, nutrition, etc) but had different priorities for how to achieve these within their production systems. Alternative producers considered unconfined, semi-natural environments important for animal welfare, and confinement producers with medium-sized operations (400-600 sows) generally agreed. Only the three largest producers (> 1,000 sows) expressed strong confidence in confinement methods. Different producers emphasised different features for ensuring animal welfare. Producers with large-scale confinement systems depend strongly on staff and automation and require the means to find and retain good staff. Those with medium-scale confinement systems see automation and personal involvement with animals as crucial, and they need economic conditions that allow herd size to remain within their personal capacity. Those operating alternative systems see small herds and non-confinement systems as crucial for animal welfare and need markets that encourage such systems. Subsidies, regulatory systems and technological developments would need to be tailored to meet the different needs in order for producers to improve animal welfare in the different systems and according to their own values and priorities. Medium-scale confinement producers could better act on their values if economic conditions allowed them to use more natural systems.

AB  - A combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Previous studies using mouse models suggested that prolonged high sucrose intake during puberty can serve as an environmental risk factor for the onset of psychiatric disorders. However, the impact of both the duration and timing of high sucrose consumption during different developmental stages on pathogenesis remains poorly defined. We therefore investigated the effects of a long-term high sucrose diet on cognitive deficit, a core symptom of psychiatric disorders, using Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 locus-impairment heterozygous mutant (Disc1het) mice as a model for genetic predisposition. First, Disc1het mice and their littermate control (WT) were fed either a high sucrose diet or a control starch diet for nine weeks starting at weaning (postnatal day 24), and tested for cognitive performance in the object location test (OLT) and the novel object recognition test (NORT) (assessing spatial and recognition memory, respectively). Only Disc1het mice on a high sucrose diet displayed deficits in OLT (p < 0.0001), demonstrating impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. This behavioral abnormality was accompanied by a decreased proportion of the high parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (High-PV neurons) in the ventral hippocampus, a cell type that regulates neural activity and a variety of learning and memory processes such as spatial and working memory. We further explored the critical developmental period for high sucrose intake to cause cognitive deficits in adulthood by comparing specific feeding periods during puberty (P24-P65) and post-puberty (P65-P90). Compared to those on a standard chow diet, high sucrose intake caused deficits in spatial memory in both WT and Disc1het mice, with more pronounced effects in Disc1het mice. In particular, Disc1het mice on a sucrose diet during adolescence showed more pronounced cognitive deficit than those fed after adolescence. Our results suggest that adolescence is particularly vulnerable to nutritional environmental risk factors, and that high sucrose consumption may cause hippocampus-dependent memory deficits via decreased High-PV interneuron function when combined with Disc1-related genetic predisposition.

AB  - The crown-of-thorns sea star (COTS, Acanthaster sp.) is a coral predator that, in population outbreaks, causes major coral loss in Indo-Pacific reefs. Current paradigms explaining the cause of outbreaks focus on the larval and adult stages, while the early herbivorous juvenile stage remains a black box in our understanding of COTS. We followed growth in a large laboratory population of juveniles from settlement to 300 days. Ontogenetic changes in eight traits over time were quantified, including those typically used to track growth in sea stars (total diameter, arm number) and traits not previously quantified (e.g. spine number/type). Combinations of traits were modelled against age to explore their potential as indicators of age. Total diameter exhibited a strong association with age, as did covarying traits: central disk diameter, mouth diameter and arm length. The number of pointed spines was also strongly associated with age, greater in association than arm number. Our results indicate that use of a combination of morphological traits has potential as an indicator of juvenile age. In particular, pointed spines appear to have potential as an age marker for juveniles. Using size-at-age data, we investigated the fit of growth models to estimate age-size relationships. A Gompertz model provided the best fit to the growth/age data and is consistent with the size/time of diet shift (herbivory to corallivory) in juvenile COTS. Addressing knowledge gaps on these juveniles to inform age modelling using morphological traits contributes to the understanding of the biology and ecology of this cryptic life stage.

AB  - Waterbirds depend on a dispersed network of wetlands for their annual life cycle during migration. Climate and land use changes raise new concerns about the sustainability of these habitat networks, as water scarcity triggers ecological and socioeconomic impacts threatening wetland availability and quality. During the migration period, birds can be present in large enough numbers to influence water quality themselves linking them and water management in efforts to conserve habitats for endangered populations. Despite this, the guidelines within laws do not properly account for the annual change of water quality due to natural factors such as the migration periods of birds. Principal component analysis and principal component regression was used to analyze the correlations between the presence of a multitude of migratory waterbird communities and water quality metrics based on a dataset collected over four years in the Dumbravia section of the Homorod stream in Transylvania. The results reveal a correlation between the presence and numbers of various bird species and the seasonal changes in water quality. Piscivorous birds tended to increase the phosphorus load, herbivorous waterbirds the nitrogen load, while benthivorous duck species influenced a variety of parameters. The established PCR water quality prediction model showed accurate prediction capabilities for the water quality index of the observed region. For the tested data set, the method provided an R-2 value of 0.81 and a mean squared prediction error of 0.17.

AB  - BackgroundPlants have acquired a repertoire of mechanisms to combat biotic stressors, which may vary depending on the feeding strategies of herbivores and the plant species. Hormonal regulation crucially modulates this malleable defense response. Jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) stand out as pivotal regulators of defense, while other hormones like abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ET), gibberellic acid (GA) or auxin also play a role in modulating plant-pest interactions. The plant defense response has been described to elicit effects in distal tissues, whereby aboveground herbivory can influence belowground response, and vice versa. This impact on distal tissues may be contingent upon the feeding guild, even affecting both the recovery of infested tissues and those that have not suffered active infestation.ResultsTo study how phytophagous with distinct feeding strategies may differently trigger the plant defense response during and after infestation in both infested and distal tissues, Arabidopsis thaliana L. rosettes were infested separately with the chewing herbivore Pieris brassicae L. and the piercing-sucker Tetranychus urticae Koch. Moderate infestation conditions were selected for both pests, though no quantitative control of damage levels was carried out. Feeding mode did distinctly influence the transcriptomic response of the plant under these conditions. Though overall affected processes were similar under either infestation, their magnitude differed significantly. Plants infested with P. brassicae exhibited a short-term response, involving stress-related genes, JA and ABA regulation and suppressing growth-related genes. In contrast, T. urticae elicited a longer transcriptomic response in plants, albeit with a lower degree of differential expression, in particular influencing SA regulation. These distinct defense responses transcended beyond infestation and through the roots, where hormonal response, flavonoid regulation or cell wall reorganization were differentially affected.ConclusionThese outcomes confirm that the existent divergent transcriptomic responses elicited by herbivores employing distinct feeding strategies possess the capacity to extend beyond infestation and even affect tissues that have not been directly infested. This remarks the importance of considering the entire plant's response to localized biotic stresses.

AB  - Fecal contamination from natural and anthropogenic sources poses significant threats to saltwater estuaries, particularly after storms or heavy rainfall. Monitoring fecal contamination is essential for protecting these vulnerable ecosystems having important ecological and economic values. In this study, we investigated the abundance, sources, and potential causes of fecal contamination at three marine and seven freshwater stations across Vaughn Bay (WA, USA), a shellfish growing district, during base- and storm-flow events. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) quantification, optical brightener assessment, and qPCR analysis for fecal contamination quantification. We compared the effectiveness of qPCR-based microbial source tracking (MST), which targeted a broad range of hosts including, such as humans, birds, cows, horses, ruminants, dogs, and pigs, with sequencing-based MST in identifying fecal contamination sources. Both MST analysis approaches identified birds and humans as the primary sources of fecal contamination. For marine water stations, freshwater creeks VBU001, VBU002, and VB047, along with drain VB007, were identified as the main sources of human-derived fecal contamination in Vaughn Bay, based on Kendall's tau analysis (tau: 0.58-0.97). This information indicates that the septic systems in the catchment areas of these creeks and drains require further investigation to achieve effective fecal contamination control. Optical brightener, FIB enumeration and qPCR quantification results were generally higher during storm-flow events, although they showed poor correlation with each other (Pearson r < 0.40), likely due to physiological and phylogenetic differences among the target organisms of these methods. However, the sequencing-based method faces challenges in precise quantitative identification of differences in fecal contamination between base- and storm-flow events. Due to its high-throughput and cost-effectiveness, we recommend using sequencing-based analysis for large-scale identification of the primary sources of fecal contamination in water environments, followed by targeted qPCR quantification of MST markers for more precise assessments.

AB  - Cucurbits are cultivated worldwide in regions with high concentrations of arsenic (As), a hazardous metalloid, affecting produce quality and increasing the consumer exposure. Cucurbitacins are herbivore-deterrent secondary metabolites that contribute to the plant defense response. The impact of As exposure on phenotypic and metabolic traits has not been studied in members of the Cucurbitaceae family, such as squash (Cucurbita pepo L.). To comprehend the effects of As on the root system of C. pepo, we assessed phenotype, cucurbitacin content, and transcriptome under low and high As concentrations. We report that at low dosages, cucurbitacins are decreased, while growth is not significantly affected. Conversely, high dosages impact growth and development altering root phenotype but cucurbitacin content is not significantly different from untreated plants. Furthermore, gene ontology enrichment on results of the RNA-seq analysis indicate that high dosages of As affect cellular regulatory processes, with genes related to glutathione metabolism being of the most upregulated. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of orthologs members of the heavy metal-associated (HMA)-domain superfamily and As-related transporters suggest a dosage-dependent participation of key members. WGCNA analysis reveals As-specific gene co-expression modules, indicating that low As levels induce adaptive responses in energy and allantoin metabolism, while higher levels trigger intensified oxidative stress responses, including upregulation of MYB transcription factors and heat shock proteins, which may support tolerance to the metalloid. Overall, As influences the root system physiology and metabolism in a concentration-specific manner, highlighting key defense systems and genes involved in C. pepo response to As exposure.

AB  - Mass developments of toxic cyanobacteria have increased in frequency due to global warming and eutrophication. Such cyanobacterial blooms impact whole freshwater ecosystems, especially reducing the abundance of herbivory species of the genus Daphnia. These negative effects on Daphnia have frequently been attributed to cyanobacterial secondary metabolites, among them hepatotoxic microcystins and protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors inhibit major digestive proteases in the gut of Daphnia which results in reduced fitness, that is, population growth. To date evidence for local adaptation of Daphnia to cyanobacteria is confined to microcystin-producing cyanobacteria and based on comparison of individual clones from different populations but lacks evidence from multiclone microcosm experiments. In the present study, D. magna clones from a Swedish lake where they coexist with the microcystin-free Microcystis sp. strain BM25 were compared to clones from a Polish population without cyanobacteria, first in single-clone experiments and subsequently in a multiclonal experimental population. The Swedish clones were assumed to be locally adapted to this protease inhibitor-producing cyanobacterium and indeed showed higher population growth rates, a proxy for fitness, and dominated the population in the presence of dietary Microcystis sp. BM25, but not in the absence of this cyanobacterium. The results indicate an adaptive tolerance of the Swedish population and point at local adaptation to locally co-occurring protease inhibitor-producing cyanobacteria.

AB  - We investigated low-temperature plasma effects on two Brassicaceae seeds (A. thaliana and C. sativa) using dielectric barrier discharge in air. Comparisons of plasma treatments on seeds showed distinct responses on germination rate and speed. Optimal treatment time giving optimal germination is 15 min for A. thaliana with 85% increase compared to control after 48 h of germination and 1 min for C. sativa with 75% increase compared to control after 32 h of germination. Such germination increases are associated with morphological changes shown by SEM of seed surface. For better understanding at the biochemical level, seed surfaces were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry which underlined changes of lipidic composition. For both treated seeds, there is a decrease of saturated (palmitic and stearic) fatty acids while treated C. sativa showed a decrease of unsaturated (oleic and linoleic) acids and treated A. thaliana an increase of unsaturated ones. Such lipid changes, specifically a decrease of hydrophobic saturated fatty acids, are coherent with the other analyses (SEM, water uptake and contact angle). Moreover, an increase in A. thaliana of unsaturated acids (very reactive) probably neutralizes plasma RONS effects thus needing longer plasma exposure time (15 min) to reach optimal germination. For C. sativa, 1 min is enough because unsaturated linoleic acid becomes lower in treated C. sativa (1.2 x 10(7)) compared to treated A. thaliana (3.7 x 10(7)).

AB  - Betanodaviruses, members of the Nodaviridae family, are the causative agents of viral nervous necrosis in fish, resulting in great economic losses worldwide. This is the first case study describing the detection and confirmation of viral nervous necrosis in pot-bellied seahorses (Hippocampus abdominalis) in Australia. Clinical signs of this infection in the seahorses included whirling, floating and cessation of feeding. Histopathological findings included prominent vacuolation in the grey matter of the brain and in the retina of the eye. Betanodavirus infection was initially detected by betanodavirus reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and nested PCR. Sequencing confirmed the red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) genotype of betanodavirus. The RGNNV genotype of betanodavirus has previously been detected in Australia in fish, including barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and striped trumpeter (Latris lineata). Immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against the capsid protein of betanodavirus demonstrated intralesional virus antigen. Betanodavirus targeted the brain, spinal cord and retina, causing intracytoplasmic vacuolation of neuronal processes and neuronal necrosis.

AB  - Nocardiosis, caused by Nocardia seriolae, has been a prominent disease in Southeast Asian aquaculture in the last three decades. This granulomatous disease reported in various fish species is responsible for significant economic losses. This study investigated the pathogenicity of N. seriolae in three cultured species in Taiwan: Nile tilapia (omnivore), milkfish (herbivore) and Asian seabass (carnivore). Administration of an infective dose of 1 x 10(6) CFU/ fish in tilapia, seabass and milkfish demonstrated mortalities of 100%, 90% and 75%, respectively. Additionally, clinical signs namely, granuloma and lesions displayed varying intensities between the groups and pathological scores. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification specific for N. seriolae was confirmed to be positive (432 bp) using NS1/NG1 primers. Post-mortem lesions revealed the absence of granulomas in tilapia and milkfish and their presence in the seabass. Interestingly, the gut in tilapia showed an influx of eosinophils suggesting its role during the acute stages of infection. However, post-challenge, surviving milkfish exhibited granulomatous formations, while surviving seabass progressed toward healing and tissue repair within sampled tissues. Overall, in conclusion, these results demonstrate the versatility in the immunological ability of individual Perciformes to contain this pathogen as a crucial factor that influences its degree of susceptibility.

AB  - In recent years, vermicompost (V) has been widely used as an amendment for improving crop productivity and soil quality. However, the ameliorative effect of vermicompost on the continuous cropping pepper remains unclear, particularly in the karst areas of southwestern China. A field experiment was conducted to study the effect of vermicompost application on the yield, quality, nutrient accumulation, fertilizer utilization, and economic benefits of continuous cropping pepper from 2021 to 2022. The experiment included six treatments: CK (no fertilizer), FP (the fertilization practice of local farmers), and FPV (FP combined with vermicompost of 1500, 2250, 3000, and 3750 kg & BULL;ha(-1)). The results show that vermicompost application increased the yield of fresh pod pepper by 28.34-51.36% (2021) and 47.13-68.82% (2022), whereas the yield of dry pod pepper increased by 16.97-35.14% (2021) and 34.48-62.61% (2022), respectively, compared with the FP treatment. The application of vermicompost reduced the nitrate content and increased the vitamin C (VC) and soluble sugar content of the fruits, which is beneficial for improving their quality. Vermicompost application not only increased nutrient uptake but also significantly improved agronomic efficiency (AE) and recovery efficiency (RE). In addition, although the application of vermicompost increased production costs, the increase in yield improved net incomes (16.02-31.83% in 2021 and 35.83-62.85% in 2022), especially in the FPV4 treatment. In conclusion, the use of vermicompost amendment had a positive effect on the productivity and economic benefits of continuous cropping pepper, which may be an effective nutrient management strategy for the continuous cropping pepper in the karst mountain areas of southwest China.

AB  - Golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) live in multilevel societies of over 100 individuals. Despite exploiting low visibility high-altitude forests and home ranges of 14 km(2), they maintain large and cohesive social networks that serve to coordinate travel and daily activities effectively. During traveling, foraging, and feeding, golden snub-nosed monkeys communicate using contact or coo calls. These contact calls are conspicuous (70-75 decibels), directional, and function to communicate affiliative intention, identity, and location. Based on social network analyses, we found that golden snub-nosed monkeys exchanged contact calls among individuals within their resident one-male multi-female unit (OMU) and with conspecifics from neighboring OMUs. Within each OMU, there were more frequent call exchanges among more spatially separated members than among closely located individuals. In the case of contact calls between OMUs, there were more frequent contact call exchanges among closely located leader males. These findings demonstrate that contact call exchanges communicate individual identity and location, promote social bonds, and contribute to OMU and inter-OMU coordinated behavior that is essential to a well-functioning multilevel or tiered social network. In addition, given that 34% of all contact call exchanges were initiated by adult males (twice the number given by adult females), male OMU leadership appears to play a critical role in coordinating activities, directing travel, and promoting group cohesion. Moreover, given that higher-ranking males initiated more contact call exchanges than lower-ranking males, higher-ranking males appear to play a more important role in leading and coordinating travel and the fission-fusion dynamics of this multilevel society.

AB  - The potential fish provisioning services of the Ria Formosa lagoon (Portugal) were calculated for single cohorts of 7 commercially fished species, based on densities of juveniles sampled with beach seines on a monthly basis over a 17-month period at 41 locations. The potential maximum yield per recruit (F0.1 criteria) was calculated for vegetated (V) and unvegetated (UV) habitat for low and high natural mortality values. Vegetated habitat enhanced yield (g m(-2)) of 5 of the 7 species, with the greatest enhancement for the herbivore Sarpa salpa (137 and 150 fold for low and high M). At F0.1, the calculated total potential yield of the 7 cohorts was 463 tons (low M) and 333 tons (high M), worth EUR 5,649,084 and 3,651,881, respectively. Mean annual landings of the 7 species from 1997 to 2017 ranged from 407 to 577 tons, with a mean of 495 tons (s.e. = 11.1), highlighting the importance of the lagoon nursery as a major source of recruits for local small-scale coastal fisheries. The methodology used here is the first to calculate the potential maximum yield and the corresponding fishing mortality (F0.1) for single cohorts and for different habitats within an important fish nursery. It provides more realistic values of potential fish provisioning services and economic contribution to local fisheries than studies that do not consider fishing mortality.

AB  - This study examined the antifungal activity and plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits of 30 beneficial bacterial strains isolated from Brassica campestris (L.) rhizosphere in rice. Among these, the PRB-8 strain exhibited potent antifungal activity against rice pathogens and produced a robust biofilm and a variety of PGP compounds. Based on our results, the PRB-8 showed distinct antifungal activity against fungal pathogens such as Rhizoctonia solani (75 %) > Alternaria alternata (74.5 %) > Sclerotium rolfsii (70 %) > Macrophomina phaselina (68 %) > Fusarium oxysporum (67 %). The isolate PRB-8 also increased the germination efficiency and length of rice seedlings under in-vitro conditions. The isolate PRB-8 was identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae (accession no. MT672588) and the absence of a hydrolysis zone on sheep blood agar plate suggests that PRB-8 is non-pathogenic. Inoculation of PRB-8 to R. solani and F. oxysporum-infected rice seedlings promotes length, dry biomass, and photosynthetic pigments and decreases the disease index in rice. Furthermore, PRB-8 potentially enhanced the defense responses in rice by increasing phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), beta-1,3 glucanase, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD), which play a significant role in protecting plants from phytopathogens. Thus, it can be concluded that the use of the PRB-8 strain enhances rice growth and resistance to phytopathogens while simultaneously offering agroecosystems and environmentally friendly choices. Shortly, natural antagonistic PGPR may be used as biocontrol agents to sustainably enhance biotic stress tolerance and global food production.

AB  - Simple Summary Artificial insemination (AI) is a reproductive technique routinely used in livestock to deliver sperm directly to the cervix or uterus to achieve pregnancy. In swine, AI is performed with chill-stored sperm displaying minimum criteria evaluated using traditional procedures; however, variegated fertility appeals for additional tools for sperm evaluation. To enhance sperm evaluation, we assess the potential of near-infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy in addition to traditional techniques to monitor boar sperm quality during 10-day chill-storage. Sperm samples showed differential responses to storage, with sperm quality nearly maintained in some samples, whereas it sharply deteriorated in others. Better than NIR, Raman spectral profiles obtained from freshly extended samples efficiently predict sperm survival to storage, making the technique a promising tool for in-depth assessment of sperm samples.Abstract Artificial insemination (AI) plays a critical role in livestock reproduction, with semen quality being essential. In swine, AI primarily uses cool-stored semen adhering to industry standards assessed through routine analysis, yet fertility inconsistencies highlight the need for enhanced semen evaluation. Over 10-day storage at 17 degrees C, boar semen samples were analyzed for motility, morphology, sperm membrane integrity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress indicators. Additionally, machine learning tools were employed to explore the potential of Raman and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in enhancing semen sample evaluation. Sperm motility and morphology gradually decreased during storage, with distinct groups categorized as "Good" or "Poor" survival semen according to motility on Day 7 of storage. Initially similar on Day 0 of semen collection, "Poor" samples revealed significantly lower total motility (21.69 +/- 4.64% vs. 80.19 +/- 1.42%), progressive motility (4.74 +/- 1.71% vs. 39.73 +/- 2.57%), and normal morphology (66.43 +/- 2.60% vs. 87.91 +/- 1.92%) than their "Good" counterparts by Day 7, using a computer-assisted sperm analyzer. Furthermore, "Poor" samples had higher levels of apoptotic cells, membrane damage, and intracellular reactive oxygen species on Day 0. Conversely, "Good" samples maintained higher total antioxidant capacity. Raman spectroscopy outperformed NIR, providing distinctive spectral profiles aligned with semen biochemical changes and enabling the prediction of semen survival during storage. Overall, the spectral profiles coupled with machine learning tools might assist in enhancing semen evaluation and prognosis.

AB  - Seahorse Hippocampus reidi is a vulnerable species, inhabiting estuarine and coastal waters. The safety of acidic environments for fish has been considered in terms of ocean acidification in nature and decreasing pH in intensive aquaculture systems. This study aimed to investigate the effects of acute exposition (96 h) of juvenile seahorses to different pH (5, 6, 7, and 8) in brackish (BW - salinity 11) or seawater (SW - salinity 33). For that, we studied the responses of cortisol, oxidative stress, and survival, thus covering primary, secondary, and tertiary stress responses. In SW, cortisol levels were not altered for fish maintained at pH 5 and 8. However, in BW, cortisol was higher for fish kept at pH 5. Regarding secondary stress responses, only GST activity increased with acidification in SW. However, acidification in BW caused biochemical alterations at enzymatic level (SOD, GST, GPx) and glutathione metabolism, accompanied by reduction of antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and increased lipid peroxidation (TBARS). Survival was always above 90% and it did not differ significantly among pH levels. Our results suggest that H. reidi juveniles are more vulnerable to acidic exposure in BW than in SW.

AB  - Kitchen waste (KW) production has risen considerably due to the increasing affluence of populations and a booming catering sector. If not properly disposed, KW can bring serious issues for the environment. Composting is widely used as an efficient method for the resource utilization of KW. In the present paper, the effects of different ratios of ingredients (corn straw: garden waste = 4:1, based on the dry mass) on maturity and humification during KW composting were investigated. The results showed that the nitrogen retention capacity of the treatments with a ratio of ingredients to KW of 1:2.5 and 1:5.0 was higher than that of other treatments. Additionally, it was found that the number of ingredients had an effect on the germination index (GI) during composting, and the final GI values of the four treatments were in the following order: 1:7.5 > 1:5.0 > 1:10.0 > 1:2.5. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed that the organic matter (OM) content of each treatment increased after composting, and the maturity of the 1:2.5 and 1:5.0 treatments was higher than the other two treatments. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the maturity and humification were correlated with moisture content, pH and NO3--N during composting. This study concludes that the treatment with an ingredients to KW ratio of 1:5.0 was much more useful for KW composting, which is of importance to guide the disposal of KW.

AB  - Mammals have presumably evolved to adapt to a diverse range of ambient environmental conditions through the optimized heat and mass exchange. One of the crucial biological structures for survivability is the nose, which efficiently transports and thermally preconditions the external air before reaching the internal body. Nasal mucosa and cavity help warm and humidify the inhaled air quickly. Despite its crucial role, the morphological features of mammal noses and their effect in modulating the momentum of the inhaled air, heat transfer dynamics, and particulate trapping remain poorly understood. Tortuosity of the nasal cavity in high-olfactory mammalian species, such as pigs and opossum, facilitates the formation of complex airflow patterns inside the nasal cavity, which leads to the screening of particulates from the inhaled air. We explored basic nasal features in anatomically realistic nasal pathways, including tortuosity, radius of curvature, and gap thickness; they show strong power-law correlations with body weight. Complementary inspection of tortuosity with idealized conduits reveals that this quantity is central in particle capture efficiency. Mechanistic insights into such nuances can serve as a tipping point to transforming nature-based designs into practical applications. In-depth characterization of the fluid-particle interactions in nasal cavities is necessary to uncover nose mechanistic functionalities. It is instrumental in developing new devices and filters in a number of engineering processes.

AB  - The ivory trade is of global interest due to its impacts on elephant conservation. Thailand permits the domestic trade of ivory from domesticated elephants. Knowledge of the supply chain is important for managing this market in order to achieve sustainable benefits for both wildlife conservation and human livelihoods. We interviewed elephant owners and ivory manufacturers to conduct an analysis of the Thai ivory supply chain. Five key actor groups operate in this supply chain: elephant owners, intermediaries, manufacturers, retailers, and ivory consumers. Factors influencing the supply of raw ivory vary with harvesting, use, and sale destination but the financial needs of elephant owners and market factors are particularly influential. Elephant owner decisions also depend on elephant management, sentimental values, ivory beliefs, tusk forms, and legal awareness. These findings have the potential to inform the design of monitoring the Thai ivory market.

AB  - Maize (Zea mays subsp. mays), an important cereal crop worldwide, was domesticated directly from the annual teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis), and teosintes originated from gamagrass (Tripsacum) plants. Some herbivorous insects of maize began their association on Tripsacum; however, little is known about the interaction between these herbivores and their parasitoids in this ancestral Tripsacum habitat. A field experiment was conducted in the Mesoamerican region of origin of maize, using sentinel eggs of the hopper Dalbulus quinquenotatus on Tripsacum dactyloides, and eggs of the insect pest Dalbulus maidis on annual teosinte, landrace maize, and modern maize. A community of egg parasitoids formed by Anagrus naulti (Mymaridae), Paracentrobia sp., and Pseudoligosita sp. (Trichogrammatidae) was found attacking eggs of both species of hoppers on the tested host plants. The largest abundance of parasitoids adult emergence and rate of parasitism was found in D. quinquenotatus eggs laid on T. dactyloides. The rate of parasitism was similar for the other three treatments: D. maidis on teosinte, landrace maize, and modern maize. In the D. quinquenotatus-Tripsacum treatment, D. maidis-annual teosinte treatment, and D. maidis-hybrid maize treatment more Paracentrobia sp. adults emerged than A. naulti adults. These results suggest that the interaction between hoppers and their egg parasitoids occurs on Tripsacum plants, and probably has been in place since before maize domestication.

AB  - Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are efficient and clean hydrogen energy technologies for transportation and stationary applications. Highly active and durable low-cost cathode catalysts for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) under challenging acidic environments are desperately needed to address the cost and durability issues of PEMFCs. The most promising platinum group metal (PGM)-free catalysts for the ORR in acidic media are atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated metal site catalysts denoted as M-N-C, M = Fe, Co, or Mn. Due to significant efforts in the past few decades, these catalysts have demonstrated much-improved ORR activity and promising initial fuel cell performance approaching traditional Pt/C catalysts. However, the insufficient long-term stability (up to 5000 h) under PEMFC operation represents a primary technical barrier to making current PGM-free catalysts less viable yet in PEMFCs. In this Account, we highlight recent advances in synthesizing efficient PGM-free catalysts for the ORR in PEMFCs, emphasizing effective strategies to improve mass and intrinsic activity and the possible degradation mechanisms. In particular, a chemical doping method based on the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-8 represents the key to developing efficient M-N-C catalysts containing atomically dispersed and nitrogen-coordinated single metal active sites (i.e., MN4). The newly acquired understanding of the formation mechanism of MN4 active sites during the thermal activation and its correlation to catalytic properties guide the rational catalyst design rather than relying on current trial-and-error approaches. Considerable efforts have further been invested in increasing the active site density and enhancing intrinsic activity by regulating carbon-phase structures and the local coordination environment. These highly active catalysts usually suffer from significant activity loss during the ORR. Therefore, breaking the activity-stability trade-off is the key to simultaneously achieving activity and stability in one catalyst, which is discussed on the basis of our recent successes in regulating local carbon structures surrounding active single metal sites. Significant research efforts toward understanding the degradation mechanisms and improving the lifetime of PGM-free catalysts are still crucial for viable applications in the future. Novel electrode designing strategies are needed to translate the PGM-free catalysts' ORR activity to solid-state electrolyte-based membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with robust three-phase (i.e., gas-liquid-solid) interfaces for efficient charge and mass transports for performance improvement. On the basis of our effort at the University at Buffalo supported by ElectroCat Consortium associated with U.S. DOE's Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office, we provide a perspective on PGM-free cathode catalysts concerning remaining bottlenecks and future opportunities, aiming to inspire the community in both mechanistic understanding and technological development.

AB  - Trichomes are specialized epidermal outgrowths covering the aerial parts of most terrestrial plants. There is a large species variability in occurrence of different types of trichomes such that the molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the formation and the biological function of trichomes in most plant species remain unexplored. Here, we used Chrysanthemum morifolium as a model plant to explore the regulatory network in trichome formation and terpenoid synthesis and unravel the physical and chemical roles of trichomes in constitutive defense against herbivore feeding. By analyzing the trichome-related genes from transcriptome database of the trichomes-removed leaves and intact leaves, we identified CmMYC2 to positively regulate both development of T-shaped and glandular trichomes as well as the content of terpenoids stored in glandular trichomes. Furthermore, we found that the role of CmMYC2 in trichome formation and terpene synthesis was mediated by interaction with CmMYBML1. Our results reveal a sophisticated molecular mechanism wherein the CmMYC2-CmMYBML1 feedback inhibition loop regulates the formation of trichomes (non-glandular and glandular) and terpene biosynthesis, collectively contributing to the enhanced resistance to Spodoptera litura larvae feeding. Our findings provide new insights into the novel regulatory network by which the plant synchronously regulates trichome density for the physical and chemical defense against herbivory.

AB  - The common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) is a driver of ecological processes in African savannah aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Recent studies have highlighted the ecological impacts of hippos in these systems; however, these lack behavioural data to contextualise their ecological inputs. We fitted global positioning system (GPS) transmitter bracelets on male hippos (n = 3) in Kruger National Park, South Africa. The mean home range size for hippos using Adaptive Local Convex Hull (a-LoCoH) home range (similar to 6 km(2)) was smaller than previously documented. This study contributes baseline behavioural data for managing hippos in Kruger National Park and southern Africa.

AB  - Acacia auriculiformis is a native Australian tree that has developed into a damaging environmental weed in Florida, USA. We conducted field surveys to collect insect herbivores from A. auriculiformis and three closely related allopatric congeners (A. crassa, A. leiocalyx, and A. concurrens) across the native distribution of each plant species. We collected over 800 specimens, comprising a diversity of herbivorous insect groups, and successfully sequenced 480 specimens for DNA barcoding to group them into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) as a first step in documenting this diversity. Most herbivores (85%) were found on only a single Acacia species, suggesting each Acacia species hosts its own unique herbivore complex. The Northern Territory and Far North Queensland A. auriculiformis populations are allopatric in relation to one another but hosted a similar suite of herbivores. Calomela intemerata and seven lepidopteran species (including three species of Macrobathra moths) were particularly abundant across both regions. These herbivores look promising as potential biological control agents, though their host-specificity and genetic diversity should be investigated further.

AB  - Combining somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) with genome editing technologies has emerged as a powerful platform for the creation of unique swine lineages for agricultural and biomedical applications. However, successful application of this research platform is still hampered by the low efficiency of these technologies, particularly in attaining complete cell reprogramming for the production of cloned pigs. Treating SCNT embryos with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), such as Scriptaid, has been routinely used to facilitate chromatin reprogramming after nuclear transfer. While increasing histone acetylation leads to a more relaxed chromatin configuration that facilitates the access of reprogramming factors and DNA repair machinery, it may also promote the expression of genes that are unnecessary or detrimental for normal embryo development. In this study, we evaluated the impact of inhibiting both histone deacetylases and RNA synthesis on pre- and post-implantation development of pig SCNT embryos. Our findings revealed that transcription can be inhibited for up to 40 h of development in porcine embryos, produced either by activation, fertilization or SCNT, without detrimentally affecting their capacity to form a blastocyst and their average number of cells at this developmental stage. Importantly, inhibiting RNA synthesis during HDACi treatment resulted in SCNT blastocysts with a greater number of cells and more abundant transcripts for genes related to embryo genome activation on days 2, 3 and 4 of development, compared to SCNT embryos that were treated with HDACi only. In addition, concomitant inhibition of histone deacetylases and RNA synthesis promoted the full reprograming of somatic cells, as evidenced by the normal fetal and full-term development of SCNT embryos. This combined treatment may improve the efficiency of the genome-editing + SCNT platform in swine, which should be further tested by transferring more SCNT embryos and evaluating the health and growth performance of the cloned pigs.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPlant infestation by insect pests can alter plant physiology, thereby influencing the performance and behavior of subsequent herbivores and their natural enemies through indirect effects-changes in plant traits mediated by prior herbivory. This study investigates how prior infestation of Brassica rapa by the cabbage bug Eurydema ornata (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) affects the aphid Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and its natural enemies, the predator Harmonia axyridis Coleoptera: Coccinedllidae) and the parasitoid Aphidius gifuensis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). To explore these interactions, we assessed aphid survival and fecundity, monitored population dynamics, examined the behavior of the predator and parasitoid, and analyzed plant volatile emissions.RESULTSOur findings revealed a significant reduction in M. persicae fecundity on E. ornata infested plants. Additionally, aphids showed a significantly lower frequency of entering the olfactometer arm loaded with odors emitted from infested plants compared to those with odors from healthy plants. Both natural enemies, H. axyridis and A. gifuensis, demonstrated stronger attraction to infested plants in preference and foraging bioassays. Volatile analysis revealed higher emissions from infested plants, with significant increases in key compounds, such as 3-pentanol, (Z)-3-Hexenol, methyl isothiocyanate, dihydrojasmone, cis-Jasmone, D-Limonene, (E)-beta-ocimene, beta-Elemene, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-nonatriene and (E, E)-alpha-Farnesene.CONCLUSIONSE. ornata infestation reduces the suitability of B. rapa for M. persicae and enhances the biocontrol potential of its natural enemies. These interactions highlight the importance of intra-guild competition and host manipulation in ecological, evolutionary and pest management perspectives. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Although both nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep loss and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss exacerbate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, they exert different effects. Microglial activation can be beneficial or detrimental to AD patients under different conditions. However, few studies have investigated which sleep stage is the main regulator of microglial activation or the downstream effects of this activation. We aimed to explore the roles of different sleep phases in microglial activation and to investigate the possible effect of microglial activation on AD pathology. In this study, thirty-six 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice were equally divided into 3 groups: the stress control (SC), total sleep deprivation (TSD), and REM deprivation (RD) groups. All mice un-derwent a 48-hour intervention before their spatial memory was assessed using a Morris water maze (MWM). Then, microglial morphology, activation-and synapse-related protein expression, and inflammatory cytokine and amyloid beta (A beta) levels in hippocampal tissues were measured. We found that the RD and TSD groups exhibited worse spatial memory in the MWM tests. In addition, the RD and TSD groups showed greater microglial activation, higher inflammatory cytokine levels, lower synapse-related protein expression and more severe A beta accumulation than the SC group, but there were no significant differences between the RD and TSD groups. This study demonstrates that disturbance of REM sleep may activate microglia in APP/PS1 mice. These activated microglia may promote neuroinflammation and engulf synapses but show a weakened ability to clear plaques.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to the presence of fibrous hulls, the use of traditional cultivars of oats (Avena sativa L.) in feed rations for pigs is restricted. The development of naked oat cultivars (Avena nuda L.) containing only about 2% of crude fibre allowed this cereal grain to be included in the diets of monogastric animals. The present studies evaluated the efficiency of a 60% inclusion of naked oats in rations fed to Pulawska pigs and Pulawska x Polish Large White (PLW) crossbreds on their performance results (weight gain, feed conversion), carcass composition and physical (pH, colour, WHC) and chemical (essential nutrients, fatty acids) characteristics of meat. It was demonstrated that a 60% inclusion of naked oats is recommended in the diets of Pulawska pigs and Pulawska x PLW crossbreds to maintain carcass composition and meat quality comparable to that of pigs fed with rations containing barley only. The performance indicators of Pulawska pigs declined, but their meat quality traits improved in terms of nutritional value, as the n-6/n-3 acids' ratio was narrower than that of Pulawska x PLW. The study aimed to determine the impact of a 60% inclusion of naked oats in feed rations for Pulawska pigs and Pulawska x Polish Large White (PLW) crossbreds on the fattening performance, carcass composition, and meat quality. It was demonstrated that-independent from their diet-Pulawska pigs showed a daily weight gain about 14.5% lower (p <= 0.05), with about 15% higher feed conversion rate. The experimental factors showed no impact on the dressing percentage, meatiness, and backfat thickness, except that the "eye" of the loin was significantly smaller (by 4.55 cm(2)) in Pulawska pigs. There was no interaction effect (diet/breed) for the pigs' performance results and carcass composition. A 60% inclusion of naked oats in the pigs' diet did not affect the weight of primal cuts in the right-side half-carcass. Compared to Pulawska pigs, crossbreds featured a significantly lower weight of bacon and ribs (by 1.17 kg) but a higher (p <= 0.05) weight of fillet (by 1.0 kg) and ham with shin (by 0.43 kg). The diet had no impact on the evaluated muscles, except a reduction (by 2.3 points) in colour lightness (L) of musculus semimembranosus in fattening pigs receiving feed rations with a 60% share of oats. Both muscles in Pulawska pigs showed significantly better (p <= 0.05) water-holding capacity and reduced colour lightness (L) in comparison to crossbred pigs. Moreover, the longissimus lumborum muscle of Pulawska pigs had a higher chroma (C) and a lower hue (H). The contents of essential nutrients in the evaluated muscles did not depend on the pigs' diet and breed, except that a higher by 0.3% (p <= 0.05) intramuscular fat content was found in the longissimus lumborum muscle of Pulawska pigs. Neither of the experimental factors showed significant impact on the total saturated fatty acids (SFA) and total unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), or on neutral or hypocholesterolemic (DFA) and hypercholesterolemic fatty acids (OFA) in the evaluated muscles. The muscles of Pulawska x PLW pigs contained more (by 1.77% FA in the longissimus lumborum and 1.16% in the semimembranosus) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than the muscles of the Pulawska breed (p <= 0.05). In addition, naked oats included in the pigs' diet increased (p <= 0.05) the share of PUFA in intramuscular fat.
   The muscles of Pulawska pigs, in comparison to the muscles of crossbreds, showed a significantly improved ratio: by 66% and 69% in the longissimus lumborum and the semimembranosus muscles, respectively. To sum up, a 60% inclusion of naked oats is recommended in the rations of both Pulawska pigs and Pulawska x PLW crossbreds, since it allows satisfactory carcass composition and meat quality to be maintained. Pulawska pigs had worse productivity ratios but showed improved meat quality traits in terms of the n-6/n-3 ratio.

AB  - For more than a century, wildlife conservation in the United States has been built on the notion that nonhuman animal populations are resources to be regulated by law and managed efficiently, according to the best available science and in the public trust. This approach, known as the North American Model of Wildlife Management, has come under increasing criticism for excluding diverse viewpoints that have the potential to advance both con-servation and environmental justice goals. How might the greater inclusion of Indigenous worldviews and Indigenous Studies concepts, such as radical relationality and kincentricity, improve western wildlife management? In this paper, we review three case studies of tribal wildlife stewardship programs in the land currently known as California-the Maidu Summit Consortium's beaver restoration project, the Karuk Tribe's elk management program, and the Yurok Tribe's condor recovery effort-that illuminate generative connections among ecological restoration, Indigenous cultural practices, community wellbeing, and environmental justice. Radical relationality and kincentricity offer enormous potential for informing stewardship and recovery efforts that produce more just outcomes for both people and wildlife.

AB  - The parahippocampal cortex (PHC) in the primate brain is implicated in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory network for spatial and episodic memory, but the precise function of this region remains unclear. Importantly, the rodent postrhinal cortex (POR) provides a structural and connectional homolog to the primate PHC. This homology permits the use of the powerful tools available in rodent models to better understand the function of the PHC in the human and nonhuman primate brains. Although many articles have compared and dissociated the function of the rodent POR from other areas in the MTL implicated in learning, memory, and memory-guided behavior, there are no in-depth reviews, particularly covering the last two decades of research. Nor has there been a review of the literature on the potential role of the POR in attention. Here, we review the anatomical and functional connectivity of the POR in rats, examine the evidence for proposed behavioral functions of this region, and suggest a model that accounts for the array of observations. We propose that the rodent POR binds nonspatial information and spatial information to represent the current local physical environment or context, including the geometry of the space and the spatial layout of objects and features in the environment. The POR also automatically monitors the environment for changes and updates representations when changes occur. These representations of context are available to be used by multiple brain regions, including prefrontal, posterior cortical, and hippocampal areas, for context-guided behavior, associative learning, and episodic memory.

AB  - Neural plasticity in the hippocampus has been studied in a wide variety of model systems, including in avian species where the hippocampus underlies specialized spatial behaviours. Examples of such behaviours include navigating to a home roost over long distances by homing pigeons or returning to a potential nest site for egg deposit by brood parasites. The best studied example, however, is food storing in parids and the interaction between this behaviour and changes in hippocampus volume and neurogenesis. However, understanding the interaction between brain and behaviour necessitates research that includes studies with at least some form of captivity, which may itself affect hippocampal plasticity. Captivity might particularly affect spatial specialists where free-ranging movement on a large scale is especially important in daily, and seasonal, behaviours. This review examines how captivity might affect hippocampal plasticity in avian spatial specialists and specifically food-storing parids, and also considers how the effects of captivity may be mitigated by researchers studying hippocampal plasticity when the goal is understanding the relationship between behaviour and hippocampal change.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor widely distributed in the environment due to its common use in the plastics industry. It is known that it has a strong negative effect on human and animal organisms, but a lot of aspects of this impact are still unexplored. This includes the impact of BPA on the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the large intestine. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the influence of various doses of BPA on the neurons located in the descending colon of the domestic pig, which due to similarities in the organization of intestinal innervation to the human gastrointestinal tract is a good animal model to study processes occurring in human ENS. During this study, the double immunofluorescence technique was used. The obtained results have shown that BPA clearly affects the neurochemical characterization of the enteric neurons located in the descending colon. The administration of BPA caused an increase in the number of enteric neurons containing substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) with a simultaneously decrease in the number of neurons positive for galanin (GAL) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT used as a marker of cholinergic neurons). Changes were noted in all types of the enteric plexuses, i.e., the myenteric plexus, outer submucous plexus and inner submucous plexus. The intensity of changes depended on the dose of BPA and the type of enteric plexus studied. The results have shown that BPA may affect the descending colon through the changes in neurochemical characterization of the enteric neurons located in this segment of the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - This study investigated whole-farm methane emissions from five Danish pig farms with different manure management practices and compared measured emission rates to international and national greenhouse gas inventory emission models. Methane emissions were quantified by using the tracer gas dispersion method. Farms were measured between five and eight times throughout a whole year. One of the farms housed sows and weaners (P1) and the others focused on fattening pigs (P2-P5). The farms had different manure treatment practices including biogasification (P3), acidification (P4-P5) and no manure treatment (liquid slurry) (P1-P2). Quantified methane emissions ranged from 0.2 to 20 kg/h and the highest rates were seen at the farms with fattening pigs and with no manure treatment (P2), while the lowest emissions were detected at farms with manure acidification (P4 and P5). Average methane emission factors (EFs), normalised based on livestock units, were 14 +/- 6, 18 +/- 9, 8 +/- 7, 2 +/- 1 and 1 +/- 1 g/LU/h, for P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5, respectively. Emissions from fattening pig farms with biogasification (P3) and acidification (P4-P5) facilities were 55% and 91-93% lower, respectively, than from farm with no manure treatment (P2). Inventory models underestimated farm-measured methane emissions on average by 51%, across all models and farms, with the Danish model performing the worst (underestimation of 64%). A revision of model parameters related to manure emissions, such as the estimation of volatile solids excreted and methane conversion factor parameters, could improve model output, although more data needs to be collected to strengthen the conclusions. As one of the first studies assessing whole-pig farm emissions, the results showed the potential of the applied measuring method to identify mitigation strategy efficiencies and highlighted the necessity to investigate inventory model accuracy.

AB  - DURING the winter season in various parts of Saudi Arabia, temperatures decrease up to 14 degrees C, and water salinity levels are affected by irrigation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of salinity stress and chilling temperature on plant growth, F-v/F-m, chlorophyll content and gas exchange in two forage species, Pennisetum purpureum and Zea mays. The treatments involved daytime/nighttime temperatures of 14/12 degrees C (chilling temperature) and 24/22 degrees C (optimum temperature) and 5 NaCl concentrations (0, 75, 150, 225, 300 mM). The findings showed that NaCl levels were higher and growth parameters and gas exchange of the two species lower at chilling temperature than at the optimum temperature. The optimum temperature did not induce any significant decrease in F-v/F-m values of P. purpureum at the different salinity treatments, while chilling temperature was significantly reduced the F-v/F-m values for both species at higher salinity. The chlorophyll content was higher at 24 degrees C under increased salinity in P. purpureum. In addition, senescence occurred in Z. mays grown at 14 degrees C and salinity concentrations of 225 and 300 mM within three weeks of emergence. The interaction between salinity and chilling temperature significantly affected most measurements of the two species; however, P. purpureum showed high resistance to stress. Therefore, the obtained results will be useful for agricultural application of P. purpureum as a reliable crop for saline lands under chilling temperature conditions.

AB  - Nowadays, there are few studies in vivo to explore the effects of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) single gene such as immediate early protein 2 (IE2) on the nervous system, let alone the mechanism that IE2 causes cognitive impairment. In this study, the Rosa26-LSL-IE2/Cre mouse was used to show the effects of IE2 on the cognitive ability and the GluNRs/CaMKII alpha/CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus. We divided the mice into experimental and control groups based on the results of PCR firstly. After that, the cognitive abilities of the two groups were compared through new object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. The results of the behavioral tests showed that the cognitive ability of the experimental mice was lower than that of the control group. It is known that changes in the expression levels of N-methyl D-aspartate receptor 1, 2A, and 2B (GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B) affect synaptic plasticity and cause cognitive changes. Finally, we analyzed the expression levels of GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B, and related signaling pathway molecules by qPCR and western blot. We found that the expression levels of the GluNRs/CaMKII alpha/CREB signaling pathway were decreased in the experimental group. These results indicated that IE2 could affect the expression levels of GluNRs/CaMKII alpha/CREB signaling pathway, which was closely related to the cognitive impairment of the experimental group. In summary, we used this novel mouse model to show that IE2 could cause cognitive impairment in the hippocampus, which might be related to the GluNRs/CaMKII alpha/CREB signaling pathway. It is helpful to further understand the mechanism of the cognitive impairment induced by HCMV IE2.

AB  - Introduction: Bird populations reflect the influence of major environmental changes, and the analysis of their long-term population trends concerning species-specific ecological traits can provide insight into biologically relevant impacts of such changes. In this respect, nest site is a particularly informative trait because ground-nesting bird species are more prone, in contrast to species nesting above the ground, to the impacts of nest predation which can be linked to various environmental drivers including the intensification of agriculture or woodland management. Here we hypothesize that a) ground-nesting species present negative trends due to environmental pressures mentioned above, b) such declining trends should be more pronounced in Western than in Eastern Europe because, in Western countries, the environmental threats are likely greater, and c) the interaction between nest site and habitat association will point at the habitat types where the presumed drivers most likely operate.Methods: We used population trends from 1980 to 2016 of 332 bird species in 16 European countries to test this hypothesis.Results: We found that the long-term population trends of ground-nesting birds are more negative than the trends of species nesting above the ground indicating the effect of nest predation, and this difference increased from Eastern to Western European countries, probably due to steeply increasing populations of nest predators in the West. However, the effect of longitude interacted with the habitat association being strong in woodland species and weak in open-habitat species.Discussion: This pattern suggests that the increased nest predation pressure in the West is linked to woodlands, probably due to higher abundances of mammalian herbivores that destroy forest ground and shrub layer, and thus leave the nests exposed to predators. In contrast, only a weak longitudinal pattern in open-habitat species indicates that the negative impacts of agricultural intensification are no longer confined to the Western part of the continent. Although nature conservation activities are generally successful in Europe, as indicated by benefits provided by the Natura 2000 network, our results uncovered substantial gaps in delivering such benefits.

AB  - Introduction: AI-powered platforms have gained prominence in medical education and training, offering diverse applications from surgical performance assessment to exam preparation. This research paper examines the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), including Llama 2, Google Bard, Bing Chat, and ChatGPT-3.5, in answering multiple-choice questions of the Clinical Problem Solving (CPS) paper of the Multi-Specialty Recruitment Assessment (MSRA) exam.Methods: Using a dataset of 100 CPS questions from ten subject categories, we assessed the LLMs' performance against medical doctors preparing for the exam.Results: Results showed that Bing Chat outperformed all other LLMs and even surpassed human users from the Qbank question bank. Conversely, Llama 2's performance was inferior to human users. Google Bard and ChatGPT 3.5 did not exhibit statistically significant differences in correct response rates compared to human candidates. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated Bing Chat's significant superiority over Llama 2, Google Bard, and ChatGPT 3.5. However, no significant differences were found between Llama 2 and Google Bard, Llama 2, and ChatGPT3.5, and Google Bard and ChatGPT-3.5.Discussion: Freely available LLMs have already demonstrated that they can perform as well or even outperform human users in answering MSRA exam questions. Bing Chat emerged as a particularly strong performer. The study also highlights the potential for enhancing LLMs' medical knowledge acquisition through tailored finetuning. Medical knowledge tailored LLMs such as Med-PaLM, have already shown promising results. Conclusion: We provided valuable insights into LLMs' competence in answering medical MCQs and their potential integration into medical education and assessment processes.

AB  - A novel method of extracting iron from high-iron red mud and preparing low-carbon cement clinker from tailings was proposed. Thermodynamics of smelting reduction were calculated. The effects of different conditions on iron recovery were investigated systematically. Properties of cement samples prepared from water quenched slag were analyzed. Results showed that increasing temperature, Na2O content and C/S and decreasing A/S appropriately were beneficial to increase the liquid content in slag. Iron recovery was 97.6% under optimal conditions, and the obtained metal met the industrial standard of pig iron for steelmaking. Vitreous content in water quenched slag was 99%, and its pozzolanic activity was comparable to that of S95 grade ore powder. Due to energy consumption and CO2 emission from decomposition of limestone in calcination process of cement clinker reducing significantly, the CO2 emission was reduced to about 400 kg per ton of cement clinker based on the 50% doping amount.

AB  - Yak whey protein concentrates (YWPCs) have good functional properties, but there is still a gap in the study of their peptides. In this study, peptides were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis, and the bioactivity of each ultrafiltration fraction was evaluated using an optimal process. YWPCs were isolated and purified from yak milk as the raw material. Alkaline protease, trypsin, and papain were used to hydrolyze YWPCs. The protease with the highest degree of hydrolysis (DH) and peptide concentration was selected as the most suitable enzyme. The effects of pH, temperature, time, and the enzyme-to-substrate ratio (E/S) on the DH and peptide concentration were investigated, and response surface methodology was utilized to optimize the hydrolysis process. The hydrolysate was separated using ultrafiltration membranes with molecular weight cut-offs of 10 kDa, 5 kDa, 3 kDa, and 1 kDa. The bioactivity of each ultrafiltration component was analyzed, including the inhibition rates of alpha-amylase and xanthine oxidase (XOD) activities and the scavenging rates of 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) cation radicals. The results indicated that alkaline protease was the best enzyme for hydrolyzing YWPCs. The peptide concentration in the YWPC hydrolysate was the highest (17.21 mg/mL) at a pH of 8 and a concentration of 7500 U/g, after 2.5 h at 62 degrees C. The enzymatic hydrolysate was ultrafiltered to yield four peptide fractions, of which the <1 kDa peptides exhibited the highest alpha-amylase inhibitory activity (22.06%), XOD inhibitory activity (17.15%), and ABTS cationic free radical scavenging rate (69.55%). This demonstrates the potential of YWPC hydrolyzed peptides for hypoglycemic, uric acid-lowering, and antioxidant applications, providing a theoretical basis for the high-value utilization of YWPCs.

AB  - Temporal variation in floral nectar properties and their effects on reproductive success in plants that flower from winter to summer remain poorly understood. Camellia perpetua (Theaceae) blooms almost year-round in the karst regions of Guangxi, South China. Nectar characteristics and pollinator visits were observed in two populations: in the Guilin Botanical Garden (GBG) and PaiRu Village, Chongzuo White-Headed Langur National Reserve (PRV). Nectar is secreted in the buds of C. perpetua approximately 4-5 h before opening. The total nectar volume per flower was higher in winter (453.66 +/- 4.67 mu L) than in summer (129.14 +/- 4.48 mu L). Nectar secretion decreased during the day but increased in the evening. The amount of sucrose /(fructose + glucose) ratio was significantly higher in winter (49.69 +/- 2.56) than in summer (6.99 +/- 0.42). The glutamic acid content was higher in summer than in winter. During the summer and winter flowering seasons, birds (Aethopyga christinae [the fork-tailed sunbird] in the GBG and PRV) and three bee species (in the GBG: Apis cerana, Apis mellifera ligustica, and Nomia chalybeata) were the primary visitors. The frequency of birds visiting flowers, fruit and seed set was significantly higher in winter than in summer in both populations. Furthermore, the seed set was significantly higher in PRV than in the GBG. The higher floral visitation rates by birds during winter compared to summer were associated with a larger volume and higher proportion of sucrose in the nectar during that season. This seasonal differentiation in floral nectar traits seemed to be associated with different pollinator functional groups. However, further studies are needed to determine whether factors other than the variation in nectar traits, such as temperature, play a role.

AB  - Simple Summary: Animal growth depends on various factors, such as breed, nutrition, growth hormones, physiological stage, and environment. Therefore, the decrease in piglets' growth after weaning is not only related to a decrease in feed intake but may also be related to the breed and growth hormones. Thus, the present study investigated the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system components in Chinese indigenous pig breeds (Taoyuan black and Xiangcun black pigs) and commercial pig breeds (Duroc pigs) during weaning. Our findings indicated that weaning can affect the expressions of IGF system components in piglets, and the expressions of IGF system components in response to weaning stress differed in the three pig breeds. The differences in IGF system components in the three pig breeds might be related to their anti-stress tolerance characteristics. The present study investigated the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their receptors and binding proteins among three pig breeds during weaning. Sixty Duroc (DR), Taoyuan black (TYB), and Xiangcun black (XCB) piglets (20 piglets per breed) were selected at 21 and 24 (3 days of post-weaning) days of age to analyze organ indices, plasma concentrations of IGF and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) using ELISA kits, and gene expression of IGF-system-related components in different tissues. The plasma IGFBP-3 concentration in TYB piglets was higher (p > 0.05) than in the XCB and DR piglets at 21 days of age. At 21 days of age, compared with the DR piglets, the IGF-1 expression was lower (p < 0.05) in the kidney, but it was higher (p < 0.05) in the spleen of XCB and TYB piglets. At 24 days of age, the IGF-1 expression was higher (p < 0.05) in the kidney of TYB piglets than in the XCB and DR piglets, while IGFBP-3 in the stomach and IGFBP-4 in the liver of XCB and TYB piglets were lower (p < 0.05) compared with the DR piglets. Weaning down-regulated (p < 0.05) IGF-1 expression in the jejunum, spleen, and liver of piglets, while it up-regulated (p < 0.05) IGFBP-3 expression in the stomach, IGFBP-4 in the liver, IGFBP-5 in the ileum, and IGFBP-6 in the jejunum of DR piglets. Spearman's correlation analysis showed a negative correlation (p < 0.05) between plasma IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5 concentration and the organ indices of piglets. Collectively, there were significant differences in the IGF system components among the three pig breeds. The IGF system components were altered during weaning, which might be involved in weaning stress to decrease the growth of piglets.

AB  - In January 2014, over 10,000 gallons of methyl-cyclohexane methanol (MCHM) leaked into the Elk River in West Virginia, in a chemical spill incident that contaminated a large portion of the state's water supply and left over 300,000 residents without clean water for many days and weeks. Initial efforts to remove MCHM at the treatment plant centered on the use of granulated activated carbon (GAC), which removed some of the chemical from the water, but MCHM levels were not lowered to a "non-detect" status until well after the chemical plume had moved downstream of the intake. Months later, MCHM was again detected at the outflow (but not the inflow) at the water treatment facility, necessitating the full and costly replacement of all GAC in the facility. The purpose of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that preferential absorbance of one of the two MCHM isomers, coupled with seasonal variations in water temperature, explain this contrary observation. Calculated intermolecular potentials between ovalene (a large planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) and the MCHM isomers were compared to physisorption potentials of MCHM onto an amorphous carbon model. While a molecular mechanics (MM) force field predicts no difference in the average interaction potentials between the cis- and trans-MCHM with the planar ovalene structure, MM predicts that the trans isomer binds stronger than the cis isomer to the amorphous carbon surface. Semi-empirical and density functional theory also predict stronger binding of trans-MCHM on both the planar and amorphous surfaces. The differences in the isomer binding strengths on amorphous carbon imply preferential absorbance of the trans isomer onto activated charcoal filter media. Considering seasonal water temperatures, simple Arrhenius kinetics arguments based on these predicted binding energies help explain the environmental observations of MCHM leeching from the GAC filters months after the spill. Overall, this work shows the important implications that can arise from detailed interfacial chemistry investigations.

AB  - Goats can walk freely and flexibly in complex environments such as concave and convex or soft ground. And their flexible spine has functions such as adjusting balance and providing auxiliary power during movement, while the limbs only have support functions. The spine has an adjustable and decisive role in the pressure on the sole of the hoof of the goat. Therefore, the goat spine was taken as the bionic prototype, the three-dimensional force distribution of the goat body space was analyzed, and the optimal spinal space curve was explored, combined with the goat gait cycle. Based on the study of spinal curve arrangement and placement, the spinal curve was stretched along the grouser length direction. The soil contact surface structure of the track monomer was constructed based on functional simulation. And the bionic structure of the track monomer with superior adhesion performance was explored. The results of simulation analysis and soil tank test both showed that the attachment performance of bionic structure was better than that of an ordinary structure. It showed that adding bionic curves to the contact surface of the track monomer could significantly improve the adhesion performance, and the bionic structure with a single bionic curve arranged on the complete contact surface of the track monomer had the best adhesion performance. Moreover, the adhesion of the optimal track monomer bionic structure was increased by 19.22 N compared with an ordinary structure in the soil tank test, which verified the superiority of the track monomer bionic structure design.

AB  - Game meat is an important source of meat borne parasitic infections. Due to its omnivorous diet, the wild boar is an important host of zoonotic parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii can cause severe to fatal disease in immunosuppressed patients, as well as congenital disorders in foetus and neonates. Consumption of undercooked infected meat is a main source of T. gondii infection. Information about the risk of toxoplasmosis through game meat is scarce. We collected serum samples from 42 wild boars from the federal state of Thuringia (Germany) between December 2017 and February 2018. Identification of anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies was conducted using a commercial indirect ELISA kit. Seropositivity was confirmed in 18 of the 42 samples (37.50%). From these, the highest seroprevalence was found in adult animals. This study joins another single database from wild boars in Brandenburg. The necessity of a country-wide database regarding T. gondii prevalence in wild boar and other game meat is pivotal for a profound risk analysis with its consequential impact in future mean hygiene policies.

AB  - Maintaining the proper balance between granulosa cells (Gc) proliferation and apoptosis is crucial for folliculogenesis and female fertility. Our previous study showed expression of omentin-1 (intelectin-1, ITLN1) in the porcine ovarian follicles; however, its impact on Gc functions remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the in vitro effects of ITLN1 on Gc proliferation and apoptosis in Large White (LW) and Meishan (MS) pigs. These breeds were chosen due to their distinct reproductive characteristics: MS pigs are known for maintaining a higher number of follicles during the follicular phase and exhibiting greater estradiol synthesis compared to LW pigs. Porcine Gc were incubated with ITLN1 (10-100 ng/mL) for 24-72 h, and the viability/ proliferation (alamarBlue/BrdU assays), cell cycle progression (flow cytometry) and the gene and protein expression of proliferation/apoptotic markers (PCNA, cyclins A1, B2, D1, E1, caspases-3,-9, BCL-2, BAX, FAS, FADD, XIAP) (real-time PCR, western blotting) were assessed. Next, the effect of ITLN1 on the phosphorylation of several kinases (AKT, AMPK, ERK1/2, STAT3, PKA) and the gene and protein expression of the insulin receptor (INSR) were studied (real-time PCR, western blotting). Then, using pharmacological inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059, 5 mu M), AKT (LY294002, 10 mu M) and INSR (1 mu M), treated alone or with ITLN1 (S961, 50 ng/mL), we analyzed its involvement in the effects of ITLN1 on Gc proliferation/apoptosis. We demonstrated that ITLN1 had a mitogenic effect on Gc by enhancing cell cycle progression and modulating the levels of PCNA, cyclins and apoptotic factors via ERK1/2, AKT, and INSR, suggesting that ITLN1 is a newly identified regulator in ovarian folliculogenesis, regardless of the fatness degree of pigs.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the carcass traits of crossbred F1 goats (Boer x non-descript breed) finished on thinned caatinga pasture enriched with signal grass (Urochloa trichopus Stapf.), and receiving supplementation. Twenty-four crossbred F1 goats with 27.00 ?? 3.32 kg body weight were used. The supplement was designed to meet the nutritional requirements and animals receiving the highest supplementation level could gain 150g per day. For data analysis, a completely randomized design was adopted, with four treatments (supplementation levels of 0.0%; 0.5%; 1.0% and 1.5% body weight) and six replications (animals). Data were subjected to analysis of variance and regression. Supplementation resulted in an increasing linear effect for slaughter weight, hot carcass weight, cold carcass weight, empty body weight, hot carcass yield and cold carcass yield; and a quadratic effect for biological yield. Weight loss by cooling was not influenced by supplementation. For the results of subjective evaluations, only conformation was influenced by supplementation (P<0.05). For morphometry, a positive linear effect of supplementation was found for thorax perimeter, croup perimeter, croup width, thorax width. The level of supplementation caused a positive linear effect on the weight of most non-edible carcass components, and there was no influence of supplementation on most variables for yield. It can be concluded that increasing levels of supplementation up to 1.5% body weight for F1 goats (Boer x non-descript breed) kept on caatinga pasture results in higher carcass weight and yield.

AB  - The global rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) presents a pressing public health challenge with agricultural practices such as the use of manure fertilization, excessive antibiotic use in livestock, and the irrigation of crops with contaminated water contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Despite growing concerns, the pathways through which ARGs migrate from environmental reservoirs to animal microbiomes are poorly understood. In this study, we raised mice from birth in pig manure-fertilized red (Ultisols) and black (Mollisols) soils or unfertilized controls, sampling their gut microbiomes at 8 weeks, to show that early life exposure to manure-fertilized soil profoundly shapes the gut antibiotic resistome in mice. Application of organic manure significantly enriched tetracycline-resistant ARGs in both red and black soils. Mice living in these environments harbored markedly higher abundances of ARGs, particularly the tet(Q) gene, compared to those in nonfertilized environments. Notably, Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae were identified as key hosts of tet(Q), with evidence suggesting a horizontal gene transfer between these families. These findings indicate that manure fertilization not only increases ARG abundance in soils but also facilitates its transfer to animal microbiomes, thereby amplifying the risk of AMR dissemination. This research underscores the importance of improved agricultural management practices to mitigate the environmental transmission of AMR.

AB  - This work aimed to characterize the fermentation process and physicochemical and organic characteristics of bokashi made with ovine, bovine, and pork manure, and to assess its efficiency as an organic fertilizer in the production of green fodder and dry matter, dry matter yield, and stalk:leaf:grain ratio of corn for silage, and to compare such yield when adding chemical fertilizer and without adding chemical fertilizer. No differences were found in fermentation time between manure sources; however, bokashi made with sheep manure presented a greater number of desirable physicochemical and organic characteristics. Green and dry matter forage production and dry matter yield were similar between sheep bokashi and chemical fertilizer. Leaf and grain proportions were statistically higher in corn fertilized with sheep bokashi, compared to the rest of the treatments, so it is concluded that the use of bokashi made with sheep manure as fertilizer for the production of corn for silage, can be a viable option to replace the use of agrochemicals without affecting the yield, for its higher production of grain and leaf, it is suggested as a good forage to obtain high-quality silage.

AB  - Climate change has been disturbing the present species distribution ranges, resulting in the shifting of cultivation areas and decreases in production and quality. Tea (Camellia sinensis L.), which seeks optimum climatic resources, is a key cash crop economically in Kenya. In this study, the shifting of tea suitability was projected with the MaxEnt model under the SSP (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) climate scenarios for the 2050s and 2090s relative to the 1970-2000 distribution. Analysis under the current climatic condition showed that the proportions of optimal and medium- and marginal-suitable areas were 2%, 3%, and 24% of the total area, respectively, and located in south-western (SW), central, and north-eastern (NE) Kenya and, to some extent, in the Rift Valley. It was projected that the potential suitable tea-growing areas would migrate from the western areas to the central, eastern, and north-eastern highlands in Kenya. It was detected that the precipitation of the driest period (July), precipitation of the wettest quarter (April, May, and June), and annual temperature range could be the main climatic factors determining the shift in tea distribution. Compared to the current distribution (29%), the climatically suitable areas for tea production could reach 32.58% of Kenya's land area under the SSP1-2.6 scenarios in the 2050s and 35.08% in the 2090s under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. On the contrary, it was found that the optimal climate-suitable habitats were projected to shrink by 2% and 1% in the 2050s and 2090s under all scenarios on the west side of the Great Rift Valley compared to the current distribution. In comparison, the sizes of medium- and marginal-suitable habitats would increase by 1% and 3%, respectively. The findings indicated that unless adaptive climate actions are taken, climate change could reduce the tea planting areas in western Kenya. Meanwhile, climate suitability was projected to expand upward on the east side of the Rift Valley, enhancing the potential distribution of tea. The developed climate information could be used to design and implement adaptation interventions in the lower elevation areas. Finally, we highlight that the available scientific literature on the climate suitability of tea in Kenya should be broadened by adding non-climatic factors.

AB  - The residues of copper (Cu) in pig manure cannot be ignored, but the influence of Cu on transformation of phosphorus (P) remains unclear in pig manure composting. This study examined the changes of the phosphorus transformation in Cu-rich pig manure treatment (PC) and biochar treatment of Cu-rich pig manure (PCB) in continuous high temperature composting, and the relationship between phosphorus and Cu fractions under these conditions was investigated. The results indicated that biochar could promote the organic phosphorus (OP) transform to inorganic phosphorus (IP), and the content of available phosphorus (AP) increased by 15.13% and 28.71% in PC and PCB, respectively. The addition of biochar enhanced the passivation of copper during continuous high temperature composting, with the PCB treatment achieving a passivation rate of 58.87%, which was higher than that of the PC treatment (49.44%) and the CK control (40.19%). The results of mantel test analysis indicated that the bioavailable Cu had a significant correlation with H2O-IP, NaOH-IP, and HCl-IP (P < 0.01) under PCB treatment, and biochar may passivation Cu by enhancing the precipitation and ion exchange of phosphate ions and Cu (II).

AB  - Some PFASs are immunotoxic in rodent models and associated with diminished vaccine response in exposed humans. This study assessed the immunotoxicity of four PFASs via the T cell-dependent IgM antibody response (TDAR) to sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) in adult male rats following 28-day oral repeat dosing. The PFASs included 1H,1H,9H-perfluorononyl acrylate (PFNAC), 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorohexyl iodide (PFHI), 2-chlorotetrafluoropropionic acid (CTFPA), and 3,3,4,4,5,5,5-heptafluoropentan-2-one (MHFPK), administered in corn oil. The positive control was cyclophosphamide (CPS). Rats were dosed with vehicle or PFAS from Days 0 to 27. On Day 22, an immunogenic dose of SRBCs was administered intravenously. Positive control animals were administered CPS by intraperitoneal injection from Days 22-27. On Day 28, the animals were euthanized; blood, thymus, and spleen samples were collected and weighed. Serum IgM was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Body weights were unaffected in PFAS-treated rats, except for 3 and 10 mg/kg/day PFNAC-treated rats on Days 24, 27, and 28. Relative spleen and thymus weights and serum IgM levels were not affected by the PFASs at the doses tested, whereas CPS-treated animals had significant decreases in these parameters. The rat TDAR, as assessed by the anti-SRBC IgM response, was not affected by these four PFAS test agents following a 28-day oral exposure.

AB  - LncRNAs are essential for regulating skeletal muscle. However, the expression profile and function of lncRNAs in goat muscle remains unclear. Here, an average of similar to 14.58 Gb high-quality reads were obtained from longissimus dorsi tissues of 1-month-old (n = 3) and 9-month-old (n = 3) Wu'an black goats using RNA sequencing. Of a total of 3441 lncRNAs, 1281 were lincRNAs, 805 were antisense lncRNAs, and 1355 were sense_overlapping lncRNAs. These lncRNAs shared some properties with goats, such as fewer exons, shorter transcript, and open reading frames (ORFs) length. Among them, 36 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE lncRNA) were identified, and then 10 random lncRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, 30 DE lncRNAs were neighboring 71 mRNAs and several genes were functionally enriched in muscle development-related pathways, such as APC, IFRD1, NKX2-5, and others. Additionally, 36 DE lncRNAs and 2684 mRNAs were included in co-expression interactions. A lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network containing 4 lncRNAs, 3 miRNAs, and 8 mRNAs was finally constructed, of which XR_001296113.2 might regulate PDLIM7 expression by interaction with chi-miR-1296 to affect skeletal muscle development. This study revealed the expression profile of goat lncRNAs for further investigative studies and provides a fuller understanding of skeletal muscle development.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation caused by agricultural expansion directly influences the spatial distribution of habitats and resources, favoring populations of pest insects such as the polyphagous whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Therefore, pest insects may constantly be dispersing between large- and small-scale crops that vary in quality and size at the landscape level. We aimed to understand how habitat use, dispersal movement and population dynamics of B. tabaci occur between large-scale and small-scale crops. We conducted a field experiment in large-scale soybean farms and small-scale farms cropping tomato plants in Brazil for two years. We collected soybean and tomato plant samples and adult whiteflies on these plants at different times of the phenological cycle of the crops. We determined the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of the plants and the whiteflies collected on these plants. We also estimated the population densities of whiteflies over time on these crops. We found that whitefly populations behave as metapopulations connected by dispersal. The isotopic ratios of B. tabaci revealed that large-scale soybean crops are source habitats of whitefly populations that, after harvest, disperse and redistribute among small-scale tomato farms causing a cascading effect on population growth on the latter. Therefore, understanding the spatial dynamics and management of pests such as whiteflies requires regional strategies, including large-scale and adjacent small-scale crops. C and N stable isotopes used here were able to track pest populations at the landscape level and, therefore, could be helpful to subsidize area-wide pest management strategies of whiteflies.

AB  - Introduction: Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable to injury when encountering large animals such as deer in the roadway. The frequency of these events, factors associated with their occurrence, and the extent of injuries sustained from such crashes are not yet well described. Methods: A review of 10 years (2012-2021) of statewide motorcycle crash reports from a single state with a large deer population was performed to ascertain the frequency of deer-associated motorcycle crashes. Environmental and roadway conditions, as well as motorcyclist age, gender, and helmet usage, were identified to determine if associations exist with the severity of injuries sustained. Results: Statewide, 8.5% of reported motorcycle crashes involved deer. Excluding the two most densely populated counties, this rose to 10.7%, with 24.1% of crashes occurring during non-daylight hours being deer related. Factors associated with increased frequency of more severe injury and death included not wearing a helmet, female gender, and rural county crash location. Death and severe injuries were reported in more than twice as many riders who were unhelmeted compared to those wearing helmets (36.1 vs 16.6%; p < 0.01). Conclusion: In a single midwestern state, deer represent a significant danger to motorcyclists, especially in rural settings during non-daylight hours. A cautious approach to riding during this time, utilizing available safety precautions to minimize risk of severe injury and death, and further exploration of viable interventions to reduce the likelihood of these occurrences should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Structural and chemical plant defence traits may reduce the efficacy of biological control agents in integrated pest management. Breeding programmes have shown arthropod predators' potential to acclimate to challenging host plants. However, whether and how these predators adapt to novel plant environments remain unclear. Using the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis - herbivorous mite Tetranychus urticae system in an experimental evolution setup, we studied the adaptation mechanisms to tomato and cucumber, plants that possess a distinct repertoire of defensive traits.
   RESULTS; Experimental evolution experiments on whole plants revealed that allowing P. persimilis to adapt to tomatoes led to an similar to 100% larger population size. Independent feeding assays showed that tomato- and cucumber-adapted prey reduced predator fecundity. The deleterious effect of ingesting low-quality prey persisted after adaptation of the predator to both cucumber and tomato. We demonstrated that jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defences reduce prey quality by evaluating predator performance on prey fed on JA defence-deficient tomato plants. Transcriptomic profiling of the replicated P. persimilis lines showed that long-term propagation on tomato and cucumber plants produces distinctive gene-expression levels. Predator adaptation to tomatoes results in the loss of a large transcriptional response, in which predicted cuticle-building rather than detoxification pathways are affected.
   CONCLUSION: We showed that the adaptation of predatory arthropods to a novel, challenging plant does not necessarily occur via the prey, but rather through the physical environment of the plant. We provided first insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Cell cryopreservation is widely used for porcine genetic conservation; however, isolating and freezing primary cells in farms without adequate experimental equipment and environment poses a significant challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a quick and simple method to freeze tissues on-site, which can be used for deriving primary fibroblasts when needed to achieve porcine genetic conservation. In this study, we explored a suitable approach for porcine ear tissue cryopreservation. The porcine ear tissues were cut into strips and frozen by direct cover vitrification (DCV) in the cryoprotectant solution with 15% EG, 15% DMSO and 0.1 M trehalose. Histological analysis and ultrastructural evaluation revealed that thawed tissues had normal tissue structure. More importantly, viable fibroblasts could be derived from these tissues frozen in liquid nitrogen for up to 6 months. Cells derived from thawed tissues did not show any cell apoptosis, had normal karyotypes and could be used for nuclear transfer. These results suggest that this quick and simple ear tissue cryopreservation method can be applied for porcine genetic conservation, especially in the face of a deadly emerging disease in pigs.

AB  - Individuals' tolerance toward wildlife can be based on a combination of tangible benefits and costs (e.g. economic gains and losses) as well as intangible benefits and costs (e.g. shared values and risk perceptions). Asian Elephants (Elephas maximus) potentially present both types of benefits and costs for rural communities. We examined which factors were associated with emotional responses toward wild Asian Elephants among agriculturalists using a questionnaire survey of 300 households situated around the Wetahirakanda sanctuary connecting Udawalawe and Lunugamwehera National Parks, Sri Lanka. Respondents were all from the SinhalaBuddhist ethno-religious majority with average annual household incomes of Rs. 339,335 LKR (similar to$2610 USD). We found that none of the surveyed households derived any economic benefits from tourism despite the proximity of two national parks, whereas 171 (57%) had experienced crop damage by Elephants. Though the median annual income lost due to elephants was Rs.50,000 LKR (4%), 21 households (7%) had losses exceeding 100%. Only six individuals (2%) recollected any human fatalities in their communities. Only three individuals reported positive feelings toward elephants, whereas all others had negative or neutral feelings. Economic factors were not significant predictors of feelings toward elephants, whereas fear of elephants and worry about crop damage had the largest and most significant negative effects. Our findings suggest that it might not be sufficient to reduce losses solely at an individual level, but that human-elephant coexistence interventions should target communities as a whole to reduce the spill-over effects of worry and anxiety by association with others who have experienced loss.

AB  - Simple Summary Fat is a vital body tissue of pigs and a crucial index that affects the production efficiency of pigs. In this study, Duroc pigs and Luchuan pigs were used as animal materials, transcriptome sequencing was used to compare the back adipose tissue of the two breeds, to explore the key reason of difference in fat deposition. The result provided new ideas and reference for further study of fat development. Fat deposition is a crucial element in pig production that affects production efficiency, quality and consumer choices. In this study, Duroc pigs, a Western, famous lean pig breed, and Luchuan pigs, a Chinese, native obese pig breed, were used as animal materials. Transcriptome sequencing was used to compare the back adipose tissue of Duroc and Luchuan pigs, to explore the key genes regulating fat deposition. The results showed that 418 genes were highly expressed in the Duroc pig, and 441 genes were highly expressed in the Luchuan pig. In addition, the function enrichment analysis disclosed that the DEGs had been primarily enriched in lipid metabolism, storage and transport pathways. Furthermore, significant differences in the metabolic pathways of alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid explained the differences in the flavor of the two kinds of pork. Finally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) exposed that the difference in fat deposition between Duroc and Luchuan pigs may be due to the differential regulation of the metabolism pathway of fatty acid. Therefore, this study described the differential expression transcriptional map of adipose tissue of Duroc pig and Luchuan pig, identified the functional genes regulating pig fat deposition, and provided new hypotheses and references for further study of fat development.

A field trial was conducted to investigate such interaction. Urea enriched with N-15 was applied to soil of the early-sprouting cultivar Jia-ming-1 (JM1) and the late-sprouting cultivar Tie-guan-yin (TGY) on 29 January (early application, EApp) or 10 March (late application, LApp), respectively. The bud density and yield of young spring shoots were significantly decreased in LApp compared to EApp. Such differences were more remarkable in the early-sprouting cultivar (JM1) than in the late-sprouting cultivar (TGY). The N-dff (N derived from N-15-enriched urea) in mature leaves and young spring shoots as well as the amount of N-15 in young spring shoots were all higher in EApp than in LApp. N-dff in both mature leaves (R-2 = 0.99, p < 0.001) and young spring shoots (R-2 = 0.61-0.89, p < 0.01) could be well predicted by the growing degree days of the duration between the N fertilization and sampling. N-dff and N-15 concentrations in mature leaves were significantly correlated with the content of nitrate and the ratio of ammonium to total inorganic nitrogen. Partial least squares path modeling revealed that thermal condition directly affected soil N supply and soil pH and thereby affected N-dff in mature leaves and young spring shoots. Our findings highlight the importance of early pre-spring topdressing of N fertilizer to improve the yield and N use efficiency of spring tea in both early- and late-sprouting tea cultivars. The work identified a synergistic effect of N uptake by tea plants, N transformation, and soil pH related to the thermo-conditions of early and late N topdressing.

AB  - Fluorochloridone (FLC), a pyrrolidone herbicide, has been recognized as a hazardous chemical. The in vitro adverse effects of FLC on the reproduction of livestock have not been assessed. This study was conducted to explore the cytotoxicity and toxicological mechanisms of FLC on cultured goat Sertoli cells. The results showed that FLC exposure significantly decreased goat Sertoli cell viability (p < 0.05) and induced oxidative stress. And FLC treatment promoted apoptosis and initiation of autophagy. Interestingly, FLC inhibited lysosomal biogenesis and blocked autophagic flux in goat Sertoli cells. The expression levels of autophagy-related proteins Atg5, LC3II, and p62 were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in FLC-treated goat Sertoli cells compared with the control. Importantly, FLC-induced ROS accumulation further causes mitochondrial dysfunction and disturbs mitophagy. FLC significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the expression levels of OPA1, MFN2, p-Drp1, FIS1, PINK1, and Parkin in goat Sertoli cells. Moreover, pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, an antioxidant) significantly reduced (p < 0.01) FLC-induced ROS accumulation and reversed the disorder of autophagy levels. Our results indicated that FLC-induced toxicity in primary goat Sertoli cells was characterized by ROS accumulation, inducing oxidative stress, inhibiting lysosomal biogenesis, blocking autophagic flux, and promoting mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of terminal sire (Dorset) use and supplementation with agro-byproducts, specifically corn gluten feed and soy hull, on the carcasses and meat quality of landrace hair sheep (Barbados Blackbelly and St. Croix) under rotational grazing. The crossbred lambs had greater carcass weights and more substantial wholesale cuts from the shoulder, rack, loin, and leg than their purebred counterparts. The purebred supplemented lambs showed comparable enhancements in their carcass characteristics to those of the crossbred lambs. Fresh lamb from the purebred animals displayed a more vivid red and yellow hue compared to the crossbred lambs. The meat from the purebred lambs was found to be softer than that from their crossbred counterparts. Supplementation played a more crucial role than crossbreeding in enhancing carcass quality under the conditions of these experiments. The protein content was notably higher in the meat from the crossbred lambs, while the supplemented lambs produced meat with an increased fat content. Pasture-only lambs had elevated levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, displaying a healthier fatty acid profile than those receiving supplementary agro-byproducts. However, they benefited from the improved lipid oxidation stability and texture properties of the meat. The supplement type had no effects on the carcass characteristics, but it affected the meat composition. Abstract The effects of breed type (purebred or crossbred) and supplementation of agro-byproducts on the growth, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of landrace hair (Barbados Blackbelly; BB and St. Croix; SX) lambs was evaluated. Thirty-six 7.5-month-old purebred hair (BB and SX; body weight = 24.1 +/- 4.26 kg) and terminal sire (Dorset; DO) crossbred lambs (DO x BB and DO x SX; body weight = 31.4 +/- 3.50 kg) rotationally grazed predominantly on Jesup tall fescue pasture during spring with or without agro-byproduct supplementation (soyhull or corn gluten feed at 2% of BW). Following a 77d grazing period, the lambs were harvested, and their carcass characteristics and meat composition were evaluated. Both supplementation and crossbreeding significantly increased their carcass weight and primal cuts, whereas only supplementation increased (p < 0.01) the dressing percentage, and crossbreeding increased the shear force (p < 0.01). Regardless of breed type, supplementing agro-byproducts improved the lipid oxidation stability and texture properties of the fresh lamb, whereas the pasture-only lambs had healthier fatty acid profiles compared with the supplemented lambs. The results indicate that both terminal sire crossbreeding and byproduct supplementation can be used to affect the carcass characteristics and meat composition of landrace hair sheep lambs.

AB  - This work aimed to characterize the fermentation process and physicochemical and organic characteristics of bokashi made with ovine, bovine, and pork manure, and to assess its efficiency as an organic fertilizer in the production of green fodder and dry matter, dry matter yield, and stalk:leaf:grain ratio of corn for silage, and to compare such yield when adding chemical fertilizer and without adding chemical fertilizer. No differences were found in fermentation time between manure sources; however, bokashi made with sheep manure presented a greater number of desirable physicochemical and organic characteristics. Green and dry matter forage production and dry matter yield were similar between sheep bokashi and chemical fertilizer. Leaf and grain proportions were statistically higher in corn fertilized with sheep bokashi, compared to the rest of the treatments, so it is concluded that the use of bokashi made with sheep manure as fertilizer for the production of corn for silage, can be a viable option to replace the use of agrochemicals without affecting the yield, for its higher production of grain and leaf, it is suggested as a good forage to obtain high -quality silage.

AB  - The invasive tree Tecoma stans (L.) Juss. ex Kunth var stans (Bignoniaceae) has been targeted for biological control in South Africa since 2003. Plant nutrients contained in fertilizers typically improve host-plant quality, thereby enhancing the fitness of insect herbivores deployed as weed biocontrol agents. We investigated the effect of increasing nutrient levels (fertilizer treatments) on the growth of potted T. stans plants and on the subsequent performance of the root-feeding beetle Heikertingerella sp. (Chrysomelidae). Enhanced performance of Heikertingerella sp. in culture will improve mass-rearing initiatives for releases in South Africa. Ten newly emerged mating pairs of Heikertingerella sp. were exposed under glasshouse conditions to caged plants that were treated with four regimes of nitrogen: phosphorus: potassium 2:3:2 (14%) + carbon (8%) fertilizer, namely zero (control), low (5.6 g/m(2)), medium (9.4 g/m(2)) and high (13.2 g/m(2)). Increasing nutrient levels significantly increased leaf production and above - and below-ground biomass accumulation in T. stans plants. Similarly, the performance of Heikertingerella sp. was improved substantially, with significantly and progressively higher levels of P-1 adult feeding and F-1 progeny production, and significantly and progressively reduced F-1 developmental times, under increasing nutrient levels. While F-1 adult size was significantly increased by fertilizer application relative to the controls, there were no significant differences between the three nutrient levels. Although the high fertilizer application rates were the most suitable for the culturing and mass-rearing of Heikertingerella sp. adults, medium fertilizer applications may prove more economical to improve host-plant quality and boost beetle numbers for release.

AB  - The larval ecology of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) influences their spatial distributions and the pathogens they transmit. These features are of special concern for deer farmers in Florida where epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is a major source of mortality in captive herds. Rarity of larval morphological expertise leads many researchers to study larval ecology by quantifying emergence, either with field emergence traps or removing substrate from the field for observation under laboratory conditions. We investigated the comparability of these methods in Florida seepages where two recently implicated EHDV vectors, Culicoides stellifer Coquillett and Culicoides venustus Hoffman, are common. We compared the abundance and composition of emerging Culicoides collected from emergence traps with removed substrate samples (soil plugs) at three seepages. Soil plugs were sampled adjacent to the emergence trap and from underneath the trap footprint, and then monitored under laboratory conditions for 11-13 wk to compare the methods and to assess the role of incubation period for removed substrate samples. Emergence traps and removed substrate sampling largely agreed on community compositions and trends within different seepages. However, comparatively large numbers of C. stellifer emerged later than expected and well into the incubation period with emergence still occurring after 13 wk (90 d). Removed substrate samples were more similar to emergence traps at shorter incubation times. The importance of time for the capture of Culicoides in removed substrate sampling was more pronounced than we anticipated and is important from both a methodological and biological perspective.

AB  - Artificial insemination in the swine industry, as in other species, demands adequate semen handling and accurate evaluation for the preparation of seminal doses. Sperm concentration and motility estimates are part of the semen evaluation process and are considered important for maximizing the yield of doses for insemination. In this study, methods were examined for their accuracy in the estimation of boar sperm concentration and motility. Assessments of sperm concentration were carried out using iSperm((R)), ISAS((R)) v1, Open CASA v2, and the Accuread((R)) photometer. Analyses of sperm motility were performed with iSperm((R)), ISAS((R)) v1, and Open CASA v2 systems. In this study, boar semen samples were collected from 10 healthy males from two genetic lines. There were no relevant differences between sire lines when sperm concentration was assessed. A Bayesian analysis was applied to the four methods used to assess sperm concentration to examine whether there are relevant differences between them. Results suggested differences in the four methods, with a probability of relevance (PR) of 0.86-1.00. The iSperm((R)) method revealed higher concentration values within the highest posterior density region at 95% confidence interval (HPD95%) = 167.0, 224.2 M/mL, whereas Open CASA v2 showed the lowest values, with HPD95% = 99.3, 155.9 M/mL. The iSperm((R)) demonstrated higher reliability in measuring sperm concentration compared to other methods or devices within the given range of confidence. ANOVAs revealed relevant differences in the three methods of motility estimation. Overall, differences in boar sperm concentration and motility estimates were found using various methods, but further studies are needed for better characterization of these differences.

AB  - Removal of a strong selective pressure allows for modification of traits previously requisite for survival, which may enable species to take advantage of new ecological opportunities. Globally many traits shared by grasses are a byproduct of strong selection due to mammalian herbivores and fire, including nondehiscence of senesced leaves. We used two genera of grasses (Danthoniiae), Chionochloa and Rytidosperma, that have radiated in New Zealand in the absence of mammalian herbivory and low fire frequency and have unusually high proportions (>50%) of species with dehiscent leaves to examine the ecological consequences of novel growth strategies. We integrate phylogenetic, niche modelling, and common garden studies to understand the evolutionary, biogeographic, and physiological consequences of leaf dehiscence. The Chionochloa and Rytidosperma phylogenies show a complex pattern of the development of dehiscence, with multiple lineages developing leaf dehiscence and several species or subspecies showing reversion to non-dehiscent states. Ecologically, the non-dehiscent species have broader physiological and geographical niches, likely representing continued adaptations to ancestral New Zealand habitats, while dehiscent species have narrower and distinctive niches in colder and wetter habitats. Both modelling and laboratory studies show that dehiscent species are more low temperature adapted than non-dehiscent species. Additionally, dehiscent species have lower quality leaves for herbivores, based on stoichiometry and silica content, suggesting that invertebrate and avian herbivory may have also been an important evolutionary factor in leaf-level traits in these genera. Both dehiscent and nondehiscent species have similar sensitivity to shading. Our results indicate that dehiscence evolved as species changed their defence strategies and allowed species to respond to the new ecological opportunity presented with the appearance of cold, wet alpine environments in the Pliocene-Pleistocene.

AB  - Uterine inflammation is a common reproductive disorder in domestic animals, leading to disturbances in many reproductive processes and economic losses. More information on inflammatory pathways, however, is needed to understand mechanisms of uterine inflammation. The aim of the study was to investigate transcriptomic profiles of the pig endometrium affected by inflammation. On day 3 of the estrous cycle (day 0 = initial day of study), saline or Escherichia coli suspension were injected into uterine horns. In endometrial tissues collected 8 days later, microarray analysis results indicated there were 189 differentially abundant mRNA transcripts (DEGs, 95 in relatively greater and 94 in lesser abundance) after saline injections compared with samples where there was severe acute inflammation. Relative abundance of mRNA transcripts for proteins assigned to inflammatory response, movement of phagocytes, quantity of phagocytes, leukocyte migration and adhesion of immune cells and many other functions related to inflammation were different in the Escherichia coli-treated endometrium than in samples from gilts treated with saline. Among others, S100A9, SLC11A1, CCL15, CCL3L3, CCR1, CD48, CD163, THBS1, KIT, ITGB3, JAK3 and NFKB2 mRNA transcripts were in relatively greater abundance and there were those in relatively lesser abundance including IL24, FGG, SST, CXCL16 and CREB. In this study, for the first time, there was detection of alterations in the transcriptome of the inflamed pig endometrium which may be an important finding for maintaining uterine homeostasis and functions. Results form the basis for future studies focusing on regulation of uterine inflammation in animals and women.

AB  - Trace elements, which may have harmful health effects, are present in the environment at varying concentrations. In Albania, data on exposure risks are limited. This study aimed to assess and compare the concentrations of various trace elements (aluminum, arsenic, boron, calcium, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc) in the hair of cattle and sheep raised in Central Albania (Tirana and Elbasan Counties). Hair samples were collected from 25 cattle and 25 sheep per county and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. Zinc concentrations were significantly higher in cattle than in sheep (p = 0.029), while no differences were observed between counties (p > 0.05), indicating similar environmental conditions. Copper (17.84, 95%CI: 13.63-16.34 and 15.84, 95%CI: 14.00-17.69 mg/kg in cattle, and 15.58, 95%CI: 13.61-17.56 and 14.14, 95%CI: 12.07-16.20 mg/kg in sheep, in Elbasan and Tirana County, respectively), arsenic (2.08, 95%CI: 1.45-1.21 and 1.51, 95%CI: 1.19-1.81 mg/kg in cattle, 1.73, 95%CI: 1.38-2.07 and 1.39, 95%CI: 1.02-1.75 mg/kg in sheep, in Elbasan and Tirana County, respectively), and cadmium (2.36, 95%CI: 1.63-2.07 and 2.00, 95%CI: 1.68-2.32 mg/kg in cattle, 2.00, 95%CI: 1.59-2.40 and 1.71, 95%CI: 1.39-2.02 mg/kg in sheep, in Elbasan and Tirana County, respectively) concentrations exceeded the values reported in the literature, likely due to contamination from local mining and metal processing activities. Further research is needed to determine the sources of contamination and assess potential risks to animal and human health.

AB  - Microplastics have become ubiquitous in the environment and are increasingly found in a variety of matrices, including in animal feed. At the same time, the presence of plastics from packaging materials in animal feed is still prohibited in the European Union. This is a major barrier preventing certain organic waste streams from being repurposed as feed. However, issues associated with the presence of plastic particles in feed for `conventional' livestock such as poultry and pigs (e.g. accumulation in stomach/other tissues) may not pose a problem to reared insects such as black soldier fly larvae (BSFL). In the hypothetical absence of such transfer, insects reared on feed contaminated with plastics could potentially be repurposed as feed. Such reuse would be a major opportunity for a more circular food chain. The aim of this exploratory study was to develop a method to determine the potential transfer of microplastics from the substrate to biomass of reared BSFL. Tested plastics consisted of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of three different sizes, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET); to mimic the types of synthetic polymers commonly used for food packaging. The results showed no significant effects of dietary exposure of tested (micro-)plastics on larval yield and survival. We benchmarked fluorescence microscopy through Nile Red staining against a newly developed technique utilizing polarised light optical microscopy to identify plastic particles in BSFL. Tested LDPE particles were virtually absent from the post-exposure larvae. PET was recovered from the larvae, although it is unclear what the exact mechanism for this transfer was. More research is needed to validate these experimental findings with plastics of different types and particle sizes.

AB  - Lying behaviour has been shown to be highly valuable in supporting the productivity and welfare of cattle. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effect of biological and physical factors on the lying behaviour of sheep. Ninety-six Bluefaced Leicester x Welsh Mountain crossbred (Mule) ewes managed to lamb indoors, and 80 Welsh Mountain (WM) ewes managed to lamb at grass were used for the study. Acceleration values were collected for the two flocks from accelerometers fitted vertically to the outside of the rear right leg and set to record at 1-min intervals for at least 14 d prior to parturition. Ewes were simultaneously recorded using video equipment to identify lambing and to verify predictions of lying (total lying time, mean lying bout duration and total number of lying bouts) using data collected from 10 randomly selected ewes from the indoor flock on day -10 prior to lambing. Linear regression was used to evaluate predicted behaviours with video footage. Predictions of total lying time (R2 0.99; P > 0.05 for slope = 1, intercept = 0), mean lying bout duration (R2 > 0.99; P > 0.05 for slope = 1, intercept = 0) and total number of lying bouts (R2 > 0.98; P > 0.05 for slope = 1, intercept = 0) were strongly associated with video footage (P < 0.001) demonstrating that a 1-min sampling interval provides reliable estimates of ewe lying behaviours. Measures of lying (mean daily lying time, mean lying bout duration and mean daily lying bouts) were calculated for all ewes using averages taken across days -10, -9 and -8 prior to lambing. Linear regression was used to test for effects of independent variables (pregnancy scan result (single- or twin-bearing), ewe age, ewe BCS, lambing ease, lamb sex and lamb birth weight) on each measure of lying. Significant associations (P < 0.05) were found between measures of lying and pregnancy scan result, ewe age, sex of singleton lambs and twin birth weight for housed, Mule ewes. Only ewe age and twin birth weight were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with measures of lying for WM ewes managed at grass. This information could help guide further research on sheep behaviour for management purposes (e.g., to optimise stocking densities and welfare for pregnant ewes). Further work should also consider evaluating measures of lying as proxies for imminent parturition.

AB  - Energy conservation is linked to survival and fitness of overwintering ectotherms, and is particularly critical in winter. Although many insects overwinter individually, some form aggregations with conspecifics. Aggregations cause metabolic suppression in some insects, but the effect of aggregations on metabolic rates and energy use in overwintering aggregations remains underexplored. The convergent ladybeetle (Hippodamia convergens) over winters in massive aggregations, making it an ideal system for testing the effect of aggregation size on metabolic rates in overwintering insects. We measured metabolic rates of beetle aggregations of 1, 10, 25, and 50 individuals using stop-flow respirometry across two ecologically relevant temperatures, and measured locomotor activity as one possible driver of group effects on metabolic rate. Metabolic rates per beetle decreased with increasing aggregation size at both temperatures, but was more pronounced at low temperatures. Metabolic rates scaled hypometrically with mass, with deeper response at cool temperatures. Activity decreased with aggregation size, but only at low temperatures. These results suggest that individuals within aggregations enter a deeper metabolically inactive state that single individual beetles cannot achieve, which is partly but not completely explained by a reduction in locomotor activity. This group strategy for energy conservation may provide an additional selective advantage for the evolution of large overwintering aggregations.

AB  - The exponential growth of the economy and society has resulted in a substantial need for superior urban green spaces, consequently fostering a significant surge in urban landscape construction. The integration of plant landscapes in urban landscape construction is crucial. The rational use of plant landscape resources to create high-quality urban green spaces is of great significance for promoting urban sustainable development. Hence, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the landscape and ecological functions of indigenous plants in the context of urban landscape implementation and then provide utilization strategies of indigenous plants for urban landscape construction. This research focuses on the utilization of native plants in Aksu's urban green spaces (a city in northwest China). Through a contrastive analysis of the dust retention, windbreak and sand fixation, and landscaping capabilities of these native plants, certain indigenous species are identified as suitable candidates. Specifically, Styphnolobium japonicum and Ulmus densa exhibit a dust adhering per plant of 656.50 and 388.46 g center dot m-2, respectively. Consequently, augmenting their planting proportion can effectively augment the overall dust adhering within the garden. The windbreak distances of Populus bolleana, Populus euphratica, and Styphnolobium japonicum were found to exceed 60 m, indicating their effectiveness in mitigating wind and sand erosion. Therefore, strategically planting these species can contribute to the establishment of a robust urban windbreak forest. Additionally, optimizing the arrangement of Rosa multiflora, Hippophae rhamnoides, Berberis thunbergii, and Salix matsudana can enhance the aesthetic appeal of urban gardens. The utilization of native plants holds promise in enhancing the ecological and landscape functions of urban gardens in Aksu. The effective enhancement of the ecological function and the landscape effect of urban gardens can be achieved through the appropriate reconstruction with native plants. The findings of this study hold significant reference value for the urban landscape architecture in arid urban areas.

AB  - Simple Summary: Procambarus clarkii is an economic freshwater aquaculture species which is popular with consumers for its delicious flavor and high protein content. Salinization of freshwater ecosystems is an increasingly pressing global issue that poses a significant threat to aquaculture. Salinity is an important environmental factor directly affecting the metabolism, growth, reproduction, and physiological processes of aquatic animals. In this study, crayfish were subjected to acute low salt (6 ppt) and high salt (18 ppt) stress and investigated using transcriptome sequencing technology. The response of the crayfish to different salinity stresses, especially immunity, metabolism, ion transport, and osmoregulation, was analyzed to illustrate the resistance mechanism of crayfish facing salt stress. The results of this study are intended to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which freshwater organisms respond to salinity stress and provide useful references for the healthy culture of crayfish and the utilization of saline soils. Salinization of freshwater ecosystems is a pressing global issue. Changes in salinity can exert severe pressure on aquatic animals and jeopardize their survival. Procambarus clarkii is a valuable freshwater aquaculture species that exhibits some degree of salinity tolerance, making it an excellent research model for freshwater aquaculture species facing salinity stress. In the present study, crayfish were exposed to acute low salt (6 ppt) and high salt (18 ppt) conditions. The organisms were continuously monitored at 6, 24, and 72 h using RNA-Seq to investigate the mechanisms of salt stress resistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the crayfish responded to salinity stress with numerous differentially expressed genes, and most of different expression genes was observed in high salinity group for 24h. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that metabolic pathways were the primary response pathways in crayfish under salinity stress. This suggests that crayfish may use metabolic pathways to compensate for energy loss caused by osmotic stress. Furthermore, gene expression analysis revealed the differential expression of immune and antioxidant-related pathway genes under salinity stress, implying that salinity stress induces immune disorders in crayfish. More genes related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, such as the Foxo, Wnt, Hippo, and Notch signaling pathways, responded to high-salinity stress. This suggests that regulating the cellular replication cycle and accelerating apoptosis may be necessary for crayfish to cope with high-salinity stress. Additionally, we identified 36 solute carrier family (SLC) genes related to ion transport, depicting possible ion exchange mechanisms in crayfish under salinity stress. These findings aimed to establish a foundation for understanding crustacean responses to salinity stress and their osmoregulatory mechanisms.

AB  - Agriculture's goal to meet the needs of the increasing world population while reducing the environmental impacts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer use without compromising output has proven to be a challenge. Manure and composts have displayed the potential to increase soil fertility. However, their potential effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions have not been properly understood. Using field-scaled lysimeter experiments, we conducted a one-year study to investigate N2O and CH4 emissions, their combined global warming potential (GWP: N2O + CH4) and yield-scaled GWP in a wheat-maize system. One control and six different organic fertilizer treatments receiving different types but equal amounts of N fertilization were used: synthetic N fertilizer (NPK), 30% pig manure + 70% synthetic N fertilizer (PM30), 50% pig manure + 50% synthetic N fertilizer (PM50), 70% pig manure + 30% synthetic N fertilizer (PM70), 100% pig manure (PM100), 50% cow manure-crop residue compost + 50% synthetic N fertilizer (CMRC), and 50% pig manure-crop residue compost + 50% synthetic N fertilizer (PMRC). Seasonal cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.39 kg N ha(-1) for the PMRC treatment to 0.93 kg N ha(-1) for the NPK treatment. Similar CH4 uptakes were recorded across all treatments, with values ranging from -0.68 kg C ha(-1) for the PM50 treatment to -0.52 kg C ha(-1) for the PM30 treatment. Compared to the NPK treatment, all the organic-amended treatments significantly decreased N2O emission by 32-58% and GWP by 30-61%. However, among the manure-amended treatments, only treatments that consisted of inorganic N with lower or equal proportions of organic manure N treatments were found to reduce N2O emissions while maintaining crop yields at high levels. Moreover, of all the organic-amended treatments, PMRC had the lowest yield-scaled GWP, owing to its ability to significantly reduce N2O emissions while maintaining high crop yields, highlighting it as the most suitable organic fertilization treatment in Sichuan basin wheat-maize systems.

AB  - Simple Summary Copy number variation (CNV) is a type of variant that may influence meat quality of, for example intramuscular fat (IMF). In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was then performed between CNVs and IMF in a pig F2 resource population. A total of 19 CNVRs were found to be significantly associated with IMF. RNA-seq and qPCR validation results indicated that CNV150, which is located on the 3 ' UTR end of the proline, as well as glutamate and the leucine rich protein 1 (PELP1) gene may affect the expression of PELP1 alternative splices. We infer that the CNVR may influence IMF content by regulating the alternative splicing of the PELP1 gene and ultimately affects the structure of the PELP1 protein. These findings suggest a novel mechanistic approach for meat quality improvement in animals and the potential treatment of insulin resistance in human beings. Intramuscular fat (IMF) is a key meat quality trait. Research on the genetic mechanisms of IMF decomposition is valuable for both pork quality improvement and the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Copy number variations (CNVs) are a type of variant that may influence meat quality. In this study, a total of 1185 CNV regions (CNVRs) including 393 duplicated CNVRs, 432 deleted CNVRs, and 361 CNVRs with both duplicated and deleted status were identified in a pig F2 resource population using next-generation sequencing data. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was then performed between CNVs and IMF, and a total of 19 CNVRs were found to be significantly associated with IMF. QTL colocation analysis indicated that 3 of the 19 CNVRs overlapped with known QTLs. RNA-seq and qPCR validation results indicated that CNV150, which is located on the 3 ' UTR end of the proline, as well as glutamate and the leucine rich protein 1 (PELP1) gene may affect the expression of PELP1 alternative splices. Sequence alignment and Alphafold2 structure prediction results indicated that the two alternative splices of PELP1 have a 23 AA sequence variation and a helix-fold structure variation. This region is located in the region of interaction between PELP1 and other proteins which have been reported to be significantly associated with fat deposition or insulin resistance. We infer that the CNVR may influence IMF content by regulating the alternative splicing of the PELP1 gene and ultimately affects the structure of the PELP1 protein. In conclusion, we found some CNVRs, especially CNV150, located in PELP1 that affect IMF. These findings suggest a novel mechanistic approach for meat quality improvement in animals and the potential treatment of insulin resistance in human beings.

AB  - In Hungary, from the beginning of the 19th century, horse-chestnut trees have been planted widely and are popular ornamental trees in public parks, along streets, and in gardens. In the summer of 2015, longitudinal cracks on the trunk and branches and the intensive oozing of brown liquid were observed from a wound in a horse-chestnut tree in a park in Budapest. Some years later, in 2018 and 2019, the same symptoms were found in trees in other locations in Budapest. Several bacteria were reported that induce similar symptoms, including cracks and cankers on the bark of trunks and branches and sticky, white, red, brown, or black oozing. These pathogens belong to the genera Brenneria and Lonsdalea. Bark and exudate samples were taken with the aim of identifying the causal agent by conventional and molecular methods. Our results confirmed that the bacteria isolated from Aesculus hippocastanum trees belong to the genus Brenneria and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene region proved to have the closest phylogenetic relation with the Brenneria nigrifluens strains.

AB  - Mitigating the loss and negative impacts of reactive N from fertilized soils remains a global environmental challenge. To optimize N retention by biochar, bamboo and pig manure biochars were modified as MgO-and sepiolite-biochar composites and characterized. Novel soil application of the modified biochars and their raw forms were comparatively evaluated for N-retention in a fertilized soil leached for 90 days in a column experiment. Changes in N-cycling-related enzyme and bacterial structure were also reported after 90 days. Results revealed low leaching losses of NH4+, which reduced over time across all the treatments. However, while sole fertilizer (F) increased the initial and cumulative NO3- leached from the soil, the MgO-bamboo biochar (MgOBF) and sepiolite-bamboo biochar (SBF) treatments re-duced leachate NO3- by 22.1 % and 10.5 % compared to raw bamboo biochar (BBF) treatment. However, 15.5 % more NO3- was leached from the MgO-pig manure biochar-treated soil (MgOPF) compared to its raw biochar treat-ment (PMBF) after 90 days. Dissolved organic N leached was reduced by 9.2 % and 0.5 % in MgOBF and SBF, as well as 15.4 % and 40.5 % in MgOPF and SPF compared to their respective raw forms. The total N of the biochars, ad-justment of surface charges, cation exchange capacity, surface area, pore filling effects, and the formation of potential Mg\\N precipitates on the modified-biochar surfaces regulated N leaching/retention. In addition, the modified bio -char treatments reduced the hydrolysis of urea and stimulated some nitrate-reduction-related bacteria crucial for NO3- retention. Hence, unlike the raw biochar and MgOPF treatments, MgOBF, SBF, and SPF hold promise in mitigat-ing inorganic-N losses from fertilized soils while improving the soil's chemical properties.

AB  - Soybean is one of the major pulse crops being cultivated in India. The production and productivity of soybean are greatly affected due to whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) feeding associated direct damage and indirectly due to yellow mosaic virus transmission. In the present study, activities of antioxidative enzymes viz. superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were estimated spectrophotometrically from the leaf samples collected at two-time intervals (30 and 50 days after sowing) from the whitefly-infested and uninfested plants of eight soybean genotypes. Antioxidative enzyme activities (SOD, POD and PPO) were increased with B. tabaci infestation in all genotypes, with significant variation was recorded among the genotypes at both the sampling intervals. In general, SOD, POD and PPO activities were high in moderately resistant genotypes in whitefly-infested conditions and were negatively correlated with the whitefly population (nymphs and adults), suggesting that the increased activities might have been involved in providing defence against B. tabaci damage. The possible potential mechanisms involving higher antioxidative enzyme activities dealing the insect damage and offering resistance are also discussed.

AB  - Garlic, an important economic crop, provides nutrient-rich straw. When appropriately balanced with silage corn stalks, it is a high-quality forage resource. However, studies on the impact of garlic straw with silage corn stalks on Hu sheep's digestive metabolism and rumen microbiota are scarce. In this study, different addition ratios of garlic straw and silage corn stalks were utilized for in vitro experiments. We designed six experimental groups (CON, G0, G20, G40, G60, G80, and G100) based on varying ratios of garlic straw to silage corn stalks. Rumen microbiota was analyzed through 16S rRNA sequencing. Nutrient composition analysis indicated that garlic straw's relative feeding value (RFV) closely resembled that of silage corn stalks. After 24 h of fermentation, dry matter digestibility and in vitro gas production significantly increased, reaching peak values at a 60% addition ratio. Furthermore, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) such as acetic, propionic, and butyric acid exhibited elevated contents, with the highest yields observed at 60% inclusion. At the genus level, Prevotella, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, and Succiniclasticum were identified as the dominant bacterial groups. The gas production test showed a significant decrease in the G80 group compared to others. Microbial analysis revealed a higher abundance of Prevotella in G80 compared to G20, offering valuable insights for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ruminant animals. Finally, this study predicted the impact of garlic straw with silage corn stalks' addition on Hu sheep's metabolic pathways and biological functions of the rumen microbiota. This research highlights the potential for effectively utilizing garlic straw as a feed resource for Hu sheep and proposes a rational proportion for combining garlic straw with silage corn stalks.

AB  - recent decades, the alteration of coastal food webs (via aquaculture, fishing, and leisure activities), nutrient loading, and an expansion of monitoring programs have prompted an apparent worldwide rise in Harmful Algae Blooms (HABs). Over this time, a parallel increase in HABs has also been observed in the Chilean southern austral region (Patagonia fjords). HAB species like Alexandrium catenella-responsible for Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP)-are of great public concern due to their negative socioeconomic impacts and significant northward geographical range expansion. Many toxic dinoflagellate species (like A. catenella) produce benthic resting cysts, yet a holistic understanding of the physical-chemical and biological conditions influencing the distributions of cysts in this region is lacking. In this study, wemeasured a combination of hydrographic (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) and sediment physical-chemical properties (temperature, pH and redox potential), in addition to meiofaunal abundances -as sediment bioturbators and potential cyst predators- to determine the factors influencing dinoflagellate cyst distribution, with emphasis on A. catenella in and around a "hotspot" area of southern Chile. An analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) test revealed significant differences (p < 0.011) in cyst assemblages between the fjords and oceanic environments. Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) showed significant effects of sediment temperature and silt proportion in explaining differences in the cyst assemblages. A generalized linear model (GLM) indicated that sediment temperature, silt/sand, anoxic conditions, and low abundances of Harpacticoida -a meiofauna herbivore group and potential bioturbator- are associated with the higher resting cyst abundances of the harmful species A. catenella. The implications for A. catenella resting cysts dynamics are discussed, highlighting physical-chemical and biological interactions and their potential for PSP outbreak initiation.

AB  - Tributyltin (TBT), an antifouling biocide frequently detected in aquatic systems, is generally considered to be an environmental obesogen. However, alterations in lipid metabolism in aquatic animals that are exposed to TBT are scarcely known. This study examined the effects of in vitro exposure to TBT on hepatic lipid homeostasis in the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus). Primary seahorse hepatocyte cultures were established for the first time. TBT exposure (100 and 500 nM for 24 h) significantly promoted lipid accumulation in seahorse hepatocytes and drastically reduced the number of active intracellular lysosomes. Furthermore, exposure to TBT significantly upregulated the gene expression of lipogenic enzymes and transcription factors but downregulated that of genes involved in the catabolism of lipid droplets in seahorse hepatocytes. These results indicate that TBT disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis by simultaneously promoting lipid synthesis and inhibiting lipid droplet breakdown in seahorses. The present study extends our understanding of the utilization of primary hepatocytes from marine animals for toxicological research, and the molecular evidence of the effects of TBT on hepatic lipid homeostasis in teleost fishes.

AB  - In the present study, we aimed to identify morphological and molecular changes of in vivo and in vitro-produced goat embryos submitted to cryopreservation. In vivo embryos were recovered by transcervical technique from superovulated goats, whereas in vitro produced embryos were produced from ovaries collected at a slaughterhouse. Embryos were frozen by two-steps slow freezing method, which is defined as freezing to -32 degrees C followed by transfer to liquid nitrogen. Morphological evaluation of embryos was carried out by assessing blastocoel reexpansion rate and the total number of blastomeres. The expression profile of candidate genes related to thermal and oxidative stress, apoptosis, epigenetic, and implantation control was measured using RT-qPCR based SYBR Green system. In silico analyses were performed to identify conserved genes in goat species and protein-protein interaction networks were created. In vivo-produced embryos showed greater blastocoel re-expansion and more blastomere cells (P < 0.05). The expression level of CTP2 and HSP90 genes from in vitro cryopreserved embryos was higher than their in vivo counterparts. Unlikely, no significant difference was observed in the transcription level of SOD gene between groups. The high similarity of CPT2 and HSP90 proteins to their orthologs among mammals indicates that they share conserved functions. In summary, cryopreservation negatively affects the morphology and viability of goat embryos produced in vitro and changes the CPT2 and HSP90 gene expression likely in response to the in vitro production process.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are key components of the soil microbiota and are characterized by their symbiosis with terrestrial plants. In addition to providing nutrients to plants during symbiosis, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can enhance plant defenses against herbivorous insects and pathogens, including induced systemic resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated that Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae perform better in maize plants colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which generally exhibit greater growth and higher nitrogen and phosphorus contents. However, these studies were limited to a small number of maize varieties. Additionally, prior research has not considered the host preference of S. frugiperda females for noncolonized versus arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-colonized maize plants, although female choice can significantly influence progeny performance. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Rhizophagus irregularis (Blaszk, Wubet, Renker, & Buscot) C. Walker & A. Sch & uuml;ss ler (Glomerales: Glomeraceae) inoculation on 4 maize inbred lines (CML 124, CML 343, CML 122, and CML 126) susceptible to S. frugiperda on female oviposition preference and larval performance of S. frugiperda. Overall, females preferred ovipositing on uncolonized seedlings to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-colonized seedlings, independent of the inbred lines. Larval performance was affected by inbred lines and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization. Larvae feeding on noncolonized maize seedlings exhibited significantly higher weights than those feeding on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-colonized seedlings. Among the inbred lines, larvae fed CML 122 performed better than those fed CML 126 and CML 343 seedlings. The weight of the larvae fed on CML 124 seedlings was similar to that of the larvae fed on CML 122, CML 126, and CML 343 seedlings.

AB  - Feral swine, Sus scrofa L., have become a nuisance to landowners across the United States by damaging agriculture, property, and ecosystems. Additionally, these animals have been found to host various ixodid ticks including Amblyomma americanum (L.), Amblyomma maculatum Koch, Dermacentor variabilis (Say), and Ixodes scapularis Say, which can maintain and transmit several rickettsial pathogens to livestock, wildlife, and humans. Though previous research has identified the maintenance cycle of several rickettsial pathogens in ticks and native wildlife, little is known about the role S. scrofa plays in supporting ixodid ticks and the pathogens these ticks could be harboring. This study sought to identify rickettsia! agents (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae and Rickettsiaceae) in ticks collected from S. scrofa obtained in Florida and South Carolina. Overall, ticks from four species (A. americanum, D. variabilis, I. scapularis, and A. maculatum) totaling 258 collected individuals were obtained from S. scrofa (n = 45). We found an Ehrlichia chaffeensis Anderson et al. infection prevalence in A. americanum of 2.7% and 2.9% in Florida and South Carolina, respectively. A Rickettsia parked Lackman et al. prevalence of 100% and 33% was found in A. maculaturn from Florida and South Carolina, respectively. Additionally, a 0.9% infection prevalence of R. parkeri was identified in A. americanum collected in South Carolina. A 1.9% Ehrlichia ewingii Anderson et al. infection prevalence was documented in collected A. americanum in South Carolina. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role S. scrofa plays in the natural maintenance of rickettsia! agents in various regions of the United States.

AB  - Monarchs and their milkweed hosts are well studied for mechanisms of plant defence and insect counter-defence, but little is known about their associated microbiomes in this iconic system. It is unclear how herbivore-induced changes in milkweed microbiomes are linked to chemical defensive responses (i.e., plant secondary metabolites). Metagenomics was used to characterise functional gene profiles of bacterial communities associated with plant tissues and monarch caterpillars feeding in milkweed spp. (Asclepias curassavica L., 1753, Asclepias syriaca L., 1762, and Asclepias tuberosa subsp. tuberosa). We compared the influence of monarch feeding and milkweed spp. on phyllosphere and rhizosphere communities. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to profile microbial diversity, predict annotative functions, assess microbial plant secondary metabolite (PSM) degradation potential, and look for enrichment of PSM degradation pathways. Findings show phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiomes have distinct functional gene profiles and the presence of potential PSM metabolism genes that varied across milkweed spp. Rhizosphere metagenomes had more genes and metabolic pathways involved in degradation/detoxification of known classes of PSMs. In relation to milkweed defensive chemical profiles, we saw an inverse pattern of PSM metabolism pathways and enzymes. Overall, results suggested greater potential for PSM metabolism in rhizosphere compared to phyllosphere communities.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate Candida tropicalis as a kind of environmentally friendly dietary additive to manipulate ruminal fermentation patterns, reduce methane emissions and nitrogen excretion, and to screen the appropriate dose for sheep. Twenty-four Dorper x thin-tailed Han crossbred ewes (51.12 kg & PLUSMN; 2.23 kg BW) were selected and randomly divided into four groups which were fed Candida tropicalis at dose of 0 (control), 4 x 10(8) (low dose), 4 x 10(9) (medium dose), and 4 x 10(10) (high dose) colony-forming units (CFU)/d per head, respectively. The experiment lasted 33 days with 21 days for adaptation and 12 days for nutrient digestibility trial and respiratory gases sampling. The results showed that nutrients intake was not affected by Candida tropicalis supplementation (P > 0.05), whereas apparent digestibility of nutrients significantly increased compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Nitrogen and energy utilization increased with Candida tropicalis supplementation (P < 0.05). Compared with the ewes of the control group, rumen fluid pH and NH3-N concentration were not affected (P > 0.05), whereas total volatile fatty acid concentration and molar proportion of propionate were greater (P < 0.05), and molar proportion of acetate and the ratio of acetate to propionate were less (P < 0.05) when the ewes were fed Candida tropicalis. Daily total CH4 production (L/d) and CH4 emissions yield (L/d of CH4 per kg of dry matter intake, metabolic weight, or digestibility dry matter intake) were decreased at the low dose group (P < 0.05). The abundance of total bacteria, methanogen, and protozoa in rumen fluid was significantly higher at medium dose and high dose of Candida tropicalis supplementation (P < 0.05) compared with low dose and the control group. In summary, Candida tropicalis supplementation has a potential to reduce CH4 emissions and nitrogen excretion, and the optimal dose should be 4 x 10(8) CFU/d per head.

Enterococcus infections caused by linezolid resistant enterococci (LRE) are becoming more challenging to treat as their resistance to antibiotics intensifies. Therefore, this study investigated the molecular epidemiology, phenotypic and genomic characterization of enterococci in seven species of farm animals (sheep, chicken, swine, camel, cattle, equine, pigeon) anal swab from Xinjiang, China by agar dilution method, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and bioinformatics analysis. A total of 771 samples were collected, 599 (78 %) were contaminated with Enterococcus spp., among which Enterococcus faecalis (350/599) was dominant. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that high resistance was observed in rifampicin (80 %), tetracycline (71 %), doxycycline (71 %), and erythromycin (69 %). The results of PCR showed the highest prevalent antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were aac(6 ')-aph(2 '') (85 %), followed by tet(M) (73 %), erm(B) (62 %), and aph(3 ')-IIIa (61 %). Besides, 29 optrA-carrying E. faecalis isolates belonging to 13 STs (including 3 new alleles) were detected, with ST714 (31 %, 9/29) being the dominant ST type. The phylogenetic tree showed that optrA-carrying E. faecalis prevalent in the intensive swine farm is mainly caused by clonal transmission. Notably, optrA gene in Enterococcus spp. isolate from camel was first characterized here. WGS of E. faecalis F109 isolate from camel confirmed the colocalization of optrA with other five ARGs in the same plasmid (pAFL-109F). The optrA-harboring genetic context is IS1216E-fexA-optrA-erm(A)-IS1216E. This study highlights the prevalence of MDR Enterococcus (>= 88 %) and four ARGs (>= 75 %) in swine (intensive farming), cattle (commercial farming), and chickens (backyard farming) are high and also highlights that optrA-carrying E. faecalis of farm animals incur a transmission risk to humans through environment, food consumption and others. Therefore, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) monitoring and effective control measures should be strengthened and implemented in diverse animals.

AB  - Population density estimation is essential for wildlife management and conservation. Camera trap (CT) surveys have become popular as non-invasive monitoring, and several methods have been developed to estimate pop-ulation densities of individually unrecognizable animals exclusively from CT surveys, including the random encounter model (REM), the random encounter and staying time (REST) model, the instantaneous sampling (IS) model, and the space-to-event (STE) model. However, these models assume that individual detections are in-dependent events. This assumption is violated when animals live in groups and behave correlatedly. Thus, this study aims to compare the performances of the REM, the REST, the IS, and the STE when animals move cor-relatedly in groups. Their extensions to account for overdispersion of detection count data and an application of group encounters in the REM were also examined. Seven group sizes and two cohesive patterns were simulated using correlated random walk moving biased to the group centers mimicking red deer, and the detection data were fitted to the models. A goodness-of-fit procedure was used to evaluate the fit of the models. It was found that the original model of the IS and the REST, and the REM of the individual encounters to were robust to the violation of independence in detections while the STE underestimated the density; they were, however, poor at data fitting. Although their extensions to the overdispersion improved the model fitting, the negative binomial (NB) models biased the estimates upward in the IS and the REST due to the limitation of sample size, the zero -inflated Poisson in the IS did not bias the estimates but was still poor at fitting in large groups, and the Lomax in the STE did not resolve the underestimation. Applying the group encounters in the REM also biased the density upward. The overestimation in the NB model occurs when the Bayesian p-value exceeded 0.5. This relationship would be informative in evaluating the possibility of overestimations in the NB model.

AB  - Infections with soil-transmitted helminths pose a significant threat to wildlife in enclosures, where transmission of these parasitic larvae is easier due to the limited space. Nematophagous fungi offer a promising solution as they can naturally control these nematodes. In this study, three nematophagous fungi (Arthrobotrys oligospora, Dactylaria scaphoides, Nematoctonus leiosporus) purchased from the non-profit global biological resource center ATCC were tested for their suitability as biological control agents. The nematodes Strongyloides sp., Trichostrongylus sp. and Oesophagostomum sp. Were isolated from three animal species: wild boar (Sus scrofa) (n = 10), fallow deer (Dama) (n = 5) and mouflon (Ovis orientalis musimon) (n = 5) from a wildlife park using the Baermann-Wetzel method. In a second step, the fungi were brought into contact with the parasites on the soil of the enclosures. The two media tests showed that the nematophagous fungi were more effective on the agar plate than on the autoclaved soil. Only D. scaphoides showed good efficacy on both media, while the other two fungi showed more marked differences on the two media. The results showed that these three nematophagous fungi can reduce parasites in soil before they are ingested by an infected animal. Given the increasing development of drug resistance and the use of chemical agents for soil treatment, this is an important finding that should be pursued in the future.

AB  - Simple Summary Oocytes are the foundation of life in mammals. They develop in small sacs called follicles in the ovaries. Each follicle holds one oocyte and numerous accompanying cells, and the final stage of oocyte development happens in a follicle called the antral follicle. The successful growth and maturation of oocytes depend on complex interactions with neighboring cells, mainly granulosa cells. Understanding the differences among these granulosa cells within the antral follicle and how they communicate with each other is essential for comprehending how mammals reproduce and grow. In this study, we collected cells from these follicles in pigs and utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomic features of these cells. The study discovered diverse subpopulations of granulosa cells within antral follicles, and they were found to communicate extensively. These findings provide us with valuable insights into how follicles develop and oocytes mature in pigs. This could potentially help improve pig reproduction efficacy and advance our knowledge in human reproductive medicine.Abstract The antral follicle stage is a critical period in mammalian oocyte maturation, marked by complex interactions between oocyte development and neighboring granulosa cells. Understanding the heterogeneity and communication patterns of granulosa cells within antral follicles is crucial for deciphering their roles in follicle development and oocyte maturation. Here, we employed single-cell RNA-sequencing to explore the molecular and cellular characteristics of porcine antral follicles. Our analysis revealed distinct subpopulations within mural and cumulus granulosa cells, indicating diverse cellular states and functions within the follicles. Functional enrichment analysis unveiled the involvement of specific subpopulations in steroid biosynthesis, cumulus expansion, and cellular communication. Moreover, comparing mature and less mature follicles highlighted differences in cell distribution and functions, indicating developmental-specific variations. Our findings shed light on the intricate cellular heterogeneity and communication network within porcine antral follicles, providing valuable insights into the regulation of follicle development and oocyte maturation in pigs. These results hold promise for improving pig reproductive efficiency and advancing human reproductive medicine.

AB  - Facial eczema (FE) in ruminants is associated with the fungal toxin sporidesmin that can cause significant mortality in grazing livestock. Incidences are particularly severe in New Zealand but are reported worldwide. The syndrome has historically been attributed to Pithomyces chartarum, a species transferred to Pseudopithomyces in 2015, but the classification of many other Pithomyces species remains unresolved. In this study we investigated the taxonomy of Pseudopithomyces using modern species concepts and clarified which species make sporidesmin. Fungal isolates were cultured from grass samples obtained from New Zealand farms and roadside collections in 2014-2022. International isolates, including all available types, and historic isolates deposited in the International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants (ICMP) were also evaluated. Phylogenetic analyses of the ITS region plus four concatenated protein coding genes distinguished 15 species in the genus. We describe Pseudopithomyces toxicarius sp. nov. as a novel sporidesmin producing species, most formerly identified as Pse. chartarum, with 80 % of isolates in this study able to produce the toxin. Two Pithomyces species are combined into Pseudopithomyces as Pseudopithomyces cynodontis comb. nov. and Pseudopithomyces pavgii comb. nov. We also place Pseudopithomyces pandanicola in synonymy with Pseudopithomyces palmicola. Pithomyces terricola is reclassified into the family Longipedicellataceae as Pseudoxylomyces terricola comb. nov. Pseudopithomyces chartarum was the only other species where sporidesmin was detected, but this was found in only one of 14 isolates we tested. The extent of sporidesmin synthesis in this genus remains to be determined due to the limited availability of strains for testing in other species. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms from whole genome Illumina sequences of isolates from Pse. toxicarius, Pse. chartarum and Pse. palmicola revealed distinct genetic subclades within each species. Four species were detected in New Zealand. Pseudopithomyces toxicarius and Pse. chartarum were recovered from grass samples collected from the North and South Islands, Pse. palmicola ICMP 12878 was recovered once from pasture at a North Island research station in 1993, and Pseudopithomyces sp. 'gladiolus NZ', which is currently undescribed. No species were unique to New Zealand, suggesting widespread global distribution.

AB  - The caloric content and macronutrient ratio of diet consumed is a major source of phenotypic variation in most animal populations. While these nutritional effects have been well-documented for a variety of life-history and morphological traits, the effects of nutrition on male genitals are poorly understood but genitals are thought to be more canalised than general morphology and hence less susceptible to variation in nutrition. Even less is known about the effects of nutrition on female genital form, which to our knowledge, have never been investigated. Here we tested for effects of juvenile dietary macronutrients (protein and carbohydrate) on larval survival, adult morphology, including genital size and shape in male and female flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum). We found there was nutritionally induced plasticity in larval survival and morphology, although the latter effect was variable, with body size being most responsive to dietary macronutrients and genital size and shape being least responsive. Functionally equivalent morphological traits in the sexes responded similarly to nutrition. Previously, we showed that the genitalia of male and female T. castaneum are subject to strong stabilising sexual selection, and our current findings suggest that developmental mechanisms reduce the nutritional sensitivity of male and female genitals, possibly to ensure matching during mating.

AB  - In the context of agroecological transition, breeding females with robust reproductive performance, leading to prolonged lactation sequences, is valuable for farmers. This study aimed to explore the relationship between artificial insemination (AI) success and phenotypic lactation curves that serve as proxies for key biological functions in Alpine and Saanen goats. Using data from two French experimental farms (1996-2021), the study analyzed time series data on milk yield (MY), body weight (BW), and sternal body condition score (BCS_S). These data were modeled at the lactation scale to characterize dynamic profiles and create clusters. Each phenotypic lactation curve was evaluated with three levels of detail: cluster membership, synthetic indicators, and model parameters. To investigate AI success, three datasets were used: 638 lactations with complete MY, BW, and BCS_S data; 1359 lactations with MY and BW; and separate sets with 1731 MY and 795 BCS_S records. A mixed logistic regression model (year as a random effect) assessed the relationship between AI success and phenotypic lactation curve characteristics. Results showed that for primiparous goats, AI success was influenced by MY clusters (p < 0.05), while in multiparous goats, MY and BCS_S clusters did not influence AI success. However, indicators such as persistency (p < 0.001) and BW repletion speed (p < 0.001) were significant. Overall, the lactation curve shape was more important to AI success than milk production level, offering insights for enhancing reproductive performance in dairy goats.

AB  - In holometabolous insects, life-history characteristics can vary in response to diet. The main aim of this contribution was to examine which diet best promotes larval development and survival of the aquatic saprophagous hoverfly Eristalis tenax L. (Diptera: Syrphidae). This study was motivated by a need to optimize techniques for rearing these insects in captivity. We studied how adding yeast to several rearing media based on animal droppings or decaying plant material affected development and survival in captive larvae, and whether these effects could be optimized depending on the amount of yeast and the rearing medium. In addition, premature exit of larvae was examined in two medium volumes to investigate differences in pupation. Larvae in yeast supplemented rabbit growth medium pupated and emerged faster than those in horse and antelope growth media. A high number of adult females emerged when compared to males, and both seemed to have a shorter developmental period in yeast supplemented growth media. Pupal survival was significantly greater in a mixture of droppings and plant organic matter, and a high medium volume of 140 ml (p < 0.05). Between 10% and 17% of larvae prematurely exited the aquatic medium in high (140) and low (70 ml) medium volumes, respectively. These results provide additional information that may be crucial for the successful mass rearing of E. tenax in captivity, and suggest that apart from the addition of yeast, growth medium quality and volume may be limiting factors for the production of large colonies of adults.

AB  - Aim: Identification of Jamun (Syzygium cumini L. sleeks) resistant genotypes against important fruit borers, Meridarchis scyrodes and Dudua aprobola for their sustainable management.
   Methodology: Twenty-six genotypes of Syzygium cumini from the gene bank were tested for resistance against fruit borers. Randomly fruits were collected from three plants of each genotype and mean incidence of fruit borers Meridarchis scyrodes and Dudua aprobola was recorded along with biophysical structures. The collected fruits were also analyzed for antixenotics and allelochemical biomolecules.
   Results: On the basis of resistance scale, 5 genotypes were resistant, 11 were moderately resistant; 7 were susceptible and 2 were highly susceptible to fruit borers (M. scyrodes and D. aprobola) infestation. The infestation in different genotypes was negatively correlated with phenols, flavonoides, tannins and alkaloids, while it was positively correlated with fruit length, fruit width, pulp thickness and pulp: stone ratio. The phenolic and tannin content explained 93.30% of genotypic variability against M. scyrodes infestation while the genotypic variability explained 81% due to phenolic content followed by tannin content 10.4 % against D. aprobola infestation.
   Interpretation: The jamun genotypes (GJ-27 & GJ-17) comes out as resistant against fruit bores with minimal infestation that can be used as breeding material for development of high yielding and borer resistant jamun varieties with higher antioxidant activity. We can use the jamun genotypes that resistant to fruit borers with minimal investment to get high yield under good agricultural practices. Therefore, resistance to fruit borers jamun genotypes can be used as part of sustainable management or integrated pest management.

AB  - Currently, common fecal source identification methods in water environments are based on the detection of host-specific gene markers, such as 16S rRNA gene fractions of Bacteroidales and mitochondrial DNA. However, with this approach, identifying all animals contributing to fecal pollution in a catchment has been a challenge, considering numerous species and populations of animals in the area. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of a metabarcoding approach that comprehensively targets mammalian and avian mitochondrial DNA as an approach to identify animal species potentially contributing to pollution. Surface water samples (n = 108) were collected monthly at five sites in Toyama prefecture, Japan under wet and dry weather conditions for two years. The samples were subjected to the metabarcoding targeting mammalian and avian mitochondrial DNA. Further, human (HF183)-, pig (Pig-2-Bac)-, and ruminant (BacR)-specific gene markers were quantified. Human-like DNA (74 samples) and livestock-like DNA, namely, pig-(66 samples), cattle-(23 samples), and chicken-(52 samples) like DNA were frequently observed. Additionally, DNA associated with wild terrestrial animals, waterfowls, and urban birds commonly found in the study area were observed regardless of the weather conditions. Human- and livestock-like DNAs exhibited similar detection trends to their corresponding markers across sites, though the presence of mitochondrial DNA from non-fecal sources was also suggested. The metabarcoding assay was effective for simultaneously and comprehensively evaluating animal species' potential contributions to fecal pollution. Comparing the stability of animal markers and their DNA in the environment would help to further validate the effectiveness of the assay.

AB  - Interactions between arthropods and plants have been documented extensively in late Paleozoic trees and ground cover plants, but they have rarely been recorded in late Paleozoic climbers. In this study, we present the second example of coprolites preserved within the plant tissue from the early Permian fossil Lagerst & auml;tte Wuda Tuff Flora. The host axis is identified as a phyllophore of the climbing fern Hansopteris uncinatus by the combined evidence of anatomy, morphology, and associated plants. Unlike the first coprolites, which were suggested to be produced by oribatid mites, the culprit of the studied coprolites was likely a myriapod or beetle, indicated by their slightly larger size and the boring behaviour. Furthermore, anomalous parenchymatous cells, sclerenchymatous cells, and metaxylem tracheids have been observed surrounding the tunnel, suggesting responses to traumatic stimulus caused by arthropod damage. This discovery provides an informative example of arthropod herbivory on late Paleozoic climbers and sheds light on how the host plant responded during the early stage of injury.

AB  - Wood-feeding termites have a nitrogen-poor diet and have therefore evolved nitrogen conservation strategies. However, termite workers molt periodically, and throughout the lifetime of a colony, millions of exuviae, a nitrogen-rich resource, are produced by the colony. In Coptotermes Wasmann, workers foraging at remote feeding sites must return to the central part of the nest to molt, where the queen, king, eggs, and larvae are located. It was hypothesized that this molting-site fidelity is an efficient way to recycle nitrogen for reproduction and colony growth, as nestmates involved in exuviae consumption can directly transfer such resources to individuals engaged in reproduction (the queen) or growth (larvae). This study investigates whether incipient colonies of C. gestroi (Wasmann) can gain additional biomass when they are fed supplementary exuviae. Incipient colonies were reared in nitrogen-poor or nitrogen-rich conditions, and 0, 1, 5, or 10 exuviae were added to 3-month-old colonies. After 6.5 months, colonies reared in nitrogen-poor environments gained significantly more biomass when exuviae were added than colonies with no added exuviae. However, the addition of exuviae had no effect on colony growth for colonies reared in nitrogen-rich environments. In a second experiment, queens from colonies in which exuviae were effectively removed laid fewer eggs than queens from colonies in which exuviae were not removed. Therefore, consumption of exuviae from molting individuals by nestmates is an important part of the nitrogen recycling strategy in Coptotermes colonies, as it facilitates queen oviposition and colony growth, especially when such colonies have limited access to nitrogen-rich soils.

AB  - The red palm weevil (RPW) Rhynchophorusferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a species of beetle that depends on palm trees to complete its life cycle. RPW larvae feed on palm trunks and can cause tree death, with significant impacts on both wild and cultivated palms. The larvae burrow into the trunk of the palm and feed on the delicate tissue and sap of the palm, killing the host tree. Herbivore insect gut microbiota play important roles in host physiological characteristics such as nutritional needs, immunity, growth and developmental mechanisms, and mating behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota diversity of RPW larvae sampled in Sistan and Baluchistan province, Iran. Analysis of 16S rRNA amplified directly from the intestine showed the presence of Serratia sp., Klebsiella sp., and Shigella sp. from the Enterobacteriaceae family, Bacillus sp. from the Bacillacea family, Enterococcus sp. from the Enterococcaceae family, and Kocuria sp. from the Micrococcaceae family. The results of their cultivation on a modified CMCAgar medium showed that Kocuria, Serratia, Bacillus, Shigella genera have the ability to degrade cellulose. Identifying the bacterial flora and determining their role can be essential to controlling and reducing the population of this pest.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PCx) is involved in many higher-order cognitive processes, including decision making, reasoning, personality expression, and social cognition. These functions are associated with high energy demand and the production of harmful oxygen radicals. Recent studies indicate that kynurenic acid (KYNA) exerts neuroprotective effects, largely due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. To further evaluate the antioxidant potential of this compound, we tested the hypothesis that increasing KYNA levels in the sheep cerebroventricular circulation would positively affect the mRNA expression and activity of selected antioxidant and DNA repair enzymes in the distal part of the brain, i.e., the PCx. Anestrous sheep were infused intracerebroventricularly with a series of two KYNA doses: lower (4 x 5 mu g/60 mu L/30 min) and higher (4 x 25 mu g/60 mu L/30 min) at 30 min intervals. The results demonstrated that KYNA exerted significant dose-dependent stimulatory effects on the activity of superoxide dismutase 2, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase 1 while inhibiting their transcription in a similar manner. In addition, KYNA was also found to dose-dependently activate the base excision repair pathway, as determined by the increased transcript levels of glycosylases: N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase, thymine-DNA glycosylase, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1, and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1. The excision efficiency of damaged nucleobases, such as epsilon A, epsilon C and 8-oxoG, by these enzymes was also increased in response to central KYNA infusion. These findings expand the knowledge on KYNA as a potential protective factor against oxidative stress in the central nervous system.

AB  - Biological invasions are expected to alter food web structure, but there are limited empirical data directly comparing invaded versus uninvaded food webs, particularly in species-rich, tropical systems. We characterize for the first time the food web of Lake Gatun-a diverse and highly invaded tropical freshwater lake within the Panama Canal. We used stable isotope analysis to reconstruct the trophic structure of the fish community of Lake Gatun and to compare it to that of a minimally invaded reference lake, Lake Bayano. We found significant differences between the trophic structures of these two Neotropical lakes, notably that Lake Gatun's fish community was characterized by a longer food chain, greater isotopic diversity, a broader range of trophic positions and body sizes, and shifts in the isotopic positions of several native taxa relative to Lake Bayano. The degree of isotopic overlap between native and non-native trophic guilds in Lake Gatun was variable, with herbivores exhibiting the lowest (20%-29%) overlap and carnivores the greatest (81%-100%). Overall, our results provide some of the first empirical evidence for the ways in which multiple introduced and native species may partition isotopic space in a species-rich tropical freshwater food web.

AB  - In this study, the epididymal histology, caepididymal sperm physiological parameters, serum reproductive hormones, and antioxidant enzyme SOD levels of Tibetan sheep at a 2500 m and 3500 m altitude were compared by using a combination of transcriptome and metabolomics methods. This was conducted to investigate the effects of a high-altitude environment on spermatogenesis and the maturation of Tibetan sheep. The results showed that compared to the low-altitude group, the high-altitude group had a smaller epididymal lumen, thicker epididymal wall, significantly decreased sperm survival rate, and significantly increased sperm deformation rate, but no difference in sperm motility and sperm respiratory intensity. With increasing altitude, Tibetan sheep showed a decreasing trend in serum reproductive hormones (FSH and T), while the antioxidant enzyme SOD activity was significantly reduced. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 139 differentially expressed genes in the Tibetan sheep epididymis under high-altitude conditions. The SYCP2 gene is involved in multiple biological processes related to reproduction and plays an important role in the regulation of epididymal function and sperm quality in Tibetan sheep. Genes like ADCYAP1R1, CABP2, CALN1, and ATP6V1B1 can help maintain sperm viability and maturation by regulating the cAMP signaling pathway, calcium ion homeostasis, and cellular signaling. Metabolomic analysis found that the high-altitude group had increased adenosine content and decreased prostaglandin I2 content in the epididymis. These metabolites are involved in spermatogenesis, motility, fertilization, and early embryonic development. The integrated omics analysis suggests that Tibetan sheep adapt to the high-altitude hypoxic environment by regulating cAMP signaling pathway genes like ADCY and PRKACA, as well as metabolites like adenosine and prostaglandin I2, to maintain epididymal function and sperm motility. These genes and metabolites play an important role in maintaining normal epididymal function and sperm motility at high altitudes.

AB  - The effect of the population density on humoral adaptive immunity in bank (Clethrionomys glareolus) and gray-sided (C. rufocanus) voles has been studied. We used 20-, 40-, and 60-day-old voles born in a vivarium from females captured in the field (May-August). The rearing of voles in the brood groups after the end of lactation modeled a high population density without the possibility of dispersal. The low density was modeled by isolated rearing of the animals after weaning. The number of spleen antibody-forming cells, formed in response to the administration of sheep erythrocytes, was considered an indicator of humoral immunity. We studied animals at the age of 20, 40, and 60 days. Regardless of the population density, the humoral immunity was higher in the bank vole. There were no sex differences in either species. The effect of the density of the social environment on the immunity depended on the species and birth dates of individuals. Without taking into account the birth dates, this indicator was higher for red voles kept in brood groups. The sensitivity of the immune system to social stimuli depended on the birth date of individuals. Regardless of the rearing conditions, voles born in May had a similar level of immunity in all age groups. These differences appeared at the age of 60 days in individuals born in June and at the age of 40 days in individuals born in July and August. The immunity of the gray-sided vole depended on the population density only indirectly, through thermoregulation conditions. In isolated two-month-old individuals of this species born in August, low ambient temperatures caused immunosuppression. The formation of the immune system of both vole species competed with growth processes without influencing maturation.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) disrupts hippocampus-dependent memory, particularly in the dentate gyrus (DG) region, an area crucial for pattern separation. Previous research showed that non-selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitors like roflumilast can alleviate these deficits. However, it remains unclear whether these outcomes are specific to a particular subfamily of PDE4. Hence, this study examined the specific impact of PDE4B inhibitor (A-33) and PDE4D inhibitor (zatolmilast) on spatial pattern separation in sleep deprived mice. Results demonstrated that SD impairs pattern separation, but both zatolmilast and A-33 alleviate these effects. However, A-33 impaired pattern separation in non-sleep deprived animals. The cognitive benefits of these inhibitors after SD may arise from alterations in relevant signaling pathways in the DG. This study provides initial evidence that inhibiting PDE4B or PDE4D holds promise for mitigating memory deficits due to SD.

AB  - The interaction between larval host plant quality and temperature can influence the short-term physiological rates and life-history traits of insect herbivores. These factors can vary locally, resulting in local adaptation in responses to diet and temperature, but the comparison of these interactions between populations is infrequently carried out. In this study, we examine how the macronutrient ratio of an artificial diet determines the larval growth, development, and survival of larval Pieris rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) at different temperatures between two invasive North American populations from different climatic regions. We conducted a fully factorial experiment with three temperature treatments (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 32 degrees C) and three artificial diet treatments varying in terms of the ratio of protein to carbohydrate (low protein, balanced, and high protein). The effects of diet on life-history traits were greater at lower temperatures, but these differed between populations. Larvae from the subtropical population had reduced survival to pupation on the low-protein diet in the cold temperature treatment, whereas larval survival for the temperate population was equally high for all temperature and diet treatments. Overall, both populations performed more poorly (i.e., they showed slower rates of consumption, growth, and development, and had a smaller pupal mass) in the diet with the low protein ratio, but larvae from the temperate population were less sensitive to diet ratio changes at all temperatures. Our results confirm that the physiological and life-history consequences of imbalanced nutrition for insect herbivores may depend on developmental temperatures, and that different geographic populations of P. rapae within North America vary in their sensitivity to nutritional balance and temperature.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of bovine serum albumin (BSA) inclusion in the thawing extender on boar sperm quality. Thawing protocols in sperm cryopreservation are vital, yet underexplored. It has been determined that BSA can interact with membranes, stabilizing them and preventing damage during the freezing process, for this reason it could also have a beneficial effect during thawing. Our study explores modifications in the conventional Beltsville thawing solution, incorporating BSA at different concentrations (0.005, 0.01, 0.025 and 0.050 g/mL), and evaluating the sperm quality after up to 150 min post-thawing incubation (37 degrees C). All BSA concentrations preserved plasma membrane and acrosome integrity, relative to control (BSA absence). In addition, 0.025 g/mL BSA group preserves acrosome integrity over time without compromising motility or kinetic parameters. Our study suggests that BSA inclusion in thawing extenders should be considered as an additive for improving post-thaw boar sperm quality.

AB  - As a class of regulatory factors, microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulating normal muscle development and fat deposition. Muscle and adipose tissues, as major components of the animal organism, are also economically important traits in livestock production. However, the effect of miRNA expression profiles on the development of muscle and adipose tissues in yak is currently unknown. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on Tianzhu white yak longissimus dorsi muscle tissue obtained from calves (6 months of age, M6, n = 6) and young (30 months of age, M30, n = 6) and adult yak (54 months of age, M54, n = 6) to identify which miRNAs are differentially expressed and to investigate their temporal expression profiles, establishing a regulatory network of miRNAs associated with the development of muscle and adipose. The results showed that 1191 miRNAs and 22061 mRNAs were screened across the three stages, of which the numbers of differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) and differentially expressed mRNAs (DE mRNAs) were 225 and 450, respectively. The expression levels of the nine DE miRNAs were confirmed using a reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay, and the trend of the assay results was generally consistent with the trend of the transcriptome profiles. Based on the expression trend, DE miRNAs were categorized into eight different expression patterns. Regarding the expression of DE miRNAs in sub-trends Profile 1 and Profile 2 (p < 0.05), the gene expression patterns were upregulated (87 DE miRNAs). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that the identified DE miRNAs and DE mRNAs were enriched in pathway entries associated with muscle and intramuscular fat (IMF) growth and development. On this basis, we constructed a DE miRNA-mRNA interaction network. We found that some DE mRNAs of interest overlapped with miRNA target genes, such as ACSL3, FOXO3, FBXO30, FGFBP4, TSKU, MYH10 (muscle development), ACOX1, FADS2, EIF4E2, SCD1, EL0VL5, and ACACB (intramuscular fat deposition). These results provide a valuable resource for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of muscle tissue development in yak and also lay a foundation for investigating the interactions between genes and miRNAs.

AB  - The study of animal microbiomes has revolutionized our understanding of host physiology, behavior, and ecology. However, many studies focus on correlations rather than causal functional interaction, and critical caps persist in linking microbial dynamics to ecological and fitness-relevant outcomes. Advances in multi-omics approaches, combined with stable isotope microbiomics, offer promising tools for linking microbial community dynamics to host function in ecologically relevant conditions. Here, we highlight the importance of longitudinal studies, controlled physiological comparisons, and integrative methodological approaches for microbe-host interactions beyond laboratory models. We emphasize the integration of multi-omics approaches and stable isotope probing to track microbial metabolites and their effects on hosts. Examples from African herbivores, geladas, and amphibians illustrate how longitudinal sampling and isotopic labeling can reveal microbiome plasticity in response to environmental variability. Furthermore, experimental systems such as larval amphibians, fish models, and dietary specialists like koalas demonstrate the potential of combining microbiome manipulations with multi-omics to disentangle host-microbe interactions in ecologically relevant contexts. We argue that advancing this field requires moving beyond disease-focused study of model organisms to explore microbiome contributions to life-history traits, nutrient provisioning, and resilience in wild populations. Coupling stable isotope probing with multi-omics in field experiments that compare dichotomous physiological and/or ecological states can be a powerful approach for providing insight into microbiome functional effects on hosts in fitness-relevant contexts.

AB  - This study aimed to build a clean agricultural production system in small watersheds through rice-duck farming system, farmland ecological ditch, two-stage aerobic composting of typical organic waste and returning the compost product to the field. The results showed that the final product of two-stage aerobic composting, with sludge, pig manure and rice straw as raw materials, has better maturity and humification (C/N: 15.2; GI: 112%; Humification: 4.78; Humic fractions: 22.1% of OC). After composting, the physical and chemical properties of the composted products were improved, the microcystin further degraded, and the spatial structure further optimized. The quality of final compost products from different batches of continuous operation within six months totally meets the requirement of organic fertilizer standard, and most nutritional elements in algae sludge, pig manure and rice straw were retained. Mechanism analysis shows that the reduction of the TOC and C/ N ratio and the increase of the pH, EC, and TN were all conducive to the maturity and humification of the final compost. In addition, the application of nitrogen fertilizers and herbicides in the rice planting process under the rice-duck farming system has been reduced by 10% and 50%, respectively. Furthermore, the rice-duck farming system increased the economic income of rice per hectare by $1523.9. The agricultural cleaner production through rice-duck farming system and two stage aerobic composting of typical organic waste can achieve pollution load reduction and waste resource utilization, which has both economic and environmental benefits.

AB  - A heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying (HN-AD) strain ZQ-A1 with excellent denitrification performance, identified as Acinetobacter, was isolated from simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) craft. ZQ-A1 was capable of removing NH4+, NO2-, and NO3-; the 21-hour removal rates were 84.84%, 87.13%, and 92.63%. ZQ-A1 has the ability to treat mixed nitrogen sources. In addition, ZQ-A1 can be well applied to actual sewage. According to the analysis of microbial community characteristics, the relative abundance of Acinetobacter in the experimental group increased from 0.06% to 2.38%, which is an important reason for the removal rate of NH4+ exceeding 99% within 30 days. The results of KEGG function prediction showed that with the addition of ZQ-A1, the relative abundance of pathways related to bacterial metabolism, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism, was higher. The research expanded the thinking of HN-AD bacteria in actual production and laid a foundation for its application in sewage treatment.

AB  - Sheep in extreme environments rely on tail fat for survival, but the importance of this trait is often overlooked, leading to the decline of fat-tailed breeds. This study discovered a novel molecule named lncRSFD1, a type of non-coding RNA, which is highly active in sheep fat tissues. It helps control fat deposition by slowing the growth of early fat cells and encouraging their maturation. lncRSFD1 interacts with neighboring genes and important miRNAs that influence fat and muscle processes. Additionally, specific variations in the genetic region controlling lncRSFD1 are linked to growth traits like body height in certain sheep breeds. These findings shed light on how genetic factors regulate fat storage and growth in sheep, offering valuable tools for improving sheep breeds through selective breeding. This could enhance fat deposition and adaptability, particularly for sheep in challenging environments, supporting both their survival and agricultural productivity.
   Tail fat is essential for sheep survival in extreme environments, yet its significance is often overlooked, leading to the decline of fat-tailed breeds. This study identified a novel lncRNA, lncRSFD1 (TCONS_00054953), through transcriptome sequencing, showing differential expression in the tail adipose tissues of Lanzhou Fat-Tailed (LFT) sheep and Tibetan (TS) sheep. Highly expressed in adipose tissues, lncRSFD1 inhibits preadipocyte proliferation and promotes 3T3-L1 differentiation, suggesting its role in regulating fat deposition. Located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, lncRSFD1 targets the neighboring gene PDE4DIP and may function as a molecular sponge for conserved miRNAs, including oar-miR-30a-3p, oar-miR-329b-5p, and oar-miR-431, which are known to influence fat and muscle-related physiological processes. Moreover, the core promoter of lncRSFD1 (-2607 bp to -1776 bp) harbors four SNPs (g.-2429G>A, g.-2030T>C, g.-2016C>T, g.-2015G>A) significantly associated with growth traits such as body height in Guiqian Semi-Fine Wool (GSFW) sheep. These findings suggest lncRSFD1 plays a key role in fat deposition and growth regulation, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in sheep. It provides a potential target for genetic improvement and molecular breeding to enhance fat deposition and adaptability in sheep breeds.

AB  - Simple Summary Boar sperm has proven to be extremely susceptible to cold shock and sensitive to peroxidative damage due to the high membrane content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. As a result, free radicals and oxidative stress can have a significant impact on the outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the properties of sperm motility, viability, and morphology under induced oxidative stress; compare the antioxidant capacity of dithiothreitol (DTT) and glutathione (GSH) following the cryopreservation of Large White boar semen; investigate the ability of the cryopreserved Large White boar semen to fertilize the matured gilts oocytes under the same conditions; and to compare the efficacy of DTT and GSH antioxidants in improving the oocyte fertilization by the cryopreserved Large White boar semen. In this study, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used as a source of oxidative stress (control). The treatment of boar semen with H2O2 reduced the percentage of sperm progressive motility (PM; 86.70 +/- 10.24) after 3 h of incubation period (p < 0.05). The combination of GSH + DTT treatment reduced the percentage of sperm total motility (TM; 22.45 +/- 11.14), PM (10.41 +/- 4.59) and rapid motility (RAP; 9.20 +/- 3.55) following thawing (p < 0.05). For IVF, fresh semen (11.84%) and a combination of DTT + GSH (14.10%) recorded a high percentage of zygotes with >2 pronucleus. However, the DTT treatment recorded a high percentage of zygotes with two pronuclei (19.76%). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the properties of sperm motility and morphology under induced oxidative stress, compare the antioxidant capacity of dithiothreitol (DTT) and glutathione (GSH) following the cryopreservation of Large White boar semen, investigate the ability of cryopreserved Large White boar semen to fertilize the matured gilts oocytes and compare the efficacy of DTT and GSH antioxidants in improving the oocyte fertilization by cryopreserved Large White boar semen. The semen was collected from three Large White boars (ten ejaculates per boar) and transported (37 degrees C) to the laboratory. Semen freezing extenders were supplemented with 5 mM DTT, 5 mM GSH and a combination of 2.5 mM DTT + 2.5 mM GSH. A liquid nitrogen vapor method was used to freeze boar semen. Gilts' ovaries were collected from the local abattoir and transported (37 degrees C) to the laboratory. The slicing method was used to retrieve the oocytes from the ovaries. Fresh semen and frozen-thawed semen were used for in vitro fertilization (IVF). For frozen-thawed semen, four treatments (control, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM GSH, and a combination of 2.5 mM DTT + 2.5 mM GSH) were used during IVF in order to evaluate the fertilizing ability of the antioxidants. The supplementation of 5 mu M DTT to H2O2-treated semen significantly improved progressive motility (PM) by 14.82%. A combination of 2.5 mM DTT + 2.5 mM GSH treatment reduced percentage of sperm total motility (TM) and rapid motility (RAP) following thawing (p < 0.05). Fresh semen and a combination of 2.5 mM DTT + 2.5 mM GSH treatment recorded a higher percentage of zygotes with polyspermy (p < 0.05). The control treatment numerically recorded a high percentage of zygotes with 1 PN, while the 5 mM DTT treatment recorded a high percentage of zygotes with 2 PN.

AB  - Recent collections from Cameroon have revealed the occurrence of a new species of Porphyronota Burmeister, 1842 from Adamaoua and the Centre regions, P. antoinei sp. nov. This is described herein, along with a review of the known species of the country. The rehabilitation of the specific status of P. maculipennis Moser, 1916 is confirmed, as this species is clearly separated from P. hebraea (Olivier, 1789) by a number of diagnostic characters already highlighted by other authors and is also known mainly from Cameroon thus far. The occurrence of P. cinnamomea (Afzelius, 1817) in northern Cameroon is reported for the first time, and it is proposed that P. cinnamomea angolensis Holm, 1990 be upgraded to species level, P. angolensis stat. nov., as it is sufficiently different from the nominal form in the shape of its parameral apex and other key characters. The bioecology of the genus Porphyronota is discussed in the context of the prevailing habitat characteristics, the feeding and breeding patterns of the various taxa currently included in it. One group of species, previously constituting the obsolete genus Poecilophila Kolbe, 1893, lives in forest and open savanna habitats and its members breed within the soil or in rotten wood and feed on fruits, sap or flowers at the adult stage. A second group, probably composed of most if not all the other known species, lives in mountainous grassland habitats, undergoes period of dormancy underground and appears to depend on specific herbivore dung for larval growth.

AB  - Background: Uncovering the genetic architecture of economic traits in pigs is important for agricultural breeding. However, high-density haplotype reference panels are unavailable in most agricultural species, limiting accurate genotype imputation in large populations. Moreover, the infinitesimal model of quantitative traits implies that weak association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome, further complicating the genetic analysis. Hence, there is a need to develop new methods for sequencing large cohorts without large reference panels. Results: We describe a Tn5-based highly accurate, cost- and time-efficient, low-coverage sequencing method to obtain 11.3 million whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 2,869 Duroc boars at a mean depth of 0.73 x . On the basis of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms, a genome-wide association study was performed, resulting in 14 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 7 of 21 important agricultural traits in pigs. These QTLs harbour genes, such as ABCD4 for total teat number and HMGA1 for back fat thickness, and provided a starting point for further investigation. The inheritance models of the different traits varied greatly. Most follow the minor-polygene model, but this can be attributed to different reasons, such as the shaping of genetic architecture by artificial selection for this population and sufficiently interconnected minor gene regulatory networks. Conclusions: Genome-wide association study results for 21 important agricultural traits identified 14 QTLs/genes and showed their genetic architectures, providing guidance for genetic improvement harnessing genomic features. The Tn5-based low-coverage sequencing method can be applied to large-scale genome studies for any species without a good reference panel and can be used for agricultural breeding.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) contamination in soil is a serious problem in China, especially around mining area. Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) is one of the four major woody oil plants in the world and has become an important ecological and economic resource. Different P fertilization levels on the morphological and physiological characteristics of C. oleifera in two soils with different degrees of Mn contamination were evaluated. C. oleifera saplings were planted individually in plastic pots that were filled with 5.0 kg of the two types of Mn-contaminated soil. P fertilizer was applied at the rates of 0 (control), 100, 200 and 400 mg P kg(-1) at the beginning of the pot experiment. Ninety days after transplantation, C. oleifera were harvested, and soils (on root surface within 1-2 mm) were collected to analyse. Compared to the control, P fertilization significantly increased the content of photosynthetic pigments (p < 0.05) and affected the growth of C. oleifera in both soils. In the soils from mining area (high contamination level), low level of P fertilizer (100 mg kg(-1)) significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme content in plant (p < 0.05) and had appropriate nonenzymatic antioxidant activities. In recovery area soil, high level of P fertilizer (400 mg kg(-1)) could significantly increase the antioxidant enzyme content in plant (p < 0.05), which reduced the toxicity of high Mn concentration to plant. The recommended P fertilization levels for maintaining the biomass of plant while increasing Mn accumulation in mining area and recovery area soils were 100 and 400 mg kg(-1), respectively. At these levels, the efficiency of Mn phytoremediation by C. oleifera can be further enhanced.

AB  - A large variation in feeding patterns between pigs and over time hampers the use of data from electronic feeding stations in the continuous monitoring of growing-finishing pig welfare. Individual feeding strategies (i.e. differences between pigs that are consistent within a pig across time) likely explain part of this variation, both at the daily level - based on feeding components intake, frequency and rate - and at the diurnal level - based on feeding components circadian rhythms and night feeding. It is, however, not known exactly which feeding strategies pigs display, nor which types of pigs display which strategies. This study aimed 1) to test which (combinations of) feeding components contribute to independent feeding strategies; and 2) to see whether pigs with different feeding strategies also differ in other physical and behavioural characteristics. To identify feeding strategies, we calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for each day-level feeding component, which reflects the proportion of variation explained by an individual pig effect (n=98 pigs). Subsequently, high ICC day-level components were correlated to diurnal-level components known to contain feeding strategies, to assess possible overlap. Pigs with different strategies were then characterised based on physical (n=52) and behavioural (home pen and play tests, n=22-27) variables at different ages, using (generalised) linear mixed models. Four dimensions of individual feeding strategies emerged: nibbling/meal eating, fast/slow eating, day/day-night eating and consistent/inconsistent eating from day to day, sustaining after correction for pig sex or body weight. All dimensions except day/day-night eating partially overlapped at the beginning of the growing-finishing phase, but became more distinct over time. Pigs with different feeding strategies also differed in their general activity, diurnal activity and possibly dominance rank. Feeding strategies did not relate to behaviours possibly indicative of more positive or negative emotional states of pigs. Our results demonstrate that pigs showed individual differences in their feeding behaviour that are consistent across time, along continua in four distinct dimensions. These differences went beyond differences in body weight and sex, and were related to other behavioural characteristics of pigs. The presence of feeding strategies suggests that the use of pig feeding behaviour data should be corrected for individual differences between pigs.

AB  - Probiotics can improve animal growth performance and intestinal health. However, understanding the effects of paraprobiotics on the growth performance and gut microbiota of piglets and how the paraprobiotics exert their impact are still limited. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 supplementation on the growth performance, intestinal microbiota, and fecal metabolites of piglets. First, a feed-additive sample of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 was prepared by culture. Second, 96 (initial BW = 14.38 +/- 0.67 kg, weaning age of 40 days) healthy piglets were selected and randomized into four treatment groups. Each treatment group consisted of three replicates (n = 8). Pigs were fed a basal diet (NC), basal diet plus antibiotics (PC), basal diet plus Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 at 600 g/t (LA, 1.0 x 10(10) cfu/g), and basal diet plus heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 at 600 g/t (HKLA), respectively; the trial lasted for 30 days. The results showed that the ratios of feed to gain (F:G) and diarrhea rate of both the HKLA and PC groups were significantly lower compared with the NC and LA groups (p < 0.05); however, there was no significant difference between the HKLA and PC group (p > 0.05). In addition, the average daily weight gain (ADG) of the HKLA group was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the other three groups in terms of growth performance. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolome analysis based on fecal samples further elaborated that the addition of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 to the feed improved the intestinal microbial diversity and abundance (p < 0.05) and reduced the abundance of pathogenic bacteria (p < 0.05), but it did not affect the abundance of Lactobacillus (p > 0.05). Through the comparison of microbial abundance and metabolite content between the two groups (NC_vs_HKLA), the largest differences were found in six microorganisms and 10 metabolites in the intestine (p < 0.05). These differential metabolites were involved in the digestion, absorption and utilization of protein and starch, as well as in oxidative stress. In summary, addition of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 as a new feed additive in piglets has beneficial effects on the growth performance, intestinal bacteria and metabolites, and can be used as an alternative to antibiotics.

AB  - Intestinal inflammation is a common digestive system disease. Milk-derived exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and transport a variety of bioactive components, and the microRNAs (miRNAs) they carry play important roles in a variety of biological processes in the body. At present, the preventive effect and mechanism of action of goat milk exosomes and their derived miRNAs on intestinal inflammation are still unclear. In this study, the protective effect of goat milk exosomes on LPS-induced intestinal inflammation was investigated using mouse intestinal inflammation model and IEC-6 cell inflammation model. Small RNA sequencing was used to analyze the miRNA expression profile of goat milk exosomes. In this study, C-Exo and MExo alleviated intestinal inflammation by reducing the LPS-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the increase in the NLRP3 protein and the activation of the TLR4/NF kappa B kappa B signaling pathway. C-Exo has a more significant inhibitory effect on them, and better therapeutic efficacy than M-Exo. Notably, the target genes of miRNAs in C-Exo and M-Exo were significantly enriched in immune-related pathways. Furthermore, their derived miR-26a-5p and miR-30a-5p were found to ameliorate the IEC-6 inflammatory response. These findings suggest that miRNAs in goat milk exosomes have the potential to attenuate LPS-induced intestinal inflammation.

AB  - Camelina is a drought-resistant medicinal oil plant. There is a need for a deeper understanding of its nutrition in arid and semi-arid regions. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the effect of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) on Camelina's yield and physiological traits in water deficit. Different Fe (FeSO4) and Zn (ZnSO4) concentrations (water spray as control, 4 and 8 g l(-1)) were applied by the foliar method at the beginning of leaf development and flowering stages in two environments: well-watered as control (WW) and water deficit or stop irrigation from flowering till maturity (WD) in crop years 2018 and 2019 in Kermanshah, west of Iran. The average Camelina seed, oil, and protein yields in WW were 1100, 394, and 176 kg ha(-1), respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding traits in WD were 869, 267, and 170 kg ha(-1). The foliar treatment increased them by 17, 25, and 47% in WW and 15, 22, and 32% in WD. Foliar treatments caused a significant increase (p < 0.05) in proline, phenolics, and soluble carbohydrates concentration, as well as the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the leaf and unsaturated fatty acids of oil. Under WD, the highest oil percentage (34.3%) and yield (352 kg ha(-1)) was obtained by applying Fe at 4 g l(-1). Erucic acid in oil was below 5%, and WD reduced it. The evidence from this study suggests that Fe and Zn foliar treatment mitigates the adverse effects of WD on seed and protein yield, oil yield quantity and quality, and antioxidant capacity in Camelina.

AB  - Optimal litter size on goat farms is an important trait for production and economic efficiency. The ovary and uterus, key components of the reproductive system, play essential roles in reproductive performance. In recent years, numerous genes linked to goat reproductive performance have been identified. However, reliable marker genes that are specifically associated with litter size require further exploration. In this study, eight Jining Grey goats were divided into high-yield (n = 4) and low-yield (n = 4) groups on the basis of their kidding records to identify key regulatory genes associated with litter size. Ovarian and uterine tissues were collected during oestrus for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). After two outlier uterine tissue samples were excluded, the remaining 14 samples were subjected to WGCNA and differential expression gene (DEG) analysis. A total of 1224 DEGs were identified (|log2(fold change) >= 1|, p <= 0.05), including 912 in ovarian tissues (monozygotic vs. polyzygotic, MO vs. PO) and 312 in uterine tissues (MU vs. PU). Through WGCNA, we identified 15 coexpression modules, among which four key modules were significantly correlated with litter size. Our analysis focused on the magenta and green modules, as they contained 11 and 3 candidate genes overlapping with the DEGs, respectively. Notably, three genes-FOXC1, FOSB, and FGL2-were found to play important roles in both ovarian and uterine tissues. These genes mainly participate in regulatory processes such as RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity, calcium ion binding, and extracellular space organization, highlighting their potential as key candidates for future research. Overall, we identified several gene modules associated with litter size in goats, providing potential molecular markers for investigating litter size traits in Jining Grey goats.

AB  - Pasteurella multocida (Pm) infection causes severe respiratory disease in goats. We investigated the effects of the Pm infection intratracheally on the histopathology, miRNA and mRNA expression dynamics in the lung of goats infected for 1, 2, 5 and 7 days. Pm infection caused fever, which significantly (p < 0.05) increased the body temperature of the goats from day 1 to 5. Haemotoxylin-eosin staining of the infected lung tissue showed characteristics of suppurative pneumonia with inflammatory cells infiltration and the lung structure destruction. During the Pm infection of the goats, compared with the control group, there were 3080, 3508, 2716 and 2675 differentially expressed genes and 42, 69, 91 and 108 significantly expressed miRNAs (vertical bar log(2)Fold Change vertical bar > 1, p < 0.05) in the Pm_d1, Pm_d2, Pm_d5 and Pm_d7 groups, respectively. Five miRNAs and nine immune-related genes were selected for confirmation by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that the expression patterns of the miRNAs and genes were consistent with those determined by next-generation sequencing. The differentially expressed genes were enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cell adhesion molecules, complement and coagulation cascades, tight junction and phagosome Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and cytokine production, leukocyte migration, myeloid leukocyte migration, cell periphery, plasma membrane, extracellular region part, extracellular region and other Gene Ontology terms. The differentially expressed genes were mapped to marker genes in human and mouse lung cells. The results showed the presence of some marker genes of the immune cells. Compared with the CK group, five miRNAs and 892 common genes were differentially expressed in the Pm_d1, Pm_d2, Pm_d5 and Pm_d7 groups. The target relationships between the common 5 miRNAs and 892 differentially expressed genes were explored and the miRNAs involved in the host immune reaction may act through the target genes. Our study characterized goats' reaction in the lung from histopathological and molecular changes upon Pm infection, which will provide valuable information for understanding the responses in goats during Pm infection.

AB  - Introduction In the United States, more than 11.5 million people participate in hunting. Deer hunters commonly use tree stands as tall as 8 m. Falls from tree stands can cause injury and even death. Previous studies have investigated the types of injuries sustained from tree stand falls, but few have investigated patient outcomes. This study investigated patient outcomes related to tree stand falls and analyzed injury types resulting from tree stand falls, and this paper discusses factors that may lead to tree stand falls.Methods This study used a retrospective chart review of patients at the same institution between January 1, 2012, and August 31, 2022. Patient information, injury type, fall height, and interventions were collected.Results A total of 38 patients were included in the study, 36 males (94.70%) and 2 females (5.30%). The average fall height from a tree stand was 4.22 +/- 1.62 m (13.86 +/- 5.30 ft). Of the 38 patients, 19 had sustained orthopedic injuries to their upper extremity, lower extremity, spine/pelvis, or multiple areas; the average fall height of this subgroup was 4.51 +/- 1.76 m (14.79 +/- 5.76 ft). Nonoperative management was the highest used intervention because 12 patients did not require surgery. Orthopedic surgery was used to treat 6 patients, and 1 patient had nonorthopedic surgery.Conclusions Although tree stand falls are rare, the injuries they cause can be fatal. Injury severity and outcome are determined by a multitude of factors. This study highlights the significance of these injuries and the importance of practicing safe guidelines while hunting.

AB  - Simple Summary This study developed a new method for automatically tracking and analyzing pig behavior in complex environments. We use the YOLOv8 algorithm for real-time detection and behavior classification, and employ the OC-SORT algorithm to address tracking issues caused by lighting changes, occlusions, and collisions between pigs. This method enables the automatic analysis of behavior, helping farm managers promptly detect abnormalities and health issues in pigs. Experimental results show that the method performs excellently in behavior recognition and tracking, accurately recording pig behavior to provide technical support for monitoring the health and welfare of pig herds.Abstract Smart farming technologies to track and analyze pig behaviors in natural environments are critical for monitoring the health status and welfare of pigs. This study aimed to develop a robust multi-object tracking (MOT) approach named YOLOv8 + OC-SORT(V8-Sort) for the automatic monitoring of the different behaviors of group-housed pigs. We addressed common challenges such as variable lighting, occlusion, and clustering between pigs, which often lead to significant errors in long-term behavioral monitoring. Our approach offers a reliable solution for real-time behavior tracking, contributing to improved health and welfare management in smart farming systems. First, the YOLOv8 is employed for the real-time detection and behavior classification of pigs under variable light and occlusion scenes. Second, the OC-SORT is utilized to track each pig to reduce the impact of pigs clustering together and occlusion on tracking. And, when a target is lost during tracking, the OC-SORT can recover the lost trajectory and re-track the target. Finally, to implement the automatic long-time monitoring of behaviors for each pig, we created an automatic behavior analysis algorithm that integrates the behavioral information from detection and the tracking results from OC-SORT. On the one-minute video datasets for pig tracking, the proposed MOT method outperforms JDE, Trackformer, and TransTrack, achieving the highest HOTA, MOTA, and IDF1 scores of 82.0%, 96.3%, and 96.8%, respectively. And, it achieved scores of 69.0% for HOTA, 99.7% for MOTA, and 75.1% for IDF1 on sixty-minute video datasets. In terms of pig behavior analysis, the proposed automatic behavior analysis algorithm can record the duration of four types of behaviors for each pig in each pen based on behavior classification and ID information to represent the pigs' health status and welfare. These results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits excellent performance in behavior recognition and tracking, providing technical support for prompt anomaly detection and health status monitoring for pig farming managers.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is long-term inflammation of the sinuses that can be caused by infection due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Biofilm developed by microbes is postulated to cause antibiotic treatment failure. Thus, the anti-biofilm activities of seven Thai herbal essential oils (EOs) against antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from CRS patients was investigated. Lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus L.) EO showed the most effective antibiofilm activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis grown as biofilm. GC-MS analysis found that myrcene was the major bioactive compound. Pretreatment with lemongrass EO significantly inhibited biofilm formation of all bacterial strains in more than 50% of cases. Furthermore, confocal microscopy analysis revealed the biofilm-disrupting activity of lemongrass EO against the biofilm matrix of all these bacterial species and also increased P. aeruginosa swarming motility with no toxicity to human cells. These results suggest that lemongrass EO has promising clinical applications as an anti-biofilm agent for CRS patients.

AB  - Simple Summary The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the growing demand for poultry products have led to an interest in finding alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) used in poultry farming. Probiotics, which have been shown to have positive effects on performance and health in chickens, are among the most recognised alternatives to AGPs. However, the use of probiotics in commercial farming has not been fully optimised. One of the major challenges arises from the competition of probiotics with other gut microbiota for adhesion and nutrients. This study investigated the use of a phage cocktail in combination with probiotics as a potential alternative to AGPs in poultry farming. The results showed that the combination of phage and probiotics improved growth performance in chickens and had a positive impact on the diversity and composition of gut microbiota. This study suggests that using a phage cocktail in combination with probiotics could be a promising alternative to AGPs for poultry production. Phages, which are often used therapeutically, have begun to receive interest as alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) for enhancing chicken growth. Another option that has been extensively studied as a growth promoter in chickens is probiotics. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study available on the use of phages and probiotics in combination as potential feed additives for broiler chickens. Therefore, this study demonstrated the effects of a phage cocktail, probiotics, and their combination on the growth performance and gut microbiota of broiler chickens. A total of 288 one-day-old male Cobb 500 broilers were randomly allotted to one of six treatments in a completely randomised design. The treatments were (i) C (basal diet (BD) only), (ii) 1 phi (BD + 0.1% phage cocktail), (iii) 2 phi (BD + 0.2% phage cocktail), (iv) P (BD + 0.1% probiotic), (v) 1 phi P (BD + 0.1% phage cocktail + 0.1% probiotic), and (vi) 2 phi P (BD + 0.2% phage cocktail + 0.1% probiotic). The 1 phi P treatment had significantly (p < 0.05) better BW (35 days), BWG (22-35 days, 1-35 days), and FCR (1-21 days, 22-35 days, 1-35 days) compared to C. Unique gut microbiota diversity was also found between the phi P (1 phi P and 2 phi P) and non-phi P groups (C, 1 phi, 2 phi, and P) in ilea, particularly in the 35-day-old chickens. Microorganisms associated with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers were significantly (p < 0.05) more present in the phi P group than in the non-phi P group. The predicted genes related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were significantly upregulated in phi P groups compared to non-phi P groups. These genes were involved in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, as well as the production of energy. Our findings showed that the 1 phi P treatment could be a potential alternative to AGPs for poultry, as growth performance was enhanced, and gut microbiota was positively modulated.

AB  - alpha-keratins are structural proteins in the cortex of wool fibres and assemble in an organized fashion into keratin intermediate filaments. Variation in these keratin proteins affects the structure and characteristics of wool fibre, making keratin genes ideal candidates for the development of gene markers that describe variations in wool traits. A region of KRT85 spanning exon 3-4 (including the entire exon 3, intron 3, exon 4 and part of intron 4) was investigated. Two banding patterns defining two variant sequences (A and B) were observed in this region, and these were characterised by the presence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms. The effect of this variation in the exon 3-4 region of KRT85 on wool traits was investigated in 463 Merino x Southdown-cross lambs. The frequencies of these two variants in these sheep were 55.6% and 44.4%, respectively. Three different genotypes were observed with frequencies of 32.6%, 46.1% and 21.3% for AA, AB and BB, respectively. The presence of A was associated with an increase in greasy fleece weight and clean fleece weight, while the presence of B was associated with an increased wool prickle factor. These findings should be replicated in a broader range of sheep breeds to determine whether the associations are robust and to clarify whether the observed effects are attributable to breed differences or to gene effects themselves.

AB  - Bottom-up effects are major ecological forces driving crop-arthropod pest interactions in agroecosystems. Light is an important resource for plants, alters plant growth traits and trade-off their defensive ability through the bottom-up effects. In this study, we measured the effects of red (R), blue (B), red-blue (RB) and white (W, control) light on the growth traits of tomato plants and their defensive ability against whitefly Bemisia tabaci and western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis. Compared to the control, red, blue and red-blue light significantly affected the growth and defensive ability of tomato plants but to differing effects. Red light promoted plant height and stem diameter of tomato plants, inhibited photosynthetic traits and leaf thickness, which significantly decreased the fecundity of B. tabaci and F. occidentalis, and reduced the feeding and oviposition preference of B. tabaci. Blue light decreased the growth of tomato plants but increased photosynthetic parameters and leaf thickness and inhibited the fecundity of B. tabaci. Red-blue light was closest to the white control, slightly reducing growth of tomato plants but increasing leaf thickness and significantly decreasing the feeding and oviposition preference of F. occidentalis. These results indicated that red, blue and red-blue light had certain inhibitory effects on the performance of B. tabaci and F. occidentalis, and blue light also suppressed the growth and biomass accumulation of tomato plants. In conclusion, red and red-blue light reduced the performance of herbivores and optimally improve plant yield and quality in greenhouses.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the protective effects of bioactive compounds from the fruit of the mulberry tree (Morus alba L.) against cisplatin-induced apoptosis in LLC-PK1 pig kidney epithelial cells. Morus alba fruit is a well-known edible fruit commonly used in traditional folk medicine. Chemical investigation of M. alba fruit resulted in the isolation and identification of six phytosterols (1-6). Their structures were determined as 7-ketositosterol (1), stigmast-4-en-3 beta-ol-6-one (2), (3 beta,6 alpha)-stigmast-4-ene-3,6-diol (3), stigmast-4-ene-3 beta,6 beta-diol (4), 7 beta-hydroxysitosterol 3-O-beta-d-glucoside (5), and 7 alpha-hydroxysitosterol 3-O-beta-d-glucoside (6) by analyzing their physical and spectroscopic data as well as liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry data. All compounds displayed protective effects against cisplatin-induced LLC-PK1 cell damage, improving cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity to more than 80% of the control value. Compound 1 displayed the best effect at a relatively low concentration by inhibiting the percentage of apoptotic cells following cisplatin treatment. Its molecular mechanisms were identified using Western blot assays. Treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with compound 1 decreased the upregulated phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) following cisplatin treatment. In addition, compound 1 significantly suppressed cleaved caspase-3 in cisplatin-induced LLC-PK1 cells. Taken together, these findings indicated that cisplatin-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by compound 1 in LLC-PK1 cells, thereby supporting the potential of 7-ketositosterol (1) as an adjuvant candidate for treating cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.

AB  - In this paper, we present old and new data about our integrated interdisciplinary stratigraphic study of sedimentary deposits preserved in the Grotta dei Baffoni Cave of the Frasassi hypogenic cave complex, including sedimentological, paleontological, archaeometric, and radiometric analyses. This research work allowed us to reconstruct the geologic, environmental, and human history of this part of the northeastern Apennines of Italy for the past 200,000 years, from the late Middle Pleistocene to the Present. Accumulation of alluvial sediment began in this cave similar to 200,000 years ago, when an entrance was breached by the Sentino River during its process of incision and deepening of the Frasassi Gorge coupled with regional tectonic uplift. Flooding of the cave went on until the entrance sill of the cave was lifted up to an elevation that could no longer be reached by the river, sometime in the mid-Late Pleistocene. After this, windblown dust (i.e., loess) and coarser carbonate clasts derived from the disintegration of the vaults due to cryogenic processes and/or seismically induced collapses of the limestone vaults, accumulated on this now-dry underground environment. The stratigraphy of an similar to 4-m-thick sedimentary deposit accumulated in the vast atrium room of the cave was measured, sampled, and documented in two excavation trenches in 1952 by archaeologist Anton Mario Radmilli. By collecting a dozen stratigraphically located osteological finds for C-14 dating, and revisiting artifacts collected by Radmilli, which are archived respectively in the Museum of Natural History of Verona and in the National Museum of Archaeology of Ancona, we assessed that the cave was frequented by wild animals, such as cave bear and ibex, starting in the mid-Late Pleistocene. Dating of charcoal particles from subsurface sediments in the inner part of the cave suggested that fires were lit in this cave by Epigravettian visitors during the Younger Dryas cold period. Scarce archaeological evidence nevertheless suggests that man began using this underground environment for worship practices probably in the early Neolithic. Human bones in the lower part of one of Radmilli's excavations yielded early Eneolithic ages. No other human bones were found in overlying levels of this excavation, but the typology of animal bones and associated ceramic artifacts, corroborated by our C-14 dates, suggest that this cave was utilized as a worship or ritual place until the early Middle Bronze Age. After that, the cave was sporadically used as a shelter for herders until recent times.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Dietary protein is an important source of amino acids for livestock, while excess protein consumption and an imbalance of amino acids in the diet result in increased feed costs and an increased risk of diarrhea, caused by the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, we investigated whether a diet with a moderate reduction of crude protein levels, supplemented with crystalline amino acids, could alleviate these problems. The results showed that a moderate reduction in the dietary protein level can provide similar growth performance and improve metabolism, due to the improvement of intestinal microbiota, compared with high protein feed in Sushan nursery pigs. These findings present new insights into the role of microorganisms in metabolism, and point to a potential nutrition strategy for indigenous pig production.
   In this paper, we investigated the effects of a diet with a moderate reduction of dietary crude protein (CP) level, supplemented with five crystalline amino acids (Lys, Met, Thr, Try, and Val), on the growth, metabolism, and fecal microbiota of Sushan nursery pigs. Seventy Sushan nursery pigs with an average body weight of 19.56 +/- 0.24 kg were randomly allocated to two experimental dietary treatments: 18% CP (high protein; group HP), and 15% CP (low protein; group LP). We found that the differences in the two diets had no significant effect on the growth performance of Sushan nursery pigs. Nursery pigs on the 15% CP diet showed significantly improved protein, amino acid, and energy utilization. Furthermore, the LP diet cloud optimized the gut microflora composition to some extent. The functional structure of bacterial communities implied improved metabolic capabilities in group LP. Additionally, correlation analysis between fecal microbiota and metabolic profiles confirmed that the increase of beneficial bacterial in the feces was beneficial to the health and metabolism of the nursery pigs. In conclusion, a moderate reduction in the dietary protein level can improve growth and metabolism due to the improvement of intestinal microbiota in Sushan nursery pigs. This finding could provide useful reference data for the application of a different nutrition strategy in indigenous pig production.

AB  - Cryopreservation of boar semen is essential for maintaining genetic diversity and improving reproductive efficiency. However, optimizing semen extenders and packaging methods is crucial to enhancing sperm quality and cryotolerance. Equex-STM is commonly used as a surfactant to enhance cryoprotective properties by stabilizing sperm membranes during freezing and thawing. A total of 24 ejaculates (n = 24), six from each of four Hampshire crossbred boars, aged between 18 and 24 months were used in the present study. Semen was collected twice weekly by gloved hand technique. The sperm-rich fraction showing more than 70% initial motility was considered for further processing and freezing. The fresh semen was diluted in Beltsville thawing solution (BTS) at a 1:1 ratio and further processed with the addition of Fraction I and Fraction II extenders supplemented with and without 1.5% Equex-STM paste {Control (C)-no Equex; Treatment (T-1.5% Equex-STM supplementation}. The extended semen was packaged in 0.25 and 0.5 mL straws to check the effect of straw size (T-1-0.25 mL straw and T-2-0.50 mL straw). Straws were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen (LN2) for post-thaw sperm quality evaluation. Results showed that the sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity (PMI), DNA integrity, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in the T group in comparison with control (C). Sperm motility, PMI, and DNA integrity were highly significant (p < 0.001) and sperm viability and MMP were significant (p < 0.05) in group T-2 in comparison with T-1.

AB  - Drought is an increasingly important consequence of climate change. Drought often causes plants to alter patterns of resource allocation, which in turn can affect how plants interact with other species. How these altered interactions subsequently influence plant reproductive success remains incompletely understood and may depend on the degree of specialization exhibited by antagonists and mutualists. Specialist pollinators, for example, are dependent on floral resources from their obligate hosts and under drought conditions may thus indiscriminately visit these hosts (at least in certain circumstances). Generalist pollinators, in contrast, may only forage on host plants in good condition, given that they can forage on other plant species. We tested this hypothesis and its consequences for plant reproduction in squash (Cucurbita pepo) grown along an experimental moisture gradient ranging from dry (growth and flowering compromised) to wet conditions. Floral visitation increased with plant soil moisture for generalist honey bees but was independent of plant soil moisture for specialist squash bees. Pollen production increased with plant soil moisture, and fluorescent pigments placed on flowers revealed that pollinators primarily moved pollen from male flowers on well-watered plants to the stigmas of female flowers on well-watered plants. Seed set increased with increasing plant soil moisture but, notably, was higher in bee-pollinated plants compared to plants pollinated by hand with an even mix of pollen from plants grown at either end of the experimental moisture gradient. These results suggest that superior pollen rewards, perhaps combined with selective foraging by generalists, enhanced reproductive success in C. pepo when plant soil moisture was high and more generally illustrate that pollinator behavior may contribute to how drought conditions affect plant reproduction.

AB  - The numbers of large wild herbivores are rising in the Czech Republic, leading to increased grazing pressure on agricultural crops, including the sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), which is highly sensitive to grazing. In this study, we aim to estimate the amount of damage to sunflower crops in the Czech Republic, experimentally evaluate the effects of grazing on sunflower development and yield and their response to given types of damage, and propose a procedure for quantifying damage caused to sunflower crops. Our results indicate that most sunflowers damaged below the cotyledon at any stage of growth died or failed to yield achenes, while those damaged above the cotyledon were better able to regenerate and produce some form of harvest. In most cases, plants damaged at 11 cm height (growth stage BBCH 10-12) were able to increase growth intensity, replace damaged tissue and make up for any loss. In later growth stages, this ability progressively decreased. Plants damaged at 15 cm (BBCH 14-16), for example, produced just 14% of achievable production. On the other hand, we observed a 10% yield increase in undamaged plants when competitive neighbours were removed. Overall, we estimate total damage to sunflower achene production caused by herbivores in the Czech Republic at 16%.

AB  - Identifying and understanding limiting conditions is at the centre of ecology and biogeography. Traditionally, associations between climate and occurrences of organisms are inferred from observational data using regression analysis, correlation analysis or clustering. Those methods extract patterns and relationships that hold throughout a dataset. We present a computational methodology called redescription mining, that emphasizes local patterns and associations that hold strongly on subsets of the dataset, instead. We aim to showcase the potential of this methodology for ecological and biogeographical studies, and encourage researchers to try it. Redescription mining can be used to identify associations between different descriptive views of the same system. It produces an ensemble of local models, that provide different perspectives over the system. Each model (redescription) consists of two sets of limiting conditions, over two different views, that hold locally. Limiting conditions, as well as the corresponding subregions, are identified automatically using data analysis algorithms.
   We explain how this methodology applies to a biogeographic case study focused on China and southern Asia. We consider dental traits of the large herbivorous mammals that occur there and climatic conditions as two aspects of this ecological system, and look for associations between them.
   Redescription mining can offer more refined inferences on the potential relation between variables describing different aspects of a system than classical methods. Thus, it permits different questions to be posed of the data, and can usefully complement classical methods in ecology and biogeography to uncover novel biogeographic patterns.
   A python package for carrying out redescription mining analysis is publicly available.

AB  - During a scientific expedition in the Taiwan Bank in the southern Taiwan Strait in 2021, five pygmy seahorses, measuring between 18.1 mm and 28.3 mm in standard length, were inadvertently collected along with Muricella sea fans. Morphometric measurements of these pygmy seahorse specimens coincided with the previous data on H. bargibanti, but they had a proportionally greater head depth and snout length. Genetically, DNA marker analysis of partial mitochondrial COI sequences confirmed that our specimens belonged to the same lineage as H. bargibanti, with a p-distance of 0.54% among populations. This discovery enhances our knowledge of the limited biodiversity in the Taiwan Bank, which includes a complex geomorphology of both reef banks and sandy substrates, and highlights the importance of strict laws prohibiting fishing with inadequate gear, invasive or illegal fishing, and sand dredging to protect unexplored coral reef biodiversity in the area.

AB  - Simple Summary TBXT (c.333G > C; c.334G > T) has been identified as a molecular genetic marker in short-tailed sheep. This paper describes a high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis using unlabeled probes and asymmetric PCR for the detection of genetic variants of TBXT in short-tailed sheep populations. The detection results of this method are consistent with those of Sanger sequencing and can help farmers with marker-assisted breeding. The short-tailed phenotype has long been considered one of the best traits for population genetic improvement in sheep breeding. In short-tailed sheep, not only is tail fat eliminated but also the pubic area is exposed due to the lack of a tail covering, giving them an advantage in reproduction. Recent studies have shown that two linked mutations in sheep TBXT at nucleotides 333 and 334 are associated with the short-tailed phenotype. In the population of short-tailed sheep, several heterozygous mutants of this gene are found. In our research, we used high-resolution melting (HRM) to identify homozygous and heterozygous genotypes in a flock of short-tailed sheep and compared the results with those of Sanger sequencing, which were identical. This demonstrates that our established HRM method, a rapid and inexpensive genotyping method, can be used to identify homozygous and heterozygous individuals in short-tailed sheep flocks.

AB  - The pig-breeding industry is one of the pillar industries of China's agriculture. Improving the green total factor productivity of pig breeding is the basis for ensuring the stable supply of pork, and is also the key to the green transformation of the pig industry. The existing studies about the green total factor productivity of pig breeding lack an analysis of regional coordination and the spillover of spatial technology efficiency at the macro level, and most studies focus on the impact of agricultural production's environment pollution and other undesirable outputs. Based on the input-output index system of the pig-breeding industry's green production, the DDF directional distance function model and the Malmquist-Luenberger (ML) productivity index were combined to measure the green total factor productivity of the pig-breeding industry. Moran's I-Theil index model was used to measure and reveal the technical efficiency differences among the dominant regions of the pig-breeding industry in China and the sigma-convergence test was adopted to reveal the convergence trend of green total factor productivity. The results showed that: (1) The growth level of green total factor productivity of pig breeding in China was generally low from 2006 to 2018, and there were obvious regional and scale differences. (2) The green total factor productivity of pig breeding in each province had spatial autocorrelation; that is, there was technology spillover. From 2006 to 2018, with the advance of time, a pattern of gradual evolution from low-level equilibrium to high-level imbalance was formed. (3) Through the convergence test, the convergence trend of large and medium-scale development between different regions fluctuated, while the convergence trend of small-scale development between different regions was not obvious. Therefore, it is necessary to increase investment in technological innovation, promote the large-scale and standardized development of the pig-breeding industry, and strengthen the promotion of technology in producing areas with advantages in pig breeding.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between rumen fermentation, stress-related hormones, and behavior in sheep with the aim of providing insights for improving animal welfare and feed management practices. Eight lambs were assigned to either a high concentration or control group. Blood samples were collected for hormone analysis, and an open field test was conducted to observe behavioral stress responses. The results showed that diet composition may affect the behavior of ruminants in response to stressors and novel situations, as evidenced by the higher number of escape attempts in the high-concentration group. In addition, analyses of individual volatile fatty acids (VFAs) showed a significant positive correlation between the acetic acid/propionic acid ratio and sniffing behavior of the novel object (p < 0.05, rho = -0.414). These findings have important implications for animal welfare and feed management practices. Overall, this study provides insights into the potential impact of diet composition on the behavior of ruminants in response to stressors and novel situations, highlighting the importance of improving animal welfare through feed management practices. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the complex relationship between rumen fermentation, stress-related hormones, and behavior in ruminant animals.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social communication impairments with restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs). The increase in prevalence of ASD and the heterogeneity of symptom severity may arise from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors that alter synaptic plasticity. Maternal stress during pregnancy, which is linked to depression, may be one risk factor for an ASD phenotype in offspring. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment can be effective in alleviating maternal depression but prenatal SSRI exposure itself may be a risk factor for autism in offspring. The present study investigated in C57BL/6J pregnant mice whether restraint stress (G4-18) and/or treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine (G8-18) affects autism-related behaviors and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in male and female offspring. The findings indicate that restraint stress reduces preference for sucrose reward in pregnant dams that is reversed by fluoxetine. In adult male offspring, combined prenatal stress and SSRI exposure increased self-grooming and impaired spatial reversal learning. In adult female offspring, the prenatal experiences did not affect self-grooming, but restraint stress alone or SSRI exposure alone impaired spatial reversal learning. Prenatal stress reduced anxietyrelated behavior in male and female offspring. Further, LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation of Schaffercommissural afferents in field CA1 was significantly reduced in female offspring exposed to prenatal stress alone or combination with fluoxetine. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to prenatal stress, SSRI treatment or the combination differentially affects male and female offspring in autism-like behaviors and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - More than 12,000 plant species (ca. 10% of flowering plants) exude latex when their tissues are injured. Latex is produced and stored in specialized cells named "laticifers''. Laticifers form a tubing system composed of rows of elongated cells that branch and create an internal network encompassing the entire plant. Laticifers constitute a recent evolutionary achievement in ecophysiological adaptation to specific natural environments; however, their fitness benefit to the plant still remains to be proven. The identification of Euphorbia lathyris mutants (pil mutants) deficient in laticifer cells or latex metabolism, and therefore compromised in latex production, allowed us to test the importance of laticifers in pest resistance. We provided genetic evidence indicating that laticifers represent a cellular adaptation for an essential defense strategy to fend off arthropod herbivores with different feeding habits, such as Spodoptera exigua and Tetranychus urticae. In marked contrast, we also discovered that a lack of laticifer cells causes complete resistance to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Thereafter, a latex-derived factor required for conidia germination on the leaf surface was identified. This factor promoted disease susceptibility enhancement even in the non-latex-bearing plant Arabidopsis. We speculate on the role of laticifers in the coevolutionary arms race between plants and their enemies.

Adding plant extracts to the diet is an effective way to help overcome this problem. Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS) is a natural non-toxic antioxidant with multiple biological activities. This study analyzed the potential mechanism of AOS in alleviating heat stress and improving semen quality in boars through a combination of multiple omics tools. The results indicated that AOS could significantly increase sperm motility (P < 0.001) and sperm concentration (P < 0.05). At the same time, AOS improved the antioxidant capacity of blood and semen, and increased blood testosterone (P < 0.05) level. AOS could improve the metabolites in sperm, change the composition of gut microbiota, increase the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Pseudomonas (P < 0.01), Escherichia-Shigella (P < 0.05), Bifidobacterium (P < 0.01), reduce the relative abundance of harmful bacteria such as Prevotella_9 (P < 0.05), Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 (P < 0.01), and increase the content of short chain fatty acids. Proteomic results showed that AOS increased proteins related to spermatogenesis, while decreasing heat shock protein 70 (P < 0.05) and heat shock protein 90 (P < 0.01). These results were verified using immunofluorescence staining technology. There was a good correlation among sperm quality, sperm metabolome, sperm proteome, and gut microbiota. In conclusion, AOS can be used as a feed additive to increase the semen quality of boars to enhance reproductive performance under heat stress.

AB  - Sertoli cells (SCs), the only somatic constituent of the testicular seminiferous epithelium, are vital to spermatogenesis. We previously found that vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) can reprogram the transcriptome, and promote the proliferation and reproductive function of pig immature SCs (iSCs). However, the global change of microRNAs (miRNA) expression and its effect on pig iSCs as induced by vitamin C treatment is still unknown. Here, we performed small RNA sequencing on pig iSCs after 250 mu M AA2P (L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate) treatment for 36h. Total number of detected miRNAs ranged from 326 to 335 known, and 400-570 novel miRNAs. Of the top ten highly expressed miRNAs, we found that 8 were common (miR-21e5p, let-7i-5p, miR-30a-5p, let-7f-5p, let-7g, miR-100, miR-10a-5p and miR-30d), which were predicted to target mRNAs involved in cell development and differentiation. We identified 78 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs (vertical bar log2 (Fold Change)vertical bar >= 1; Padj.<0.05), including 7 known and 71 novel miRNAs. We further selected 13 highly and stably expressed DE miRNAs (4 up-regulated: miR-184, novel-miR-610, novel-miR-316 and novel-miR-1274; 9 down-regulated: miR-222, miR-221-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-210, miR-146b, miR-146a-5p, novel-miR-182, novel-miR-1088 and novel-miR-1016), and performed integrated analysis on the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. DE mRNAs negatively targeted by these 13 DE miRNAs were enriched in multiple GO and KEGG signaling pathways (e.g. pyruvate and steroid metabolic processes, developmental process in reproduction, response to oxidative stress, Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis and HIF-1). We validated 8 DE miRNAs and their 12 DE mRNA targets, most of them showed expression patterns consistent with (mi) RNA-seq results. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that vitamin C could induce the global change of miRNAs, which possibly regulate cell proliferation, energy metabolism and male reproduction as induced by vitamin C treatment on pig iSCs.

AB  - Distance traveled and home range size describe how animals move in space. The seasonal variations of these parameters are important to comprehensively understand animal ecology and its connection with reproductive behavior and energy costs. Researchers usually estimate the distance traveled as the sum of the straight-line displacements between sampled positions, but this approach is sensitive to the sampling frequency and does not account for the tortuosity of the animal's movements. By means of the continuous-time movement modeling which takes into account autocorrelation and tortuosity of movement data, we estimated the distance traveled and monthly home range size of 28 wild boar Sus scrofa and modeled their inter-sexual seasonal variability. Males traveled longer distances and used larger home ranges than females, particularly during the rut in autumn-winter, consistently with the different biological cycles of males and females. Males enlarged their home ranges during the rut but traveled constant average distances along the year, whereas females traveled shorter distances in correspondence with the peak of food resources and birth periods but exhibited constant home range size across seasons. The differences between the seasonal variation patterns of distance traveled and home range size, observed in both sexes, revealed the complex relationship between these two aspects of spatial behavior and the great opportunity of including both distance traveled and home range size in behavioral ecology investigations. We provided a detailed analysis of wild boar spatial behavior and its relationships with the reproductive cycles of males and females, promoting a deeper comprehension of their behavioral ecology.

AB  - Simple Summary This study mainly aimed to evaluate the seasonal and breed effects on spermatozoa (SPZ) traits of ten Portuguese sheep breeds, cryopreserved and stored in the Portuguese National Germplasm Bank. The mean volume and SPZ concentration of the ejaculate was 0.77 mL and 5039 +/- 51 x 10(6)/mL, respectively, and were affected by breed but not by season. The viability (alive SPZ), individual motility, and abnormal morphology of fresh semen were 63.2 +/- 0.2%, 61.41 +/- 0.2%, and 10.1 +/- 0.1%, respectively. A significant decrease of 28.5% of the viability and 35.5% of individual motility, as well as an increase of 54.5% in the SPZ abnormal morphology was observed in thawed semen. An effect of breed, but not of season, was observed on these SPZ traits. Nonetheless, breed x season interactions influenced individual motility and abnormal morphology, except for tail defects. Overall, the effect of season on ejaculate and SPZ traits was not significant and local rams are able to be SPZ donors for cryopreservation during the whole year in our latitudes. The semen quality is one of the determinant factors of ram semen cryopreservation. The present retrospective study aimed to characterize the seasonal ram pattern during the year for ten Portuguese local sheep breeds, hypothesizing that the breed and season had low effects on the main spermatozoa traits. A total of 1471 ejaculates were used and evaluated (fresh semen) from 85 rams between 2004 and 2020 and re-evaluated after thawing (thawed semen). The effect of breed, season, and sperm cryopreservation on nine semen traits were evaluated. The volume per ejaculate, spermatozoa (SPZ) concentration, and total number of SPZ per ejaculate, were affected by breed (p < 0.001) but not by season (p > 0.05). As expected, the semen processing was the most significant (p < 0.001) factor of variation on seminal parameters. Moreover, breed and interactions between breed x semen processing, modulated the response of alive SPZ, abnormal morphology, head, and intermediate piece defects. In fresh semen, season only affected the intermediate piece defects due to the highest percentage observed between February and April period in some breeds. Overall, and despite the mentioned particularities, there were similarities among the ten local breeds. We also concluded that the seasonal effect on ejaculate and SPZ traits is not significant in our region. These local ram breeds have low seasonality and can be employed in natural mating as well as semen donors for cryopreservation and assisted reproductive biotechnologies during the whole year at our latitude.

AB  - Probiotics-induced feed fermentation can improve the composition of microbiota, leading to benefits in pig production. However, the influence of probiotics-driven feed fermentation on pollution reduction is limited. This study aimed to analyze the impact of Weissella-based-based feed fermentation on the chemical characteristics, changes in microbial abundance, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Moreover, the possible mechanism and the association among them was also analyzed. First, pigs reared on fermented feed exhibited improved growth performance. The fermentation group showed a significant reduction in emissions of total phosphorus (TP), total carbon (TC), organic matter (OM), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) levels in feces compared to the control group. The fermentation group also showed a significant decrease in the ARGs, especially for the tetX, , tetW, , tetQ, , tetL, , tetO, , tet32, , tet44, , ermG, , ermF, , CfxA2, , CfxA3, , aph3-III,- III , aadA, , and ant9-I, compared to the control group. The primary functional microbiota, characterized by increased levels of Bifidobacterium, Megasphaera, , and Mitsuokella, , and decreased levels of Methanosphaera, and Ruminiclostridium, , displayed both negative and positive correlations with ARGs, TC, TP, OM, Cu, and Zn. Furthermore, a significant association was observed between the alterations in microbiota and ARGs and the lactic acid concentration in the fermented feed. The molecular docking results showed a good fit between lactate dehydrogenase and three antibiotics, particularly tetracycline. In conclusion, these results offer novel targets and strategies to address environmental pollutants associated with pig farming.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study of blood chemical, cytokine and hormone indicators in male and female pigs offered insights into the combined effects of maternal immune activation and weaning stress. Our results indicate that maternal immune activation may grant higher tolerance to anion gap and bilirubin disruptions triggered by weaning stress. Therefore, management practices aimed at minimizing the effects of weaning should consider the interacting effect of immune activation during development. Weaning stress can elicit changes in the metabolic, hormone and immune systems of pigs and interact with prolonged disruptions stemming from maternal immune activation (MIA) during gestation. The present study advances the characterization of the combined effects of weaning stress and MIA on blood chemistry, immune and hormone indicators that inform on the health of pigs. Three-week-old female and male offspring of control gilts or gilts infected with the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus were allocated to weaned or nursed groups. The anion gap and bilirubin profiles suggest that MIA enhances tolerance to the effects of weaning stress. Interleukin 1 beta and interleukin 2 were highest among weaned MIA females, and cortisol was higher among weaned relative to nursed pigs across sexes. Canonical discriminant analysis demonstrated that weaned and nursed pigs have distinct chemistry profiles, whereas MIA and control pigs have distinct cytokine profiles. The results from this study can guide management practices that recognize the effects of the interaction between MIA and weaning stress on the performance and health of pigs.

AB  - Feed fermentation enhances feed nutrition and animal health, but its impact on the gut microbiota of young pigs remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic fermented feed, which includes Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus coagulans, on the growth performance, meat quality, and intestinal microbiota of growing pigs. We randomly assigned 24 Duroc x Landrace x Landrace pigs to two groups: a control (Ctrl) group and the fermented liquid feed (FLF) group, with three replicate pens per group and four pigs per pen. Results indicated that the FLF group experienced a significant decrease in anti-nutritional factors like alpha-conglycinin and beta-conglycinin. In addition, the average daily gain of pigs in the FLF group increased significantly, while the feed conversion ratio and shear force decreased. HE staining showed that the FLF group had notably enhanced villus height in the jejunum and ileum. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a marked increase in the relative abundance of certain microbes in the FLF group, which were predominantly associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. These results indicated that compound probiotic FLF can elevate feed quality, enhance the growth performance of growing pigs, and ameliorate the structure of the gut microbiota.

AB  - As a reactive species, the red deer is sensitive to both negative exogenous and endogenous stimuli. An intensive hunting period may have a particularly negative impact on game animals. The aim of this study was to determine the plasma cortisol level and biochemical parameters in 25 wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) harvested during stalking hunts in correlation with the sex and age of the animals. The mean cortisol concentrations in the stags and hinds analyzed in this study were similar (20.2 and 21.5 ng/mL, respectively). Higher HDL cholesterol values were found in the blood of the hinds than in stags (p < 0.05). Similarly, the mean levels of LDL cholesterol, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine aminotransferase were higher by 21%, 16%, and 42%, respectively, in the blood of the hinds. In contrast, the levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and aspartate aminotransferase were higher in the stags (by 30%, 49%, and 36%, respectively). There was a negative correlation of the cortisol concentration with urea and bilirubin and a positive correlation between cortisol and aspartate aminotransferase in the stags (p < 0.05). In turn, a negative correlation was found between the cortisol and urea levels in the hinds (p < 0.05). In summary, the stress caused by stalking hunts and the characteristic behavior of red deer during the mating season had an impact on chosen biochemical parameters. The increased concentration of cortisol resulted in a decrease in the carcass mass, which may lead to the deterioration of the physical condition of animals on hunting grounds.

AB  - Tea-oil tree (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is a unique woody edible oil species in China. Anthracnose is the common disease of Ca. oleifera, which affected the production and brought huge economic losses. Colletotrichum fructicola is the dominant pathogen causing Ca. oleifera anthracnose. The gene CfSET1 was deleted and its roles in development and pathogenicity of C. fructicola were studied. Our results show that this protein participated in the growth, conidiation, appressorium formation, and pathogenicity of this fungal pathogen. Our results help us understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis in C. fructicola and suggest CfSet1 as a potential target for the development of new fungicide.

AB  - The contamination of toxic heavy metals in meat production and processing can cause the oxidative deterioration of processed meat products. Aside from the possible mechanisms of toxic heavy metals on pro-oxidative reaction, little is known about the potential impacts of toxic heavy metal contamination on meat quality attributes within permitted maximum residual levels. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the influence of the intentional contamination of toxic heavy metals on the oxidative deterioration in ground pork models during aerobic display storage. Four types of toxic heavy metal salts (As2O3, CdCl2, K2Cr2O7, and Pb(NO3)(2)) were mixed with ground pork at two different levels (maximum residue limit and its half level), PVC-wrapped, and displayed in a 4 degrees C showcase equipped with continuous fluorescent natural white light (1400 lx, color temperature = 6500 K). The contamination of toxic heavy metals significantly decreased the redness of ground pork, and rapidly increased the hue angle. The contamination of Cd and Cr equivalent to maximum residue levels (0.05 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively) could increase the formation of peroxides, 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and carbonyls, along with an immediate decrease in total reducing activity. However, there was no difference in protein thiol content between treatments (p > 0.05). These results indicate that contamination of certain toxic heavy metals, particularly Cd and Cr, would accelerate discoloration, lipid oxidation, and carbonyl formation of ground pork during aerobic storage.

AB  - Plants employ elemental defense and organic defenses against herbivores under heavy metal stress. While the dose-dependent effects of metal accumulation on herbivore performance are well documented, the effects of these defenses on gut ultrastructure and microbiota remains less explored. In this study, maize grown in cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soil (1 or 5 mg/kg Cd) inhibited fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) life history traits. Greater inhibition was occurred at 1 mg/kg than at 5 mg/kg. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that more severe subcellular damaged to the FAW gut at 1 mg/kg Cd, characterized by nuclear membrane rupture and microvillus collapse, compared to 5 mg/kg Cd. 16S rDNA gene sequencing showed that 1 mg/kg Cd stress significantly decreased the abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Enterococcus) in the FAW gut while increasing heavy metal-resistant bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter ursingii). Transcriptomic profiling indicated that the 1 mg/kg Cd treatment significantly down-regulated genes involved in metabolic pathways (e.g., the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites) and up-regulated immune pathway genes (e.g., innate immune response). Maize under the 1 mg/kg stress treatment accumulated more soluble sugars and benzoxazinoids (BXs), such as HDMBOA-Glc and M2BOA. These compounds, rather than Cd levels alone, were critical factors influencing FAW growth. Therefore, maize low Cd-contaminated soil increases soluble sugars and BXs, which may synergize with Cd absorbed in the insect gut to enhance defense against the FAW. This study provides mechanistic insights into plant-herbivore interactions in contaminated ecosystems.

KW  - SAFETY
AB  - Implicit everyday forms of food sovereignty can be explored to reveal the diversity of the movement. For example, the ways in which elderly villagers raise pigs on weeds in central China share some features with the "quiet food sovereignty" of Russia. Small-scale pig rearing is largely invisible to outsiders, so identifying it relies heavily on weeds as indicators. Bounded by age in rural southwest Hubei, the small space of raising weed-fed pigs emerged in a blind spot between discourses on modern technological agriculture and concerns for food safety. In the 1990s, elderly villagers continued feeding pigs on local plants instead of using industrial fodder in order to retain the authentic taste of pork, which continues to have social value. The practice took on added significance as a form of self-protection from food-safety issues in the 2000s. It provides a moral buffer for elderly villagers sandwiched between the conflicting values of modern scientific and technological farming supported by the state policy of "Increasing Agricultural Prosperity with Modern Sci-tech" and emerging organic or green food movements motivated by urban people's desire for safe foods and state agenda on developing rural tourism. Despite the ecological, material, health, and social benefits of operating in this small space, their implicit food sovereignty goes unnoticed. Because raising weed-fed pigs functions invisibly, it remains in the blind spot of mass food discourses in China.

AB  - Simple Summary Small ruminants fed on cactus pear exclusively in the diet may present nutritional disorders, especially diarrhea. This is due to the high moisture requirements present in this food, related to microbiological factors inherent to poor hygienic quality, such as handling and prolonged exposure of crushed palm to the air, which can cause greater ingestion by animals of certain bacterial groups with pathogenic potential. The aim of this research was to investigate the levels of cactus associated with buffel grass hay on the microbiological quality of diets and the influence on physiological parameters in sheep. Thus, this research revealed that the participation of buffel grass hay was able to reduce the contamination of bacteria that cause diarrhea and depress animal performance. This study aimed to evaluate the microbiological composition of cactus pear-based diets with increasing levels of buffel grass hay, and its effect on the blood and physiological parameters and occurrence of diarrhea in feedlot sheep. Four diets containing different percentages of buffel grass hay were tested. Diets were composed of forage cactus, buffel grass hay and concentrate, and the treatments were represented by different levels of hay in the dry matter of the feed: 7.5% buffel grass hay; 15% buffel grass hay; 30% buffel grass hay; and 45% buffel grass hay on a dry matter basis. There was a significant effect (p = 0.0034) of inclusion levels of buffel grass hay on fecal score. Only at the 45% inclusion level diarrhea was not observed, showing that the level of buffel grass affected more the animals than the collection period, although the collection period has affected the microbial counts. Probably there was a physiological adaptation of animals over time. There were significant changes (p < 0.0001) in the blood parameters of sheep. The reduction of the proportion of cactus and the inclusion of greater than 15% buffel grass hay, on a dry matter basis, provides less contamination of the diet and animal feces by enterobacteria, such as E. coli.

AB  - There is insufficient land to use the large amount of nitrogen-rich biogas slurry, a potential agricultural nonpoint source pollutant, produced by anaerobic digestion of pig manure on large-scale pig farms in South China, and biochemical treatments of this product are often insufficient for meeting discharge standards. In addition, a large amount of phosphorus-rich fly ash (FA), which has poor phosphorus bioavailability and cannot be directly used in agriculture, is produced by chicken manure incineration. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find a way to treat this solid waste. This study explores the possibility of synergistic management and comprehensive utilization of these two wastes. The results indicated that the leaching effect of sulfuric acid was better than that of hydrochloric acid, citric acid and oxalic acid in phosphorus extraction from FA. When the amount of sulfuric acid used was 0.75 mol/L, L/S was 10, and the leaching time was 120 min, 87.33% of the phosphorus in FA was extracted; when the wastewater pH was 9.5 and the molar ratio of Mg:N:P was 1:1:2, 95.43% of ammonia nitrogen was recovered from the pig farm biogas slurry. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses indicated that the main component of the resulting Nsingle bondP fertilizer was struvite, and pot experiments showed that this Nsingle bondP fertilizer was more effective than superphosphate (SP) for plant growth. The residual wastewater met discharge standards after SBR treatment. The present research shows that two different agricultural wastes from one farm, N-rich biogas slurry and P-rich FA, can be treated together to yield recycled Nsingle bondP fertilizers and that the residual wastewater meets the standards for discharge. This study provides an innovative method for the comprehensive treatment and resource utilization of waste in modern and large-scale farms. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multivoltine insects can produce multiple generations in one year. Favorable conditions support more generations, leading to serious outbreaks. For herbivores, plant nutrient availability is a major environmental factor affecting fitness and it can shift substantially throughout seasons. In a stochastic environment, organisms can adopt several strategies to regulate their nutrient intake and maximize performance. However, data regarding nutrient regulation of wild herbivores are scarce, and even more so regarding potential intergenerational plasticity. To bridge this gap, we measured nutritional regulation and performance of an outbreaking multivoltine herbivore - one of the most serious agricultural pests in the Sahel: Oedaleus senegalensis. We surveyed a field population in Senegal and measured its nutritional preference and regulation across two generations (G1 and G3) using artificial diets and plant choice experiments. In the field, G1 locusts were five to ten times more abundant than G3 locusts. We found that G1 and G3 locusts selected different protein:carbohydrate ratios but also that the strength of regulation was different. G1 locusts regulated their nutrient target more tightly than G3 locusts. In contrast, studies with laboratory populations demonstrate strong regulation for grasshoppers, appearing less plastic than field populations. Both generations selected a carbohydrate-biased nutrient ratio, although it was more carbohydrate-biased for G3 locusts. In both cases, plant nutrient contents in the field were more protein biased than their preferred diet. Therefore, choices by locusts were likely influenced by other ecological variables such as leaf toughness or plant defenses. G1females were heavier and laid more eggs than G3 females. However, G3 locusts survived longer during the experiment than G1 locusts, suggesting a potential generational tradeoff between reproduction and survival. Our data highlight the importance of studying nutritional regulation in situ and incorporating field and lab data to better understand foraging decisions and nutritional tradeoffs.

AB  - Proteins not only serve as a nitrogen source for microorganisms but are the main skeleton of kefir grains. After subculturing in goat milk for 4 months, proteins and peptides in three kefir grains from China, Germany, and the United States were analyzed. Except for the S-layer protein from special Lactobacillus (sp.,) alpha(s1)-casein, alpha s(2)-casein, and beta-casein from goat milk were found in kefir grains. These proteins could form aggregates through a covalent interaction with polysaccharides to maintain the morphological stability of the grains. Furthermore, they were highly related to the microbiota in kefir grains. Additionally, a number of hydrophilic/hydrophobic peptides that were hydrolyzed by extracellular proteases were found from kefir grains. A correlation may exist between peptides and Lactobacillus sp. in kefir grains. Bioactive peptides, including DKIHPF, LGPVRGPFP, and QEPVLGPVRGPFP, were found from these kefir grains. The results indicated that goat milk as a substrate affects the protein and peptide composition of kefir grains.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the differences in the proteins in non-capacitated and capacitated boar sperm and to identify the functions of the differential proteins and key capacitation proteins of boar sperm before and after capacitation. Transwell chambers were used to separate capacitated sperm proteins using a unique polycarbonate membrane. Meanwhile, isotopic tags for relative and absolute quantification combined with LC-MS/MS analysis were used for quantitative determination of differential proteins. Through the comparative analysis of different databases, 475 different proteins were identified in non-capacitated sperm and capacitated sperm, of which 303 were significantly upregulated and 172 were significantly downregulated. These differentially-expressed proteins are mainly involved in redox processes, cell biosynthesis processes and cell aromatic compound metabolism biological processes. They also participate in the signaling pathways of phosphorylation, ketone synthesis and degradation, most of which interact to varying degrees. Among these differentially-expressed proteins, phosphofructokinase attracted our attention as a potential capacitated protein. We further verified that phosphofructokinase can promote boar sperm capacitation by immunoblotting. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The South American insect Tuta absoluta is a significant leaf-mining pest for tomato plants ( Solanum lycopersicum ). In the last fifteen years, it has invaded and rapidly expanded across most European and African countries. This poses increasing threats to key tomato-growing regions worldwide. Despite the global significance of crop damages caused by T. absoluta , existing models have primarily focused on the developmental growth at the individual level, with limited consideration for population and community-level interactions, especially the plant-pest relationship. Here we introduce and discuss an ecological, process-based, mathematical model that accounts for the interdependent dynamics between a population of the herbivorous insect and the tomato plants it feeds on. The model explicitly integrates the impacts of water and nutrients availability, as well as temperature, on the growth of both insect and plant populations. After calibrating the model using empirical data, we find that its simulations can replicate different observed patterns. Leveraging the mechanistic nature of our approach, we analyze the combined effects of various temperature, fertilization/irrigation (fertigation) and biocontrol scenarios on ( i ) crop growth and ( ii ) the overall health of the production system. This enables us to identify knowledge gaps and to discuss the effectiveness and trade-offs associated with different management policies.

AB  - Australian funnel-web spiders are amongst the most dangerous venomous animals. Their venoms induce potentially deadly symptoms, including hyper- and hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia and pulmonary oedema. Human envenomation is more frequent with the ground-dwelling species, including the infamous Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus); although, only two tree-dwelling species induce more severe envenomation. To unravel the mechanisms that lead to this stark difference in clinical outcomes, we investigated the venom transcriptome and proteome of arboreal Hadronyche cerberea and H. formidabilis. Overall, Hadronyche venoms comprised 44 toxin superfamilies, with 12 being exclusive to tree-dwellers. Surprisingly, the major venom components were neprilysins and uncharacterized peptides, in addition to the well-known omega- and delta-hexatoxins and double-knot peptides. The insecticidal effects of Hadronyche venom on sheep blowflies were more potent than Atrax venom, and the venom of both tree- and ground-dwelling species potently modulated human voltage-gated sodium channels, particularly Na(V)1.2. Only the venom of tree-dwellers exhibited potent modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels. H. formidabilis appeared to be under less diversifying selection pressure compared to the newly adapted tree-dweller, H. cerberea. Thus, this study contributes to unravelling the fascinating molecular and pharmacological basis for the severe envenomation caused by the Australian tree-dwelling funnel-web spiders.

AB  - The feasibility of the co-culture production of giant gourami Osphronemus goramy, an omnivorous with a herbivorous tendency fish, with high economic and patrimonial value in Indonesia, and floating macrophyte Azolla filiculoides was tested. A three months trial was carried out in an Indonesian small-scale fish farm from November 2017 to February 2018. Four earthen ponds (from 353 to 482 m(2)) were used. Two ponds were managed as conventional monoculture aquaculture; in the two others, 20% of the pond's surface was dedicated to the production of A. filiculoides. The objective of this co-production was to replace partially the commercial pellets with fresh, unprocessed Azolla. All ponds were fertilized with chicken manure and stocked with juveniles of giant gourami (24-34 g) bought in the local live fish market at a density of 6 individuals per m(2) under both management schemes. Production of Azolla was discontinuous, covering only 40 days over 90 days of the production cycle of Giant gourami. Azollawas harvested every three days producing 571 +/- 359 g m(-2) (mean +/- SD) of biomass. This discontinuity might be attributed to insufficient phosphorous (P) fertilization and predation by other fish, aquatic snails, and insect larvae. In the co-cultured ponds, a total of 15% of commercial pellets were spared by their replacement with fresh Azolla. The specific growth rate (SGR) and the fish biomass gain were similar for both systems. Azolla did not influence water quality. Both production systems were negative economic net-benefice (-17% for conventional ponds and -4% for co-cultured ponds), mainly because of high costs for seeds and sub-optimal feed performance. We demonstrated that the co-production of A. filiculoides did not generate any significant extra cost. We discussed the benefits of ecological intensification with macrophytes in semi-intensive production systems in the tropics.

AB  - The conservation of nature is of paramount importance for preserving biodiversity. However, it can also give rise to conflicts and challenges for communities dependent on natural resources. In this paper, we focus on the issue of Human-Elephant conflict (HEC) in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve, China, and investigate the causal linkages between governance systems and HEC. Our research presents a comprehensive case study of a village located within the Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve, delving into the intricate dynamics of humanelephant relationships spanning a three-decade period. Drawing on the integrated governance (IG) theory and actor-centered power (ACP) perspectives, we analyze the influence and interaction of three policy systems-Asian elephant conservation policy, agricultural development policy, and forestry policy-on the governance of HECs. Through our examination of power dynamics among multiple actors involved in policy formulation and those affected by policies, we aim to identify the driving forces influencing governance performance. We have identified noteworthy patterns of synergy and conflicting interests among agricultural, forestry, and elephant conservation policies, which have evolved at different stages of governance. The interplay between these policy systems significantly influences the habitat of wild elephants, the land-use patterns of adjacent communities, and the livelihood strategies adopted by local farmers. As a result of these interactions, an adaptive governance strategy on Human-Elephant Conflicts has emerged. Our findings offer novel perspectives on understanding the nuanced transitions in human-elephant relationships, providing valuable insights into the implications of policy interactions.

AB  - Hemodynamic disturbance, a rise in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and release of inflammatory cytokines into blood, is a bad prognostic indicator in severe COVID-19 and other diseases involving cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). The purpose of this study was to explore if zymosan, a known stimulator of the innate immune system, could reproduce these changes in pigs. Pigs were instrumented for hemodynamic analysis and, after i.v. administration of zymosan, serial blood samples were taken to measure blood cell changes, cytokine gene transcription in PBMC and blood levels of inflammatory cytokines, using qPCR and ELISA. Zymosan bolus (0.1 mg/kg) elicited transient hemodynamic disturbance within minutes without detectable cytokine or blood cell changes. In contrast, infusion of 1 mg/kg zymosan triggered maximal pulmonary hypertension with tachycardia, lasting for 30 min. This was followed by a transient granulopenia and then, up to 6 h, major granulocytosis, resulting in a 3-4-fold increase in NLR. These changes were paralleled by massive transcription and/or rise in IL-6, TNF-alpha, CCL-2, CXCL-10, and IL-1RA in blood. There was significant correlation between lymphopenia and IL-6 gene expression. We conclude that the presented model may enable mechanistic studies on late-stage COVID-19 and CSS, as well as streamlined drug testing against these conditions.

AB  - Leptin (LEP), a protein hormone well-known for its role in metabolic regulation, has recently been linked to lipid metabolism in cattle. However, its function in buffalo mammary glands remains unclear. To address this issue, we isolated and identified the LEP gene and conducted experiments to investigate its function in buffalo mammary epithelial cells (BuMECs). In this study, two transcript variants of LEP, designated as LEP_X1 and LEP_X2, were identified. The coding sequences (CDS) of LEP_X1 and LEP_X2 are 504 bp and 579 bp in length, encoding 167 and 192 amino acid residues, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that LEP_X2 is a hydrophobic protein with an isoelectric point below 7 and contains a signal peptide, while LEP_X1 is hydrophilic and lacks a signal peptide. Our study found that LEP gene expression in lactating BuMECs was significantly higher than in non-lactating cells, with LEP_X2 expression remarkably higher than LEP_X1 in lactating BuMECs. Overexpression of both LEP_X1 and LEP_X2 significantly promoted the expression of genes related to milk fat synthesis in lactating BuMECs, including STAT3, PI3K, mTOR, SCD, and SREBF1, accompanied by an increase in cellular triglycerides (TG). Interestingly, LEP_X2 overexpression significantly suppressed LEP_X1 expression while increasing intracellular TG concentration by 12.10-fold compared to LEP_X1 overexpression, suggesting an antagonistic relationship between the two variants and supposing LEP_X2 plays a dominant role in milk fat synthesis in lactating BuMECs. Additionally, four nucleotide substitutions were identified in the buffalo LEP CDS, including a nonsynonymous substitution c.148C>T (p.Arg50Cys), which was predicted to decrease the stability of the LEP protein without affecting its function. These results collectively underscore the significant role of LEP in milk fat synthesis and can provide a basis for molecular breeding strategies of buffalo.

AB  - The analysis of AR is widely used to detect loss of acrosome in sperm, but the subjective decisions of experts affect the accuracy of the examination. Therefore, we develop an ARCS for objectivity and consistency of analysis using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with various magnification images. Our models were trained on 215 microscopic images at 400x and 438 images at 1000x magnification using the ResNet 50 and Inception-ResNet v2 architectures. These models distinctly recognized micro-changes in the PM of AR sperms. Moreover, the Inception-ResNet v2-based ARCS achieved a mean average precision of over 97%. Our system's calculation of the AR ratio on the test dataset produced results similar to the work of the three experts and could do so more quickly. Our model streamlines sperm detection and AR status determination using a CNN-based approach, replacing laborious tasks and expert assessments. The ARCS offers consistent AR sperm detection, reduced human error, and decreased working time. In conclusion, our study suggests the feasibility and benefits of using a sperm diagnosis artificial intelligence assistance system in routine practice scenarios.

AB  - This work aims to evaluate how supplementing a commercial freezing media with butylated hydrox-ytoluene (BHT), or reduced glutathione (GSH), or their combination affected in-vitro measures of boar sperm after cryopreservation. One ejaculate was collected from 30 high-fertility boars in a weekly collection rotation. Samples were diluted 1:1 in an extender and cooled before overnight shipping at 17 degrees C to the freezing lab. On arrival, samples were split into the treatments with the following additions before cryopreservation; 1) semen without additional antioxidants (Control), 2) semen with 1 mM BHT, 3) semen with 2 mM GSH, and 4) semen with 1 mM BHT+2 mM GSH. Semen was evaluated for motility kinetics at 30,120, and 240 min after thawing. Flow cytometry assessments were performed at 60 min after thawing. At all-time points evaluated, total and progressive motility were greater (P < 0.05) in semen cryopreserved with GSH than in Control. No (P > 0.05) differences between Control and other treatment groups were observed in viability, or acrosomal and mitochondrial membrane integrity; however, the proportion of capacitated spermatozoa were reduced (by-21.17%) in semen treated with BHT + GSH compared to Control (P < 0.05). In contrast, there was a higher (P < 0.05, +21.18%) superoxide anion production in the Control than in the BHT + GSH. For IVF, semen cryopreserved with both anti-oxidants (BHT + GSH) had a negative (P < 0.05) impact on fertilization rate (-54.11%) compared to Control. However, for the blastocysts rate, there were more (+22.75%) blastocysts (P < 0.05) for BHT compared to Control. These results indicate that commercial media supplemented with GSH increased motility but impaired in vitro fertilization rate. On the other hand, media supplemented with BHT improved the in vitro fertilizing ability of the frozen-thawed sperm cells. Therefore, we suggest the supplementation with 1 mM of BHT in the formula of commercial freezing media used in the present experiment.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Herbal tea usually refers to "beverage plants that do not belong to the genus Camellia", and it holds a significant historical legacy as a traditional beverage among specific regions and ethnic groups. In light of this, our research aims to investigate and analyze the traditional knowledge pertaining to herbal tea plants used by local people in the Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province. We also initiated preliminary efforts to create tea products from herbal tea leaves using various processing techniques. Additionally, we attempted to test hypotheses to elucidate how local people select herbal tea plants.Methods Data related to the use of herbal tea plants in this study were collected through semi-structured interviews and participatory observations in four villages in Qianxinan. Quantitative indicators, including the relative frequency of citation (RFC) and the relative importance (RI) value, were calculated, and the availability of plants was also evaluated. General linear model was performed to examine the relationship between the frequency of citation and resource availability, as well as the correlation between the relative frequency of citation and the relative importance, to test both the resource availability hypothesis and the versatility hypothesis. Centella asiatica tea was processed using techniques from green tea, black tea and white tea, with a preliminary sensory evaluation conducted.Results A total of 114 plant species were documented as being used for herbal teas by local residents, representing 60 families and 104 genera. Of these, 61% of herbal tea plants were found growing in the wild, and 11 species were exotic plants. The family with the highest number of species was Asteraceae (20 species). The study identified 33 major medicinal functions of herbal tea, with clearing heat-toxin and diuresis being the most common functions. General linear model revealed a strong correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.72, p < 0.001) between the frequency of citation and plant availability, as well as a significant correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.63, p < 0.001) between RFC and RI. Under different processing conditions, the characteristics of Centella asiatica tea exhibited variations and were found to be suitable for consumption.Conclusion The consumption of herbal tea serves as a preventive measure against common ailments for local residents. The resource availability hypothesis, diversification hypothesis and the versatility hypothesis were shown to provide some insight into "how and why local communities select plants for use." Exotic herbal tea plants in the study area also possess valuable therapeutic properties. The processing and production of Centella asiatica herbal tea products hold promising prospects.

AB  - Simple Summary Plastic production has increased over the past decades, causing more plastic pollution to enter marine ecosystems. Because plastics persist in the environment for hundreds of years, they have become a threat to many living organisms. Animals may mistake plastic debris for food, which can cause illness or mortality. In this study, we analyzed the gastrointestinal tracts of ten sea turtles to assess the prevalence of plastic ingestion in the Saudi Arabian Red Sea. Plastics > 1 mm were collected and categorized into plastic type and color. This was the first report of plastic ingestion by turtles in the Red Sea. It is important to have baseline data on plastic ingestion because the human population surrounding the Red Sea is expected to increase within the coming decades. With more people residing in coastal areas, there may be an increased amount of plastic debris entering the ocean. This study found that 40% of the turtles had ingested plastics, meaning that plastic is currently a threat to turtles in the region, and conservation efforts should be implemented to remove plastics from the sea and to prevent plastic pollution from entering the environment. (1) Background: Plastic pollution is a major environmental concern confronting marine animals. Sea turtles are considered a bio-indicator of plastic pollution, but there is little information regarding plastic ingestion by turtles in the Red Sea. With large-scale development projects being built along the Saudi Arabian coast, it is important to have a baseline for plastic ingestion before construction is complete. (2) Methods: Ten deceased sea turtles (four hawksbill and six green turtles) were collected along the Saudi Arabian coastline. Necropsies were conducted, and the entire gastrointestinal tracts were extracted and the contents were passed through a 1 mm mesh sieve. (3) Results: We found that 40% of the turtles in this study had ingested plastics. Thread-like plastics were the most common plastic category, and multi-colored was the most prevalent color category. (4) Conclusions: Monitoring of the plastic ingestion by marine megafauna should be conducted as a long-term assessment of the developments' impacts. Additionally, conservation efforts should be focused on removing plastics (namely ghost nests and fishing lines) from the reefs and reducing the amount of plastic entering the sea.

AB  - Adolescent binge drinking is a social problem with a long-lasting impact on cognitive functions. The cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in brain synaptic plasticity, cognition and behavior via receptor localization at specific subcellular compartments of the cortical, limbic and motor regions. Alcohol (EtOH) intake affects the ECS, CB1 and their functions. Evidence indicates that binge drinking during adolescence impairs memory via the abrogation of CB1-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. However, the impact of EtOH consumption on global CB1 receptor expression in the adult brain is unknown. We studied this using optical density analysis throughout brain regions processed for light microscopy (LM) immunohistotochemistry. CB1 staining decreased significantly in the secondary motor cortex, cerebellum, cingulate cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Next, as omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) rescue synaptic plasticity and improve EtOH-impaired cognition, we investigated whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) had any effect on CB1 receptors. N-3 intake during EtOH abstinence restored CB1 immunostaining in the secondary motor cortex, cerebellum and amygdala, and ameliorated receptor density in the cingulate cortex. These results show that n-3 supplementation recovers CB1 receptor expression disrupted by EtOH in distinct brain regions involved in motor functions and cognition.

AB  - The intricate mechanisms driving oocyte maturation remain only partially understood, especially within the domains of domestic animal reproduction and translational medicine. In the case of prepubertal girls, the clinical challenge is especially pronounced, as ovarian tissue cryopreservation-though promising-remains an experimental technique necessitating rigorous scientific validation to guarantee the developmental potential of preserved materials and facilitate broader clinical adoption. To address these knowledge gaps, while considering the ethical implications, we applied transcriptome and translatome sequencing to comprehensively profile the transcriptional and translational dynamics of oocyte maturation in adult and prepubertal goats. Our analyses uncovered a sequential transition in gene expression regulation, shifting from cytoplasmic processes to chromosome segregation during the maturation process. Comparative profiling between adult and prepubertal goat oocytes revealed critical regulatory factors essential for prepubertal oocyte maturation. These include genes involved in organelle function (GTPBP4 and TOMM7), spindle organisation (CKS2, CCP110, CKAP5 and ESCO1) and chromosome segregation (CENPE, CENPF, CENPN and SGO2). Functional validation through in vitro maturation experiments demonstrated that GTPBP4 significantly enhances the developmental competence of prepubertal goat oocytes. This enhancement occurs through mechanisms that promote cell cycle progression, organelle maturation and mRNA translation. These findings provide a detailed map of the molecular events underpinning goat oocyte maturation and offer new perspectives on the developmental strategies required for oocyte competence in prepubertal females. Translating these insights to humans, this research highlights potential fertility preservation strategies for prepubertal girls, such as ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation, in vitro follicle culture, meiotic maturation and artificial ovary technologies. Moreover, the identified mechanisms have significant implications for improving reproductive efficiency in domestic animal breeding, bridging basic research and applied science.

AB  - Simple Summary Urinary tract obstruction is a common problem in male goats. Urine acidification resulting from ammonium chloride treatment has been proved to dissolve sandy stones in alkaline urine. Although the natural high ambient temperature of the tropical area activates acid-base balance to alkalosis direction, a low dietary cation-anion difference regimen could acidify goat urine. The tubular excretion of acid and electrolytes plays a crucial role during mixed acid-base situations: respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. Goats can suffer from intermittent heat stress in high ambient temperature (HTa) conditions, which causes sporadic respiratory hypocapnia. Obstructive urolithiasis is a common urological problem in goats. Sandy uroliths can be partially relieved by urine acidification with short-term ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) treatment. However, the outcome of urine acidification and the physiological responses to short-term NH4Cl supplementation under respiratory hypocapnia of HTa have rarely been reported. The present study investigated the effect of NH4Cl supplementation that produced a low dietary cation-anion different (l-DCAD) diet on acid-base balance and renal function under HTa conditions. The first experiment investigated the physiological responses to natural HTa to prove whether the peak HTa during the afternoon could induce HTa responses without a change in the plasma cortisol. The partial pressure of CO2 also tended to decrease during the afternoon. The second experiment examined the short-term effect of l-DCAD under HTa conditions. Although the blood pH was within the normal range, there was a clear acid-base response in the direction of metabolic acidosis. The major responses in renal function were an increase in tubular function and acid excretion. With a comparable level of creatinine clearance, the fractional excretions (FE) of chloride and calcium increased, and the FE of potassium decreased. Acid excretion increased significantly in the l-DCAD group. We conclude that under HTa conditions, the tubular excretion of electrolytes and acids was the major response to acid loading without changing the filtration rate. The l-DCAD formulation can be used to acidify urine effectively.

AB  - Iron and steel are valuable commodities worldwide. Pig iron is produced mainly by blast furnaces, being the primary raw material used in steel manufacturing. The ironmaking sector is intensive in energy use and greenhouse gas emission; however, detailed information on further environmental impacts concerning the blend of material sources and co-product utilization as well as a rigorous application of the life cycle assessment (LCA) method are scarce. This study aimed to assess the environmental and energy performance of the production of 1.0 t of pig iron from cradle-to-gate via LCA. Global warming potential (GWP), renewable and non-renewable cumulative energy demand (CEDR and CEDNR), fossil resource scarcity (FRS), mineral resource scarcity (MRS), blue water footprint (WF), and land use (LU) were assessed in five scenarios in the Brazilian context, being S0: the baseline scenario with coke as a carbon source; S1: partial utilization of by-/co-products (top gas and slag), representing the current industry practice; S2: carbon and iron input blends proportional to the current industry practice; S3: current industry mix (S1 and S2 combined); and S4: ex-ante (forecast) scenario with an enhanced blend of inputs and maximum utilization of co-products. Results show that, when evaluated against an unrefined but realistic fossil-based state of the technology (S0), the existing practice in co-product utilization (S1) provided more gains in terms of GWP, CEDNR, FRS, and MRS (11 % on average) than the current iron and carbon input blends (S2, 9 % on average) if compared side-by-side. The current industry mix (S3) showed further improvement in environmental and energy performance (22 % on average) compared with the baseline scenario (S0), while the forecasted scenario (S4) indicated additional gains, reducing GWP by 47 % (down to similar to 1 t CO2 eq), CEDNR by 69 %, FRS by 70 %, MRS by 12 %, and WF by 5 %. The GWP, CEDNR, and FRS presented the greatest improvements with a significant statistical difference, and using charcoal as a carbon source was key in that regard, despite the great increase in CEDR (3x for biomass) and LU (2x) indicators suggesting that a robust sustainable wood supply chain will be decisive for the sector strategy. The sensitivity analysis (SA) and benchmarking of the ex-ante scenario (S4) showed notable competitiveness of such pig iron in the global market, especially for carbon and energy footprints, reaching 0.69 t CO2 eq t(-1) pig iron and 4.6 GJ(NR) t(-1) pig iron from 100 % sustainable charcoal and including rail logistics (SAiv), which are from 2x to 5x smaller than those of any conventional blast furnace pig iron reported in the consulted literature.

AB  - The development and verification of nuclear fuel-cladding performance codes require extensive test-ing to establish empirical correlations, necessitating more accelerated testing methods that can replace large validation studies. In the present work a technique was developed and implemented to experi-mentally quantify the relationship between temperature, cladding internal pressure, and strain in-situ during a burst test, with the specific aim of generating data for code validation and model refinement. Digital image correlation was used to measure hoop, axial, and radial strain, and infrared thermogra-phy to quantify axial temperature gradients. Several key experimental modifications to traditional LOCA burst testing were necessary, but are shown to effectively have little impact on burst temperatures. The time/temperature dependent pressure and time/spatially dependent thermal gradient data were used with BISON to simulate cladding burst and strain rates. Although the measured DIC strains reach ap-preciable amounts at slightly lower temperatures than BISON simulated strains, there is good agreement between the measured and simulated strains in terms of magnitude and rates leading up to burst. How-ever, in the few seconds prior to and during burst, the BISON simulated strains are significantly lower than the measured strains, indicating the potential for model improvement. The combined experiment and simulation technique may be applied to any new cladding concept to accelerate fuel qualification.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundPig slurries account for a large proportion of the organic manure available worldwide. Because of the large range of slurry compositions, farmers need fast and accurate alternatives to laboratory methods to assess nutrient concentrations in these farm-based fertilizers. In this way, nutrient emissions into the environment can be reduced and targeted nutrition of crops can be implemented, while mineral fertilizers can be saved. AimThe objective was to evaluate whether it is possible to rapidly determine ammonium and potassium concentrations in pig slurries on-farm using ion-selective electrodes (ISE) and to compare the measurement with established methods. MethodsA total of 391 pig slurry samples were collected from farms in north-west Germany, and ammonium and potassium concentrations were analyzed in the laboratory. Then the composition of pig slurries was measured with ISE, the Quantofix-N-Volumeter (QV) and an electrical conductivity (EC) meter and regression models were used to evaluate the on-farm quick tests. ResultsFor the 391 pig slurries studied, regressions with an R-2 of 0.92 for ammonium and 0.91 for potassium were achieved for concentrations measured with the ISE in comparison with laboratory analyzes. The model fits for the electrodes were significantly higher than those based on the EC for ammonium and potassium, and it was equivalent to the QV method for the assessment of the ammonium concentration. ConclusionDue to the simple and rapid measurement, ISE offer high potential for on-farm quantification of ammonium and potassium concentrations in pig slurries.

AB  - Upon fertilization, extensive chromatin reprogramming occurs during preimplantation development. Growing evidence reveals species-dependent regulations of this process in mammals. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor SMARCA5 (also known as SNF2H) is required for peri-implantation development in mice. However, the specific functional role of SMARCA5 in preimplantation development and if it is conserved among species remain unclear. Herein, comparative analysis of public RNA-seq datasets reveals that SMARCA5 is universally expressed during oocyte maturation and preimplantation development in mice, cattle, humans, and pigs with species-specific patterns. Immunostaining analysis further describes the temporal and spatial changes of SMARCA5 in both mouse and bovine models. siRNA-mediated SMARCA5 depletion reduces the developmental capability and compromises the specification and differentiation of inner cell mass in mouse preimplantation embryos. Indeed, OCT4 is not restricted into the inner cell mass and the formation of epiblast and primitive endoderm disturbed with reduced NANOG and SOX17 in SMARCA5-deficient blastocysts. RNA-seq analysis shows SMARCA5 depletion causes limited effects on the transcriptomics at the morula stage, however, dysregulates 402 genes, including genes involved in transcription regulation and cell proliferation at the blastocyst stage in mice. By comparison, SMARCA5 depletion does not affect the development through the blastocyst stage but significantly compromises the blastocyst quality in cattle. Primitive endoderm formation is greatly disrupted with reduced GATA6 in bovine blastocysts. Overall, our studies demonstrate the importance of SMARCA5 in fostering the preimplantation development in mice and cattle while there are species-specific effects.
   Summary sentence
   The chromatin remodeler SMARCA5 is required for preimplantation development with species-specific effects in mice and cattle.

AB  - Different hair sheep breeds originated from diverse climatic regions of the USA may show varying adaptability to water deprivation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the effects of restricted availability of drinking water on blood characteristics and constituent concentrations in different breeds of hair sheep from various regions the USA. For this study, 45 Dorper (initial age = 3.7 +/- 0.34 yr), 45 Katandin (3.9 +/- 0.36 yr), and 44 St. Croix (2.7 +/- 0.29 yr) sheep from 45 farms in 4 regions of the USA (Midwest, Northwest, Southeast, and central Texas) were used. Ad libitum water intake was determined during wk 2 of period one, with 75% of ad libitum water intake offered during wk 2 of period two, and 50% of ad libitum water intake offered for 5 wk (i.e., wk 5-9) in period three. Water was offered at 07:00 or 07:30 h, with blood samples collected at 08:00 and (or) 14:00 h in wk 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9 for variables such as hemoglobin and oxygen saturation and wk 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 for concentrations of glucose and other constituents. The blood oxygen concentration at 08:00 h was 4.86, 4.93, and 5.25 mmol/L in period one and 4.89, 4.81, and 5.74 mmol/L in period three for Dorper, Katandin, and St. Croix, respectively (SEM = 0.160; p = 0.001). Blood oxygen at 14:00 h was 4.37, 4.61, and 4.74 mmol/L in period one and 4.66, 4.81, and 5.46 mmol/L in period three for Dorper, Katandin, and St. Croix, respectively (SEM = 0.154; p = 0.003). St. Croix were able to maintain a higher (p < 0.001) blood oxygen concentration than Dorper and Katandin regardless of water availability. The pattern of change in blood concentrations with advancing time varied considerably among constituents. However, concentrations of glucose (55.3 and 56.2 mg/dL; SEM = 0.84), lactate (24.1 and 22.5 mg/dL; SEM = 0.79), total protein (7.08 and 7.17 g/dL; SEM = 0.0781), and albumin (2.59 and 2.65 g/dL in wk 2 and 9, respectively; SEM = 0.029) were similar (p > 0.05) between periods one and three. Conversely, concentrations of cholesterol (56.2 and 69.3 mg/dL; SEM = 1.33) and triglycerides (28.6 and 34.5 mg/dL in wk 2 and 9, respectively; SEM = 0.98) were greater (p < 0.05) in period three vs. 1. In conclusion, water restriction altered almost all the blood variables depending upon severity and duration of restriction, but the hair sheep breeds used from different regions of the USA, especially St. Croix, displayed considerable capacity to adapt to limited drinking water availability.

AB  - Simple Summary Glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2) gene expression differs between individuals with different GPX2 polymorphism. Individuals with high GPX2 expression had thinning 100 kg backfat (BF) thickness, no change on average daily gain (AG) and lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) and residual feed intake (RFI) in Duroc pigs. The reason for this result could be that increasing GPX2 could inhibit the adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, promoting the lipid degradation. Meanwhile, GPX2 may promote muscle cells' proliferation and myogenic differentiation. Overall, our fundings indicate that GPX2 can transfer more nutrients to less fat deposition direction, providing the material basis for animal weight gain. GPX2 has been recognized as a potential candidate gene for feed efficiency in pigs. This article aimed to elucidate polymorphism of GPX2 associated with feed efficiency and its related molecular mechanism. In this study, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of GPX2 were found among 383 Duroc pigs. In addition, seven SNPs and ALGA0043483 (PorcineSNP60 BeadChip data in 600 Duroc pigs), which are near the GPX2 gene, were identified in one haplotypes block. Furthermore, associated studies showed that the genotype of GPX2 has significant association with weaning weight and 100 kg BF in Duroc pigs. In addition, the AG had no effect when the backfat became thinner, and the FCR and RFI traits had a tendency to decrease in the G3 + TT combination genotype, accompanied by an increase of GPX2 expression in backfat and muscle tissues. At the cellular level, the adipocyte proliferation and ability of adipogenic differentiation were reduced, and the lipid degradation increased in 3T3-L1 when there was overexpression of GPX2. In contrast, overexpression of the GPX2 gene can promote the muscle cell proliferation and myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells. In other words, GPX2 has the effect of reducing fat deposition and promoting muscle development, and it is a candidate gene for backfat and feed efficiency.

AB  - Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) plays a critical role in myoblast proliferation and fat deposition in animals. Our previous RNA-Seq analyses identified a close association between the JAK2 gene and muscle development. To date, research delving into the relationship between the JAK2 gene and growth traits has been sparse. In this study, we sought to investigate the relationship between novel mutations within the JAK2 gene and goat growth traits. Herein, two novel InDel (Insertion/Deletion) polymorphisms within the JAK2 gene were detected in 548 goats, and only two genotypes were designated as ID (Insertion/Deletion) and DD (Deletion/Deletion). The results indicate that the two InDels, the del19008 locus in intron 2 and del72416 InDel in intron 6, showed significant associations with growth traits (p < 0.05). Compared to Nubian and Jianzhou Daer goats, the del72416 locus displayed a more pronounced effect in the Fuqing breed group. In the Nubian breed (NB) group, both InDels showed a marked influence on body height (BH). There were strong linkages observed for these two InDels between the Fuqing (FQ) and Jianzhou (JZ) populations. The DD-ID diplotype was associated with inferior growth traits in chest width (ChW) and cannon circumference (CaC) in the FQ goats compared to the other diplotypes. In the NB population, the DD-DD diplotype exhibited a marked negative impact on BH and HuWI (hucklebone width index), in contrast to the other diplotypes. In summary, our findings suggest that the two InDel polymorphisms within the JAK2 gene could serve as valuable molecular markers for enhancing goat growth traits in breeding programs.

AB  - Background: The forest musk deer, a rare fauna species found in China, is famous for its musk secretion which is used in selected Traditional Chinese medicines. However, over-hunting has led to musk deer becoming an endangered species, and their survival is also greatly challenged by various high incidence and high mortality respiratory and intestinal diseases such as septic pneumonia and enteritis. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Akkermannia muciniphila (AKK) is a promising probiotic, and we wondered whether AKK could be used as a food additive in animal breeding programmes to help prevent intestinal diseases. Methods: We isolated one AKK strain from musk deer feces (AKK-D) using an improved enrichment medium combined with real-time PCR. After confirmation by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a series of in vitro tests was conducted to evaluate the probiotic effects of AKK-D by assessing its reproductive capability, simulated gastrointestinal fluid tolerance, acid and bile salt resistance, self-aggregation ability, hydrophobicity, antibiotic sensitivity, hemolysis, harmful metabolite production, biofilm formation ability, and bacterial adhesion to gastrointestinal mucosa. Results: The AKK-D strain has a probiotic function similar to that of the standard strain in humans (AKK-H). An in vivo study found that AKK-D significantly ameliorated symptoms in the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)-induced murine diarrhea model. AKK-D improved organ damage, inhibited inflammatory responses, and improved intestinal barrier permeability. Additionally, AKK-D promoted the reconstitution and maintenance of the homeostasis of gut microflora, as indicated by the fact that AKK-D-treated mice showed a decrease in Bacteroidetes and an increase in the proportion of other beneficial bacteria like Muribaculaceae, Muribaculum, and unclassified f_Lachnospiaceae compared with the diarrhea model mice. Conclusion: Taken together, our data show that this novel AKK-D strain might be a potential probiotic for use in musk deer breeding, although further extensive systematic research is still needed.

AB  - BackgroundIn 2018, a sodium nitrite (SN)-based toxic bait for invasive wild pigs (hereafter wild pigs; Sus scrofa), was evaluated to determine its effectiveness in reducing local wild pig populations in Texas. Localized population reductions of >70% were achieved, but spillage of bait outside wild pig-specific feeders (bait stations) caused by feeding wild pigs resulted in the deaths of non-target animals. To evaluate risks to non-target animals, we tested whether bait presentation influenced the total amount of bait spilled by wild pigs and estimated the associated risk to non-target species. ResultsWe found that bait spilled outside bait stations could be reduced by >90% when compacted in trays, as opposed to being manually crumbled into pieces. We documented a mean spill rate of 0.913 g of bait per wild pig. Conservative risk assessments for nine non-target species for which SN toxicity data exist indicate that there is relatively low risk of lethal exposure, apart from zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and white mice. Our results indicate that there may be enough spilled bait per feeding wild pig to kill 9.5 or 3.5 individuals of these species, respectively. Other species assessed range from 0.002 to 0.406 potential mortalities per wild pig. ConclusionWe demonstrated that the amount of bait spilled by wild pigs during feeding and the associated risk to non-target animals can be minimized by presenting the bait compacted in trays within bait stations. We recommend that baits be tightly compacted and secured in bait stations to minimize risks to non-target animals from spilled bait by wild pigs. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abundant in mammalian genomes and have been found to play important roles in many biological events. However, the mechanism by which lncRNAs regulate embryonic development remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the function of the lncRNA, TCONS_00135926 (referred to as lnc5926), through knockdown and overexpression experiments in goat early embryos. Lnc5926 expression at the eight-cell embryonic stage was significantly higher than that at other stages, which was consistent with the pattern of embryonic genome activation (EGA) gene expression. The blastocyst rate after lnc5926 knockdown in eight-cell embryos was significantly lower than that in the control group (0.2% vs. 17.1%, p < 0.05), whereas the cleavage rate was not affected (71.9% vs. 75.1%, p > 0.05). After knockdown or overexpression of lnc5926 in embryos, we measured expression levels of the potential target genes, STAM, HACD1, UBL5, MIOX, ELF1, and the key EGA genes, ZSCAN4 and EIF1AX. Only ZSCAN4 and EIF1AX were significantly downregulated after lnc5926 knockdown, and this effect was reversed by lnc5926 overexpression. We conclude that lnc5926 plays an essential role in early embryonic development in goats by regulating expression of EGA-associated genes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Plant Vigor Hypothesis (PVH) predicts that herbivorous insects will preferentially feed on large plants with more vigorous growth, or on more vigorous parts of the plant. However, we still need to understand how these predictions work throughout the ontogenic stages of plants and with other groups of natural plant enemies. We tested the PVH using gall-inducing insects, free-living herbivorous insects, and pathogenic fungi associated with Hymenaea courbaril seedlings of the same age cohort (six months) from seeds germinated in greenhouses. We classified the plants into three different sizes: small, medium, and large seedlings, and then measured above and belowground biomass, plant height, leaf area, and leaf area consumed by free-living herbivores. We also measured nutrient partitioning among roots, stems, and leaves and estimated hypersensitive responses. We found no differences in leaf area consumed by free-living herbivorous insects between plant size groups. However, we observed that larger seedlings were more vigorous and had greater nutritional value and, thus, represented adequate niches for colonization by pathogens and gall-inducing insects, confirming the PVH for both groups. The hypersensitive response was greater in medium and large seedlings, proving to be an effective defense mechanism against gall-inducing insects. Therefore, we highlight that nutritional quality, plant vigor and hypersensitivity response are factors that influence the incidence of pathogens and galling insects on H. courbaril seedlings.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is an acute, hemorrhagic and severe infectious disease caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), and leads to a serious threat to the pig industry in China. Yet the impact of the virus in the environment and contaminated swill on the ASFV transmission is unclear in China. Then we build the ASFV transmission model with the virus in the environment and swill. We compute the basic reproduction number, and prove that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R-0 < 1 and the unique endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R-0 > 1. Using the public information, parameter values are evaluated. PRCCs and eFAST sensitivity analysis reveal that the release rate of ASFV from asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious pigs and the proportion of pig products from infectious pigs to swill have a significant impact on the ASFV transmission. Our findings suggest that the virus in the environment and contaminated swill contribute to the ASFV transmission. Our results may help animal health to prevent and control the ASFV transmission.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the efficiency of a system of treatment of organic swine waste as a management tool in the transformation of organic waste into products of value in the swine industry. The residues from the pig farm and the products obtained (compost, biol and biogas) were quantified and characterized, as were the energy used within the process and the distribution of the products. The negative impacts on the soil and adjacent river, as well as the efficiency of the compost as fertilizers and biol in grass and corn crops, were evaluated. The subsystems were: S1-slurry separation, S2-anaerobic digestion, S3-composting solid fraction of slurry, and S4-composting of dead tissues. S2 was not efficient in obtaining biol, with COD and TSS required. The process requires 31.1 kW/d of electrical energy and 3.22 L/d of diesel. The biogas (35,486.0 m(3)/d) is used for cooking food and heating houses, whilst the compost (82 kg/d) and biol (7.72 m(3)/d) replace inorganic fertilizers in crops. The system was adequate for the transformation of 38,109.0 kg/d of waste into valuable products. The biol needs further treatment time or to couple biodigesters-another treatment. The pig farm can be considered eco-efficient.

AB  - Simple Summary: Weaning is a critical period in the development of piglets. During the weaning period, piglets are prone to weight loss, diarrhea, and even death due to factors such as the environment, feeding management, feed type, and feeding method. Current research indicates that essential oils can positively impact animal nutrition and production due to their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. However, essential oils are quickly metabolized in the upper gastro-intestinal tract, so that the concentrations remaining in the distal small intestine are far too low to improve the intestinal tract. Microencapsulation technology is a relatively new processing method for essential oils. However, there is a scarcity of studies investigating the effects of microencapsulated essential oils (MEO) on growth and intestinal structure in weaned piglets. Consequently, further research on the application of MEO in the diet of weaned piglets is warranted. In this study, we administered varying concentrations of MEO to assess its impact on ADG, ADFI, FCR, diarrhea score, intestinal structure, antioxidant capacity, and other factors in weaned piglets. The aim was to develop new feed additives to enhance intestinal health of weaned piglets. The study investigated the effects of microencapsulated essential oils (MEO) on the growth performance, diarrhea, and intestinal microenvironment of weaned piglets. The 120 thirty-day-old weaned piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire, 8.15 +/- 0.07 kg) were randomly divided into four groups and were fed with a basal diet (CON) or CON diet containing 300 (L-MEO), 500 (M-MEO), and 700 (H-MEO) mg/kg MEO, respectively, and data related to performance were measured. The results revealed that MEO supplementation increased the ADG and ADFI in weaned piglets (p < 0.05) compared with CON, and reduced diarrhea rates in nursery pigs (p < 0.05). MEO supplementation significantly increased the duodenum's V:C ratio and the jejunal villi height of weaned piglets (p < 0.05). The addition of MEO significantly increased the T-AOC activity in the jejunum of piglets (p < 0.05), but only L-MEO decreased the MDA concentration (p < 0.01). H-MEO group significantly increases the content of isobutyric acid (p < 0.05) in the piglet colon, but it does not affect the content of other acids. In addition, MEO supplementation improved appetite in the nursery and increased the diversity and abundance of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal microbiome. In conclusion, these findings indicated that MEO supplementation improves growth and intestinal health in weaned piglets.

AB  - Pigs are important biomedical model animals for the study of human neurological diseases. Similar to human aggressive behavior in children and adolescents, weaned pigs also show more aggressive behavior after mixing, which has negative effects on animal welfare and growth performance. The identification of functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the aggressive behavior of pigs would provide valuable molecular markers of the aggressive behavioral trait for genetic improvement program. The Rho GTPase-activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24) gene plays an important role in regulating the process of axon guidance, which may impact the aggressive behavior of pigs. By resequencing the entire coding region, partially adjacent introns and the 5 ' and 3 ' flanking regions, six and four SNPs were identified in the 5 ' flanking region and 5 ' untranslated region (UTR) of the porcine ARHGAP24 gene, respectively. Association analyses revealed that nine SNPs were significantly associated with aggressive behavioral traits (p = < 1.00 x 10(-4)-4.51 x 10(-2)), and their haplotypes were significantly associated with aggressive behavior (p = < 1.00 x 10(-4)-2.99 x 10(-2)). The core promoter region of the ARHGAP24 gene has been identified between -670 and -1,113 bp. Furthermore, the luciferase activity of allele A of rs335052970 was significantly less than that of allele G, suggesting that the transcriptional activity of the ARHGAP24 gene was inhibited by allele A of rs335052970. It was identified that the transcription factor p53 bound to the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) containing allele A of rs335052970. In porcine primary neural cells, p53 binds to the target promoter region of the ARHGAP24 gene, reduces its promoter transcriptional activity, and then reduces its messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression. The results demonstrated that the ARHGAP24 gene had significant genetic effects on aggressive behavioral traits of pigs. Therefore, rs335052970 in the ARHGAP24 gene can be used as a molecular marker to select the less aggressive pigs.

AB  - Generalist predators, such as the dingo (Canis familiaris), frequently use linear clearings as movement corridors, increasing their mobility, landscape access, and sometimes modifying predator-prey relationships. We quantified the diet of the dingo in the West Kimberley region of Western Australia and tested the hypothesis that clearing of seismic lines would result in a change to the diet of dingoes. A total of 199 scats were collected from inside and outside the footprint of a seismic survey at three collection time points (before and twice after the disturbance). Overall, the diet of dingoes varied over seasons (P = 0.003), and between control and treatment sites (P = 0.013); however, there was no evidence of a shift in diet caused by seismic clearing (time x treatment interaction term, P = 0.848). Cattle were the most frequently occurring item (frequency of occurrence = 65% of 199 samples; the greatest value recorded in Australia), with greater consumption of cattle in control and treatment sites at the end of the dry season compared to the early dry season, likely driven by an increase in cattle mortality and susceptibility to predation. Despite dingoes using seismic lines as movement corridors, there is little evidence that this results in a change in their diet.
