AB  - Colostrum intake within the first hours of life is essential for neonatal survival. Lambs born from twin pregnancies may experience failure in passive immunity transfer (PIT), which can affect the serum concentrations of several metabolites. This study aimed to evaluate serum biochemical constituents and PIT in Santa In & ecirc;s lambs born from single (Sg; n=19) and twin (Tw; n=28) births. Blood samples were collected at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after birth, and analyzed for total protein, albumin, globulin, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), and the enzymatic activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Lambs in the GS group showed higher birth weight (3.98 kg vs. 3.03 kg; p<0.05), total protein (6.12 g/dL vs. 5.32 g/dL), globulin (4.35 g/dL vs. 3.64 g/dL), and GGT (322.93 U/L vs. 543.90 U/L) at 24 hours post-partum. Considering the association between globulin and immunoglobulin levels, the data suggest partial PIT failure in twin-born lambs. Additionally, significant differences (p<0.05) were observed in the mean values of albumin (1.87 vs. 1.80 g/ dL), P (7.92 vs. 7.24 mg/dL), and Mg (2.51 vs. 2.37 mg/dL), with higher levels in the GS group. The remaining parameters remained within the reference ranges for the species. It is concluded that lambs from twin pregnancies are at greater risk of PIT failure and present lower serum levels of constituents related to neonatal immunity and metabolism, highlighting the importance of assisted colostrum management in such cases.

AB  - While host plants and endosymbionts have been implicated in influencing dietary breadth in polyphagous herbivores, the underlying mechanism remains vague. In this study, we focused on the food nutrition and nutrition provision of endosymbionts to elucidate the determination of dietary breadth in a polyphagous aphid Aphis gossypii. Our findings demonstrated that high sugar and riboflavin presence in food decreased aphid fitness, while Arsenophonus infections improved aphid performance. Aphids collected from cotton could not use cucumber whether they were infected with Arsenophonus or not, signifying a distinct specialization toward cotton. Further, both the Arsenophonus-infected and free aphids fed on artificial diet varying in sugar titer failed to utilize cucumber. However, Arsenophonus-free aphids attained the ability to utilize cucumber after feeding on the riboflavin-free diet, but not on the riboflavin-containing diet, indicating riboflavin and Arsenophonus-absent expansion in dietary breadth. Notably, up-regulated expression of riboflavin synthase genes of the obligated symbiont Buchnera aphidicola was detected in the Arsenophonus-infected aphids which may provide more riboflavin. Arsenophonus promoting riboflavin synthesis in the obligated symbiont B. aphidicola and riboflavin ingestion enhancing host specialization of aphids to cotton modulate dietary breadth of A. gossypii.

AB  - We evaluated a method for marking arthropods that could serve as a valuable tool for mark-release-recapture dispersal research. The taggants tested consisted of three liquid fluorophores labeled cartax green, magenta, and orange. The manufacturer markets these fluorescent markers as forensic theft deterrents. Specimens of 16 genera of arthropods were externally marked with either one of the colored fluorophores or with water (negative control treatment). The specimens were then qualitatively and quantitatively inspected for fluorescence 24 h later. For the qualitative analysis, three independent observers scored each specimen by direct observation for the presence of a fluorescent mark. The specimens were scored using a portable ultraviolet (UV) tube lantern and a specialized NIGHTSEA-brand LED UV light. The three fluorophores were readily detected on many but not all the species examined, regardless of the type of UV light used. Moreover, the NIGHTSEA LED light yielded fewer false-negative observer errors than the lantern. Each specimen's fluorescence was measured with an automated dual-wavelength microplate fluorometer for the quantitative analysis. Overall, the quantitative analysis was very reliable at detecting fluorescence on a few taxa [e.g., Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), Chrysoperla spp. (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae)], effective on most taxa, and unreliable on several others [e.g., Collops vittatus (Say) (Coleoptera: Melyridae), Geocoris spp. (Hemiptera: Geocoridae), Mecaphesa celer (Hentz) (Araneae: Thomisidae)]. The cartax green marker was more readily detected than the magenta and orange markers with both visual and automated detection. Overall, the results show that these fluorophores could be effective markers for many arthropod species.

AB  - miRNA is a noncoding RNA found in recent years and more than one third of human genes are the target of miRNAs. miR-624, located on human chromosome 14, is associated with tumorigenesis. However, the role of miR-624 in human hepatocarcinogenesis is still unclear. Herein, our results indicate that miR-624 accelerates the growth of liver cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the modification distribution of H3K9me1 on chromosomes is different between rLV group and rLV-miR-624 group. miR-624 affects epigenetic regulation of several genes in human liver cancer cells, such as RAB21, SMARCD3, MAPK6,PRRX1, ZFHX3, EMC3 (TMEM111). Furthermore, miR-624 affects transcriptome of some genes in liver cancer, including RAB21, UBE2N, PPP1CC,KPNA3, RAB7A,CPEB2,KLF4, MARK2, JUN, ARF6, TMEM39A. On the other hand, miR-624 affects proteome of several genes in liver cancer, such as, RBM5,PTK2, KDM2A,POLR2H, POLR2G, CDK6,KIF15,CUL2,FKBP2,ErbB-3,JUN, PKM2, CyclinE,PLK1, mTOR, PPAR gamma, Rab7A,ARAF, UPF3B ,PTEN, SUZ12, GADD45, H3.3, CUL5, ARF6,EMC3,ATG4B,ATG14,CALR. Interestingly, miR-624 affects the RAB7A interaction network in liver cancer cells, involving in CLTC,ITGB1,HNRNPU, DARS1, RPS16, CTPS1, H3-3B,JUN,MYH10, CUL5, CPSF7. Strikingly, excessive MEC3 abrogates the carcinogenic functions of miR-624. Importantly, our findings indicate that miR-624 affects some signaling pathway in liver cancer, including Wnt signaling pathway,Hippo signaling pathway,mTOR signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway,MAPK signaling pathway,PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, erbB signaling pathway. These results provide a basis for the treatment of human liver cancer.

AB  - Simple Summary The detailed descriptions of immature stages of Lachnaeus crinitus Schoenherr, 1826, Rhinocyllus alpinus Gultekin, Diotti and Caldara, 2019 and R. conicus (Frolich, 1792), belonging to the Lixini (Curculionidae: Lixinae), are very important for an increased understanding of the relationship between the species and of the taxonomic and phylogenetic value of the tribes and genera in the Lixinae. The complex of these new data has allowed us to support that (1) Lachnaeus and Rhinocyllus are two valid genera that are different from Larinus, (2) Rhinocyllini is not a tribe different from Lixini, and (3) the separation of Rhinocyllus into two subgenera is rational. In the tribe Lixini, these new data may have an important role, because Rhinocyllus conicus and several other species of the genera Lixus and Larinus have a practical or at least potential use as biological control agents against invasive and noxious weeds. Mature larvae and pupae of Lachnaeus crinitus Schoenherr, 1826 and Rhinocyllus alpinus Gultekin, Diotti and Caldara, 2019 and pupae of R. conicus (Frolich, 1792), belonging to the Lixini (Curculionidae: Lixinae), are morphologically described for the first time. They possess all the characters considered distinctive in the immature stages of this tribe and are distinguishable from all the related genera by a combination of some characters (e.g., presence of endocarina, shape of premental sclerite; the number of pds on the abdominal segments; size and presence of urogomphi). It is emphasized that the controversial tribe Rhinocyllini is not supported by the characters of the larvae and pupae of Rhinocyllus and that the two subgenera of this genus, Rhinocyllus s. str. and Rhinolarinus, are separable from each other not only by characters of the adult but also distinctive characters of the larvae and pupae. These results confirm that the morphology of the immature stages, which is usually overlooked, can be very important for the purpose of identifying new characters that are useful for clarifying taxonomical and phylogenetic complex situations based only on the study of the imagoes.

AB  - Two formulations of permethrin EC termiticide were evaluated for depth of penetration into sandy-loam soil following by-the-label aqueous applications to the soil surface. The termiticide formulations were the same, except one formulation contained finely powdered cellulose and the other did not. Formulations were applied separately at 0.25% and 0.50% a.i. and allowed 7 to 9 days to disperse into the soil before samples were extracted and a.i. residues from various depths near the soil surface determined. Residue analyses for both formulations determined that 100% of a.i. recovered was contained in the top 5.1 cm of soil. Residues in the top 1.3 cm of soil were 95.2 to 96.9% of a.i. recovered. In the top 5.1 cm of soil, residue of permethrin plus powdered cellulose formulation applied at 0.50% was significantly greater than permethrin without cellulose additive.

AB  - Many animals, including many arachnids, return to an established "home" after an active period. Although desert-adapted solifuges shelter from the sun in retreats, it is unknown if these solifuges "home" to and re-use the same retreats over multiple consecutive periods. We sought to investigate whether individual solifuges exhibit site fidelity (philopatry) and could be found repeatedly within the same small geographic area using a simple mark-and-recapture study design. Over the course of the seven-day study period, nine of 46 solifuges were recaptured once, and two were recaptured a second time, with an average of 4.17 m between encounters. This rate of recapture is suggestive that solifuges remain in or return to the same geographic area over some period of time - a prerequisite for homing behavior. Further investigation is warranted to establish if solifuges are repeatedly using the same retreats, and if so, how they are navigating during homing.

AB  - We document for the first time the larval food plants of Anoncia mosa Hodges (Cosmopterigidae) mining the leaves of Collinsia heterophylla and C. tinctoria (Lamiales: Plantaginaceae) in Madera County, California. We describe and illustrate the mine, larval feeding habits, last instar larva and pupa of Anoncia mosa, then compare the immature stages to other Cosmopterigidae to help identify this species and call attention to some overlooked morphological characters. These include the larval P seta, larval cuticular texture and the genital opening of the pupa in a pit. We partially describe the previously unknown pupa of Euclemensia. We also use characters of the immature stages to briefly discuss the systematic placement of three taxa. The family status of the Chrysopeleiidae and the inclusion of Triclonella in the Cosmopterigidae are supported by the pupa but not the larva. Conversely, the systematic placement of Metharmostis in Cosmopterigidae is better supported by the larva than the pupa. Our study is an example of the need to save larval and pupal exuviae for morphological descriptions.

AB  - Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) is a highly polyphagous herbivore with more than 300 known host plants. The high polyphagy has created logistical challenges for understanding its population dynamics. I hypothesized that the primary food resource of this species can be characterized simply, cutting across the multiple host plant species, and enabling a simpler understanding of its population dynamics. The food resource was defined as the apical buds and meristematic tissue and terminal flowers and young seeds. Adult abundance in a habitat was related to the relative abundance of food in the habitat, abundance on a host plant stem was related to the amount of food resource on the stem, and the rate of emigration was lower from host plant patches with higher amounts of food resources. These results suggest that the population dynamics of L. lineolaris depends less on the identity of the host plants and more on the amount of food resource the various host plant species provide.

AB  - Fasciola hepatica is a foodborne zoonotic parasite causing significant economic losses and impacting human and livestock health in resource-limited regions. We developed a rapid, reliable, and sensitive detection method combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with CRISPR/Cas12a, allowing visualization with the naked eye or a fluorescence reader. Multiple visual methods were used to analyze the assay results. Fluorescence signals were collected using a fluorescence reader or observed under UV or blue light. Lateral flow strips (LFS) were used for visual detection. Among seven primer pairs and three CRISPR RNA (crRNA) screened, F1/R1 and crRNA3 were optimal. The Cas12a reaction buffer was optimized with 50 mM Tris-HCl and 80 mM NaCl, with an RPA reaction time of 20 min. The assay showed high specificity and excellent sensitivity for F. hepatica, detecting 0.122 copies/mu L with fluorescence and 8.6 copies/mu L with LFS. Testing of 143 sheep and 43 human fecal samples showed 98.39 % consistency with qPCR and nested PCR, with prevalence rates of 52.45 % and 18.6 % in sheep and humans, respectively. Our assay offers substantial potential for point-of-care testing in resource-limited areas, addressing the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of F. hepatica.

AB  - L-Theanine is a crucial secondary metabolite in tea and positively determines the potential quality and health benefits of tea products. Previous work found that the content of L-theanine decreased during the withering process, although the specific mechanism is still unknown. Here, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed based on transcriptome data obtained previously. The key hydrolysis gene CsPDX2.1 in L-theanine metabolism and seven candidate transcription factors were screened out. Among these transcription factors, CsWRKY40 displayed the strongest activation on the CsPDX2.1 promoter (373.18-fold) by binding to the W box element, based on dual luciferase assay and EMSA results. The CsWRKY40 protein was located in the nucleoplasm, whereas CsPDX2.1 was found in both the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Analysis of withering, water-retention, and water-loss treatments confirmed that water loss from tea leaves was the critical factor that affected ABA and L-theanine contents by activating the expression of CsWRKY40 and CsPDX2.1. Our results provide a new insight into the regulatory mechanism of L-theanine hydrolysis metabolism.

AB  - Frmpd3 (FERM and PDZ Domain Containing 3), a scaffold protein potentially involved in excitatory synaptic function, has not been thoroughly characterized in terms of its expression and functional role in vivo. Here, we investigated the distribution of Frmpd3 in the central nervous system and its potential regulatory role in epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by disrupted excitatory-inhibitory balance. The distribution of Frmpd3 throughout the mouse brain was investigated by immunofluorescence. Western blotting was conducted to examine potential alterations in Frmpd3 protein expression in the hippocampus of a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced chronic epilepsy model. Using stereotaxic techniques, we delivered Frmpd3 siRNA-AAV9 into the hippocampal CA1 region to achieve targeted protein knockdown. Then, the functional consequences of Frmpd3 depletion were assessed through behavioral observations and electrophysiological recordings in PTZ-treated mice. Finally, protein-protein interactions were investigated using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed Frmpd3 expression in cortical, hypothalamic, cerebellar, and hippocampal neurons of adult mice. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated predominant distribution of Frmpd3 in the excitatory postsynaptic density (PSD) of hippocampal CA1 neurons, with additional expression in inhibitory neurons. Quantitative analysis showed significantly elevated Frmpd3 protein levels in the hippocampus of PTZ-induced epileptic mice compared to controls. Frmpd3 knockdown in the CA1 region resulted in the following: (1) reduced seizure frequency, (2) prolonged seizure latency, and (3) decreased incidence of PTZ-induced generalized seizures. Local field potential (LFP) recordings demonstrated that seizure amplitude tended to be reduced, and epileptic discharge durations tended to be shorter in Frmpd3-depleted mice compared to controls. Furthermore, we observed decreased membrane expression of the AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit in the hippocampus of Frmpd3 knockdown mice. Molecular interaction studies revealed that Frmpd3 forms complexes with glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP) and GluA2. Our findings identify Frmpd3 as a novel regulatory scaffold protein that modulates epileptic susceptibility through molecular interactions with GRIP and GluA2. The underlying mechanism appears to involve Frmpd3-mediated regulation of GluA2 trafficking from the cytoplasm to the membrane, ultimately enhancing neuronal excitability through increased membrane expression of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors.

AB  - Ovaustra aurantia Tetley, Glatz & Fagan-Jeffries, gen. et sp. nov. (Mesostoinae) is described from Kangaroo Island. South Australia, Australia, and is a solitary, koinobiont, egg-larval parasitoid of the enigma moth, Aenigmatinea glatzella Kristensen & Edwards, 2015, in the monotypic family Aenigmatineidae Kristensen & Edwards, 2015 (Lepidoptera). Female parasitoids oviposit into the eggs of A. glatzella soon after female moths place them beneath minute adpressed leaves at the growing foliar tips of the larval host plant Callitris gracilis R.T. Baker (Cupressaceae). Adult parasitoids emerge from A. glatzella larval chambers located directly beneath the bark of small branches, some way from the growing tip. Adults can be seen on or near foliage of C. gracillis primarily during October and coinciding with the presence of adult host moths. Morphological and preliminary molecular evidence place Ovaustra Glatz, Fagan-Jeffries & Tetley, gen. nov. within Mesostoinae s.l. and indicate that its closest relatives are likely to reside within a group of genera from Australia and New Zealand whose hosts and biology are not well defined but are apparently quite broad, including lepidopteran, coleopteran and dipteran larvae, as well as primary plant gall induction.

AB  - Information regarding the species composition and dispersal flight season of termites is crucial for termite management. The major obstacles to collecting such information are a lack of access to private buildings and shortage of workers to monitor and report on termite swarming. To overcome these difficulties, we launched a citizen science project in which members of the public and pest management professionals were invited to collect termite samples. We created the website, Taiwan Termite Identification Service, on which populace could log the collection information, and ship termite samples to our laboratory for identification. We also established a Facebook group, called the "Termite Forum," to publicize this project. A total of 3024 samples were collected from 2015 to 2020, and we identified the species of >93% of the samples. Based on 1499 samples collected from buildings, five structural termite pests were identified, and species composition in each county of Taiwan is available. According to 844 dispersal flight events, termite dispersal flight timing peak and degree of centralization were estimated using a Gaussian model. The collected data demonstrated that the invasive termite species, Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), continued northward expansion. The first intercepted alate of Schedorhinotermes sp. (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) indicated that it may be a new invasive pest from Southeast Asia. This study reports on a successful case of a citizen science project where urban pest data were collected on a national scale.

AB  - Lutzomyia longipalpis is known as one of the primary insect vectors of visceral leishmaniasis. For such ectothermic organisms, the ambient temperature is a critical life factor. However, the impact of temperature has been ignored in many induced-stress situations of the vector life. Therefore, this study explored the interaction of Lu. longipalpis with temperature by evaluating its behaviour across a thermal gradient, thermographic recordings during blood-feeding on mice, and the gene expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) when insects were exposed to extreme temperature or infected. The results showed that 72 h after blood ingestion, Lu. longipalpis became less active and preferred relatively low temperatures. However, at later stages of blood digestion, females increased their activity and remained at higher temperatures. Real-time imaging showed that the body temperature of females can adjust rapidly to the host and remain constant until the end of blood-feeding. Insects also increased the expression of HSP90(83) during blood-feeding. Our findings suggest that Lu. longipalpis interacts with temperature by using its behaviour to avoid temperature-induced physiological damage during the gonotrophic cycle. However, the expression of certain HSP might be triggered to mitigate thermal stress in situations where a behavioural response is not the best option.

AB  - Taste receptor type 1 subunit 3 (T1R3) is a G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the TAS1R3 gene that can be specifically activated by certain sweeteners or umami agents for sweet/umami recognition. T1R3 is a potential target for regulating male reproduction. However, studies on the impact of non-nutritive sweeteners on reproduction are limited. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of the non-nutritive sweeteners (saccharin sodium, sucralose and acesulfame-K) on testosterone synthesis in testicular Leydig cells of Xiang pigs by comparing the relative abundance of mRNA transcripts and protein expression of T1R3, steroidogenic related factors, and intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), protein kinase A (PKA), as well as testosterone levels using Western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To clarify the specific mechanism, a dual luciferase assay was used to uncover the relationship between the transcription factors and steroidogenic enzyme. The acute intratesticular injection of a typical non-nutritive sweeteners was conducted to verify this impact in mouse. The results showed that saccharin sodium not only enhanced T1R3 expression in Leydig cells of Xiang pigs, but also caused significant increases in testosterone, cAMP, PKA, phosphorylation of specificity protein 1 (p-SP1), total protein of specificity protein 1 (SP1), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and 3(3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (3(3-HSD1) (P < 0.05). Similarly, treatment of Leydig cells with sucralose and acesulfame-K also increased testosterone level, protein expression of T1R3, 17-a-hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase (CYP17A1), and 3 (3- HSD1 (P < 0.05). Treatment with SQ22536 (an adenylate cyclas inhibitor) or H89 (a PKA inhibitor) significantly reduced saccharin sodium-induced protein levels of p-SP1, StAR, CYP17A1, and 3(3-HSD1 (P < 0.05). In addition, a dual luciferase assay further demonstrated that SP1 significantly increased the promoter activity of CYP17A1 (P < 0.05). When mouse testes were injected with saccharin sodium, T1R3, p-SP1, CYP17A1, and 3(3-HSD1 were upregulated, leading to a significant testicular increase in testosterone and cAMP levels (P < 0.05). These results suggest a mechanism by which the taste receptor T1R3 regulates testosterone production, and this mechanism may be linked to the cAMP-PKA pathway. Understanding the interrelationship between T1R3 and the cAMPPKA-SP1 pathway contributes to clarify the regulatory mechanisms of male reproduction.

AB  - The lower group of subterranean termites, Coptotermes gestroi (C. gestroi), and the higher groups, Globitermes sulphureus (G. sulphureus) and Macrotermes gilvus (M. gilvus), were bait treated in a no-choice laboratory bioassay using multiple active ingredients (chlorfluazuron, hexaflumuron, and bistrifluron) in Chitin Synthesis Inhibitor (CSI) baits in individual separated petri dishes. The mortality rate for each sample group was observed daily for four weeks. After one week of bait introduction, the record showed the acceleration of mortality rate in M. gilvus, followed by C. gestroi and G. sulphureus. Within four treatment weeks, C. gestroi and M. gilvus reached the complete mortality. The Tukey's post-hoc test revealed the significant differences between the mortality rate of G. sulphureus and those of C. gestroi and M. gilvus in response to chlorfluazuron and bistrifluron (p < 0.01). No significant differences in the mortality rate were observed among these three termite species when hexaflumuron was used. Additionally, the observation of the feeding activity indicated significant differences among all species in response to hexaflumuron and bistrifluron (p < 0.01). As for the case of chlorfluazuron, the feeding activity of G. sulphureus and M. gilvus under the treatment of this substance did not show any significant difference. The correlation analysis further revealed that both the study variables were distantly related. In conclusion, the mortality rates of the three termite species tested in this study were recorded after four weeks of CSI-bait bioassay.

AB  - Many attentions have been previously focused to identify the multiple biochemical components related to tea quality and health benefits, however, the natural variation of biochemical components present in tea germplasm has not been adequately evaluated. In this study, the main biochemical components, leaf morphological and yield characteristics were evaluated for four rounds of tea leaves in a panel of 87 elite tea cultivars suitable for black, green, or oolong tea. Significant variations were observed among the tea cultivars, as well as seasonal differ-ences in the levels of the free amino acid (FAA), caffeine (CAF), tea polyphenols (TP), water extract (WE) and TP to FAA ratio (TP/FAA). Results showed that the average levels of FAA showed a seasonal change, with the highest level of 4.0% in the 1st spring tea in the cultivars suitable for green tea and the lowest of 3.2% in summer tea in the cultivars suitable for black tea. The average CAF content was highest 3.2% in the cultivars suitable for oolong tea in the 1st spring and the lowest 2.5% in the cultivars suitable for green tea in summer. Limited seasonal and varietal variations were noticed in the average levels of WE among the three categories of tea. In addition, significant natural variation of the morphological characteristics, bud length varying from 2.5 cm to 8.7 cm, bud density from 190.3 buds & BULL; m-2 to 1730.3 buds & BULL; m-2, mature leaves biomass from 128.4 kg & BULL; hm-2 to 2 888.4 kg & BULL; hm-2, and yield component traits of 100 buds (one bud with two leaves) dry weight from 3.7 g to 37.7 g, tea yield/round from 444.6 kg & BULL; hm-2 to 905.3 kg & BULL; hm-2, were observed. The aim of our evaluation was not only to identify the advantages of seasonal and clonal variations but also to provide a new viewpoint for their further application. Representative accessions were selected from the germplasm to promote the establishment of an inherent biochemical constituent expressing the quality of black, green, and oolong tea. The findings might be utilized to establish early selection criteria to enhance the tea breeding and production program.

AB  - This paper presents the possibility of valorization of animal manure (camel and cow) by mixing it with agroindustrial biomass (cotton stalk and rapeseed oil cake) to produce pellets for use in power generation processes. Feedstocks were mixed in specific proportions based on certain assumptions concerning the energy and mechanical parameters of pellets. The assessment concerned both the combustion behavior as well as mechanical properties of four types of pellets derived from blends of animal manure and agro-industrial biomass. Thermogravimetry (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) techniques are applied to analyze the reaction areas, characteristic temperatures as well as heat flow rates of raw materials and their blends. Results showed that addition of agro-industrial biomass (even 10%) to animal manure changed the specific combustion parameters: initiation and burn-out temperature and combustion time. For blends of cow manure (COM) and rapeseed oil cake (ROC), a reduction in the initiation temperature was achieved compared to the combustion of raw cow manure, and the combustion time increased by 1/3. In the case of camel manure (CAM) with the addition of cotton stalk (CS) the burn-out temperature and combustion time decreased.
   The addition of agro-biomass also causes a change in the heat release profiles, for the blends no pronounced DSC peaks are obtained in the area of devolatilization as it happens animal manure alone and in the area of fixed carbon combustion as for cotton stalk and rapeseed oil cake. The heat released from camel manure blends was 9.2-9.3 kJ/kg and from cow manure blends 10.2-10.4 kJ/kg.
   An evaluation of the physical and mechanical properties showed that all types of pellets at a moisture content of 10-15% have a similar drop strength in the range of 80-85%, while this strength decreases to 40-60% after the pellets have absorbed water.

AB  - This study discusses the smelting behaviors of chromium-bearing vanadium titanomagnetite pellets (CVTP) with TiO2 additions. The results show that the softening start temperature T-10% increases from 1148 degrees C to 1215 degrees C, and the softening end temperature T-40% increases from 1280 degrees C to 1336 degrees C. The melting start temperature T-S increases from 1318 degrees C to 1352 degrees C and the dripping temperature T-D decreases from 1558 degrees C to 1505 degrees C. The primary phases of slag are (Ti0.7V0.3)(2)O-3, (Mg0.6Ti2.4)O-5, MgSiO3, and MgTi2O5, and the equilibrium phases calculated by FactSage 7.0 verify the primary phases. The titanium-vanadium compound as an intermediate reactant is generated at the interface of pig iron and slag. The FT-IR results show the depolymerization of slag, which results in the improvement of the softening-melting behaviors.

AB  - Pieris brassicae (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), commonly known as the cabbage butterfly, is a major herbivorous pest causing significant damage to Brassica crops, which are widely cultivated for edible parts and economic uses such as oilseed production. Conventional chemical-based pest control methods pose risks to environmental and human health, prompting interest in sustainable alternatives like biological control using parasitoids. This study evaluated crop damage by P. brassicae larvae and the potential of the larval parasitoid Cotesia vestalis (Haliday, 1834) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in managing pest populations. Larvae and fertilized eggs of P. brassicae were collected and reared on four host diets (cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, and generic brassica) under controlled laboratory conditions. Larval growth, feeding behavior, and development were assessed, along with a feeding index for dietary efficiency. Parasitisation was introduced by exposing larvae to adult C. vestalis, and host-parasitoid interactions were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and regression models. Results revealed that larvae had the highest feeding preference and weight gain on brassica, while turnip-fed larvae consumed the least. Parasitisation by C. vestalis significantly suppressed larval development, with a strong correlation between parasitisation rates and reduced host fitness. These findings highlight C. vestalis as a promising biological control agent for P. brassicae, offering an effective and eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides. Further research should focus on optimizing C. vestalis mass-rearing protocols and release strategies tailored to diverse Brassica cropping systems to promote sustainable pest management.

AB  - The Mexican soybean weevil, Rhyssomatus nigerrimus Fahraeus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a pest of soybeans. In this study we evaluate the volatiles of the soybean flower of the varieties FT-Cristalina-RCH and Flores as possible attractants for R. nigerrimus. Behavioral bioassays using an "Y" tube olfactometer and Electroantennography tests were performed to evaluate the responses of R. nigerrimus to the soybean flowers and their volatile extracts, in addition the volatiles were collected by dynamic aeration and identified using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Bioassays showed that females and males were attracted by the flowers and volatile extracts of flowers of both varieties. However, females exhibited stronger antennal response than males to the volatile extracts of flowers of both varieties and their synthetic blends. The volatile extracts analysis showed the presence of 1-octen-3-one, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, limonene, alpha-copaene, alpha-pinene, undecane, nonanal, octyl hexanoate, trans-alpha-bergamotene and calamanene. Quantitative differences in 1-octen-3-one, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, alpha-pinene and limonene between the varieties were observed. In bioassays, males and females were attracted by alpha-copaene, 1-octen-3-ol alpha-pinene, and both synthetic blends. Females exhibited stronger antennal response than males to the synthetic compounds alpha-pinene, alpha-copaene, 1-octen-3-ol, nonanal and limonene.

AB  - The Asian subterranean termite Coptotermes gestroi is a worldwide structural pest, although its reproductive biology has been poorly investigated due to a cryptic habit and occurrence of polycalic nests. In this study, we investigated ovarian development and oogenesis in different-aged females of C. gestroi: fourth-instar nymphs, non-functional neotenics, alates, and functional queens. We show that the ovaries develop gradually according to their age and functionality, as younger individuals possess immature oocytes, whereas alates and functional queens always undergo vitellogenesis. Oocytes were classified into previtellogenic (stages I, II, and III) or vitellogenic (stages IV, V, and VI). Ovary development varied among non-functional neotenics, and a rapid differentiation and/or the presence of primary reproductives are believed to influence such a maturation. Immature oocyte stages were shared between fourth-instar nymphs and neotenics. These characteristics, together with other neotenic features (wing buds, body pigmentation, and eye color), should be evaluated in detail aiming to clarify which nymphal instars differentiate into secondary reproductives. Oogenesis was not uniform among alate females, and cross-sectional area of terminal oocytes was significantly smaller in alates when compared to functional queens, suggesting different degrees of maturation in swarming individuals. Functional queens always had mature terminal oocytes (stage VI). Ovariole number and oocyte maturation in C. gestroi relies on several factors and may therefore differ among individuals of the same caste. Future studies should take into account these reproductive features to evaluate how they impact colony development.

AB  - Eogystia hippophaecolus Hua, Chou, Fang et Chen (Lepidoptera: Cossidae) is a notorious carpenterworm pest of sea buckthorn, Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Elaeagnaceae). Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are thought to be responsible for initial biochemical recognition during olfactory perception by the insect. We examined the structure, function, and expression profiles of these proteins in four structures (e.g., antennae, labipalp, legs, and external genitalia) of male adults. Molecular weight, isoelectric point, hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of proteins, and signal peptide prediction of 18 E. hippophaecolus CSPs (EhipCSPs) were investigated via software. Expression profiles in the four male structures were analyzed by fluorescence quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Bioinformatics analysis showed that most EhipCSPs are low-molecular-weight proteins with hydrophobic regions and a high proportion of alpha-helices, consistent with the general characteristics of insect CSPs. Eight EhipCSPs (EhipCSP2, EhipCSP5, EhipCSP7, and EhipCSP1317) were predominantly expressed in the labipalp (P < 0.01), and three (EhipCSP6, EhipCSP8, and EhipCSP9) were predominantly expressed in legs (P < 0.01). We speculate that these proteins may be related to contact sensations, host recognition, and other functions. Two EhipCSPs (EhipCSP4 and EhipCSP11) were highly expressed in the external genitalia (P < 0.01), suggesting that they may be involved in spousal positioning or mating activities. Most EhipCSPs were differentially expressed in the four structures, with wide overall expression, indicating an important role in olfactory recognition in multiple tissues. Our findings establish the foundation for further investigation of EhipCSPs and potential development of nonpesticide control measures.

AB  - Huanglongbing (HLB) is a systemic plant disease caused by 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas)' and transmitted by Diaphorina citri. D. citri acquires the CLas bacteria in the nymph stage and transmits it in the adult stage, indicating that molting from the nymph to adult stages is crucial for HLB transmission. However, the available D. citri reference genomes are incomplete, and gene function studies have been limited to date. In the current research, PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and Illumina sequencing were performed to investigate the transcriptome of D. citri nymphs and adults. In total, 10,641 full-length, non-redundant transcripts (FLNRTs), 594 alternative splicing (AS) events, 4522 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), 1086 long-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 281 transcription factors (TFs), and 4459 APA sites were identified. Furthermore, 3746 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between nymphs and adults were identified, among which 30 DEGs involved in the Hippo signaling pathway were found. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) further validated the expression levels of 12 DEGs and showed a positive correlation with transcriptome data. Finally, the spatiotemporal expression pattern of genes involved in the Hippo signaling pathway exhibited high expression in the D. citri testis, ovary, and egg. Silencing of the D. citri transcriptional co-activator (DcYki) gene significantly increased D. citri mortality and decreased the cumulative molting. Our results provide useful information and a reliable data resource for gene function research of D. citri.

AB  - The spotted amber ladybird, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), is known to be a potent predator of aphids, psyllids, whiteflies, mealybugs, and some butterfly species. This ladybeetle overwinters in the diapausing adult stage. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of diapause on the energy resources and cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of the female ladybeetle, specifically comparing the changes in glycogen, lipid, and protein contents, and CHCs profile of diapausing and non-diapausing adults. In this study, gas chromatography-mass was used to analyze whole-body extracts of the beetles. Results showed no significant differences between the amount of glycogen, lipid, and protein contents of diapausing and non-diapausing ladybeetle. The CHCs profile of H. variegata consisted of 24 hydrocarbons categorized into 2 groups: linear aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) and methyl-branched hydrocarbons (17 molecules), as well as unsaturated cyclic compounds (7 molecules). The n-alkanes, with 14 compounds, were identified as the primary constituents of the CHCs of the ladybeetle. Six molecules were common to non-diapausing and diapausing beetles, 5 were exclusive to non-diapausing beetles, and 13 were exclusive to diapausing beetles. Moreover, we noted a significant difference in the quantity and quality of CHCs between diapausing and non-diapausing beetles, with diapausing beetles synthesizing more CHCs with longer chains. This disparity in CHC profiles was concluded to be an adaptation of H. variegata to survive harsh environmental conditions during diapause.

AB  - A new apionine genus and species, Diselmobius lechi, is described from Tasmania, based on four females collected on the Cupressaceae Diselma archeri Hooker in Cradle and Field Mountains. It represents the fourth distinct apionine lineage in the fauna of Australia, being compared with the Australian Rhinorhynchidius Voss and New Zealand Strobilobius Kuschel, both associated with the gymnosperm family Cupressaceae. Due to unknown male characters, the tribal placement of Diselmobius within Apioninae remains uncertain.

AB  - Reticulitermes flavipes is the most invasive species in its genus and is responsible for causing significant damage to human structures in areas where it has been introduced. Although it has already become established in Chile and Uruguay, it had not previously been reported in Argentina. In this study, we report the first detection of this species in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. The colony was already producing alates, and species identification was confirmed through both morphology and mitochondrial gene 16S rRNA analysis. Our results, while not conclusive, suggest that this introduction was independent from the one that occurred in Chile and Uruguay, and potentially originated from the United States. The detection of R. flavipes in Argentina is significant because it highlights the potential for this species to establish itself in new regions and underscores the need for future research on and control of R. flavipes in this country.

AB  - Dairy products from ovine milk are very popular in the Mediterranean countries and are gaining a large portion of the market in EU countries and worldwide. EU legislation permits the dairy processing of raw ovine milk under certain conditions. To study the ecology and prevalence of E. coli in raw ewes' milk and assess thus the public health risk, samples of milk were taken from 75 different sheep farms in the rural area of Epirus, Greece. The initial sampling was conducted in clinically healthy animals which were noted as controls (group A). From the same farms, samples were taken from animals with clinical mastitis and before treatment (group B). For therapeutic purposes, to some animals, a combination of penicillin and streptomycin was administrated (group C1), or tetracycline (group C2), or enrofloxacin (group C3). Finally, samples of raw milk were taken from the C groups, on the first day after the withdrawal period of the antibiotics used, when the milk is permitted to enter the food chain. In total, 97 isolates of Escherichia coli were recovered from all groups. Analysis revealed an impressive increase in E. coli strains in the milk of group B (39.33%) with respect to group A (5%). Even after treatment, although the prevalence was decreased, it was still found to be higher in the C groups than group A. E. coli O157:H7 strains absent from group A were detected in all other groups in relatively low occurrence rates with respect to other "O" serotypes but non-O157:H7 strains. Virulence factors such as the production of toxins (32.60% for serotoxin 1 and 18.47% for serotoxin 2) and hemolysin (42.39%) as well as biofilm formation capacity (52.17% of the total) and ESDL production (43.47% of the total) were also studied. All strains were also tested for susceptibility against 12 antibiotics by the MIC method and the results showed a high prevalence of resistance and multi-resistance. The presence of various resistant strains to antibiotics and pathogenic "O" serotype strains in the milk when it can enter the food chain again is an alarming conclusion.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to the complexity of the structure of African swine fever virus (ASFV), the structure and function of most viral encoded proteins are uncharacterized. A full understanding and identification of ASFV-coding proteins is conducive to the prevention and control of ASFV. In this study, a previously uncharacterized protein, MGF_110-13L, was identified as an immunogenic protein and expressed as a glycosylated homodimer in eukaryotic cells. Two monoclonal antibodies against MGF_110-13L were generated, and two linear epitopes were further identified using monoclonal antibodies. One epitope peptide was evaluated as a potential antigen for ASFV antibody detection. This study will provide a basis for further understanding the structure and function of the MGF_110-13L protein of ASFV.Abstract African swine fever caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an acute, highly contagious swine disease with high mortality. To facilitate effective vaccine development and find more serodiagnostic targets, fully exploring the ASFV antigenic proteins is urgently needed. In this study, the MGF_110-13L was identified as an immunodominant antigen among the seven transmembrane proteins. The main outer-membrane domain of MGF_110-13L was expressed and purified. Two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; 8C3, and 10E4) against MGF_110-13L were generated. The epitopes of two mAbs were preliminary mapped with the peptide fusion proteins after probing with mAbs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. And the two target epitopes were fine-mapped using further truncated peptide fusion protein strategy. Finally, the core sequences of mAbs 8C3 and 10E4 were identified as 48WDCQDGICKNKITESRFIDS67, and 122GDHQQLSIKQ131, respectively. The peptides of epitopes were synthesized and probed with ASFV antibody positive pig sera by a dot blot assay, and the results showed that epitope 10E4 was an antigenic epitope. The epitope 10E4 peptide was further evaluated as a potential antigen for detecting ASFV antibodies. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antigenic epitope information on the antigenic MGF_110-13L protein of ASFV.

AB  - Neurosteroids and benzodiazepines are modulators of the GABA(A) receptors, thereby causing anxiolysis. Furthermore, benzodiazepines such as midazolam are known to cause adverse side-effects on cognition upon administration. We previously found that midazolam at nanomolar concentrations (10 nM) blocked long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we aim to study the effect of neurosteroids and their synthesis using XBD173, which is a synthetic compound that promotes neurosteroidogenesis by binding to the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), since they might provide anxiolytic activity with a favourable side-effect profile. By means of electrophysiological measurements and the use of mice with targeted genetic mutations, we revealed that XBD173, a selective ligand of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), induced neurosteroidogenesis. In addition, the exogenous application of potentially synthesised neurosteroids (THDOC and allopregnanolone) did not depress hippocampal CA1-LTP, the cellular correlate of learning and memory. This phenomenon was observed at the same concentrations that neurosteroids conferred neuroprotection in a model of ischaemia-induced hippocampal excitotoxicity. In conclusion, our results indicate that TSPO ligands are promising candidates for post-ischaemic recovery exerting neuroprotection, in contrast to midazolam, without detrimental effects on synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Recent studies on the regulatory networks implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) evince long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as crucial regulatory players, albeit a poor understanding of the mechanism. Analyzing differential gene expression in the RNA-seq data from the post-mortem AD brain hippocampus, we categorized a list of AD-dysregulated lncRNA transcripts into functionally similar communities based on their k-mer profiles. Using machine-learning-based algorithms, their subcellular localizations were mapped. We further explored the functional relevance of each community through AD-dysregulated miRNA, RNA-binding protein (RBP) interactors, and pathway enrichment analyses. Further investigation of the miRNA-lncRNA and RBP-lncRNA networks from each community revealed the top RBPs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs for each cluster. The experimental validation community yielded ELAVL4 and miR-16-5p as the predominant RBP and miRNA, respectively. Five lncRNAs emerged as the top-ranking candidates from the RBP/miRNA-lncRNA networks. Further analyses of these networks revealed the presence of multiple regulatory triads where the RBP-lncRNA interactions could be augmented by the enhanced miRNA-lncRNA interactions. Our results advance the understanding of the mechanism of lncRNA-mediated AD regulation through their interacting partners and demonstrate how these functionally segregated but overlapping regulatory networks can modulate the disease holistically.

AB  - The freezing stress during overwintering brings great challenges to the normal growth of Camellia sinensis. The current research on C. sinensis mainly focuses on cold resistance, but less on freezing resistance. In the present study, the transcriptome and metabolome of C. sinensis under freezing stress were studied. Results showed that Pyr/PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 played a critical role in the signal transduction of freezing stress. Three metabolic pathways including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis contributed to the freezing resistance of C. sinensis. This study provides substantial insights for the breeding of C. sinensis.
   Freezing stress in winter is the biggest obstacle to the survival of C. sinensis in mid-latitude and high-latitude areas, which has a great impact on the yield, quality, and even life of C. sinensis every year. In this study, transcriptome and metabolome were used to clarify the freezing resistance mechanism of 60-year-old natural overwintering C. sinensis under freezing stress. Next, 3880 DEGs and 353 DAMs were obtained. The enrichment analysis showed that pathways of MAPK and ABA played a key role in the signal transduction of freezing stress, and Pyr/PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 in the ABA pathway promoted stomatal closure. Then, the water holding capacity and the freezing resistance of C. sinensis were improved. The pathway analysis showed that DEGs and DAMs were significantly enriched and up-regulated in the three-related pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis. In addition, the carbohydrate and fatty acid synthesis pathways also had a significant enrichment, and the synthesis of these substances facilitated the freezing resistance. These results are of great significance to elucidate the freezing resistance mechanism and the freezing resistance breeding of C. sinensis.

   This manuscript presents a critical analysis of intraocular pressure (IOP) measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GIOP), the gold standard technique for the measurement of intraocular pressure, compared to measurements obtained by a pressure transducer inserted in the ocular anterior chamber (TIOP). Data showed significant differences between GIOP and TIOP, more evident for softer and thinner corneas and suggest GIOP should be corrected on the basis of corneal biomechanical parameters. This evidence is crucial for the detection and prevention of glaucoma as one of the main causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
   Glaucoma is the second cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a recognized major risk factor for the development and progression of glaucomatous damage. Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) is internationally accepted as the gold standard for the measurement of IOP. The purpose of this study was to search for correlations between Goldmann tonometry and corneal mechanical properties and thickness by means of in vitro tests. IOP was measured by the Goldmann applanation tonometer (GIOP), and by a pressure transducer inserted in the anterior chamber of the eye (TIOP), at increasing pressure levels by addition of saline solution in the anterior chamber of enucleated pig eyes (n = 49). Mechanical properties were also determined by inflation tests. The GAT underestimated the real measurements made by the pressure transducer, with most common differences in the range 15-28 mmHg. The difference between the two instruments, highlighted by the Bland-Altman test, was confirmed by ANOVA, normality tests, and Mann-Whitney's tests, both on the data arranged for infusions and for the data organized by pressure ranges. Pearson correlation tests revealed a negative correlation between (TIOP-GIOP) and both corneal stiffness and corneal thickness. In conclusion, data obtained showed a discrepancy between GIOP and TIOP more evident for softer and thinner corneas, that is very important for glaucoma detection.

AB  - Machadotermes is one of the basal Apicotermitinae genera, living in tropical West Africa. Old observations suggested the presence of a new gland, the intramandibular gland, in Machadotermes soldiers. Here, by combining micro-computed tomography, optical and electron microscopy, we showed that the gland exists in Machadotermes soldiers only as an active exocrine organ, consisting of numerous class III cells (bicellular units made of secretory and canal cells), within which the secretion is produced in rough endoplasmic reticulum, and modified and stored in Golgi apparatus. The final secretion is released out from the body through epicuticular canals running through the mandible cuticle to the exterior. We also studied three other Apicotermitinae, Indotermes, Duplidentitermes, and Jugositermes, in which this gland is absent. We speculate that the secretion of this gland may be used as a general protectant or antimicrobial agent. In addition, we observed that the frontal gland, a specific defensive organ in termites, is absent in Machadotermes soldiers while it is tiny in Indotermes soldiers and small in Duplidentitermes and Jugositermes soldiers. At last, we could also observe in all these species the labral, mandibular and labial glands, other exocrine glands present in all termite species studied so far.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Total polyphenol and total flavonoid assays were performed to characterize the rela-tionships between the color of Peucedanum japonicum (PJ) seed coat and stem and the content of phytochemical compounds. The samples were divided into two groups based on their stem and seed coat color, with each group containing 23 samples. The stem color group was subdivided into green, light red, and red, whereas the seed coat color group was divided into light brown, brown, and dark brown. In the stem color group, the light red stems exhibited the highest content of phytochemical compounds, with levels over 10% higher than those of the stems of the other colors. Moreover, among the top ten samples with the highest total polyphenol content, eight samples were light red, and the light red group also exhibited the highest total flavonoid content among the examined color groups. In terms of the seed coat color, the plants grown from dark brown seeds exhibited the highest contents of both total polyphenols and total flavonoids. In conclusion, PJ plants with dark brown seeds and light red stems contained the highest levels of phytochemical compounds. Collectively, our findings provide a valuable basis for future seed selection of PJ for pharmaceutical purposes.

AB  - The knee joint has long been considered a closed system. The pathological effects of joint diseases on distant organs have not been investigated. Herein, our clinical data showed that post-traumatic joint damage, combined with joint bleeding (hemarthrosis), exhibits a worse liver function compared with healthy control. With mouse model, hemarthrosis induces both cartilage degeneration and remote liver damage. Next, we found that hemarthrosis induces the upregulation in ratio and differentiation towards Th17 cells of CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood and spleen. Deletion of CD4(+) T cells reverses hemarthrosis-induced liver damage. Degeneration of cartilage matrix induced by hemarthrosis upregulates serological type II collagen (COL II), which activates CD4(+) T cells. Systemic application of a COL II antibody blocks the activation. Furthermore, bulk RNAseq and single-cell qPCR analysis revealed that the cartilage Akt pathway is inhibited by blood treatment. Intra-articular application of Akt activator blocks the cartilage degeneration and thus protects against the liver impairment in mouse and pig models. Taken together, our study revealed a pathological joint-liver axis mediated by matrikine-activated CD4(+) T cells, which refreshes the organ-crosstalk axis and provides a new treatment target for hemarthrosis-related disease.

AB  - Infection with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) leads to enzootic bovine leukosis, the most prevalent neoplastic disease in cattle. Due to the lack of commercially available vaccines, reliable eradication of the disease can be achieved through the testing and elimination of BLV antibody-positive animals. In this study, we developed a novel competitive ELISA (cELISA) to detect antibodies against BLV capsid protein p24. Recombinant p24 protein expressed by Escherichia coli, in combination with the monoclonal antibody 2G11 exhibiting exceptional performance, was used for the establishment of the cELISA. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 98.85 % and 98.13 %, respectively. Furthermore, the established cELISA was specific for detecting BLV-specific antibodies, without cross-reactivity to antisera for six other bovine viruses. Significantly, experimental infection of cattle and sheep with BLV revealed that the cELISA accurately monitors seroconversion. In a performance evaluation, the established cELISA displayed a high agreement with Western blotting and the commercial BLV gp51 cELISA kit in the detection of 242 clinical samples, respectively. In conclusion, the novel p24 cELISA exhibited the potential to be a reliable and efficient diagnostic tool for BLV serological detection with a broad application prospect.

AB  - In this paper, a fiber-optic biosensor with the structure of both Au film and Au nanoparticles (AuNps) co-modified on D-shaped photonic crystal fiber (PCF) by adhesion with polydopamine (PDA) is proposed and experimentally fabricated, where the electric field near the sensing surface is increased and thus the sensitivity is improved by coupling the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in Au film with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in Au nanoparticles (AuNps), D-shaped PCF as well as high refractive index of PDA. In addition, due to excellent adhesion and biocompatibility properties of PDA, an extra layer of PDA is modified on the surface of AuNps to anchor a layer of goat anti-rabbit IgG on it, which is a bioassay for rabbit IgG. The experimental results show that the sensor obtains a high sensitivity of 4301.49 nm/RIU in the refractive index (RI) range of 1.335 similar to 1.365, which is 2.4 times the RI sensitivity of the PCF-Au sensor. The bio-sensitivity of the sensor for rabbit IgG reaches 1.017 nm/(mu g/ml), and the limit of detection (LOD) is 0.019 mu g/ml. This sensitized fiber-optic biosensor based on the SPR-LSPR coupling effect has a potential application in clinical disease diagnosis and immunoassay.

AB  - Tea is one of the most popular beverages and its leaves are rich in catechins, contributing to the diverse flavor as well as beneficial for human health. However, the study of the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism affecting the synthesis of catechins remains insufficient. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome using PacBio sequencing technology and obtained 63,111 full-length high-quality isoforms, including 1302 potential novel genes and 583 highly reliable fusion transcripts. We also identified 1204 lncRNAs with high quality, containing 188 known and 1016 novel lncRNAs. In addition, 311 mis-annotated genes were corrected based on the high-quality Isoseq reads. A large number of alternative splicing (AS) events (3784) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) genes (18,714) were analyzed, accounting for 8.84% and 43.7% of the total annotated genes, respectively. We also found that 2884 genes containing AS and APA features exhibited higher expression levels than other genes. These genes are mainly involved in amino acid biosynthesis, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan biosynthesis, and pyruvate metabolism, suggesting that they play an essential role in the catechins content of tea polyphenols. Our results further improved the level of genome annotation and indicated that post-transcriptional regulation plays a crucial part in synthesizing catechins.

AB  - Axonal varicosities or swellings are enlarged structures along axon shafts and profoundly affect action potential propagation and synaptic transmission. These structures, which are defined by morphology, are highly heterogeneous and often investigated concerning their roles in neuropathology, but why they are present in the normal brain remains unknown. Combining confocal microscopy and cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) with in vivo and in vitro systems, we report that non-uniform mechanical interactions with the microenvironment can lead to 10-fold diameter differences within an axon of the central nervous system (CNS). In the brains of adult Thy1-YFP transgenic mice, individual axons in the cortex displayed significantly higher diameter variation than those in the corpus callosum. When being cultured on lacey carbon film-coated electron microscopy (EM) grids, CNS axons formed varicosities exclusively in holes and without microtubule (MT) breakage, and they contained mitochondria, multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and/or vesicles, similar to the axonal varicosities induced by mild fluid puffing. Moreover, enlarged axon branch points often contain MT free ends leading to the minor branch. When the axons were fasciculated by mimicking in vivo axonal bundles, their varicosity levels reduced. Taken together, our results have revealed the extrinsic regulation of the three-dimensional ultrastructures of central axons by the mechanical microenvironment under physiological conditions.

AB  - The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, is both an economically impactful pest and a successful invader. One method of subterranean termite control is baiting. According to the label, baits are installed surrounding the structure at a uniform interval distance of approximate to 3 m. However, homeowners and pest control professionals are often concerned that termites may bypass bait stations and have access to the structure. To address this concern, we experimentally duplicated feld conditions using a large planar arena (3.6 m x 1.1 m) to study the optimal distribution of bait stations based on colony-wide foraging activity. We installed 2 bait stations 3 m apart as per label instructions and introduced C. formosanus colonies to allow them to explore the arena by tunneling through the sand. In this real-scale arena, all termite colonies intercepted a bait station in an average of 21 (+/- 8 SD) days. We assumed that termites could fnd bait faster if there were more bait stations by overlaying additional hypothetical baits closer than per label instruction, but the improvement was incremental, requiring 4 times more stations (0.45 m interval) to obtain a signifcant difference. We also revealed the characteristic behavior after intercepting bait stations, termites created a burst of tunnels that radiated from the bait station. These branching tunnels averaged 16 cm in length, suggesting immediate interceptions of additional auxiliary stations placed within 16 cm of an active station. These fndings contribute to our understanding on how subterranean termites intercept inground bait stations

AB  - Spodoptera litura Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is one of the most destructive pests of various crops cultivated in Thailand. Spodoptera litura larvae, at early stages, attack the leaves and feed on every part of infested crops in later stages. Acorus calamus essential oil contains toxic asarones, which are generalistic cytotoxic compounds. However, the present study is the first attempt to look at safer metabolites from the rhizomes that could deter insect feeding. The objective was to use such compounds as safer residues on crops that would prevent the feeding of herbivorous lepidopterans. Accordingly, phenolic metabolites were isolated and evaluated to establish the feeding deterrence against polyphagous S. litura larvae. Methanol extract of A. calamus, chrysin, and 4-hydroxy acetophenone compounds were the most effective feeding deterrents with FD50 of 87.18, 10.33, and 70.77 mu g/cm(2), respectively, after 4 h of feeding on treated kale leaves in a no-choice leaf disc assay. Chrysin also reduced carboxylesterase activities (1.37-fold), whereas A. calamus methanol extract reduced glutathione-S-transferase activities (1.44-fold). Some larvae were also seen dead if they consumed the treated kale leaves. Feeding deterrent activity in the methanol extract of A. calamus was due to chrysin and 4-hydroxy acetophenone. The large-scale utilization of such compounds could help develop feeding deterrent strategies in the integrated pest management of lepidopterans.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is consequence of anesthesia and surgery that primarily affects older people. The prevention and treatment of POCD has drawn an increasing attention in recent decades. Here, we established the animal model mimicked POCD after femoral fracture surgery, and analyze the effect of acupuncture stimulation on postoperative cognitive function after femoral fracture surgery. Compared with the mock group, the cognitive function performance was significantly decreased both in the anaesthesia group and the surgery group, between which the symptoms were more severe in the surgery group. The peripheral inflammation response and the neuron impairment and inflammation response in the hippocampus were observed in the surgery group, but only peripheral inflammation response was detected in the anaesthesia group. These findings indicated the POCD was the synergistic outcome of anaesthesia and surgical stimulation but with different pathogenic mechanism. The surgery with mental tri-needles (surgery+MTN) group outperformed the surgery group in terms of cognitive function performance. The peripheral inflammation response and the neuron impairment and inflammation response in the hippocampus was significantly reduced by the electroacupuncture stimulation. Our findings indicated the protection of electroacupuncture form POCD after femoral fracture surgery is related to the inhibition of inflammation response and neuron impairment.

AB  - The necessity of the human hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe structures to semantic memory remains contentious. Impaired semantic memory following hippocampal lesions could arise either due to partially intertwined episodic memories and/or retrograde/anterograde effects. In this study, we tested amnesic individuals with lesions in hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (n = 7) and age-matched controls (n = 14) on their ability to precisely recall the dates of famous public events that occurred either before (i.e., pre-lifetime) or after participants ' birth date (lifetime). We show that deficits in dating precision are greatest for recent lifetime events, consistent with the notion that recent event memory may be particularly intertwined with episodic memory. At the same time, individuals with medial temporal lobe lesions showed more subtle impairments in their ability to date pre-birth and remote lifetime events precisely. Together, these findings suggest that the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe structures are important for representational precision of semantic memories regardless of their remoteness.

AB  - 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP), a typical nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is a developmental toxicant. This study was to evaluate gestational 1-NP-induced anxiety-like behavior in male adult offspring. Pregnant mice were orally administered to 1-NP daily throughout pregnancy. Anxiety-like behaviors, as determined by Elevated PlusMaze (EPM) and Open-Field Test (OFT), were showed in male adult offspring whose mothers were exposed to 1NP. Gestational 1-NP exposure reduced dendritic arborization, dendritic length and dendritic spine density in ventral hippocampus of male adult offspring. Additional experiments showed that gephyrin, an inhibitory synaptic marker, was reduced in fetal forebrain and hippocampus in male adult offspring. Nrg1 and Erbb4, two gephyrin-related genes, were reduced in 1-NP-exposed fetuses. Accordingly, 5hmC contents in two CpG sites (32008909 and 32009239) of Nrg1 gene and three CpG sites (69107743, 69107866 and 69107899) of Erbb4 gene were decreased in 1-NP-exposed fetuses. Mechanistically, ten-eleven translocation (TET) activity and alphaketoglutarate (alpha-KG) content were decreased in 1-NP-exposed fetal forebrain. Supplementation with alpha-KG alleviated 1-NP-induced downregulation of gephyrin-related genes, prevented hippocampal synaptic damage, and improved anxiety-like behavior in male adult offspring. These results indicate that early-life 1-NP exposure causes anxiety-like behavior in male adulthood partially by altering hippocampal epigenetic reprogramming of synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Considering that follicular development is an energy-dependent process, supplementation of the culture medium with energy substrates, such as lactose, would improve follicle viability and growth. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lactose on morphology, development, glutathione (GSH) concentration, mitochondrial activity, DNA fragmentation, and meiotic resumption of oocytes from sheep secondary follicles cultured in vitro. Secondary follicles were isolated from the cortex of ovine ovaries and cultured individually for 18 days in alpha-MEM supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA), insulin, glutamine, hypoxanthine, transferrin, selenium and ascorbic acid (control medium: alpha-MEM+) or in alpha-MEM+ plus different concentrations of lactose (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 M). After culture, some of the oocytes were subjected to TUNEL assay and in vitro maturation (IVM). Follicular morphology, glutathione (GSH) concentration and mitochondrial activity were evaluated at the end of the culture. At the day 18, the percentage of morphologically normal follicles was greater (P<0.05) in the treatment of 0.025 M lactose (92.5 %) compared to the control group (75.55 %). In addition, GSH concentrations increased (P<0.05) in treatment containing 0.025 M lactose compared to the other treatments. Furthermore, oocytes cultured in 0.025 M lactose had greater (P<0.05) mitochondrial activity levels than in alpha-MEM+ and 0.1 M lactose. The group alpha-MEM+ presented a increase of TUNEL-positive oocytes (35.09 %) compared to 0.025 lactose (9.09 %). The percentage of meiotic resumption was greater (P<0.05) in oocytes from secondary follicles cultured in 0.025 M lactose (54.5 %) than in alpha-MEM+ (45.5 %). In conclusion, 0.025 M lactose improved survival, GSH and active mitochondria levels and meiotic resumption of oocytes from in vitro cultured secondary follicles. Supplementation of the culture medium of preantral follicles with lactose can gradually provide energy to follicular cells, potentially enhancing the production of viable oocytes for biotechniques such as IVM and in vitro fertilization.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to study the effects of Cyfluthrin (Cy) exposure on neurobehaviour, hippocampal tissue and synaptic plasticity in Wistar rats. First, it was found that high-dose Cy exposure could cause nerve injury, resulting in symptoms such as deficits in learning and memory ability, spatial exploration and autonomic motor function. Moreover, it was found that medium- and high-dose Cy exposure could cause an abnormal release of the neurotransmitter Glu. Second, brain tissue pathology showed that the middle and high doses of Cy caused tissue deformation, reduced the number of hippocampal puramidal cells, caused a disorder of these cells, decreased the number of Nissl bodies, and caused pyknosis of the hippocampal cell nuclear membrane and serious damage to organelles, indicating that exposure to these doses of Cy may cause hippocampal tissue damage in rats. Third, as the exposure dose increased, morphological changes in hippocampal synapses, including blurred synaptic spaces, a decreased number of synaptic vesicles and a decreased number of synapses, became more obvious. Moreover, the expression levels of the key synaptic proteins PSD-95 and SYP also decreased in a dose-dependent manner, indicating obvious synaptic damage. Finally, the study found that medium and high doses of Cy could upregulate the expression of A(2A)R in the hippocampus and that the expression levels of inflammatory factors and apoptosis-related proteins increased in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the expression of A(2A)R mRNA was correlated with neurobehavioural indicators and the levels of inflammatory factors, synaptic plasticity-related factors and apoptosis-related factors, suggesting that Cy may cause nerve damage in rats and that this effect is closely related to A(2A)R.

AB  - Quantitative flux maps describing glycerolipid synthesis can be important tools for rational engineering of lipid content and composition in oilseeds. Lipid accumulation in cultured embryos of Camelina sativa is known to mimic that of seeds in terms of rate of lipid synthesis and composition. To assess the kinetic complexity of the glycerolipid flux network, cultured embryos were incubated with [C-14/C-13]glycerol, and initial and steady state rates of [C-14/(13)Cglyceryl] lipid accumulation were measured. At steady state, the linear accumulations of labeled lipid classes matched those expected from mass compositions. The system showed an apparently simple kinetic precursor-product relationship between the intermediate pool, dominated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), and the triacylglycerol (TAG) product. We also conducted isotopomer analyses on hydrogenated lipid class species. [(13)C(3)glyceryl] labeling of DAG and PC, together with estimates of endogenous [(12)C(3)glyceryl] dilution, showed that each biosynthetically active lipid pool is similar to 30% of the total by moles. This validates the concept that lipid sub-pools can describe lipid biosynthetic networks. By tracking the kinetics of [(13)C(3)glyceryl] and [(13)C(2)acyl] labeling, we observed two distinct TAG synthesis components. The major TAG synthesis flux (similar to 75%) was associated with >95% of the DAG/PC intermediate pool, with little glycerol being metabolized to fatty acids, and with little dilution from endogenous glycerol; a smaller flux exhibited converse characteristics. This kinetic heterogeneity was further explored using postlabeling embryo dissection and differential lipid extractions. The minor flux was tentatively localized to surface cells across the whole embryo. Such heterogeneity must be recognized in order to construct accurate gene expression patterns and metabolic networks describing lipid biosynthesis in developing embryos.

AB  - This study investigated the abundance of pro-regenerative growth factors in bone marrow-derived platelet-rich plasma (BM-PRP) and their effects on bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) and bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPC). Four 4-5 months-old domestic pigs were included, and each underwent bone marrow aspiration from its humerus bones and processed into bone marrow aspiration concentrate (BMAC) samples. The plasma and cellular portions of BMAC were subsequently separated and collected. The concentration of growth factors including BMP-2, PDGF-BB, TGF-beta 1 and VEGF in the plasma portion was measured and compared between BM-PRP and bone marrow-derived platelet-poor plasma (BM-PPP). It was found that platelet count was significantly higher in BM-PRP than in BM-PPP, but the concentration of above-mentioned growth factors was not significantly different between BM-PRP and BM-PPP. As most existing literature has indicated the regenerative potency of PRP, this study focused on assessing the effect of BM-PRP treatment on BM-MSC and BM-EPC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis capacity by comparing samples with 2.5% BM-PRP treatment and samples without BM-PRP treatment (control). In response to BM-PRP treatment, the cellular doubling time increased with culturing time and was significantly shorter in the BM-PRP-treated samples than in control samples. For osteogenic differentiation, BM-PRP-treated BM-MSCs demonstrated a time-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and expression levels of osteogenic differentiation markers. For the expression of angiogenic genes, none of the differences reached statistical significance despite a tendency of stronger expression at day 18 in BM-PRP-treated BM-EPCs. In conclusion, this in vitro study suggests that most BMP-2, PDGF-BB, TGF-beta 1 and VEGF-A contained in BM-PRP are not platelet-released and BM-PRP may have some stimulation (less than 1-fold) for MSC, EPC proliferation and MSC osteogenic differentiation.

AB  - Numerous byproducts resulting from chlorinated disinfection are constantly being generated during water treatment processes. The potential risks of these new emerging pollutions remain largely unknown. Here, we determined the risks of chlorinated disinfection byproducts of diazepam (DZP) in the cellular and zebrafish exposure experiments. The cytotoxicity of disinfection byproducts (MACB and MBCC) was greater than DZP in macrophage raw 264.7 cells at 10 mg/L. We further found that the effects of MBCC on the metabolism of glycine, serine, threonine and riboflavin were far greater than DZP by the targeted metabolomics methods. Moreover, MBCC significantly decreased the peak amplitude of neuronal action potential in primary embryonic rat (SpraguDawley SD) hippocampal neurons. We finally determined behavioral toxicity of DZP and byproducts in zebrafish larvae. MBCC significantly decreased the maximal swim-activity and peak duration of zebrafish after 72 h exposure. Altogether, these findings indicate the MBCC pose serious pressures on public health.

AB  - The hallmarks of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), an active and regulated process involving the creation of calcium nodules, lipoprotein accumulation, and chronic inflammation, are the significant changes that occur in the composition, organization, and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the aortic valve (AV). Most research regarding CAVD is based on experiments using two-dimensional (2D) cell culture or artificially created three-dimensional (3D) environments of valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Because the valvular ECM has a powerful influence in regulating pathological events, we developed an in vitro AV tissue culture model, which is more closely able to mimic natural conditions to study cellular responses underlying CAVD. AV leaflets, isolated from the hearts of 6-8-month-old sheep, were fixed with needles on silicon rubber rings to achieve passive tension and treated in vitro under pro-degenerative and pro-calcifying conditions. The degeneration of AV leaflets progressed over time, commencing with the first visible calcified domains after 14 d and winding up with the distinct formation of calcium nodules, heightened stiffness, and clear disruption of the ECM after 56 d. Both the expression of pro-degenerative genes and the myofibroblastic differentiation of VICs were altered in AV leaflets compared to that in VIC cultures. In this study, we have established an easily applicable, reproducible, and cost-effective in vitro AV tissue culture model to study pathological mechanisms underlying CAVD. The valvular ECM and realistic VIC-VEC interactions mimic natural conditions more closely than VIC cultures or 3D environments. The application of various culture conditions enables the examination of different pathological mechanisms underlying CAVD and could lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to VIC degeneration and AS. Our model provides a valuable tool to study the complex pathobiology of CAVD and can be used to identify potential therapeutic targets for slowing disease progression.

AB  - Establishing a robust and intimate mucosal interface that allows medical devices to remain within lumen-confined organs for extended periods has valuable applications, particularly for gastrointestinal theranostics. Here, we report the development of an electroadhesive hydrogel interface for robust and prolonged mucosal retention after electrical activation (e-GLUE). The e-GLUE device is composed of cationic polymers interpenetrated within a tough hydrogel matrix. An e-GLUE electrode design eliminated the need for invasive submucosal placement of ground electrodes for electrical stimulation during endoscopic delivery. With an electrical stimulation treatment of about 1 minute, the cationic polymers diffuse and interact with polyanionic proteins that have a relatively slow cellular turnover rate in the deep mucosal tissue. This mucosal adhesion mechanism increased the adhesion energy of hydrogels on the mucosa by up to 30-fold and enabled in vivo gastric retention of e-GLUE devices in a pig stomach for up to 30 days. The adhesion strength was modulated by polycationic chain length, electrical stimulation time, gel thickness, cross-linking density, voltage amplitude, polycation concentration, and perimeter-to-area ratio of the electrode assembly. In porcine studies, e-GLUE demonstrated rapid mucosal adhesion in the presence of luminal fluid and mucus exposure. In proof-of-concept studies, we demonstrated e-GLUE applications for mucosal hemostasis, sustained local delivery of therapeutics, and intimate biosensing in the gastrointestinal tract, which is an ongoing clinical challenge for commercially available alternatives, such as endoclips and mucoadhesive. The e-GLUE platform could enable theranostic applications across a range of digestive diseases, including recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the neuro-developmental disorder caused by various changes in the brain. It affects the life conditions with social interaction and communication. Most of the previous researches used the various techniques for the early detection to reduce the ASD, but it had been occurred several complications such as, time expenses, and low accessibility for diagnosis.This paper aims to develop the JSTO-DenseNetmodel is for the detection of ASD. In this paper, an input autism brainimage is considered as an input applied to image preprocessing phase. In image pre-processing, the clatters are removed utilizing Gaussian filtering and also, Region of Interest (ROI) extraction is carried out. Thereafter, extraction of pivotal region is done based on functional connectivity utilizing proposed Jaya Sewing Training Optimization (JSTO). The JSTO is newly introduced by combining Jaya algorithm and Sewing Training-Based Optimization (STBO). Thus, output-1 is obtained. In feature extraction phase, grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features like entropy, correlation, energy, homogeneity, inverse difference moment, Angular second moment and texture features namelylocal ternary patterns (LTP), Local Optimal Oriented Pattern (LOOP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) are extracted from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Therefore, output-2 is obtained. From output-1 and output-2, ASD classification is accomplished using DenseNet, which is trained employing same proposed JSTO. The proposed JSTO-DenseNet model achieves the highest accuracy of 94.8 %, True Positive Rate (TPR) of 90%, True Negative Rate (TNR) of 90.5%, un-weighted average recall (UAR) of 89.8% and the lowest False Negative Rate (FNR) of 86.7%, and False Positive Rate of 82.6%, when compared with other traditional methods like, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), Hybrid deep lightweight feature generator, CLAttention, Two stream end-to-end deep learning (DL), Auto-Encoder feature representation, and Fuzzy Inference Gait System-Deep Extreme Adaptive Fuzzy (FIGS-DEAF) based on Abide 1 dataset.

AB  - The nature and distribution of the synaptic changes that underlie memory are not well understood. Here we examine the synaptic plasticity behind context fear conditioning in male and female mice and find that new learning produces synaptic potentiation specifically onto engram neurons in the basolateral amygdala. This potentiation lasts at least 7 days, is reversed by extinction, and its disruption impairs memory recall. High frequency optogenetic stimulation of the CS and US-activated ensembles, or biochemical induction of synaptic potentiation in US-responsive neurons alone, is sufficient to produce a context fear association without prior associative training. These results suggest that plasticity of CS inputs onto US-responsive amygdala neurons underlies memory formation and is necessary and sufficient to establish context fear associations.

AB  - In the neocortex, similar to 90 Hz ripples couple to similar to 12 Hz sleep spindles on the similar to 1 Hz Down-to-Up state transition during non-rapid eye movement sleep. This conjunction of sleep waves is critical for the consolidation of memories into long-term storage. The widespread co-occurrences of ripples ("co-ripples") may integrate information across the neocortex and hippocampus to facilitate consolidation. While the thalamus synchronizes spindles and Up states in the cortex for memory, it is not known whether it may also organize co-ripples. Using human intracranial recordings during NREM sleep, we investigated whether cortico-cortical co-ripples and hippocampo-cortical co-ripples are either: (1) driven by directly projected thalamic ripples; or (2) coordinated by propagating thalamic spindles or Up states. We found ripples in the anterior and posterior thalamus, with similar characteristics as hippocampal and cortical ripples, including having a center frequency of similar to 90 Hz and coupling to local spindles on the Down-to-Up state transition. However, thalamic ripples rarely co-occur or phase-lock with cortical or hippocampal ripples. By contrast, spindles and Up states that propagate from the thalamus strongly coordinate co-ripples in the cortex and hippocampus. Thus, thalamo-cortical spindles and Up states, rather than thalamic ripples, may provide input facilitating spatially distributed co-rippling that integrates information for memory consolidation during sleep in humans.

AB  - Various biodegradable wastes derived from an integrated farming system require appropriate waste treatment solutions to maximize their resource recovery efficiency regarding environmental and economic benefits. This study aims to develop a decision support framework for optimizing resource recovery performance of biowaste treatment solutions in the integrated system. The "continuous improvement" concept of the FarmDESIGN model is adopted in conjunction with a Life Cycle Assessment tool. The combination of these two tools provides a comprehensive approach to the optimization algorithms for solving economic problems and emission reduction potential assessment in technology options of biowaste treatment for the integrated farming system. A case study was used for this purpose, with data from a household-scale integrated agri-aquaculture system in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. The results of the optimization calculations revealed that decisions on resource recovery solutions based on system data would identify a set of alternative system configurations. A good farm configuration including solutions of composting, vermicomposting, pelleting, and anaerobic digestion would be appropriate for an agri-aquaculture system larger than 2 ha in size, yielding the highest profits of up to 1900 USD while emitting the least amount of greenhouse gas. This study provides the implementation process of optimizing resource recovery performance, which may be of interest not only to integrated farm managers, but also decision-makers involved in agricultural waste management.

AB  - Multiple evidence in rodents shows that the strength of excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus is greater after wake than after sleep. The widespread synaptic weakening afforded by sleep is believed to keep the cost of synaptic activity under control, promote memory consolidation, and prevent synaptic saturation, thus preserving the brain's ability to learn day after day. The cerebellum is highly plastic and the Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, are endowed with a staggering number of excitatory parallel fiber synapses. However, whether these synapses are affected by sleep and wake is unknown. Here, we used serial block face scanning electron microscopy to obtain the full 3D reconstruction of more than 7000 spines and their parallel fiber synapses in the mouse posterior vermis. This analysis was done in mice whose cortical and hippocampal synapses were previously measured, revealing that average synaptic size was lower after sleep compared to wake with no major changes in synapse number. Here, instead, we find that while the average size of parallel fiber synapses does not change, the number of branched synapses is reduced in half after sleep compared to after wake, corresponding to similar to 16% of all spines after wake and similar to 8% after sleep. Branched synapses are harbored by two or more spines sharing the same neck and, as also shown here, are almost always contacted by different parallel fibers. These findings suggest that during wake, coincidences of firing over parallel fibers may translate into the formation of synapses converging on the same branched spine, which may be especially effective in driving Purkinje cells to fire. By contrast, sleep may promote the off-line pruning of branched synapses that were formed due to spurious coincidences.

AB  - The protective effects of thymoquinone on learning and memory abilities and on hippocampal oxidative stress in rats exposed to 900 MHz electromagnetic field radiation at s strength of 6.0 +/- 0.5 V/m for 1 h on each of 15 days was studied. Thymoquinone-treatment (10 mg/kg/day) of radiation-exposed rats resulted in better performance than that of radiation-exposed rats not receiving thymoquinone. Electromagnetic field-exposure led to increased hippocampal superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde levels and to lowered brain-derived neurotrophic factor level; thymoquinone treatment ameliorated all four parameters. Also, in the electromagnetic field-exposed group, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor expression decreased, and gamma-aminobutyric-acid alpha receptor expression increased, which was reversed by thymoquinone treatment. In conclusion, treatment with the thymoquinone ameliorated the impact of the exposure to EMF and provided a hint on the mechanism involving oxidative stress.

AB  - Terpenes play a vital role in plant defense; tomato plants produce a diverse range of terpenes within specialized glandular trichomes, influencing interactions with herbivores, predators, and pollinators. This study employed two distinct methods, namely leaf dip and maceration, to extract trichomes from tomato leaves. Terpene quantification was carried out using Gas Chromatography -Mass Spectrometry (GC -MS). The leaf dip method proved effective in selectively targeting trichome content, revealing unique extraction patterns compared to maceration. The GC -MS method demonstrated high linearity, accuracy, sensitivity, and low limits of detection and quantification. Application of the method to different tomato species ( Solanum pennellii, Solanum pimpinellifolium, Solanum galapagense, Solanum habrochaites , and Solanum lycopersicum ) identified significant variation in terpene content among these species, highlighting the potential of specific accessions for breeding programs. Notably, the terpene alpha-zingiberene, known for its repellency against whiteflies, was found in high quantities (211.90 -9155.13 mu g g -1 ) in Solanum habrochaites accession PI209978. These findings provide valuable insights into terpenoid diversity for plant defense mechanisms, guiding future research on developing pest -resistant tomato cultivars. Additionally, the study underscores the broader applications of terpenes in agriculture.

AB  - Camelina sativa (camelina) is emerging as an alternative oilseed crop due to its short growing cycle, low input requirements, adaptability to less favorable growing environments and a seed oil profile suitable for biofuel and industrial applications. Camelina meal and oil are also registered for use in animal and fish feeds; however, like meals derived from most cereals and oilseeds, it is deficient in certain essential amino acids, such as lysine. In higher plants, the reaction catalyzed by dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of lysine and is subject to regulation by lysine through feedback inhibition. Here, we report enhancement of lysine content in C. sativa seed via expression of a feedback inhibition-insensitive form of DHDPS from Corynebacterium glutamicums (CgDHDPS). Two genes encoding C. sativa DHDPS were identified and the endogenous enzyme is partially insensitive to lysine inhibition. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to examine the impact of alterations, alone and in combination, present in lysine-desensitized DHDPS isoforms from Arabidopsis thaliana DHDPS (W53R), Nicotiana tabacum (N80I) and Zea mays (E84K) on C. sativa DHDPS lysine sensitivity. When introduced alone, each of the alterations decreased sensitivity to lysine; however, enzyme specific activity was also affected. There was evidence of molecular or structural interplay between residues within the C. sativa DHDPS allosteric site as coupling of the W53R mutation with the N80V mutation decreased lysine sensitivity of the latter, but not to the level with the W53R mutation alone. Furthermore, the activity and lysine sensitivity of the triple mutant (W53R/N80V/E84T) was similar to the W53R mutation alone or the C. glutamicum DHDPS. The most active and most lysine-insensitive C. sativa DHDPS variant (W53R) was not inhibited by free lysine up to 1 mM, comparable to the C. glutamicums enzyme. Seed lysine content increased 13.6 -22.6% in CgDHDPS transgenic lines and 7.6-13.2% in the mCsDHDPS lines. The high lysine-accumulating lines from this work may be used to produce superior quality animal feed with improved essential amino acid profile.

AB  - Camel bot fly (Cephalopina titillator) larvae cause myiasis in domesticated and wild camels, resulting in significant economic losses to the camel industry and posing a serious global public health concern. To date, only one mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of C. titillator isolated from the Alxa Bactrian camel has been reported. Herein, C. titillator was isolated from the Junggar Bactrian camel to assemble a complete circular mitogenome with a length of 16,552 bp encoding 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, and two rRNA genes. The mitogenome showed a high A + T content (73.31%), positive AT-skew (0.12), and negative GC-skew (-0.34) base composition patterns. All protein-coding genes (PCGs) employed ATG, ATA, ATT, GTG, or TCG as the start codons and TAA, TAG, or single T as the stop codons. Similar to other parasites in the Oestridae subfamily, the mitogenome was structurally conserved, with genes retaining the same order and direction as those in the ancestral insect mitogenome. The phylogenetic analysis clustered this species with the Oestrinae, showing that the subfamily did not exhibit monophyly. C. titillator isolated from the Junggar Bactrian camel was found to be a sister lineage to that isolated from the Alxa Bactrian camel. Despite the lack of data on the mitogenome of C. titillator isolated from dromedaries in the Middle East, phylogenetic analysis of C. titillator isolated from Xinjiang revealed one distinct lineage of the Xinjiang camel nasal bot fly. In conclusion, this study reports the complete mitogenome of Xinjiang C. titillator for the first time, providing valuable data for future studies on the phylogenetic relationships in this subfamily.

AB  - Nitrogen is a crucial element for the growth and development of insects, but herbivorous insects often suffer from nitrogen nutrition deficiencies in their diets. Some symbiotic microorganisms can provide insect hosts with nitrogen nutrition through nitrogen fixation. Extensive research has clearly demonstrated the process of nitrogen fixation by symbiotic microorganisms in termites, while evidence supporting the occurrence and significance of nitrogen fixation in the diets of the Hemiptera is less conclusive. In this study, we isolated a strain of R. electrica from the digestive tract of a leafhopper, R. dorsalis, and found that it had nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Fluorescence in situ hybridization results showed that it was located in the gut of the leafhopper. Genome sequencing revealed that R. electrica possessed all the genes required for nitrogen fixation. We further evaluated the growth rate of R. electrica in nitrogen-containing and nitrogen-free media and measured its nitrogenase activity through an acetylene reduction assay. The findings of these studies could shed light on how gut microbes contribute to our understanding of nitrogen fixation.

AB  - Developing a successful biological control program relies on understanding predator-prey interactions in agroecosystem field settings. Among several methods used, molecular gut content analysis (MGCA) has become a popular method to measure predator contributions to pest control services. Once MGCA is applied to diagnose predator-prey interactions, the DNA detectability half-life is often applied to adjust for differences in prey digestion time among predators. Although MGCA best practices are well established, with many primers available, further work is needed to rank among published primers for MGCA. Using a combination of laboratory feeding trials and application of diagnostic MGCA to field collected predators, we investigated Bemisia tabaci post-feeding detection times in three dominant predator functional groups (chewing, piercing/sucking, and spiders). This was based on three published B. tabaci-specific primers. These data reveal that primer choice generated significantly different B. tabaci DNA half-lives in predator gut content. The primers with longer half-life resulted in higher field predation frequency estimation. Our field data using the primer with the longest half-life suggest several abundant predators, including Hippodamia convergens, Geocoris punctipes, Orius spp., Thomisidae spider, and fire ants (Solenopsis invicta), are actively feeding on B. tabaci in cotton fields. Orius spp. and fire ants were the most abundant predator species in our study area and contributed the most to B. tabaci control. Our results suggest that primers can be classified based on their specific DNA half-lives and can be used to address different ecological questions such as how to study time-specific predation detection (nocturnal or diurnal).

AB  - Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear polysaccharide that plays a key role in cellular signaling networks. HS functions are regulated by its 6-O-sulfation, which is catalyzed by three HS 6-O-sulfotransferases (HS6STs). Notably, HS6ST2 is mainly expressed in the brain and HS6ST2 mutations are linked to brain disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To determine the role of Hs6st2 in the brain, we carried out a series of molecular and behavioral assessments on Hs6st2 knockout mice. We first carried out strong anion exchange-high performance liquid chromatography and found that knockout of Hs6st2 moderately decreases HS 6-O-sulfation levels in the brain. We then assessed body weights and found that Hs6st2 knockout mice exhibit increased body weight, which is associated with abnormal metabolic pathways. We also performed behavioral tests and found that Hs6st2 knockout mice showed memory deficits, which recapitulate patient clinical symptoms. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the memory deficits, we used RNA sequencing to examine transcriptomes in two memory-related brain regions, the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. We found that knockout of Hs6st2 impairs transcriptome in the hippocampus, but only mildly in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, the transcriptome changes in the hippocampus are enriched in dendrite and synapse pathways. We also found that knockout of Hs6st2 decreases HS levels and impairs dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Taken together, our study provides novel molecular and behavioral insights into the role of Hs6st2 in the brain, which facilitates a better understanding of HS6ST2 and HS-linked brain disorders.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Asarum heterotropoides var. seoulense (Nakai) Kitag is a traditional herbal medi-cine used in Korea and China. It is effective in aphthous stomatitis, local anesthesia, headache, toothache, gingivitis, and inflammatory diseases. However, information on the toxicity of the root of Asarum heterotropoides var. seoulense (Nakai) Kitag (AR) is limited. Therefore, preclinical toxicity studies on AR are needed to reduce the risk of excessive intake.Aim of the study: We aimed to evaluate genotoxicity and the potential toxicity due to repeated administration of AR powder. Materials and methods: In vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames), in vitro chromosomal aberration assay (CA), and in vivo micronucleus (MN) assay in ICR mice were conducted. As positive results were obtained in Ames and CA assays, alkaline comet assay and pig-a gene mutation test were conducted for confirmation. For evaluating the general toxicity of AR powder, a 13-week subchronic toxicity test was conducted, after deter-mining the dose by performing a single and a 4-week dose range finding (DRF) test. A total of 152 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were orally administered AR powder at doses of 0, 150, 350, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/ day in the 13-week subchronic toxicity test. Hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, organ weight, macro-, and microscopic examination were conducted after rat necropsy.Results: AR powder induced genotoxicity evidenced in the Ames test at 187.5, 750, 375, and 1500 mu g/plate of TA100, TA98, TA1537, and E. coli WP2uvrA in the presence and absence of S9, respectively; CA test at 790 mu g/ mL for 6 h in the presence of S-9; 75 mu g/mL for 6 h in the absence of S-9, and 70 mu g/mL for 22 h in the absence of S-9 in the stomach in the comet assay but not in MN and pig-a assays. In the 13-week subchronic toxicity study, clinical signs including irregular respiration, noisy respiration, salivation, and decreased body weight or food consumption were observed in males and females in the 2000 mg/kg/day group. In hematology tests, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, organ weight, and macroscopic examination, changes were observed in the dose groups of 500 mg/kg/day and above. Microscopic examination revealed hyperplasia of the stomach as a test-related change. Hepatocellular adenoma and changes in liver-related clinical chemistry parameters were observed. The rat No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was 150 mg/kg/day in males and <150 mg/kg/day in females. Conclusions: AR powder is potentially toxic to the liver and stomach and should be used with caution in humans. A long-term study on carcinogenicity is necessitated because DNA damage or changes in tissue lesions were observed in SD rats.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains to be a major cause of long-term neurodevelopmental deficits in term neonates. Hypothermia offers partial neuroprotection warranting research for additional therapies. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous product of tryptophan metabolism, was previously shown to be beneficial in rat HIE models. We sought to determine if the KYNA analog SZR72 would afford neuroprotection in piglets. After severe asphyxia (pHa = 6.83 +/- 0.02, Delta BE = -17.6 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, mean +/- SEM), anesthetized piglets were assigned to vehicle-treated (VEH), SZR72-treated (SZR72), or hypothermia-treated (HT) groups (n = 6, 6, 6; Tcore = 38.5, 38.5, 33.5 degrees C, respectively). Compared to VEH, serum KYNA levels were elevated, recovery of EEG was faster, and EEG power spectral density values were higher at 24 h in the SZR72 group. However, instantaneous entropy indicating EEG signal complexity, depression of the visual evoked potential (VEP), and the significant neuronal damage observed in the neocortex, the putamen, and the CA1 hippocampal field were similar in these groups. In the caudate nucleus and the CA3 hippocampal field, neuronal damage was even more severe in the SZR72 group. The HT group showed the best preservation of EEG complexity, VEP, and neuronal integrity in all examined brain regions. In summary, SZR72 appears to enhance neuronal activity after asphyxia but does not ameliorate early neuronal damage in this HIE model.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterized by the presence of two aberrant structures in the brain, those are, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, along with neuronal death. Amyloidbeta further exacerbates the metabolic decline and results in cognitive impairments. Because of the favorable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of Artemisia absinthium (wormwood), this study aimed to evaluate the effects of hydroalcoholic extract of this plant on spatial memory performance, neuronal injury, and apoptosis induced by amyloid-beta. Forty-eight male Wistar rats (220-250 g) were divided into the following groups: 1) control; 2) sham (solvent; ICV); 3) amyloid-beta 1-40 (ICV); and 4) amyloid-beta plus A. absinthium (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day; gavage). Congo red and TUNEL staining were performed to investigate the neuronal injury. Also, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate the spatial memory of the experimental groups. The results showed that spatial memory for finding the hidden platform in the MWM task decreased significantly in the amyloid-beta group, compared to the control and sham groups. In contrast, treatment with A. absinthium improved spatial memory dose-dependently and reduced tissue degeneration, amyloid plaques, and apoptosis. It seems that the hydroalcoholic extract of A. absinthium, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, can effectively reverse spatial memory deficits and reduce amyloid-beta plaques.

AB  - The lining mucosa of the nasal cavity performs important roles for the host adaptation to the external environment. Camels are unique in their adaptation to the lifestyle of nomadic deserts. The present study aimed to evaluate the distribution pattern of T lymphocytes and S-phase proliferating cells within the nasal mucosa of camel using antibodies against CD3 and PCNA, respectively. The mucosa of the rostral, middle, and caudal parts of the nasal cavity was collected and processed for immunohistochemical staining. CD3-immunoreactive (-IR) cells were observed within the epithelium and lamina propria of all examined parts. However, the numbers of these cells were significantly higher in the rostral part of the nasal mucosa compared to its middle and caudal parts (P < 0.05). Such expression of CD3-IR cells within the rostra' nasal mucosa was most pronounced within its lamina propria which also revealed aggregations of lymphoid cells. The increased frequency of CD3 expressing cells at the rostral part of the nasal mucosa suggests a potential role of the nasal vestibule in limiting the infection via constant clearance of encountered pathogens. PCNA-IR cells were mainly found within the basal layers of the nasal epithelium at the rostral part of the nasal cavity, though they showed a significant decrease in their frequencies on moving caudad. The results of the present work will form a basis for assessment of various nasal pathologies affecting camels particularly those associated with increased rates of T lymphocytes infiltration and/or cell proliferation.

AB  - Cannabis derivatives are largely used in the general population for recreational and medical purposes, with the highest prevalence among adolescents, but chronic use and abuse has raised medical concerns. We investigated the prolonged effects of Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) in organotypic hippocampal slices from P7 rats cultured for 2 weeks. Cell death in the CA1 subregion of slices was quantified by propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence, pre-synaptic and post-synaptic marker proteins were analysed by Western blotting and neurodegeneration and astrocytic alterations by NeuN and GFAP by immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy. The statistical significance of differences was analysed using ANOVA with a post hoc Dunnett w-test (PI fluorescence intensities and Western blots) or Newman-Keuls (immunohistochemistry data) for multiple comparisons. A probability value (P) of < 0.05 was considered significant. Prolonged (72 h) THC or CBD incubation did not induce cell death but caused modifications in the expression of synaptic proteins and morphological alterations in neurons and astrocytes. In particular, the expression of PSD95 was reduced following incubation for 72 h with THC and was increased following incubation with CBD. THC for 72 h caused disorganisation of CA1 stratum pyramidalis (SP) and complex morphological modifications in a significant number of pyramidal neurons and in astrocytes. Our results suggest that THC or CBD prolonged exposure induce different effects in the hippocampus. In particular, 72 h of THC exposure induced neuronal and glia alterations that must draw our attention to the effects that relatively prolonged use might cause, especially in adolescents.

AB  - The hippocampus is known as the brain region implicated in visuospatial processes and processes associated with learning and short- and long-term memory. An important functional characteristic of the hippocampus is lifelong neurogenesis. A decrease or increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with a wide range of neurological diseases. We have previously shown that in adult male mice with a chronic positive fighting experience in daily agonistic interactions, there is an increase in the proliferation of progenitor neurons and the production of young neurons in the dentate gyrus (in hippocampus), and these neurogenesis parameters remain modified during 2 weeks of deprivation of further fights. The aim of the present work was to identify hippocampal genes associated with neurogenesis and involved in the formation of behavioral features in mice with the chronic experience of wins in aggressive confrontations, as well as during the subsequent 2-week deprivation of agonistic interactions. Hippocampal gene expression profiles were compared among three groups of adult male mice: chronically winning for 20 days in the agonistic interactions, chronically victorious for 20 days followed by the 2-week deprivation of fights, and intact (control) mice. Neurogenesis-associated genes were identified whose transcription levels changed during the social confrontations and in the subsequent period of deprivation of fights. In the experimental males, some of these genes are associated with behavioral traits, including abnormal aggression-related behavior, an abnormal anxiety-related response, and others. Two genes encoding transcription factors (Nr1d1 and Fmr1) were likely to contribute the most to the between-group differences. It can be concluded that the chronic experience of wins in agonistic interactions alters hippocampal levels of transcription of multiple genes in adult male mice. The transcriptome changes get reversed only partially after the 2-week period of deprivation of fights. The identified differentially expressed genes associated with neurogenesis and involved in the control of a behavior/neurological phenotype can be used in further studies to identify targets for therapeutic correction of the neurological disturbances that develop in winners under the conditions of chronic social confrontations.

TI  - High-fidelity estimates of spikes and subthreshold waveforms from 1-photon voltage imaging in vivo
T2  - CELL REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The ability to probe the membrane potential of multiple genetically defined neurons simultaneously would have a profound impact on neuroscience research. Genetically encoded voltage indicators are a promising tool for this purpose, and recent developments have achieved a high signal-to-noise ratio in vivo with 1-photon fluorescence imaging. However, these recordings exhibit several sources of noise and signal extraction remains a challenge. We present an improved signal extraction pipeline, spike-guided penalized matrix decomposition-nonnegative matrix factorization (SGPMD-NMF), which resolves supra- and subthreshold voltages in vivo. The method incorporates biophysical and optical constraints. We validate the pipeline with simultaneous patch-clamp and optical recordings from mouse layer 1 in vivo and with simulated and composite datasets with realistic noise. We demonstrate applications to mouse hippocampus expressing paQuasAr3-s or SomArchon1, mouse cortex expressing SomArchon1 or Voltron, and zebrafish spines expressing zArchon1.

AB  - Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea) and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (C. gloeosporioides) were isolated from the decaying strawberry tissue. The antifungal properties of Monarda didyma essential oil (MEO) and its nanoemulsion were confirmed, demonstrating complete inhibition of the pathogens at concentrations of 0.45 mu L/mL (0.37 mg/mL) and 10 mu L/mL, respectively. Thymol, a primary component of MEO, was determined as an antimicrobial agent with IC50 values of 34.51 (B. cinerea) and 53.40 (C. gloeosporioides) mu g/mL. Hippophae rhamnoides oil (HEO) was confirmed as a potent antioxidant, leading to the development of a thymol-HEO-chitosan film designed to act as an antistaling agent. The disease index and weight loss rate can be reduced by 90 and 60%, respectively, with nutrients also being well-preserved, offering an innovative approach to preservative development. Studies on the antifungal mechanism revealed that thymol could bind to FKS1 to disrupt the cell wall, causing the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and a burst of reactive oxygen species.

AB  - Nanofibrous scaffolds have attracted much attention in bladder reconstruction approaches due to their excellent mechanical properties. In addition, their biological properties can be improved by combination with biological materials. Taking into account the advantages of nanofibrous scaffolds and decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) in tissue engineering, scaffolds of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) coated with decellularized human amnion membrane (hAM) or sheep bladder (SB)-derived ECM proteins are developed (amECM-coated PLLA and sbECM-coated PLLA, respectively). The bladder regenerative potential of modified electrospun PLLA scaffolds is investigated in rabbits. The presence of ECM proteins is confirmed on the nanofibers' surface. Coating the surface of the PLLA nanofibers improves cell adhesion and proliferation. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluations show that rabbits subjected to cystoplasty with a multilayered PLLA scaffold show de novo formation and maturation of the multilayered urothelial layer. However, smooth muscle bundles (myosin heavy chain [MHC] and alpha-smooth muscle actin [alpha-SMA] positive) are detected only in ECM-coated PLLA groups. All groups show no evidence of a diverticulumor fistula in the urinary bladder. These results suggest that the biofunctionalization of electrospun PLLA nanofibers with ECM proteins can be a promising option for bladder tissue engineering. Furthermore, hAM can also replace animal-sourced ECM proteins in bladder tissue regeneration approaches.
   Scaffolds of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) coated with decellularized human amnion membrane (hAM) or sheep bladder (SB)-derived ECM proteins and the rabbits subjected to cystoplasty with these multilayer PLLA scaffolds are developed. Four months after implantation, the results suggest that epithelialization and smooth muscle regeneration have created on the scaffolds.image

AB  - Ant colonies are often considered to be highly efficient societies skilled at cooperating and sharing workload among workers. Yet, several studies have revealed low colony activity levels and a subgroup of specialized inactive individuals, raising questions about their role. This study investigates whether these inactive ants differ in their sensitivity to environmental cues compared to other worker groups. We monitored the behavior of individually tagged workers from Myrmica rubra ant colonies, categorizing them as foragers, nurses, domestics, or inactives. Approximately one-third of the workers exhibited high levels of inactivity, forming a distinct group that remains stable over several days. Subsequently, individual tests were conducted on these ants to compare their responses to intranidal or extranidal location cues, and to task-related stimuli such as larvae or prey. In individual tests, foragers displayed distinct responses compared to internal workers. They exhibited greater responsiveness to prey, but were less inclined to care for larvae, stay in colony-marked or shaded areas, or approach nestmates. Among internal workers, except for the inactive ants, responses to various stimuli did not significantly differ. Notably, inactives had a stronger attraction to colony odor and were more likely to carry larvae when compared to foragers. Our results suggest that the inactivity of some individuals is not due to a lack of sensitivity to surrounding stimuli. Furthermore, their high propensity to interact with larvae supports the hypothesis of a "reserve caste" function, where these workers become active during periods of increased colony workload.

AB  - We examined the feasibility of externally marking insects with the liquid fluorescent forensic theft deterrent, SmartWater (SmartWater CSI, LLC.). We sprayed captive Lygus hesperus (Knight) (Hemiptera: Miridae), Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) with SmartWater fluorophore, and then qualitatively examined them for fluorescence by visual inspection under ultraviolet (UV) light and quantitatively measured them with a multiwavelength microplate fluorometer. The results indicate that this product has enormous potential as a taggant for L. hesperus and B. tabaci. However, the marking efficiency for H. convergens was only adequate. The advantages and limitations of using SmartWater as a biological marker for arthropod mark-release-recapture research are discussed.

AB  - Excessive fluoride intake poses health risks to humans and animals. Many studies have indicated that fluoride exposure can damage the cytoskeleton and synapses, which has negative effects on the intellectual development of humans and animals. Our previous study suggested that the RhoA/ROCK signalling pathway is activated by NaF exposure in HT-22 cells and plays a vital role in cytoskeletal assembly and synaptogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying RhoA/ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal injury induced by fluoride remains unclear. In this study, Neuro-2A cells and ICR mice were used to investigate the effects of RhoA/ROCK activation inhibition on NaF-induced synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. We detected the expression of GAP, RhoA, ROCK1/ 2, and (p)-MLC in vivo and in vitro model. The results showed that NaF exposure activated the RhoA/ROCK/MLC signalling pathway. We measured the effects of RhoA/ROCK inhibition on synaptic injury and intellectual impairment induced by NaF exposure. In vitro, Y-27632 suppressed activated RhoA/ROCK, attenuated morphological and ultrastructural damage, and decreased the survival rate and synapse-functional protein expression caused by NaF. In vivo, the results showed that the RhoA/ROCK/MLC pathway was inhibited by fasudil and improved pathological damage in the hippocampus, cognitive impairment, and decreased expression of neurofunctional proteins induced by NaF. Overall, these results suggest that fasudil and Y-27632 can reverse neurotoxicity caused by fluoride exposure. Furthermore, inhibition of RhoA/ROCK may be a future treatment for CNS injury, and more detailed studies on other neurodegenerative disease models are required to confirm its effectiveness.

AB  - Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, resulting in neurocognitive impairments. Adverse effects are also associated with glutamate-induced excitotoxicity due to alterations in the composition of glutamate receptors. Ketamine, which is a noncompetitive NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, has been stated to exert an impact on glutamatergic receptors. This study aims to reveal the possible alleviating or preventive effects of ketamine, which maintains glutamate homeostasis and decreases neurodegeneration, in a radiation-induced neurotoxicity model. Twenty-one female Wistar Queryrats were included in the study and 14 of these underwent whole brain irradiation (IR) with a 20 Gray single dose. Animals were allocated into three groups. Group 1: Normal control; Group 2: Placebo / IR + Saline; Group 3: IR + Ketamine. Ketamine was administered in addition to IR to rats in Group 3. The one-way ANOVA statistical test was used to compare groups. The value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. When administered in addition to irradiation, ketamine treatment significantly increased scores in the three-chamber sociability test, open field test, and passive avoidance learning test. It also raised neuron counts in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions as well as in Purkinje cells, and enhanced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine receptor kinase-B. Furthermore, ketamine administration resulted in decreased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, malondialdehyde, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, indicating a reduction in neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Ketamine exerted a significant protective impact on radiation-induced neurocognitive impairments and enhanced social-memory capacity by reducing neuronal loss, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that ketamine is beneficial in the treatment or prevention of neurodegeneration via the regulation of the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway besides decreasing neuroinflammation and blocking NMDA receptors.

AB  - The present study investigated whether N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) mediate consolidation and retrieval of habit memory. Adult male Long-Evans rats were trained in a response learning version of a water plus-maze task in which rats were reinforced to make a habitual and consistent body-turn response at the maze choice point in order to mount a hidden escape platform. Prior research indicates that acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval in this task requires DLS function. The present study consisted of two experiments. In Experiment 1, rats received intra-DLS post-training injections of the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino -5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5; 2 mu g/side) to examine the role of NMDA receptors in consolidation of habit memory. In Experiment 2, different groups of rats received a single pre-retrieval injection of AP5 in the DLS (AP5; 2 mu g/side) during the last day of maze training to examine the potential role of NMDA receptors in retrieval of habit memory. Results indicated that post-training intra-DLS AP5 injections impaired memory consolidation. However, administration of AP5 at the same dose that impaired consolidation had no effect on memory retrieval. The findings are consistent with previous research indicating a role for NMDA receptors in the DLS in memory consolidation, and suggest that NMDA-dependent synaptic activity in the DLS may not be a critical component of habit memory retrieval.

AB  - Whether a novel stimulus is expected or unexpected may have implications for the kind of ensuing encoding and the type of subsequent memory. Pupil response was used in the present study to explore the way expected and unexpected stimuli are encoded and whether encoding-linked pupil response is modulated by expectation. Participants first established a contingency relationship between a series of symbols and the type of stimulus (man-made or natural) that followed each one. At encoding, some of the target stimuli violated the previously established relationship (i.e., unexpected), while the majority conformed to this relationship (i.e., expected). Expectation at encoding had opposite effects on familiarity and recollection, the two types of memory that support recognition, and modulated differently the way pupil response predicted subsequent memory. Encoding of unexpected novel stimuli was associated with increased pupil dilation as a predictor of subsequent memory type and strength. In contrast, encoding of expected novel stimuli was associated with decreased pupil response (constriction), which was predictive of subsequent memory type and strength. The findings support the close link between pupil response and memory formation, but critically indicate that this is modulated by the type of novelty as defined by expectation. These novel findings have important implications for the encoding mechanisms involved when different types of novelty are detected and is proposed to indicate the operation of different neurotransmitters during memory formation.

AB  - This study was conducted in nutrient-restricted pregnant Hu ewes to determine whether rumen-protected arginine (RP-Arg) or N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) supplementation affects fetal liver growth and development. From 35 d to 110 d of gestation, 32 Hu ewes were randomly divided into four groups: a control group (100% of the National Research Council (NRC) requirements), a nutrient-restricted group (50% of the NRC requirements), and two treatment groups (ARG and NCG, 50% of the NRC requirements, supplemented with 20 g/day RP-Arg or 5 g/day NCG, respectively). Fetal body weights, fetal liver growth performance, the capability of antioxidation, and the expression of the mRNA and proteins of apoptosis-related genes in the fetal liver were determined and analyzed at 110 d of gestation. The dry matter, water, fat, protein, and ash components of the fetal livers in the RG group were found to be lower than in the CG group, and these components were significantly higher in the NCG group than in the RG group (p < 0.05). A decrease in DNA, RNA, and protein concentrations and contents, as well as in protein/DNA ratios, was observed in the RG group in comparison to the CG group (p < 0.05). Compared with the RG group, the NCG group had higher concentrations of DNA, RNA, and protein, as well as higher protein/DNA ratios (p < 0.05). The RG group had lower concentrations of cholinesterase, nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthase, superoxide dismutase, alanine aminotransferase, and total protein than the CG group (p < 0.05). The RG group had higher levels of glutathione peroxidase, maleic dialdehyde, and aspartate aminotransferase than the CG group (p < 0.05). In the RG group, the mRNA and protein expression of p53 and Bax was significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared with the CG group, and the gene expression of FasL and Bcl-2, the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax, and the protein expression of Bcl-2 in the RG group were lower (p < 0.05) than in the CG group. It appears that RP-Arg and NCG supplementation during pregnancy could influence fetal liver growth and development. A nutrition-based therapeutic intervention to alleviate reduced fetal growth can be developed based on this study, which has demonstrated that maternal undernutrition during pregnancy induces the maldevelopment of the fetal liver.

AB  - Simple Summary Butyrate is an established feed additive for supporting gut health in pigs and poultry and also young ruminants where it is used to promote rumen development. However, the effect of supplementing dairy cows with butyrate ahead of calving has been less extensively studied, and it is not known what effect precalving butyrate supplementation has on the calf. The purpose of this on-farm study was to investigate the effect of magnesium butyrate (MgB) fed daily for the last 3 weeks before the expected time of calving on dairy cow and calf-related parameters. The study findings showed that prepartum MgB enhanced colostrum yield and the total yield of immunglobulin G, protein and lactose. Improved early lactation performance, calving ease, fertility and body condition score were observed in the cows of the MgB-supplemented group, and their calves had increased vitality at birth. These findings highlight that prepartum MgB supplementation of dairy cows gives a wide range of benefits, which also extend to the calf. Butyrate promotes rumen epithelium growth and function; however, the effect of prepartum butyrate supplementation on dairy cow productivity, health and their offspring has not been extensively studied. Furthermore, no studies have investigated the effect of magnesium butyrate (MgB), which is also a source of magnesium. A trial was performed to test the hypothesis that prepartum MgB supplementation (105 g/cow/day) would increase colostrum quality and improve calving, newborn calf vitality and cow health. Multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned to MgB supplemented (n = 107) and Control groups (n = 112). Colostrum yield and the total yield of IgG, protein and lactose were higher (p <= 0.05) in the supplemented group. The calving assistance rate was lower (p <= 0.012), and the neonatal vitality score was higher (p <= 0.001) in the MgB group. Improved parameters related to cow health and fertility were observed in the supplemented group. The MgB group also had higher milk yield during the first week of lactation (p <= 0.001), and a higher (p <= 0.05) body condition score from 3 to 9 weeks after calving. In conclusion, prepartum MgB supplementation provides a wide range of benefits for dairy cows, as well as their newborn calves.

AB  - Synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) are evolutionarily conserved proteins that play an important role in the form and function of neuronal synapses. Teneurins (Tenms) and latrophilins (Lphns) are well-known cell adhesion molecules that form a transsynaptic complex. Recent studies suggest that Tenm3 and Lphn2 (gene symbol Adgrl2) are involved in hippocampal circuit assembly via their topographical expression. However, it is not known whether other teneurins and latrophilins display similar topographically restricted expression patterns during embryonic and postnatal development. Here, we reveal the cartography of all teneurin (Tenm1-4) and latrophilin (Lphn1-3 [Adgrl1-3]) paralog expression in the mouse hippocampus across prenatal and postnatal development as monitored by large-scale single-molecule RNA in situ hybridization mapping. Our results identify a striking heterogeneity in teneurin and latrophilin expression along the spatiotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Tenm2 and Tenm4 expression levels peak at the neonatal stage when compared to Tenm1 and Tenm3, while Tenm1 expression is restricted to the postnatal pyramidal cell layer. Tenm4 expression in the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits an opposing topographical expression pattern in the embryonic and neonatal hippocampus. Our findings were validated by analyses of multiple RNA-seq datasets at bulk, single-cell, and spatial levels. Thus, our study presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of Tenm and Lphn expression in the hippocampus, showcasing their diverse expression patterns across developmental stages in distinct spatial axes.
   Teneurins and latrophilins are cell adhesion molecules that form a transsynaptic complex implicated in hippocampal circuit assembly. This study provides a spatiotemporal map of teneurin and latrophilin expression in the hippocampus of mice during early development.

AB  - Clinical studies have found that ketamine has a rapid and lasting antidepressant effect, especially in the case of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The molecular mechanisms, however, remain unclear. In this study, we observe the effects of S-Ketamine on the expression of Rac1, neuronal morphology, and synaptic transmission function in the hippocampus of stressed rats. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to construct stressed rats. The rats were given a different regimen of ketamine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 (50 mu g, ICV) treatment. The depression-like behavior of rats was evaluated by sucrose preference test and open-field test. The protein expression of Rac1, GluA1, synapsin1, and PSD95 in the hippocampus was detected by Western blot. Pull-down analysis was used to examine the activity of Rac1. Golgi staining and electrophysiological study were used to observe the neuronal morphology and long-term potentiation (LTP). Our results showed that ketamine can up-regulate the expression and activity of Rac1; increase the spine density and the expression of synaptic-related proteins such as GluA1, Synapsin1, and PSD95 in the hippocampus of stressed rats; reduce the CUMS-induced LTP impairments; and consequently improve depression-like behavior. However, Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 could have effectively reversed ketamine-mediated changes in the hippocampus of rats and counteracted its antidepressant effects. The specific mechanism of S-Ketamine's antidepressant effect may be related to the up-regulation of the expression and activity of Rac1 in the hippocampus of stressed rats, thus enhancing synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Aging is a naturally occurring process inevitably affecting each living human. The brain is adversely affected by aging with increased risks of developing various neurological disorders. Thus, it is essential to investigate practical approaches that can counteract the impact of aging on the brain. Vitamin K2 (Vit. K2) is a naturally occurring vitamin with reported valuable therapeutic effects. The current study highlights the role of Vit. K2 administration in counteracting age-related changes in the brain using naturally aging rats. Three-month-old rats were assigned to two groups: an ageing control group receiving a drug vehicle and an ageing group orally gavaged with Vit. K2 (30 mg/kg, once daily 5 days per week). Treatment was continued for 17 months. Ten three-month-old rats were used as the adult control. Vit. K2 improved functional performance, reduced social anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and enhanced memory performance with concomitant preservation of hippocampal and cerebral cortex tyrosine hydroxylase expression. Biochemically, Vit. K2 administration restored oxidative-anti-oxidative homeostasis in the brain. Vit. K2 modulated inflammatory signaling, as evidenced by suppression in the brain of NLRP3, caspase-1, Il-1 beta, TNF alpha, IL-6, and CD68 expression. Concomitantly, histopathological examination revealed consistent hippocampal and cerebral cortex improvement. Thus, it can be inferred that Vit K2 can slow down age-related changes in the brain associated with modulation of NLRP3/caspase-1/Nrf-2 signaling.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the effect of the administration of either medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or progesterone (P4) in superovulation (SOV) treatments applied during the first follicular wave on follicular development, embryo yield, and the expression of genes related to pluripotency maintenance, differentiation of the trophectoderm, cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis and energy metabolism in sheep embryos. The estrous cycle of 36 multiparous ewes was synchronized with a short protocol, and the animals were randomly allocated to three groups. At the beginning of SOV, 12 ewes per treatment received an intravaginal sponge impregnated with 60 mg of MPA (TMPA), or an intravaginal device containing 0.33 g of P4 (TP4), or received no progestogen treatment (CON). The device was kept until the fifth dose of FSH. Ewes were mated with five fertile rams. Gene expression was performed by RT-qPCR using grade I and II blastocysts. The numbers of corpora lutea, total structures and viable embryos recovered per ewe were similar (P > 0.05) among groups. However, the viability rate was higher in TP4 (71.9 +/-& nbsp;16.3%) compared to CON (24.4 +/-& nbsp;16.8%; P = 0.01) and similar to TMPA (49.9 +/-& nbsp;16.3%; P = 0.2). Similarly, when compared with CON, treatment with P4 or MPA positively regulated the TGFB1 transcript involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively). In conclusion, supplementation with P4 during the first follicular wave of the estrous cycle improves embryo viability and alters the expression of the TGFB1 gene.

AB  - Bats are the sole group of mammals capable of flight, classified into Microchiroptera and Megachiroptera. This investigation aimed to study the morphology, anatomy, and histology of the Microchiropterans R. hardwickii brain at young and adult stages. Twelve adult and young bats were used. The gross anatomical aspects were examined. Brain tissue sections were prepared and stained using H&E, Nissl, toluidine blue, and immunohistochemically using GFAP antibody. The brain's dorsal view was pear-shaped, divided into forebrain (cerebrum), midbrain (is the most rostral part of the brainstem; pons and medulla oblongata), and hindbrain (cerebellum). A small, poorly developed olfactory bulb was observed. The cerebrum had a smooth surface with limited convolutions and depressions; it was divided into two hemispheres aligned along a median interhemispheric fissure. The pineal gland was distinctly visible. The optic lobes were prominent, rounded, and broad, appearing laterally on the midbrain. The hippocampus appeared as a dorso-medial protrusion separated by the lateral ventricle from the brain; it was well-developed in adult more than in young bats. The cerebellum was well-developed, partitioned into folds, and separated from the cerebrum by a slight transverse fissure. Histologically, a diminutive cerebral cortex was observed to have various types of neurons, including pyramidal, pyramidal-like, and multipolar. Hippocampal neurons were more extensive and lacked discrete layers. A comparatively more significant number of neurons was found in the cerebellum than in the cerebral cortex and other brain parts. All these previous characteristic features and neurological processes required for the generation and comprehension of vocalizations employed in echolocation of the Microchiropterans. Also, the findings of this study clarified notable neurological characteristics linked to the evolutionary connections and relationships of chiropterans.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a widespread environmental heavy metal that can damage the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and reduce the learning and memory ability in humans and animals. In vivo and in vitro models of acute lead acetate exposure were established to further study the mechanism of neurons injury. In this study, 4-week-old female Kunming mice were randomly divided into four groups. Each group was treated with distilled water with different Pb concentrations (0, 2.4, 4.8 and 9.6 mM). Mice were killed, and brain tissues were collected to detect the changes in synaptic plasticity-related protein expression. Furthermore, Neuro-2A cells were treated with 0, 5, 25 and 50 mu M lead acetate for 24 h to observe the changes in cell morphology and function. In in vivo experiment, results showed that the expression levels of cytoskeleton-associated and neural function-related proteins decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the mouse brain tissue. In in vitro experiment, compared with the control group, Pb treatment groups were observed with smaller and round cells, decreased cell density and number of synapses. In the Pb exposure group, the survival rate of nerve cells decreased evidently, and the permeability of the cell membrane was increased. Western blot results showed that the expression of cytoskeleton-associated and function-related proteins decreased gradually with increased Pb exposure dose. Confocal laser scanning microscopy results revealed the morphological and volumetric changes in Neuro-2A cells, and a dose-dependent reduction in the number of axon and dendrites. These results suggested that abnormal neural structures and inhibiting expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins might be the possible mechanisms of Pb-induced mental retardation in human and animals, thereby laying a foundation for the molecular mechanism of Pb neurotoxicity.

AB  - Guanosine has been considered a promising candidate for antidepressant responses, but if this nucleoside could modulate adenosine A(1) (A(1)R) and A(2A) (A(2A)R) receptors to exert antidepressant-like actions remains to be elucidated. This study investigated the role of A(1)R and A(2A)R in the antidepressant-like response of guanosine in the mouse tail suspension test and molecular interactions between guanosine and A(1)R and A(2)AR by docking analysis. The acute (60 min) administration of guanosine (0.05 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly decreased the immobility time in the tail suspension test, without affecting the locomotor performance in the open-field test, suggesting an antidepressant-like effect. This behavioral response was paralleled with increased A(1)R and reduced A(2A)R immunocontent in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex, of mice. Guanosine-mediated antidepressant-like effect was not altered by the pretreatment with caffeine (3 mg/kg, i.p., a non-selective adenosine A(1)R/A(2A)R antagonist), 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX - 2 mg/kg, i.p., a selective adenosine A(1)R antagonist), or 4-(2-[7-amino-2-{2-furyl}{1,2,4}triazolo-{2,3-a}{1,3,5}triazin-5-yl-amino]ethyl)-phenol (ZM241385 - 1 mg/kg, i.p., a selective adenosine A(2A)R antagonist). However, the antidepressant-like response of guanosine was completely abolished by adenosine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., a non-selective adenosine A(1)R/A(2A)R agonist), N-6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA - 0.05 mg/kg, i.p., a selective adenosine A(1) receptor agonist), and N-6-[2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(methylphenyl)ethyl]adenosine (DPMA - 0.1 mg/kg, i.p., a selective adenosine A(2A) receptor agonist). Finally, docking analysis also indicated that guanosine might interact with A(1)R and A(2A)R at the adenosine binding site. Overall, this study reinforces the antidepressant-like of guanosine and unveils a previously unexplored modulation of the modulation of A(1)R and A(2A)R in its antidepressant-like effect.

AB  - Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) are two important pathogens in the pig industry. PCV2 or PRV infection can induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and unfolded protein response (UPR). However, the effect of PCV2 and PRV coinfection on the ERS and UPR pathways remains unclear. In this study, we found that PRV inhibited the proliferation of PCV2 mainly at 36 to 72 hpi, while PCV2 enhanced the proliferation of PRV in the middle stage of the infection. Notably, PRV is the main factor during coinfection. The results of the transcriptomic analysis showed that coinfection with PCV2 and PRV activated cellular ERS, and upregulated expressions of the ERS pathway-related proteins, including GRP78, eIF2 alpha, and ATF4. Further research indicated that PRV played a dominant role in the sequential infection and coinfection of PCV2 and PRV. PCV2 and PRV coinfection induced the ERS activation via the PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-CHOP axis and IRE1-XBP1-EDEM pathway, and thus may enhance cell apoptosis and exacerbate the diseases.

AB  - Knowledge about the prebiotic characteristics of cellulose by in vitro fermentation is not complete due to the neglect of small intestinal fermentation. This study investigated the effects of small intestinal fermentation on the prebiotic characteristics of cellulose in the large intestine and potential mechanisms through an approach of combined in vivo small intestinal fermentation and in vitro fermentation. The structural similarity between cellulose in feces and after processing by the approach of this study confirmed the validity of the approach employed. Results showed that small intestinal fermentation of cellulose increased both acetate and propionate content and enriched Corynebacterium selectively. Compared to in vitro fermentation after in vitro digestion of cellulose, the in vitro fermentation of cellulose after in vivo small intestinal fermentation produced higher contents of acetate and propionate as well as the abundance of probiotics like Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, Blautia, and Bifidobaterium. The changes in the structural features of cellulose after in vivo small intestinal fermentation were more obvious than those after in vitro digestion, which may account for the greater production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the abundance of probiotics. In summary, small intestinal fermentation enhanced the prebiotic characteristics of cellulose in the large intestine by predisrupting its structure.

AB  - Simple Summary The content of antioxidant components and the antioxidant potential of milk can be modified through animal nutrition, i.e., with the inclusion of various natural additives, e.g., herbs, seeds, or byproducts, to the feed ration. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the addition of a standardized herbal mixture (oregano, common thyme, purple coneflower, and cinnamon bark) to the feed ration for Holstein-Friesian cows on the antioxidant capacity of milk. This study demonstrated the potential of the herbal blend to increase the content of bioactive ingredients with antioxidant properties in milk, i.e., whey proteins (& beta;-lactoglobulin, lactoferrin) and lipophilic vitamins (A, E). The value of the antioxidant potential of milk increased as well; from a nutritional point of view, this seems to be of particular importance for the protection of the organism against the harmful effects of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the addition of a standardized herbal mixture to the feed ration for Holstein-Friesian cows on the antioxidant capacity of milk. The study was carried out on a farm specialized in breeding dairy cattle. The exact study involved 30 cows in lactation III, which were in the first phase of lactation at the beginning of the experiment (15 cows-control group; 15 cows-experimental group). The nutrition supplied to the cows was based on the TMR (total mixed ration) system, with roughage and concentrate fodder used as the basis of the feed ration. The addition of a standardized blend of dried herbs, i.e., oregano (Origanum vulgare), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea), and cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), was the experimental factor. Powdered herbs were administered as a component of the concentrate fodder at the dose of 3% DM ration/day/head. Milk samples were collected four times during the experiment (term 0 after the colostrum period and then after lactation weeks 2, 4, and 6). The following parameters were determined in the milk: the basic chemical composition, i.e., the content of total protein, fat, lactose, and casein; somatic cell count; content of selected whey proteins (& alpha;-lactalbumin, & beta;-lactoglobulin, lactoferrin, BSA); and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D-3, E). Additionally, the milk antioxidant capacity (ABTS, FRAP, DPPH) was determined and the degree of antioxidant protection (DAP) was calculated. It was shown that the milk from cows receiving the herbal blend-supplemented fodder had a higher content of casein, compared to the control group. The herbal supplementation contributed to a significant increase in the content of bioactive compounds, i.e., selected whey proteins (& beta;-lactoglobulin, lactoferrin) and lipophilic vitamins (A, E). The milk was also characterized by significantly higher antioxidant potential (regardless of the measurement method) and a higher degree of antioxidant protection (DAP).

AB  - BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), considered as one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide, has drawn significant attention from researchers.Extensively studied diverse cancers, the function of LIMA1 in tumorigenesis and cancer progression remains ambiguous.. Moreover, the role of LIMA1 in HCC remains controversial.MethodsThe expression difference of LIMA1 in hepatocellular carcinoma, which was verified by TMT quantitative proteomics, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and the TCGA database, has been investigated in this study. Demonstrated by using transwell, cck8, sphere formation, and other experiments, the effects of LIMA1 on the migration, proliferation, stemness, and other aspects of hepatocellular carcinoma were significant. Moreover, the effect of LIMA1 on the wnt-beta catenin/Hippo pathway was revealed by using RNA sequencing and western blot, and the relationship between LIMA1 and beta catenin was verified by using COIP. Finally, the effect of m6a modification on LIMA1 was further verified using Western blotting, actinomycin D and MeRip experiments.ResultsIn HCC tissues and several HCC cell lines, LIMA1 was expressed at a relatively high level.LIMA1 positively regulated the invasion, migration, proliferation and stemness of hepatocellular carcinoma, and silencing of LIMA1 inhibited the tumorigenic ability of HCC cells in nude mice. Moreover, it was shown that LIMA1 can have an impact on the wnt-beta-catenin/Hippo pathway. And silencing beta-catenin suppressed the invasion, migration, proliferation and stemness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells mediated by LIMA1. Finally, it was further verified that the activation of LIMA1 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells is due to m6-methyladenosine methylation that is dependent on METTL3.ConclusionsIn HCC, LIMA1 functions as a tumor promoter and engages with the WNT-beta-catenin and Hippo signaling pathways,, affecting the characteristics of tumor cells. LIMA1 expression is regulated by METTL3-mediated m6A modification, leading to its high expression in HCC. Our research presents a hopeful objective for the detection and therapy of HCC.Graphical Abstract1.The m6A modification mediated by METTL3 can promote the high expression of LIMA1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. 2.LIMA1 can bind to beta-catenin, promoting its nuclear translocation and activating downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, LIMA1 can enhance the expression of key proteins YAP/TAZ in the Hippo pathway. 3.LIMA1 plays a crucial role in EMT, proliferation, invasion, and stemness in hepatocellular carcinoma, thereby promoting the progression of the disease.Graphical Abstract1.The m6A modification mediated by METTL3 can promote the high expression of LIMA1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. 2.LIMA1 can bind to beta-catenin, promoting its nuclear translocation and activating downstream signaling pathways.

AB  - Simple Summary In animal production, growth trials have shown that betaine has a positive effect on growth performance, especially improving meat yield. Proteins are the largest unit comprising muscle cells except moisture. However, how betaine regulates muscle protein anabolism and abundance levels remains unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary betaine on growth performance, muscle protein deposition, and proteome of broilers. The results suggested that betaine could improve growth performance and muscle protein deposition of broilers. Alterations in muscle nucleic acids, amino acids, and protein abundance levels were involved in this process. Proteomic analysis further revealed that 35 proteins in breast muscle were identified as differentially abundant proteins by betaine supplementation, which were mainly related to cell differentiation, small molecule metabolic process, and tissue development. To investigate the effect of betaine supplementation on growth performance, muscle protein deposition, muscle nucleic acid and amino acid contents, and muscle proteome of broilers, 160 one-day-old male partridge shank broiler chickens were randomly divided into 2 groups with 8 replicates of 10 broilers each. Broilers were fed a basal diet alone, or a basal diet supplemented with 1000 mg/kg betaine. Compared with the control group, the betaine group significantly increased (p < 0.05) the broilers average daily gain, the levels of serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), growth hormone (GH), total protein (TP), the contents of muscle absolute protein deposition, RNA, Ser, Glu, Met, and Phe, and the ratio of RNA/DNA, and decreased (p < 0.05) the feed conversion ratio and serum blood urea nitrogen content. Moreover, proteomic analysis revealed 35 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in the betaine group compared with the control group, including 27 upregulated proteins and 8 downregulated proteins (p < 0.05). These DAPs were mainly related to cell differentiation, small molecule metabolic process, and tissue development. In conclusion, diets supplemented with 1000 mg/kg betaine improved growth performance and muscle protein deposition of broilers. Increased serum GH, IGF-1, and TP contents, and alterations in muscle nucleic acids, amino acids, and protein abundance levels were involved in this process.

AB  - Endotherms vary widely in their capacity to defend sublethal body temperature (T-b) during acute heat exposure. Interspecific variation in the upper thermal limits of small mammals remains poorly studied, particularly in taxa other than bats. We hypothesised that rupicolous elephant shrews (Macroscelidae), on account of their occupancy of above-ground rock crevices in hot habitats and rapid cursorial locomotion, have evolved pronounced heat tolerance capacities. To test this hypothesis, we quantified relationships between T-b, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL) in western rock elephant shrews (Elephantulus rupestris) exposed to air temperature (T-air) approaching or exceeding T-b under conditions of low humidity representative of the study population's arid, winter-rainfall habitat in western South Africa. Our data revealed a pronounced capacity to tolerate T-air > T-b, with E. rupestris tolerating T-air up to 48.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C while defending T-b > 7 degrees C below T-air (maximum T-b = 41.64 +/- 0.16 degrees C). Three behavioural pathways were employed to dissipate heat: open mouth panting, flattening their body posture, and nose-licking. At the highest experimental T-air values achieved, EWL increased 15.05-fold relative to normothermic levels and heat was dissipated evaporatively at rates equivalent to 174%-240% of metabolic heat production. The heat tolerance limit of T-air = 48 degrees C in E. rupestris is one of the highest yet recorded in a non-volant small mammal, and our data support the notion that elephant shrews possess a pronounced capacity to avoid lethal hyperthermia during acute heat exposure.

The new species, Rhinogobius yangminshanensis n. sp. with fluvial life history can be well distinguished from other congeners by the following combination of features: (1) fin rays: second dorsal fin rays I/9; anal fin rays I/8; pectoral fin rays modally 16; (2) squamation: longitudinal scale series 28-30 (modally 29); perdorsal scales 9-10 (modally 9); (4) vertebral count 27; (5) rear edge of mouth: merely extending to vertical of anterior margin of pupil in male and (6) specific colouration: lateral side with 6-7 longitudinal rows of bright orange to orange red spots in male which general size about 1/2 of pupil diameter. Cheek and opercle with 24-35 orange spots in male. Branchiostegal membrane with many minute orange spots in male. Caudal fin with distally orange zone in male with about 3 vertical rows of orange or orange red spots. First dorsal fin with broad orange band on distally 1/3 area. A middle black spot in abterior first dorsal fin. Pectoral fin with two rows red orange spots in male. The phylogenetic comparisons have revealed that the great mitogenetic differences of R. yangminshanensis with all other congeneric species and sister species would be R. rubromaculatus in Taiwan. A diagnostic key to all valid species of Rhinogobius from Taiwan is also provided.

In this paper, specimens of the genus Hippocrepis parasitizing Holochilus brasiliensis from Argentina are studied on the basis of morphological and molecular characteristics. Eleven Ho. brasiliensis specimens were collected in seven localities from the Cuenca del Plata region. A total of 192 specimens of digeneans were found in a single Ho. brasiliensis. Conventional morphological and molecular analyses were used. The digenean specimens were identified as Hippocrepis fuelleborni. Furthermore, the molecular characterization of three genetic markers for Hi. fuelleborni is provided. This study contributes to the first record of the genus Hippocrepis in cricetid rodents. The continuity of the studies on this genus and the incorporation of more haplotypes from different genera of Notocotylidae will allow us to recognize the relationship among genera and provide a new systematic proposal.

AB  - The San Quintin Kangaroo Rat, a rodent species microendemic to the San Quintin-El Rosario region in Baja California that was considered potentially extinct in the wild, was recently rediscovered. This stimulated subsequent searches by us throughout its known distribution range and on sites that seemed suitable beyond its limits. We captured the species at 19 out of 42 localities surveyed, of which 6 are beyond its historically known distribution range, expanding the latter by similar to 60 km. Most sites occupied by the species occur on abandoned farmland in early ecological successional stages. Our data support that in the highly transformed agricultural landscape into which the region was converted in the 20th century, the species was able to survive undetected and colonize/recolonize sites once habitat became adequate after agricultural abandonment. This exhibits that the species is highly resilient and persisted as a metapopulation. Further research and conservation actions must be framed within context of the region's agricultural development.

AB  - In mammals, sound is detected by mechanosensory hair cells that are activated in response to vibrations at frequency-dependent positions along the cochlear duct. We demonstrate that inner ear supporting cells provide a structural framework for transmitting sound energy through the cochlear partition. Humans and mice with mutations in GAS2, encoding a cytoskeletal regulatory protein, exhibit hearing loss due to disorganization and destabilization of microtubule bundles in pillar and Deiters' cells, two types of inner ear supporting cells with unique cytoskeletal specializations. Failure to maintain microtubule bundle integrity reduced supporting cell stiffness, which in turn altered cochlear micromechanics in Gas2 mutants. Vibratory responses to sound were measured in cochleae from live mice, revealing defects in the propagation and amplification of the traveling wave in Gas2 mutants. We propose that the microtubule bundling activity of GAS2 imparts supporting cells with mechanical properties for transmitting sound energy through the cochlea.

AB  - The production of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is seriously threatened by various leaf-feeding insects, and wild soybean [Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc.] has a greater resistance capacity and genetic diversity. In this study, a natural population consisting of 121 wild soybean accessions was used for detecting insect resistance genes. The larval weight (LW) of the common cutworm (CCW), the resistance level (RL) and the index of damaged leaf (IDL) were evaluated as resistance indicators to herbivores. An association synonymous SNP AX-94083016 located in the coding region of the respiratory burst oxidase gene GsRbohA1 was identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses. The overexpression of GsRbohA1 in soybean hairy roots enhanced resistance to CCW. One SNP in the promoter region cosegregated with AX-94083016 contributing to soybean resistance to CCW by altering GsRbohA1 gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Two major haplotypes, GsRbohA1(A) and GsRbohA1(G), were identified based on the SNP. The resistant haplotype GsRbohA1(A) predominates in wild soybeans, although it has been gradually lost in landraces and cultivars. The nucleotide diversity around GsRbohA1 is much lower in landraces and cultivars than in its ancestors. In conclusion, a new resistant haplotype, GsRbohA1(A), was identified in wild soybean, which will be a valuable gene resource for soybean insect resistance breeding through introducing into improvement lines, and it offers a strategy for exploring resistance gene resources from its wild relatives.

AB  - Alternative polyadenylation (APA) affects the composition of cis-elements in 3'-untranslated region (3'- UTR), to regulate gene expression and localization, and subsequently the downstream biological pro-cesses. Acute heat stress could change rapidly the cellular transcriptome, however the underlying mo-lecular changes are less explored. Here, we systematically catalogued the global 3'-UTRome dynamics, by analyzing our previously reported transcriptome sequencing data of porcine immature Sertoli (iST) cells before (Control group), acute heat stress treatment at 43 degrees C for 0.5h (HS0.5 group), and 36h recovery culture (HS0.5-R36h group) after acute heat stress treatment. After three group comparisons (HS0.5 vs. Control, HS0.5-R36 vs. HS0.5, and HS0.5-R36 vs. Control), DaPars (dynamic analysis of alternative pol-yadenylation) identified 639, 464 and 290 mRNAs, and APAtrap (a tool to identify APA sites and detect changes of APA site usage) identified 713, 518 and 321 mRNAs, with significantly different 3'-UTRs (Padj.<= 0.05), respectively. These genes with different 3'-UTR patterns were mainly enriched in P53, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, HIF-1, apoptosis, PI3K-Akt and AMPK signaling pathways. Further analysis identified that average 3'-UTR lengths of Acss2, Inpp1 and Nr1h4 were more than 140 nt longer (HS0.5-R36 vs. HS0.5), and contained different cis-elements (PAS, CPE and microRNA binding sites). Moreover, Hsp70.2, Inhbb and Dhrs were identified to have extremely different 3'-UTR abundances. Further 3'RACE assays validated several 3'-UTRs of Nr1h4, and RT-qPCR confirmed the abundance changes of different 3'- UTR isoforms for Nr1h4 and Hsp70.2. Our findings provide useful information and resources to further uncover the molecular role of 3'-UTR, in regulating the response of porcine iST cells to acute heat stress. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. One of its pathological hallmarks is A beta accumulation, which is influenced by APOE genotype and expression, as well as by sleep homeostasis. However, conflicting mechanisms for APOE roles in A beta clearance have been reported, and the relationship between APOE and sleep also remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate how hormonal alteration caused by sleep deprivation affects APOE and its receptors in rats, and to evaluate the role of different cell types in A ss clearance. Paradoxical sleep deprivation for 96 h increased A beta level in hippocampus with concomitant reduction of APOE and LRP1 at the time point within the resting period. Sleep deprivation also significantly reduced T4 levels in both active and resting times. To evaluate the effect of T4 variation, C6 glial cells and primary brain endothelial cells were treated with T4. High T4 level (300 ng/mL) increased APOE, but reduced LRP1 and LDL-R in C6 cells, while in primary endothelial cells, LDL-R levels were increased. Treatment of C6 cells with exogenous APOE reduced LRP1 and A beta uptake. These results suggest that T4 modulates LRP1 and LDL-R in both cell types, but in the opposite manner, thus, sleep deprivation might modify the ratio of the receptors in blood-brain barrier and glial cells by altering T4 levels. Considering that LRP1 and LDL-R are important for A beta clearance, sleep deprivation might also affect the degree of participation of glia in A beta clearance, and consequently, turnover of A beta in the brain.

AB  - Heteromormyrus Steindachner, 1866, a genus of Mormyridae (Teleostei: Osteoglossomorpha), has been monotypic since the description of Heteromormyrus pauciradiatus (Steindacher, 1866) from a single specimen. No type locality other than "Angola" was given and almost no specimens have been subse-quently identified to this species. In order to investigate the relationship of this taxon to fresh specimens collected in Angola and elsewhere, whole genome paired-end sequencing of DNA extracted from the holotype specimen of Heteromormyrus pauciradiatus was performed and a nearly complete mitogenome assembled from the sequences obtained. Comparison of cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome b sequences from this mitogenome to sequences from recently collected material reveal that Heteromormyrus pauciradiatus is closely related to specimens identified as Hippopotamyrus ansorgii (Boulenger, 1905), Hippopotamyrus szaboi Kramer, van der Bank & Wink, 2004, Hippopotamyrus longilateralis Kramer & Swartz, 2010, as well as to several undescribed forms from subequatorial Africa collectively referred to in the literature as the "Hippopotamyrus ansorgii species complex" and colloquially known as "slender stonebashers." Previous molecular phylogenetic work has shown that these species are not close relatives of Hippopotamyrus castor Pappenheim, 1906, the type species of genus Hippopotamyrus Pappenheim, 1906 from Cameroon, and are thus misclassified. Hippopotamyrus ansorgii species complex taxa and another species shown to have been misclassified, Paramormyrops tavernei (Poll, 1972), are placed in genus Heteromormyrus and one genetic lineage from the Kwanza and Lucala rivers of Angola are identified as conspecific Heteromormyrus pauciradiatus. Three additional new combinations and a synonymy in Mormyridae are introduced. The morphological characteristics and geographical distribution of the genus Heteromormyrus are reviewed. The electric organ discharges (EODs) of Heteromormyrus species are to be treated in a separate study.

AB  - Background The hippocampus plays an important role to support path planning and adjustment in goal-directed spatial navigation. While we still only have limited knowledge about how do the hippocampal neural activities, especially the functional connectivity patterns, change during the spatial path adjustment. In this study, we measured the behavioural indicators and local field potentials of the pigeon (Columba livia, male and female) during a goal-directed navigational task with the detour paradigm, exploring the changing patterns of the hippocampal functional network connectivity of the bird during the spatial path learning and adjustment. Results Our study demonstrates that the pigeons progressively learned to solve the path adjustment task after the preferred path is blocked suddenly. Behavioural results show that both the total duration and the path lengths pigeons completed the task during the phase of adjustment are significantly longer than those during the acquisition and recovery phases. Furthermore, neural results show that hippocampal functional connectivity selectively changed during path adjustment. Specifically, we identified depressed connectivity in lower bands (delta and theta) and elevated connectivity in higher bands (slow-gamma and fast-gamma). Conclusions These results feature both the behavioural response and neural representation of the avian spatial cognitive learning process, suggesting that the functional disarrangement and reorganization of the connectivity in the avian hippocampus during different phases may contribute to our further understanding of the potential mechanism of path learning and adjustment.

AB  - Herbivory, and thus, the ability to acquire energy from consuming plant material, evolved numerous times independently within vertebrates. Several mechanical solutions for processing plant material have emerged along with the independent rise of herbivorous feeding strategies. Comparative studies of these mechanical solutions suggest that herbivory might generally relate to "improved" and hence comparatively effective food processing mechanisms, often involving the jaws. Such processing behaviours involving the jaws can be referred to as chewing sensu lato. While herbivory is relatively common among vertebrates, it is generally believed that salamanders exclusively feed on other animals (i.e., carnivory). Further, it had been hypothesized that salamander food processing is limited to "simple" and comparably ineffective puncture crushing movements (i.e., opening and closing movements of the jaws in combination with pointed teeth), which may not be efficient enough to break down plant material. However, sirenid salamanders (i.e., dwarf sirens and sirens, genera Pseudobranchus and Siren respectively) have long been reported to consume large amounts of plant material besides feeding on animal prey. Additionally, some sirenids have only recently been shown to apply complex three-dimensional chewing behaviours. These complex chewing behaviours could potentially enable the mechanical breakdown of plant material. Here we comparatively study sirens with particular regards to the form and function of their feeding apparatus and their feeding habits. We demonstrate that sirenids generally seem to apply complex chewing mechanisms and, in fact, consume both plant-and animal foods. Comparative gastrointestinal morphology, however, suggests that among sirenids, only sirens are apt to digest and extract energy from plant material, suggesting that dwarf sirens may not benefit from the energy of their "plant food", while sirens appear to be facultative herbivorous -or better, omnivorous. Consequently, our results indicate that some salamanders can eat, process, and acquire energy from plant material, hence, contradicting the commonly accepted idea that salamanders are generally carnivorous.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in animal mating systems can have important implications for ecological, evolutionary and demographic processes in wild populations. For example, patterns of mating can impact social structure, dispersal, effective population size and inbreeding. However, few species have been studied in sufficient detail to elucidate mating system plasticity and its dependence on ecological and demographic factors. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) have long been regarded as a textbook example of a polygynous mating system, with dominant 'beachmaster' males controlling harems of up to several hundred females. However, behavioural and genetic studies have uncovered appreciable geographic variation in the strength of polygyny among elephant seal populations. We, therefore, used molecular parentage analysis to investigate patterns of parentage in a small satellite colony of elephant seals at the South Shetland Islands. We hypothesised that dominant males would be able to successfully monopolise the relatively small numbers of females present in the colony, leading to relatively high levels of polygyny. A total of 424 individuals (comprising 33 adult males, 101 adult females and 290 pups) sampled over 8 years were genotyped at 20 microsatellites and reproductive success was analysed by genetically assigning parents. Paternity could only be assigned to 31 pups (10.7%), despite our panel of genetic markers being highly informative and the genotyping error rate being very low. The strength of inferred polygyny was weak in comparison to previous genetic studies of the same species, with the most successful male fathering only seven pups over the entire course of our study. Our results show that, even in a species long regarded as a model for extreme polygyny, male reproductive skew can vary substantially among populations.

AB  - The history of human prion diseases began with the original description, by Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt and by Alfons Maria Jakob, of patients with a severe brain disease that included speech abnormalities, confusion, and myoclonus, in a disease that was then named Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD). Later, in Papua New Guinea, a disease characterized by trembling was identified, and given the name "Kuru". Neuropathological examination of the brains from CJD and Kuru patients, and of brains of sheep with scrapie disease revealed significant similarities and suggested a possible common mode of infection that, at the time, was thought to derive from an unknown virus that caused slow infections. John Stanley Griffith hypothesized that the agent causing these diseases was "probably a protein without nucleic acid" and, in 1982, Stanley Prusiner reported the identification of a proteinaceous infectious particle (coining the term prion) that was resistant to inactivation methods that were at the time standard for nucleic acids, and identified PrP as the major protein component of the infectious agent in scrapie and in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, classifying this also as a prion disease. Interestingly, the prion concept had been previously expanded to yeast proteins capable of replicating their conformation, seeding their own aggregation and transmitting phenotypic information. The prion concept has been more recently expanded to refer to misfolded proteins that are capable of converting a normal form of a protein into an abnormal form. The quest to understand and treat prion diseases has united a specific research community around the topic, and regular meetings (Prion Meetings) have taken place over the years to enable discussions, train junior researchers, and inspire research in the field.

AB  - The intestinal trematode fauna of the Water Vole Arvicola amphibius, (previously A. terrestris), was investigated to determine whether it might provide evidence of an animal component in the diet of this aquatic herbivorous small mammal. Interrogation of the electronic Host-Parasite Database of the Natural History Museum London revealed the presence of fourteen species of intestinal trematode in water voles, infection with each of which would require the ingestion of tissue from an animal intermediate host. The results obtained using these parasite indicators provide convincing evidence of animal components in the diet of A. amphibius and support anecdotal reports of water voles feeding on animal material in the field.

The new species, Rhinogobius baborinisanensis n. sp. which is collected from northern Taiwan can be well distinguished from all other congeners by the unique combination of the following features: (1) fins: second dorsal fin rays modally I/8; anal fin rays I/7; pectoral fin rays modally 17; (2) squamation: longitudinal scale series 32-34 (modally 33); perdorsal scales usually 13-14; scale series from origin of first dorsal fin to upper pectoral fin origin modally 10; (3) vertebral count 27; (4) rear edge of mouth merely extending to or slightly beyond vertical of anterior margin of pupil in male and (5) its own specific colouration. Another new species, Rhinogobius macromaculatus n. sp. which is collected from southern Taiwan can be well distinguished from all other congeners by the unique combination of the following features: (1) fins: second dorsal fin rays modally I/8; anal fin rays I/7; pectoral fin rays modally 15; (2) squamation: longitudinal scale series 27-28 (modally 28); perdorsal scales usually 14-15; scale series from origin of first dorsal fin to upper pectoral fin origin modally 8; (3) vertebral count 27; (4) rear edge of mouth extending slightly beyond vertical of anterior margin of pupil in male and (5) its own specific colouration. The brief comparison and discussion of morphological differentiation from congeners would be also addressed.

AB  - Taxonomy of the genus Rhinogobius was investigated for the first time in Central Vietnam. Five species occurring in this region can be distinguished by shape of their head, number of pectoral-fin rays, vertebral counts, arrangements of scales and cutaneous sensory papillae, and coloration. Two species are described as new, Rhinogobius rong sp. nov. and R. nami sp. nov., and the remaining three were identified as R. taenigena, R. leavelli, and R. similis. Though the morphology of R. leavelli and R. similis differed slightly between localities, counts and measurements overlapped, and coloration was variable. This study tentatively identifies all of those populations as R. leavelli or R. similis, but further research using additional specimens from a wider geographic range is required to clear the identity of the Rhinogobius occurring in this region. Rhinogobius rong, R. similis, and R. leavelli are distributed in both Da Nang City and Thua Thien Hue Province, with the first two species occurring widely in coastal areas, and R. leavelli restricted to inland areas. On the other hand, Rhinogobius nami and R. taenigena occur only in inland areas of Da Nang City and Thua Thien Hue Province, respectively.

AB  - Reorganization of the maternal brain upon childbirth triggers the species-typical maternal social behavior. These brief social moments carry profound effects on the infant's brain and likely have a distinct signature in the maternal brain. Utilizing a double-blind, within-subject oxytocin/placebo administration crossover design, mothers' brain was imaged twice using fMRI while observing three naturalistic maternal-infant contexts in the home ecology; `unavailable', `unresponsive', and `social', when mothers engaged in synchronous peek-a-boo play. The social condition elicited greater neural response across the human caregiving network, including amygdala, VTA, hippocampus, insula, ACC, and temporal cortex. Oxytocin impacted neural response primarily to the social condition and attenuated differences between social and non-social stimuli. Greater temporal consistency emerged in the `social' condition across the two imaging sessions, particularly in insula, amygdala, and TP. Findings describe how mother's brain varies by caregiving experiences and gives salience to moments of social synchrony that support infant development and brain maturation.

AB  - Chiral assemblies by combining natural biomolecules with plasmonic nanostructures hold great promise for plasmonic enhanced sensing, imaging, and catalytic applications. Herein, we demonstrate that human serum albumin (HSA) and porcine serum albumin (PSA) can guide the chiral assembly of gold nanorods (GNRs) with left-handed chiroptical responses opposite to those by a series of other homologous animal serum albumins (SAs) due to the difference of their surface charge distributions. Under physiological pH conditions, the assembly of HSA or PSA with GNRs yielded left-handed twisted aggregates, while bovine serum albumin (BSA), sheep serum albumin, and equine serum albumin behaved on the contrary. The driving force for the chiral assembly is mainly attributed to electrostatic interaction. The opposite chiroptical signals acquired are correlated with the chiral surface charge distributions of the tertiary structures of SAs. Moreover, the chirality of the assembly induced by both HSA and BSA can be enhanced or reversed by adjusting the pH values. This work provides new insights into the modulation of protein-induced chiral assemblies and promotes their applications.

AB  - Background Postzygote isolation is an important part of species isolation, especially for fish, and it can be divided into two aspects: genetic isolation and ecological isolation. With the increase in parental genetic distance, the intensity of genetic isolation between them also increases. Will the increase in parental ecological niche differences also lead to the increase in ecological isolation intensity between them? This question is difficult to answer based on the current literature due to the lack of hybridization cases of contrasting ecological niche parents. Results Cyprinid fish parents (Schizothorax wangchiachii and Percocypris pingi) with contrasting ecological niches (herbivorous and carnivorous) and their F1 hybrids were used as research objects. Fish and periphytic algae were selected as food corresponding to different parental resources. The foraging-related traits of these hybrids are generally the same between parents; however, the intermediate foraging traits of hybrids did not result in intermediate foraging performance for parental resources, and these hybrids could hardly forage for parental resources. The poor foraging performance of these hybrids for parental resources was caused not only by the decline in the foraging ability of these hybrids but, more importantly, by the decrease in foraging activity. Interestingly, these hybrids initially showed a high interest in foraging small fishes; however, after the first successful capture, these hybrids had difficulty ingesting fish and spit them out, which led to the subsequent decrease in foraging activity. We designed a series of experiments to explore the mechanism of the fish spitting of these hybrids, excluding the taste and the size of prey, and found that the decrease in their pharyngeal tooth puncture ability may be the reason. Conclusions This study was the first to demonstrate that these parents with contrasting ecological niches will produce great postzygotic ecological isolation for parental resources. The poor foraging performance of these hybrids for parental resources is mainly due to the decrease in foraging activity. Interestingly, these hybrids have obvious fish-spitting behaviour, which is a typical example of the incompatibility between intermediate traits and genetic behaviors.

AB  - Evident similarities in pathological features in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) raise the question of a role for natural age-related adaptive mechanisms in the prevention/elimination of disturbances in interrelations between different brain areas. In our previous electroencephalogram (EEG) studies on 5xFAD- and FUS-transgenic mice, as models of AD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), this suggestion was indirectly confirmed. In the current study, age-related changes in direct EEG synchrony/coherence between the brain structures were evaluated. Methods: In 5xFAD mice of 6-, 9-, 12-, and 18-month ages and their wild-type (WT5xFAD) littermates, we analyzed baseline EEG coherence between the cortex, hippocampus/putamen, ventral tegmental area, and substantia nigra. Additionally, EEG coherence between the cortex and putamen was analyzed in 2- and 5-month-old FUS mice. Results: In the 5xFAD mice, suppressed levels of inter-structural coherence vs. those in WT5xFAD littermates were observed at ages of 6, 9, and 12 months. In 18-month-old 5xFAD mice, only the hippocampus ventral tegmental area coherence was significantly reduced. In 2-month-old FUS vs. WTFUS mice, the cortex-putamen coherence suppression, dominated in the right hemisphere, was observed. In 5-month-old mice, EEG coherence was maximal in both groups. Conclusion: Neurodegenerative pathologies are accompanied by the significant attenuation of intracerebral EEG coherence. Our data are supportive for the involvement of age-related adaptive mechanisms in intracerebral disturbances produced by neurodegeneration.

AB  - Background and Objective Dentate gyrus (DG) has a high density of 5-HT1A receptors. It has neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is involved in neural excitability. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of 5-HT1A receptors and nNOS of DG in perforant path kindling model of epilepsy. Material and Methods To achieve this purpose, a receptor antagonist (WAY100635, 0.1 mg/kg, intracerebroventricular, i.c.v) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (7-NI, 15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.) were injected during kindling aquisition. Adult male Wistar rats (280 +/- 20 g) were used in this study Animals were kindled through the daily administration of brief electrical stimulations (10 stimulations per day) to the perforant pathway. Field potential recordings were performed for 20 min in DG beforehand. Additionally, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression rate in the DG was determined using immunohistochemistry as a highly specific marker for glia. Results WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the kindling threshold compared to the kindled + vehicle group (P < 0.001). The co-administration of WAY100635 with 7-NI, exerted a significant anticonvulsive effect. Furthermore, the slope of field Excitatory Post Synaptic Potentials (fEPSP) at the end of 10 days in the kindled + 7-NI + WAY100635 group was significantly lower than in the kindled + vehicle group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed that the density of GAFP(+) cells in the kindled + 7-NI + WAY100635 group was significantly higher than in the kindled + vehicle group (P < 0.001). Conclusion Our data demonstrate that antagonists of 5-HT1A receptors have proconvulsive effects and that astrocyte cells are involved in this process, while nNOS has an inhibitory effect on neuronal excitability.

AB  - Dysregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis is linked to several neurodegenereative diseases, where boosting hippocampal neurogenesis in these patients emerges as a potential therapeutic approach. Accumulating evidence for a neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin (GAL) interaction was shown in various limbic system regions at molecular-, cellular-, and behavioral-specific levels. The purpose of the current work was to evaluate the role of the NPY and GAL interaction in the neurogenic actions on the dorsal hippocampus. We studied the Y1R agonist and GAL effects on: hippocampal cell proliferation through the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the expression of neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic factors, and the survival of neurons and neurite outgrowth on hippocampal neuronal cells. The functional outcome was evaluated in the object-in-place task. We demonstrated that the Y1R agonist and GAL promote cell proliferation and the induction of neuroprotective factors. These effects were mediated by the interaction of NPYY1 (Y1R) and GAL2 (GALR2) receptors, which mediate the increased survival and neurites' outgrowth observed on neuronal hippocampal cells. These cellular effects are linked to the improved spatial-memory effects after the Y1R agonist and GAL co-injection at 24 h in the object-in-place task. Our results suggest the development of heterobivalent agonist pharmacophores, targeting Y1R-GALR2 heterocomplexes, therefore acting on the neuronal precursor cells of the DG in the dorsal hippocampus for the novel therapy of neurodegenerative cognitive-affecting diseases.

AB  - High-penetrance mutations affecting mental health can involve genes ubiquitously expressed in the brain. Whether the specific patterns of dysfunctions result from ubiquitous circuit deficits or might reflect selective vulnerabilities of targetable subnetworks has remained unclear. Here, we determine how loss of ubiquitously expressed fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the cause of fragile X syndrome, affects brain networks in Fmr1y/ - mice. We find that in wild -type mice, area -specific knockout of FMRP in the adult mimics behavioral consequences of area -specific silencing. By contrast, the functional axis linking the ventral hippocampus (vH) to the prelimbic cortex (PreL) is selectively affected in constitutive Fmr1y/ - mice. A chronic alteration in late -born parvalbumin interneuron networks across the vH-PreL axis rescued by VIP signaling specifically accounts for deficits in vH-PreL theta -band network coherence, ensemble assembly, and learning functions of Fmr1y/ - mice. Therefore, vH-PreL axis function exhibits a selective vulnerability to loss of FMRP in the vH or PreL, leading to learning and memory dysfunctions in fragile X mice.

AB  - Despite the worldwide importance of disease complexes involving root-feeding nematodes and soilborne fungi, there have been few in-depth studies on how these organisms interact at the molecular level. Previous studies of guava decline have shown that root exudates from Meloidogyne enterolobii-parasitized guava plants (NP plants), but not from nematode-free plants (NF plants), enable the fungus Neocosmospora falciformis to rot guava roots, leading to plant death. To further characterize this interaction, NP and NF root exudates were lyophilized; extracted with distinct solvents; quantified regarding amino acids, soluble carbohydrates, sucrose, phenols, and alkaloids; and submitted to a bioassay to determine their ability to enable N. falciformis to rot the guava seedlings' roots. NP root exudates were richer than NF root exudates in amino acids, carbohydrates, and sucrose. Only the fractions NP-03 and NP-04 enabled fungal root rotting. NP-03 was then sequentially fractionated through chromatographic silica columns. At each step, the main fractions were reassessed in bioassay. The final fraction that enabled fungal root rotting was submitted to analysis using high performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence, and computational calculations, leading to the identification of 1,5-dinitrobiuret as the predominant substance. In conclusion, parasitism by M. enterolobii causes an enrichment of guava root exudates that likely favors microorganisms capable of producing 1,5-dinitrobiuret in the rhizosphere. The accumulation of biuret, a known phytotoxic substance, possibly hampers root physiology and the innate immunity of guava to N. falciformis.

AB  - A medium-sized mammals selection as food diet for pup performed by adult wolves has been previously hypothesized. In this work the diet of wolf pups living in an anthropic area in Italy has been investigated to assess which prey potentially played a key role in their sustenance. Although wild ungulates were the main prey category for both pups and adults a significantly high occurrence of medium-size mammals (hare and coypu) and birds in pup diet has been recorded. Such result could confirm a selective food provision by adult wolves. Further investigations to assess the importance of this kind of prey for pup survival are desirable.

AB  - Although stress can cause overall damage to the genome, it is currently unknown whether normal background damage to DNA varies throughout the annual cycle. If DNA damage did vary seasonally, it would have major implications on environmental-genomic interactions. We measured background DNA double-stranded breaks using the neutral comet assay in five tissues (nucleated red blood cells, abdominal fat, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and liver) in four cohorts of house sparrows (Passer domesticus): free-living summer, captives on a summer light cycle, free-living winter, and captives on a winter light cycle. The experiment was designed to answer three questions: (1) Is red blood cell DNA damage representative of other tissues? (2) Is DNA damage in captive birds representative of DNA damage in free-living birds? (3) Does DNA damage show seasonality? We found that (1) blood is a representative tissue, (2) captive animals are representative of free-living animals, and (3) DNA damage is higher in the summer than in the winter. These data indicate that red blood cells can be an index of DNA damage throughout the body and that background levels of DNA damage show substantial seasonal variation. The latter result suggests the possibility that underlying molecular mechanisms of DNA damage and/or repair also change seasonally.

AB  - Porcupines, members of the Hystricidae family, represent a unique group of herbivorous mammals. This study details the identification of a newly discovered mandible fragment of Hystrix primigenia, along with a right cheek tooth series from the middle Turolian Kemiklitepe-A fossil locality. While Hystrix fossils are found in numerous localities, the materials are often limited to a few dental fragments or isolated teeth, posing challenges to systematic investigations. The examination of this lower tooth series prompted a comprehensive review of all H. primigenia findings across Eurasia, shedding light on its adaptive characteristics over time and space. Our paleobiogeographical analysis indicates the absence of H. depereti in Late Miocene Turkiye, while the dispersal range of H. primigenia is broader than that of H. depereti in Eurasia. Additionally, the study delves into the discussion of H. primigenia and H. depereti findings in Eurasia, ultimately refining the categorization of Late Miocene Hystrix discoveries in Turkiye to two species: H. primigenia and H. kayae. Our review suggests the possibility of an additional H. kayae finding from Samos, Greece.

AB  - We described the early development of Myloplus asterias and M. lobatus, two fish species of the Serrasalmidae using morphological, meristic, and morphometric characteristics. These herbivores serrasalmids are heavily fished because of their commercial importance in the Amazon. The individuals were collected between 2016 and 2020 in the limnetic zone of open water and macrophyte stands in the Lower Amazon River floodplain. We tested different growth models to identify the development pattern of these species. During the initial ontogeny, these two species can be differentiated mainly by the myomeres total number, 37 to 39 in M. asterias vs. 40 to 41 in M. lobatus, the pigmentation pattern, and dorsal-fin ray numbers. These characteristics are effective in distinguishing these species from other serrasalmids. The morphometric relationships were also different between these two species, showing distinct patterns in growth between the analyzed features. An identification key for larvae of some sympatric Serrasalmidae species from the Amazon basin is presented. Our expectation is that this study will contribute to the knowledge of the initial ontogeny and the biology of fish species in the Neotropical region.

The diet of dingo (Canis lupus dingo), feral cat (Felis catus) and eastern barn owl (Tyto delicatula) were compared using scat, stomach and pellets from a significant conservation reserve in southwest Queensland. Dingo diet was dominated by macropods, while the diet of feral cat and barn owl was dominated by small mammals. We found no remains of threatened species but recommend continued monitoring of predator diet as a tool to assist management.

AB  - Protein engineering approaches have been proposed to improve the inhibitory properties of plant cystatins against herbivorous arthropod digestive proteases, generally involving the site-directed mutagenesis of functionally relevant amino acids or the selection of improved inhibitor variants by phage display approaches. Here, we propose a novel approach where the function-related structural elements of a cystatin are substituted by the corresponding elements of an alternative cystatin. Inhibitory assays were first performed with 20 representative plant cystatins and model Cys proteases, including arthropod proteases, to appreciate the extent of functional variability among the plant cystatin family. The most, and less, potent of these cystatins were then used as 'donors' of structural elements to create hybrids of tomato cystatin SlCYS8 used as a model 'recipient' inhibitor. In brief, inhibitory activities against Cys proteases strongly differed from one plant cystatin to another, with K-i (papain) values diverging by more than 30-fold and inhibitory rates against arthropod proteases varying by up to 50-fold depending on the enzymes assessed. In line with theoretical assumptions from docking models generated for different Cys protease-cystatin combinations, structural element substitutions had a strong impact on the activity of recipient cystatin SlCYS8, positive or negative depending on the basic inhibitory potency of the donor cystatin. Our data confirm the wide variety of cystatin inhibitory profiles among plant taxa. They also demonstrate the usefulness of these proteins as a pool of discrete structural elements for the design of cystatin variants with improved potency against herbivorous pest digestive Cys proteases.

AB  - Asymmetric cell divisions often generate daughter cells of unequal size in addition to different fates. In some contexts, daughter cell size asymmetry is thought to be a key input to specific binary cell fate decisions. An alternative possibility is that unequal division is a mechanism by which a variety of cells of different sizes are generated during embryonic development. We show here that two unequal cell divisions precede neuroblast formation in the C lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans. The equalisation of these divisions in a pig-1/MELK mutant background has little effect on neuroblast specification. Instead, we demonstrate that let-19/MDT13 is a regulator of the proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor hlh-14/ASCL1 and find that both are required to concomitantly regulate the acquisition of neuroblast identity and neuroblast cell size. Thus, embryonic neuroblast cell size in this lineage is progressively regulated in parallel with identity by key neural cell fate regulators. We propose that key cell fate determinants have a previously unappreciated function in regulating unequal cleavage, and therefore cell size, of the progenitor cells whose daughter cell fates they then go on to specify.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryopreservation of porcine oocytes is difficult compared with other species and immature oocytes particularly so compared to the meiotic stage. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a pretreatment with 1 .M paclitaxel (PTX, 30 min exposure) before vitrification to promote the maturation of porcine immature oocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cumulus cell-enclosed oocytes (COs) aspirated from porcine ovaries were divided into three groups: i) non -pretreated with PTX and non-vitrified group (control group); ii) pretreated with PTX and vitrified group (PTX-V group); and iii) non-pretreated with PTX and vitrified group (nPTX-V group). RESULTS: The nuclear maturation rate up to the preovulatory stage was significantly lower (P<0.05) in the nPTX-V group than in the control group, but was similar in the PTX-V and control groups. No significant differences were observed in viability assessed by a normal CO morphology and the embryonic development of oocytes activated by the parthenogenetic stimulation between the PTX-V and control groups, but not the non-PTX-V group. CONCLUSION: PTX may promote the maturation of vitrified porcine immature oocytes.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is a unique beverage crop worldwide, but its yield and quality are adversely affected by Toxoptera aurantii. However, the response mechanisms of tea plants to T. aurantii stress remain poorly known. Herein, we present the life table of T. aurantii on resistant (W016) and susceptible (HJY) tea cultivars, demonstrating that the fitness of T. aurantii on W016 was lower than that on HJY. Integrated metabolic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that T. aurantii feeding activated pathways associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Notably, T. aurantii feeding significantly upregulated the levels of brassinolide and p-coumaryl alcohol in W016 but not in HJY. Furthermore, in vitro enzymatic assays indicated that C. sinensis cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CsCAD1) catalyzes the formation of p-coumaryl alcohol participation in lignin synthesis. Our findings highlight the role of brassinolide-mediated lignin biosynthesis of the tea plant in response to T. aurantii feeding.

AB  - Production and use of plastic products have drastically increased during the past decades and their environmental impacts are increasingly spotlighted. At the same time, coarse wool, a by-product of meat and dairy production, goes largely unexploited in the EU. This paper asks why more coarse wool is not used in consumer goods, such as acoustic and sound-absorbing products, garden products, and sanitary products. This is answered through a SWOT analysis of results from a desktop study and interviews with producers of these products made from wool, as well as policy documents relating to wool, waste, textiles, and plastic. Findings show that on a product level, the many inherent properties of wool create opportunities for product development and sustainability improvements and that using the coarser wool represents an opportunity for replacing plastics in many applications as well as for innovation. This is, however, dependent on local infrastructure and small-scale enterprises, but as such, it creates opportunities for local value chains, value creation, and safeguarding of local heritage. The shift to small-scale and local resource utilization requires systemic change on several levels: Here the findings show that policy can incentivize material usage transitions, but that these tools are little employed currently.

AB  - Porcine embryonic fibroblasts (PEFs) can be directly reprogrammed into porcine induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs). However, the reprogramming process is generally lengthy and inefficient. Here, we established a fast and efficient induction system of piPSCs from porcine Sertoli cells (SCs) via forced expression of pig Yamanaka factors. The alkaline phosphatase (AP)-positive colonies from SCs developed on Day 3 after lentivirus infection, and were expanded and then picked up on Day 7, whereas reprogramming process from PEFs did not show any colonies in the same period. The picked piPSCs strongly expressed pluripotent genes, had the differentiation capacity to three germ layers, and could be also induced into primordial germ cell-like cells. Screening for transcription factor combinations showed that POU class 5 homeobox 1 (OCT4) is the core factor for AP-positive colony formation, and two factors (OCT4 and c-MYC) could successfully reprogram SCs into piPSCs. We then compared the RNA-sequencing data of piPSCs derived from SCs and PEFs, and found that the most significant difference was the activation of Transforming Growth Factor beta signaling pathway. We also compared the RNA levels of SCs and PEFs, and found that SCs exhibited higher Wnt signaling activity and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 expression than PEFs, which might be correlated with higher cell proliferation rate and reprogramming efficiency. In summary, the data demonstrated that starting cell sources of piPSCs significantly affect reprogramming dynamics and SCs could serve as cell sources for efficient reprogramming.

AB  - The brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) is a nocturnal refuge dependent herbivore that can be found from south-east Queensland to East Gippsland in Victoria. Brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies are situated in many different habitat types, and refuge within this habitat is important for their survival. Dingoes coexist with P. penicillata and are perceived to be a threat. This study aimed to determine the link between habitat and P. penicillata behaviour and their interaction with predators. Three P. penicillata colonies were studied within the Little Liverpool Range, Queensland. Images of P. penicillata and dingoes from camera traps were analysed for daily activity patterns and activity overlap between species. Dingo scats were collected and analysed to determine predation. The results indicated that different habitat types change the perceived predation risk and corresponding activity patterns of P. penicillata. Predation risk impacted foraging behaviour, with rock-wallabies in exposed habitat types exhibiting greater predator avoidance behaviours than those in more protected habitat types. The results indicate that brush-tailed rock-wallabies modified their activity patterns according to different habitat types to reduce their risk of predation.

AB  - Background Aphids can be positioned as robust pest insects in farming and as ones of the model organisms for arthropods in molecular biology. Carotenoids are pigments that protect organisms from photooxidative damage caused by excessive light. Aphids were shown to possess genes of fungal origin for carotenoid biosynthesis, whereas a little knowledge was available about the functions of the genes and the biosynthetic pathway. Even carotenoid species contained in aphids were not enough understood. Main purpose of this study is to clarify these insufficient findings. Results The whole carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) was elucidated at the gene level, through comprehensive functional analysis of its carotenogenic genes, using Escherichia coli that synthesized carotenoid substrates, along with structural and quantitative analysis of carotenoids from various aphid species. Four genes were needed to synthesize all carotenoids accumulated in aphids from geranylgeranyl diphosphate. The tor gene mediated desaturation reaction from phytoene to 3,4-didehydrolycopene. It was revealed that a gene designated ApCrtYB3, which was considered to have functionally evolved in aphids, can convert lycopene into uncommon carotenoids with the gamma-ring such as (6 ' S)-beta,gamma-carotene and gamma,gamma-carotene. We further demonstrated that the atypical carotenoids work as ecological indicators for estimating the food chain from aphids to predatory arthropods, and showed that aphids contributed with significant levels to the food chain from insect herbivores to several predatory arthropods, i.e., the red dragonfly (Sympetrum frequens; adults), seven-spotted ladybird (Coccinella septempunctata), and two spiders, Oxyopes sertatus and Nephila clavata. Gut microflora of the dragonfly (mature adults) was also found to include endosymbiotic bacteria such as Serratia symbiotica specific to the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae). Conclusions We revealed the whole carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of aphids, including functional identification of the corresponding genes. Subsequently, we showed that arthropodal food chain can be estimated using the uncommon carotenoids of aphids as ecological indicators. This result indicated that aphids made significant contributions to the food chain of several predatory arthropods including the red-dragonfly adults. Aphids are likely to be positioned as an important "phytochemicals" source for some predatory insects and arachnids, which are often active under bright sunlight.

AB  - Group living animals form striking aggregation patterns and display synchronization, polarization, and collective intelligence. Though many collective behavioral studies have been conducted on small animals like insects and fish, research on large animals is still rare due to the limited availability of field collective data. We used drones to record videos and analyzed the decision-making and behavioral spatial patterns in orientation of Kiang (Tibetan wild ass, Equus kiang). Leadership is unevenly distributed among Kiang, with the minority initiating majority behavior-shift decisions. Decisions of individual to join are driven by imitation between group members, and are largely dependent on the number of members who have already joined. Kiang respond to the behavior and position of neighbors through different strategies. They strongly polarize when moving, therefore adopting a linear alignment. When vigilant, orientation deviation increases as they form a tighter group. They remain scattered while feeding and, in that context, adopt a side-by-side alignment. This study reveals partially-shared decision-making among Kiang, whereby copying neighbors provides the wisdom to thrive in harsh conditions. This study also suggests that animals' spatial patterns in orientation depend largely on their behavioral states in achieving synchronization.

AB  - Sialic acids are used as a receptor by several viruses and variations in the linkage type or C-5 modifications affect the binding properties. A species barrier for multiple viruses is present due to alpha 2,3- or alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids. The C-5 position of the sialic acid can be modified to form N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), which acts as a determinant for host susceptibility for pathogens such as influenza A virus, rotavirus, and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. Neu5Gc is present in most mammals such as pigs and horses but is absent in humans, ferrets, and dogs. However, little is known about C-5 content in wildlife species or how many C-5 modified sialic acids are present on N-linked glycans or glycolipids. Using our previously developed tissue microarray system, we investigated how 2 different lectins specific for Neu5Gc can result in varying detection levels of Neu5Gc glycans. We used these lectins to map Neu5Gc content in wild Suidae, Cervidae, tigers, and European hedgehogs. We show that Neu5Gc content is highly variable among different species. Furthermore, the removal of N-linked glycans reduces the binding of both Neu5Gc lectins while retention of glycolipids by omitting methanol treatment of tissues increases lectin binding. These findings highlight the importance of using multiple Neu5Gc lectins as the rich variety in which Neu5Gc is displayed can hardly be detected by a single lectin.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Radix Bupleuri, also named "Chaihu" in Chinese, is a substance derived from the dry roots of Bupleurum chinense DC. [Apiaceae] and Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd. [Apiaceae]. Radix Bupleuri was initially recorded as a medicinal herb in Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing, the earliest monograph concerning traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Ever since, Radix Bupleuri has been broadly used to alleviate exterior syndrome, disperse heat, modulate the liver-qi, and elevate yang-qi in TCM. Radix Bupleuri has also been utilized as an important component in Xiaoyaosan, a classical formula for relieving depression, which was originated from the famous Chinese medical book called "Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang" in Song Dynasty. Currently, many valuable pharmacological effects of Radix Bupleuri have been explored, such as antidepressant, neuroprotective activities, antiinflammation, anticancer, immunoregulation, etc. Former studies have illustrated that Saikosaponin A (SSa), one of the primary active components of Radix Bupleuri, possesses potential antidepressant properties. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unknown.Aim of the study: We used a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model to explore the ameliorative effects and potential mechanisms of SSa in depressive disorder in vivo.Materials and methods: The CSDS mouse model was established and mice underwent behavioral studies using assays such as the social interaction test (SIT), sucrose preference test (SPT), forced-swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and open field test (OFT). Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and Golgi staining were performed to investigate signaling pathway activity, and alterations in synaptic spines in the hippocampus. To model the anticipated interaction between SSa and Tet1, molecular docking and microscale thermophoresis (MST) techniques were employed. Finally, sh-RNA Tet1 was employed for validation via lentiviral transfection in CSDS mice to confirm the requirement of Tet1 for SSA efficacy.Results: SSa dramatically reduced depressed symptoms, boosted the expression of Tet1, Notch, DLL3, and BDNF, encouraged hippocampus development, and enhanced the dendritic spine density of hippocampal neurons. In contrast, Tet1 knockdown in CSDS mice dampened the beneficial effects of SSa on depressive symptoms.Conclusions: Therefore, our results suggest that SSa significantly activates the Tet1/Notch/DLL3 signaling pathways and promotes hippocampal neurogenesis to exert antidepressant effects in the CSDS mouse model in vivo. The present results also provide new insight into the importance of the Tet1/DLL3/Notch pathways as potential targets for novel antidepressant development.

AB  - Types represent the most important specimens in natural history museums as they define a species and should usually be studied within the framework of revisions and new taxon descriptions, hence their documentation is of high importance. Orthoptera is a medium-size order of insects, but its members are important in many food chains as herbivores and as food for other animals. While the documentation of types in Orthoptera is overall very good thanks to the Orthoptera Species File site, there are still many gaps that need to be filled. The Steinhardt Museum of Natural History in Tel Aviv University holds an interesting collection of orthopterans with a focus on local endemics, which have not or only incompletely been documented in the past. Here, we provide a complete annotated catalogue of the 136 type specimens belonging to 29 orthopteran species in the Museum (SMNHTAU, historically TAU), consisting of 21 holotypes and 115 paratypes. The types of Gryllotalpa tali and Myrmecophilus wahrmani, which should be in the collection according to their original descriptions, were not found despite thorough research, and must be considered lost. This catalogue is an important resource for studies on the local fauna as well as for Orthoptera taxonomic research in general.

AB  - In the process of sympatric species differentiation, which feeding traits are most differentiated? The complete feeding process of capture, ingestion, and digestion requires certain external, as well as internal traits. Therefore, comprehensive comparisons are needed to study fish feeding habits. This study systematically investigated the adaptive radiation and parallel evolution of Schizothorax fishes, and quantified the external, frame, pharyngeal bone, and digestive traits of the systematically differentiated omnivorous Schizothorax davidi and herbivorous S. wangchiachii. A member of their sister genus, the carnivorous Percocypris pingi, was used as an outgroup control to explore the feeding differentiation of sympatric Schizothorax fishes. The results showed that these species had highly differentiated external traits, while the internal traits (pharyngeal bone and digestive traits) showed low differentiation, indicating that predatory traits diverged first in the differentiation of sympatric Schizothorax fishes, while chewing and digestive traits were slower to diverge. Furthermore, we screened 16 continuous feeding traits, and the quantified values of these traits progressively increased or decreased with increasing nutritional level of food. These findings provide a reference for the selection of quantitative indicators in future studies of sympatric species differentiation.

AB  - Non-mammal models are gaining popularity due to their ease of maintenance, low cost and lack of ethical restrictions. As some processes taking place in insect hemocytes are mirrored in human immunocytes, many immunological studies are now turning to the use of insect models like Galleria mellonella. G. mellonella larvae are susceptible to infection by Conidiobolus coronatus: an entomopathogenic fungus causing rhinofacial mycosis in humans. The study examines G. mellonella larvae during C. coronatus infection for the presence of certain compounds known to be involved in the human immunological response (histamine, HSF1, Cysteinyl leukotriene TLR1 and TLR2). G. mellonella larvae were exposed to fully grown fungus, and the results were determined by ELISA tests, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. CysLT showed no significant changes between the control group and the infected larvae. Both histamine and HSF1 levels increased significantly after exposure to C. coronatus. Immunolocalization and flow cytometry of TLR1 and TLR2 proves that both receptors increase their levels due to the fungus infection. Our findings show that the cellular response of the G. mellonella is similar to the human response, indicating that G. mellonella larvae may be considered as a human-like immunological model in further studies.

AB  - Two previously unknown species of Rhinogobius have been discovered in the streams of the Upper Youshui River, within the Yuan River Basin, Xiushan County, Chongqing, China. These new species are named as Rhinogobius sudoccidentalis and Rhinogobius lithopolychroma. Phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial genomes revealed that R. sudoccidentalis is genetically closest to R. reticulatus, while R. lithopolychroma shares the greatest genetic similarity with R. leavelli. Morphological distinctions allow for the clear differentiation of these species. Rhinogobius sudoccidentalis sp. nov. is characterized by having VI-VII rays in the first dorsal fin and I, 8-9 rays in the second dorsal fin. The longitudinal scale series typically consists of 22-24 scales, while the transverse scale series comprises 7-8 scales. Notably, the predorsal scale series is absent and the total vertebrae count is 12+17=29. Rhinogobius lithopolychroma sp. nov. can be distinguished from other species by the presence of 13-15 rays on the pectoral fin. Its longitudinal scale series ranges from 30 to 33 scales, with no scales in the predorsal area. The total vertebral count is 30, with 12 precaudal and 18 caudal vertebrae. The head and body of this species are light gray with irregular orange markings on the cheeks and opercle. Through morphological and molecular analyses, it has been confirmed that R. lithopolychroma and R. sudoccidentalis represent novel species within the Rhinogobius genus.

AB  - The desert rat-kangaroo or 'ngudlukanta' (Caloprymnus campestris) was once sparsely distributed in the Lake Eyre Basin of north-eastern South Australia and adjacent parts of Queensland, but has not been collected since the 1930s. However, numerous reported sightings, including some recent, provide some hope that it may still be extant. In 2018 and 2019, we searched for evidence of this species at sites where it had been collected in the 1930s, and at places where people have since reported seeing an animal that fits its description. Our survey, which analysed data from more than 6000 camera trap nights, 536 predator scats and 226 km of spotlight transects, was the most extensive field-based search ever undertaken for this animal; but we found no evidence for its continued existence. However, our work did detect other threatened species including a range extension for the kowari (Dasyuroides byrnei), thereby demonstrating the value of surveys like this one. Because of the vastness and inaccessibility of much of the terrain comprising the supposed distribution of C. campestris, we do not see our null result as definitive for this poorly surveyed animal; we instead hope that it provides a starting point for future surveys aimed at resolving its status.

AB  - The dynamic balance of Ca2+ in oocytes promotes the recovery of the meiotic arrest phase, consequently promoting oocyte maturation. Hence, the analysis of the maintenance and role of calcium homeostasis in oocytes has important guiding significance for obtaining high-quality eggs and maintaining the development of preimplantation embryos. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) are calcium channel proteins that regulate the dynamic balance between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial Ca2+. Nevertheless, the expression and role of IP3R in normal pig oocytes have not been reported, and other studies have focused on the role of IP3R in damaged cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of IP3R in regulating calcium homeostasis in oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. Our results showed that IP(3)R1 is stably expressed at different stages of porcine oocyte meiosis, IP(3)R1 gradually converges to the cortex, and cortical clusters are formed in MII stages. The loss of IP(3)R1 activity contributeds to the failure of porcine oocyte maturation and cumulus cell expansion, as well as the obstruction of polar body excretion. Further analysis showed that IP(3)R1 plays an important role in affecting calcium balance by regulating the IP(3)R1-GRP75-VDAC1 channel between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during porcine oocyte maturation. Inhibiting IP(3)R1 expression-induced ER dysfunction, contributeding to ER calcium concentration ([Ca2+](ER)) release outwards into mitochondria and causing mitochondrial free calcium concentration ([Ca2+](m)) overload and mitochondrial oxidative stress, which was confirmed by the increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. Thereby, IP(3)R1 plays an important role in affecting calcium balance by regulating the IP(3)R1-GRP75-VDAC1 channel between mitochondria and the ER during porcine oocyte maturation, inhibiting IP(3)R1 expression-induced calcium overload and mitochondrial oxidative stress, and increasing ROS levels and apoptosis.

AB  - Amphibians and fish often regenerate lost parts of their appendages (tail, limb, and fin) after amputation. Limb regeneration in adult amphibians provides an excellent model for appendage (limb) regeneration through 3D morphogenesis along the proximodistal, dorsoventral, and anteroposterior axes in mammals, because the limb is a homologous organ among amphibians and mammals. However, manipulating gene expression in specific appendages of adult amphibians remains difficult; this in turn hinders elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying appendage regeneration. To address this problem, we devised a system for appendage-specific gene induction using a simplified protocol named the "agarose-embedded heat shock (AeHS) method" involving the combination of a heat-shock-inducible system and insertion of an appendage in a temperature-controlled agarose gel. Gene expression was then induced specifically and ubiquitously in the regenerating limbs of metamorphosed amphibians, including a frog (Xenopus laevis) and newt (Pleurodeles waltl). We also induced gene expression in the regenerating tail of a metamorphosed P. waltl newt using the same method. This method can be applied to adult amphibians with large body sizes. Furthermore, this method enables simultaneous induction of gene expression in multiple individuals; further, the data are obtained in a reproducible manner, enabling the analysis of gene functions in limb and tail regeneration. Therefore, this method will facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying appendage regeneration in amphibians, which can support the development of regenerative therapies for organs, such as the limbs and spinal cord.

AB  - The single-point mutation D26E in human B-tubulin is associated with drug resistance seen with two anti-mitotic taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) when used to treat cancers. The molecular mechanism of this resistance remains elusive. However, docetaxel and a third-generation taxane, cabazitaxel, are thought to overcome this resistance. Here, structural models of both the wildtype (WT) and D26E mutant (MT) human B-tubulin were constructed based on the crystal structure of pig B-tubulin in complex with docetaxel (PDB ID: 1TUB). The three taxanes were docked into the WT and MT B-tubulin, and the resulting complexes were submitted to three independent runs of 200 ns molecular dynamic simulations, which were then averaged. MM/GBSA calculations revealed the binding energy of paclitaxel with WT and MT B-Tubulin to be -101.5 +/- 8.4 and -90.4 +/- 8.9 kcal/ mol, respectively. The binding energy of docetaxel was estimated to be -104.7 +/- 7.0 kcal/mol with the WT and -103.8 +/- 5.5 kcal/mol with the MT B-tubulin. Interestingly, cabazitaxel was found to have a binding energy of -122.8 +/- 10.8 kcal/mol against the WT and -106.2 +/- 7.0 kcal/mol against the MT B-tubulin. These results show that paclitaxel and docetaxel bound to the MT less strongly than the WT, suggesting possible drug resistance. Similarly, cabazitaxel displayed a greater binding propensity against WT and MT B-tubulin than the other two taxanes. Furthermore, the dynamic cross-correlation matrices (DCCM) analysis suggests that the single-point mutation D26E induces a subtle dynamical difference in the ligand-binding domain. Overall, the present study revealed how the single-point mutation D26E may reduce the binding affinity of the taxanes, however, the effect of the mutation does not significantly affect the binding of cabazitaxel.

CP  - 3rd AFOB Malaysia Chapter International Symposium
AB  - Dadih is a dairy product obtained from fermented buffalo milk in West Sumatra, Indonesia. It contains various nutrients and probiotics that are beneficial for prenatal supplementation and pregnancy outcomes. In this study, a pudding enriched with dadih was formulated. The study was conducted in November-December 2019 at the Nutrition Laboratory Andalas University. The design of this study was a True Experiment using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with two replications consisting of four formulas. They were F0, F1, F2, and F3 with the addition of dadih at 0, 80, 90, and 100 g, respectively. Analysis of nutritional value and the number of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) was performed. Based on the nutritional value analysis, 100 g of dadih pudding contains 11.59% of carbohydrate, 1.24% of protein, 1.09% of fat, with a total of 61.13 calories for F0; 10.41% of carbohydrate, 2.29% of protein, 3.29% of fat, with a total of 80.41 calories for F1; 10.12% of carbohydrate, 4.74% of protein, 3.32% of fat, with a total 89.32 calories for F2; and 11.84 % of carbohydrate, 3.05% of protein, 3.13% of fat, with a total 87,73 calories for F3. The result of the LAB test of dadih pudding showed that: F0 at 3.1 x 10(3) (CFU/g); F1 at 1.7 x 10(9) (CFU/g); F2 at 2.4 x 10(9) (CFU/g), and F3 at 2.4 x 10(9) (CFU/g). While the result of the Kruskall Wallis test showed that there was a significant difference between the hedonic test and the hedonic quality test of four dadih pudding formulas (p<0.000). The chosen formula was F3 with the highest nutrition value average of 87.73 kcaL total calories. Dadih pudding is recommended as a food supplementation because it is good for the digestive system and can increase the immune system of pregnant women.

AB  - Knowledge of the Cambodian bat fauna has grown in recent years, although much remains to be learnt. Based on field surveys undertaken throughout the country in 2014-2020 and using morphological (external, cranial and dental characters), genetic and acoustic data, we document the first records of six bat species nationally (Rhinolophus marshalli, R. siamensis, Hipposideros halophvllus, H. lekaguli, Cassistrellus yokdonensis and Eptesicus pachyomus) and the second in-country record for an additional species (Saccolaimus saccolaimus). All of these taxa were encountered in Cambodia's understudied border regions where literature for neighbouring territories suggests future field research will likely reveal other bat species presently unknown in the country. We also comment on the distribution and conservation status of the newly documented taxa, provide a revised checklist of the 80 bat species now confirmed in Cambodia and briefly consider the prospects for future discoveries and bat conservation in the country.

AB  - Water quality degradation can be caused by excessive agricultural nutrient transfers from fertilised soils exposed to wet weather. Mitigation measures within the EU Nitrates Directive aim to reduce this pressure by including 'closed' fertiliser spreading periods during wet months. For organic fertilisers such as slurry and manure, this closed period requires sufficient on-farm winter storage and good weather conditions to relieve storage at the end of the period. Therefore, robust scientific evidence is needed to support the measure. Incidental nutrient transfers of recently applied organic fertilisers in wet weather can also be complicated by synchronous transfers from residual soil stores and tracing is required for risk assessments. The combination of nutrient monitoring and biomarker analyses may aid this and one such biomarker suite is faecal steroids. Accordingly, this study investigated the persistence of steroids and their association with phosphorus during leaching episodes. The focus was on the coupled behaviour of steroids and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in sub-surface hydrological pathways. Cattle slurry was applied to monolith lysimeters either side of a closed period and concentrations of both steroids and TP were monitored in the leachate. The study showed no significant effect of the treatment (average p = 0.17), though tracer concentrations did significantly change over time (average p = 0.001). While the steroidal concentration ratio was validated for herbivorous faecal pollution in the leachate, there was a weak positive correlation between the steroids and TP. Further investigation at more natural scales (hillslope/catchment) is required to confirm tracer behaviours/correlations and to compliment this sub-surface pathway study.

AB  - Many plant species are known to take up metals from the soil and accumulate them to potentially toxic levels. This may provide tolerance to soils with high metal content or a defensive mechanism against herbivores and pathogens. Accumulators, plants that uptake and store elevated concentrations of metals, can be used in phytoremediation as a means to remove metals from contaminated soils. In this study, the native weed Conyza canadensis was grown in soils contaminated with elevated levels of lead (Pb), barium (Ba), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), or chromium (Cr). All metals, except for Cr, were accumulated by the plants. Zinc and Cu, both essential elements, accumulated to the highest levels, while Pb and Ba were present at lower levels. All treatments except Cr showed accelerating rates of accumulation over the eight-week experiment. Barium, Cu, and Cr reduced aboveground biomass of the plants, indicating toxicity or a cost to metal accumulation. Lead and Zn promoted early flowering, while plants accumulating Ba, Cr, and Cu flowered in lower numbers. Overall, C. canadensis has promise in the phytoremediation of Pb, Cu, and Zn.

AB  - Therizinosaurs were a taxon of unusual theropods from North America and Asia. The derived therizinosaur Nothronychus graffami possessed a synsacrum and hip convergent with extant birds. The osteology is figured and described in detail supplemented with material from Nothronychus mckinleyi. Both species exhibit traits convergent with extant birds, ornithischian dinosaurs, and titanosaurs. As preserved, the ilia and sacrum are minimally distorted and apomorphically modified into a synsacrum. The pubes are modified into a mesopubic condition, wherein the pubes are partially retroverted. The femoral shaft has an oval cross-section. As these characters are absent from the basal therizinosaur Falcarius utahensis, they evolved more than once within the maniraptoran lineage. An herbivorous ecology is supported. Both specimens were skeletally mature, based on fusion of the neural spines and scapulocoracoid.

AB  - Using a complex analysis of the molecular genetics, morphological, and ecological characteristics of Hippoboscidae flies, the phylogenetic structure and trends in the evolution of morphological characters that contribute to the ectoparasitic lifestyle of hippoboscid flies of the north of Eurasia were studied for the first time. The research was carried out on 26 Palearctic species from 10 genera. The analysis of molecular phylogeny revealed the levels of clustering of the family with the species predominantly parasitizing mammals or birds, the time of cluster formation, and the divergence of species in the Palearctic conditions. An independent adaptation to birds occurred in the genera Icosta, Pseudolynchia, Ornithoica, and others. Bird parasites are characterized by bifid tarsal claws, long hooks on pulvilli, and long empodium setae (except genus Ornithoica). Mammalian parasites are characterized by simple tarsal claws, short lobes of hooks on pulvilli, and zones on empodium with short setae. Specialization in empodium and pulvillus morphotypes and wing reduction are higher diverged in mammalian parasites than in bird parasites. The decrease of flight ability and wing reduction independently arose in different subfamilies of Hippoboscidae flies. Our results assume that the tribe Ornithomyini is a paraphyletic group, since, according to the complex of morphological features, the genus Ornithoica can be considered a separate lineage of evolution.
   Hippoboscidae flies have a worldwide distribution and are vectors of many dangerous diseases both in mammals and birds. They have unique morphological adaptations, closely related to their ectoparasitic lifestyles, such as wing characteristics and elements of the tarsi-attachment apparatus. These features are of great importance in the evolution of this family. image

AB  - Six amphibian taxa are described within the Pleistocene vertebrate assemblage of the Taurida cave (Crimean Peninsula): Lissotriton sp., Strauchbufo raddei, Bufotes viridis, Rana cf. macrocnemis, Pelophylax ridibundus, and Pelophylax sp. The possible presence of second species of the genus Rana is suggested. Three of described species do not occur on the Crimean Peninsula currently, but apparently inhabited it during the Early Pleistocene. The ranid frogs in Crimea were taxonomically more divers in the Pleistocene than today. Strauchbufo raddei and Bufotes viridis come from different periods of sediment accumulation of the Taurida cave, during the Early Pleistocene and the late Middle Pleistocene, respectively. The presence of the Mongolian toad, Strauchbufo raddei, not previously reported from Crimea, confirms a wide distribution of this species during the Early Pleistocene of Eastern Europe. The Taurida cave represents the first Pleistocene amphibian assemblage of Crimea.

AB  - Two new species of Rhinogobius found in streams on central part of Palawan Island, Philippines are described. The two new species, Rhinogobius estrellae and Rhinogobius tandikan share unique transverse rows of sensory papillae on the cheek with Rhinogobius similis Gill, 1859, but differ from the latter in fin ray counts, arrangement of the scales, etc. The two new species are distinguished from each other by the pectoral-fin ray count, the longitudinal-and predorsal-scale counts, and colouration of the body. Rhinogobius estrellae new species and R. tandikan new species have been found allopatrically in a stream within Malatgao River system flowing into the Sulu Sea and in the Cayulo River flowing into the South China Sea, respectively. The Malatgao River system is the southernmost habitat of the genus Rhinogobius. Rhinogobius similis had been considered as the only member of the most basal lineage of this genus, but our mitochondrial genome analysis suggested that the two new species are additional members of this lineage. They are considered to be relicts of their common ancestor with R. similis, which probably had a wider distribution.

AB  - Intrinsic plasticity, a fundamental process enabling neurons to modify their intrinsic properties, plays a crucial role in shaping neuronal input-output function and is implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite its importance, the underlying molecular mechanisms of intrinsic plasticity remain poorly understood. In this study, a new ubiquitin ligase adaptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type N (PTPRN), is identified as a regulator of intrinsic neuronal excitability in the context of temporal lobe epilepsy. PTPRN recruits the NEDD4 Like E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase (NEDD4L) to Na(V)1.2 sodium channels, facilitating NEDD4L-mediated ubiquitination, and endocytosis of Na(V)1.2. Knockout of PTPRN in hippocampal granule cells leads to augmented Na(V)1.2-mediated sodium currents and higher intrinsic excitability, resulting in increased seizure susceptibility in transgenic mice. Conversely, adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of PTPRN in the dentate gyrus region decreases intrinsic excitability and reduces seizure susceptibility. Moreover, the present findings indicate that PTPRN exerts a selective modulation effect on voltage-gated sodium channels. Collectively, PTPRN plays a significant role in regulating intrinsic excitability and seizure susceptibility, suggesting a potential strategy for precise modulation of Na(V)1.2 channels' function.

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway has a regulatory function in the organogenesis process and cellular homeostasis, switching the cascade reactions of crucial kinases acts to turn off/on the Hippo pathway, altering the downstream gene expression and thereby regulating proliferation, apoptosis, or stemness. Disruption of this pathway can lead to the occurrence of various disorders and different types of cancer. Recent findings highlight the importance of ncRNAs, such as microRNA, circular RNA, and lncRNAs, in modulating the Hippo pathway. Defects in ncRNAs can disrupt Hippo pathway balance, increasing tumor cells, tumorigenesis, and chemotherapeutic resistance. This review summarizes ncRNAs' inhibitory or stimulatory role in - Hippo pathway regulation in cancer and stem cells. Identifying the relation between ncRNAs and the components of this pathway could pave the way for developing new biomarkers in the treatment and diagnosis of cancers.

AB  - The stability of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is maintained through transcriptional silencing by the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Alongside proteostasis, rDNA stability is a crucial factor regulating the replicative lifespan of S. cerevisiae. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is induced by misfolding of proteins or an imbalance of membrane lipid composition and is responsible for degrading misfolded proteins and restoring endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane homeostasis. Recent investigations have suggested that the UPR can extend the replicative lifespan of yeast by enhancing protein quality control mechanisms, but the relationship between the UPR and rDNA stability remains unknown. In this study, we found that the deletion of ARV1, which encodes an ER protein of unknown molecular function, activates the UPR by inducing lipid bilayer stress. In arv1 Delta cells, the UPR and the cell wall integrity pathway are activated independently of each other, and the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway is activated in a manner dependent on Ire1, which mediates the UPR. Activated Hog1 translocates the stress response transcription factor Msn2 to the nucleus, where it promotes the expression of nicotinamidase Pnc1, a wellknown Sir2 activator. Following Sir2 activation, rDNA silencing and rDNA stability are promoted. Furthermore, the loss of other ER proteins, such as Pmt1 or Bst1, and ER stress induced by tunicamycin or inositol depletion also enhance rDNA stability in a Hog1-dependent manner. Collectively, these fi ndings suggest that the induction of the UPR enhances rDNA stability in S. cerevisiae by promoting the Msn2-Pnc1Sir2 pathway in a Hog1-dependent manner.

AB  - The phenotypic plasticity of the digestive system is important to cope with the variations in food quality for wild small mammals, in particular for the lactating females because they must increase food intake to meet the highest energy requirements of offspring. This study aimed to investigate the energy budget and reproductive performance of striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis) fed on a high-fiber or high-fat diet across lactation. Body mass, food intake, resting metabolic rate (RMR), milk energy output (MEO), and litter size and mass were measured at peak lactation. The body composition, digestive enzymes activity, as well as the hypothalamus-driven gene expression relating to orexigenic or anorexigenic neuropeptides was determined at weaning. The food intake at peak lactation was not significantly changed in the females fed on a high-fiber diet, while it was decreased in those fed on a high-fat diet compared with the females fed a control diet. The females fed a high-fiber diet did not change RMR, but decreased MEO, and had smaller litters with lower masses. The females fed a high-fiber diet had a larger stomach, small and large intestine, and caecum, in parallel with increases in maltase and aminopeptidase activity, but these females did not show significant changes in amylase, lipase, lactase, or chymotrypsin compared with the females fed a control diet. The mRNA expression of AgRP was increased, and POMC was decreased in the hamsters fed a high-fiber diet compared with control ones. The high-fat group did not vary from the control group in almost all of the parameters. These findings suggest that the adaptive modulations in the digestive enzyme activity may be maximized at peak lactation, creating a hard limitation for SusEI in response to a high-fiber diet, which may be independent of either orexigenic or anorexigenic neuropeptides .

AB  - Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers with high metastasis and lethality. Arrestin domain-containing 4 (ARRDC4) is involved in inhibiting cancer glycolytic phenotypes. Brusatol (BR), extracted from Bruceae Fructus, exerts good anti-cancer effects against a number of cancers.
   Purpose: In the present study, we aimed to explore the efficacy of BR on inhibiting CRC metastasis and elucidate the underlying mechanisms involving the upregulation of the ARRDC4 expression.
   Methods: Cell viability, colony formation, wound healing and transwell assay were used to detect the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of BR against CRC in vitro. Microarray analysis was performed to find out differential genes in CRC cells after treatment with BR. Analysis of the CRC patients tumor samples and GEPIA database were first conducted to identify the expression of ARRDC4 on CRC. Stable overexpression and knockdown of ARRDC4 CRC cells were established by lentiviral transfection. The role of ARRDC4 in mediating the anti-metastatic effects of BR on CRC was measured using qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis. Orthotopic xenograft and pulmonary metastasis mouse models of CRC were established to determine the anti-cancer and anti-metastatic effects of ARRDC4 and BR.
   Results: BR markedly suppressed the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibited tumor growth and tumor metastasis. Microarray analysis demonstrated that BR treatment markedly increased the gene expression of ARRDC4 in CRC cells. ARRDC4 was significantly repressed in CRC in the clinical samples and GEPIA analysis. ARRDC4 overexpression plus BR produced better inhibitory effects on CRC metastasis than BR treatment alone, while ARRDC4 knockdown could partially eliminate the inhibitory effects of BR against CRC metastasis. BR exerted anti-metastatic effects against CRC via upregulating ARRDC4 and inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processing through modulating PI3K/Hippo pathway.
   Conclusion: This study reported for the first time that BR is a potent ARRDC4 agonist, and is worthy of further development into a new therapeutic strategy for CRC.

AB  - Zerynthia polyxena is a western Palaearctic species listed in the EU Habitats Directive (Natura 2000). This study describes its oviposition and larval preferences at two ruderal habitats in southern Slovakia, near its northern distribution margin. The females preferred oviposition at tall and richly-leafed shoots of the regionally used single host plant Aristolochia clematitis L. Caterpillars were generally located at the same positions as egg batches, mainly at the underside of leaves of richly-leafed plants.

AB  - The home ranges of odd-nosed colobines as reported by a number of studies can vary greatly both within and between taxa. Evaluating Pygathrix, particularly within the context of the odd-nosed colobines, has proven challenging due to the comparable dearth of published data on all three species-Pygathrix nigripes, Pygathrix cinerea, and Pygathrix nemaeus. This dearth has also proven challenging when assessing territoriality within Pygathrix and contextualizing this behavior to odd-nosed colobines. For this study, we set out to assess home range, daily path length, and territoriality in a population of P. nemaeus at Son Tra Nature Reserve in Vietnam. We collected a total of 259 h of behavioral data using 10-min focal follows with 1-min instantaneous scans, including GPS recordings for each follow. We collected phenology and weather data, which were then used with Pearson's correlations to test whether ecological factors influenced variation in ranging or daily path length at both the monthly and seasonal levels. Finally, we used the Mitani-Rodman defendability index to assess territoriality in P. nemaeus. We found that our population of P. nemaeus had a home range of 36.00 ha with a core area of 8.02 ha and an average daily path length of 509.11 +/- 244.87 m. Daily path length was correlated to precipitation such that daily path lengths were shorter during increases in rainfall (r(17) = 0.52, p = .03). These measures resulted in a defendability index of 0.75, suggesting that the population of P. nemaus on Son Tra does not travel far enough each day to actively defend territorial borders.

AB  - The control of glutamate concentration in the synaptic gap is crucial for neuronal communication, preventing excitotoxicity from excessive receptor activation. There are specific transporters in the brain that are responsible for maintaining glutamate homeostasis. The glutamate transporter GLT-1 is mainly localized in astrocytes, and its expression is particularly abundant in the hippocampus. This study explored the role of GLT-1 in memory phases using contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and inhibitory avoidance (IA) tasks. Dihydrokainic acid (DHK), a selective GLT-1 inhibitor, was injected into the dorsal hippocampus of female rats at different times around aversive learning. DHK administration 2 h after weak CFC or IA training sessions improved long-term memory (LTM) formation. However, DHK administration around strong training sessions did not affect consolidation in either task. Moreover, the DHK application 15 min before test sessions impaired short-term memory (STM) and LTM expression in both tasks. In contrast, the antibiotic ceftriaxone (CFT), which increases GLT-1 expression, did not affect the expression of aversive memories. This study highlights the critical role of hippocampal astrocytic glutamate uptake in the formation and expression of aversive memories.image

AB  - The aim of this study is to probe the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of propofol on HT22 cells. HT22 cells treated with different concentrations were sequenced, and then the results of the sequencing were analyzed for dynamic trends. Expression pattern clustering analysis was performed to demonstrate the expression of genes in the significant trend modules in each group of samples. We first chose the genes related to the trend module for WGCNA analysis, then constructed the PPI network of module genes related to propofol treatment group, and screened the key genes. Finally, GSEA analysis was performed on the key genes. Overall, 2,506 genes showed a decreasing trend with increasing propofol concentration, and 1,871 genes showed an increasing trend with increasing propofol concentration. WGCNA analysis showed that among them, turquoise panel genes were negatively correlated with propofol treatment, and genes with Cor R >0.9 in the turquoise panel were selected for PPI network construction. The MCC algorithm screened a total of five key genes (CD86, IL10RA, PTPRC, SPI1, and ITGAM). GSEA analysis showed that CD86, IL10RA, PTPRC, SPI1, and ITGAM are involved in the PRION_DISEASES pathway. Our study showed that propofol sedation can affect mRNA expression in the hippocampus, providing new ideas to identify treatment of nerve injury induced by propofol anesthesia.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of the combination of oviduct fluid flush (OFF) and oviduct epithelial cells (OEC) in modulating the incidence of polyspermy in pigs. Therefore, for in vitro fertilization (IVF), oocyte and sperm were co-cultured in Tris-buffered medium (TBM) either supplemented with 10% OFF (OFFD group), or in the presence of a bovine OEC monolayer (OEC group), or the oocytes were exposed to OFF for 30 min before IVF (OFFB group), or in the presence of an OEC monolayer (OFFB thorn OEC group). Regardless of sperm concentration used (0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 x 105 cells/ml), supplementation of IVF medium with 10% OFF led to an increased (P < 0.05) monospermy rate, without alteration (P > 0.05) of the penetration rate in comparison with the control and OEC groups. When the IVF medium was supplemented with heparin, an overall increase (P < 0.05) of the final output of the IVF system in terms of zygotes with two pronuclei (2PN) was observed in the OFFD group, compared with the control and OEC groups, at a sperm concentration of 4.5 x 105 cells/ml. At this concentration, OFFB improved the monospermy rate but decreased the penetration rate, resulting in low efficiency of monospermic zygotes production. Despite this, no major effect was observed in the developmental competence of the presumed zygotes up to the blastocyst stage. The combination of OFFB with OEC improved the penetration rate, while maintaining the high monospermic rate induced by OFFB. In conclusion, the combination of treatment of oocytes by diluted OFF 30 min before IVF, followed by IVF in the presence of OEC, improved monospermic zygote production without reducing the penetration rate, when the IVF medium was supplemented with heparin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent and toxic environmental pollutant. Gestational exposure to TCDD has been linked to cognitive and motor deficits, and increased incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits in children. Most animal studies of these neurodevelopmental effects involve acute TCDD exposure, which does not model typical exposure in humans.
   OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to establish a dietary low-dose gestational TCDD exposure protocol and performed an initial characterization of the effects on offspring behavior, neurodevelopmental phenotypes, and gene expression.
   METHODS: Throughout gestation, pregnant C57BL/6J mice were fed a diet containing a low dose of TCDD (9 ng TCDD/kg body weight per day) or a control diet. The offspring were tested in a battery of behavioral tests, and structural brain alterations were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging. The dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 area was analyzed. RNA sequencing was performed on hippocampi of postnatal day 14 TCDD-exposed and control offspring. RESULTS: TCDD-exposed females displayed subtle deficits in motor coordination and reversal learning. Volumetric difference between diet groups were observed in regions of the hippocampal formation, mammillary bodies, and cerebellum, alongside higher dendritic arborization of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region of TCDD-exposed females. RNA-seq analysis identified 405 differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus, enriched for genes with functions in regulation of microtubules, axon guidance, extracellular matrix, and genes regulated by SMAD3.
   DISCUSSION: Exposure to 9 ng TCDD/kg body weight per day throughout gestation was sufficient to cause specific behavioral and structural brain phenotypes in offspring. Our data suggest that alterations in SMAD3-regulated microtubule polymerization in the developing postnatal hippocampus may lead to an abnormal morphology of neuronal dendrites that persists into adulthood. These findings show that environmental low-dose gestational exposure to TCDD can have significant, long-term impacts on brain development and function. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7352

AB  - Outdoor group housing is generally reported as being beneficial to the welfare of horses compared to single boxes, being considered to show greater similarities with the living conditions of feral horses, allowing full expression of behaviours such as grazing, social interactions and free movement. However, concerns persist regarding the ability to maintain a good nutritional state and the possibility of acquiring injury. No data reporting a comprehensive assessment of welfare for horses in outdoor group-housing systems are currently available. The present study aimed at applying a scientifically valid welfare assessment protocol to group-housed outdoor horses in 'parcours', a particular management system used in the south of France. 'Parcours' are semi-natural areas, grazed by domestic herbivores located in lowland, mountain, or marsh. One hundred and seventy-one horses older than a year pertaining to six farms and kept on 'parcours' were evaluated by a trained veterinarian using a modified version of the second level Animal Welfare Indicators (AWIN) welfare assessment protocol for horses. No major welfare issues were detected. Horses in 'parcours' displayed few abnormal behaviours, they could move freely for most of the day and interact with conspecifics, maintaining a healthy state of nutrition and a good relationship with humans. The main welfare concerns were related to the presence of superficial integument alterations such as alopecia, difficulty in reaching quality controlled water sources and a lack of shelter. As the number of facilities involved in this study is relatively limited, further harmonised data collection should aim to enlarge the sample size and allow comparison with different outdoor group-housing conditions.

AB  - The reed vole Alexandromys fortis is a small herbivorous species primarily inhabiting open meadows in northern and central Eurasia. While the reed vole population in Mongolia is classified as least concern, there are limited information available about this species. To address this knowledge gap, a s urvey was conducted in the Khonin Nuga region of West Khentey, along the Yeroo River in Northern Mongolia, to assess the physical characteristics and population structure of reed voles. Over the course of a 12-year study, the reed vole population exhibited significant oscillations. Notably, the species demonstrated strong sexual dimorphism, with males consistently displaying larger size than females among all individuals measured. Fur-thermore, an imbalanced sex ratio was observed, with a greater number of males present both in the captured individuals (male-to-female ratio of 1.19:1) and the adult samples (male-to-female ratio of 1.45:1).

AB  - Egg rejection is the most effective and widespread defense used by host species to counteract the extreme fitness costs frequently imposed by obligate avian brood parasites. Yet, the proximate mechanisms underlying between- and within-individual variation in host responses remain poorly explored. Emerging evidence suggests that egg rejection is dependent on individual physiological states, and draws attention to the role of hormones as mediators of flexible antiparasitic responses. In this perspective article, I outline recent advances in our understanding of the proximate factors that mediate egg rejection. I also point out some areas where knowledge remains still lacking, especially those related to the development and maintenance of effective cognitive functions, the potential role of oxidative stress, immunological state, and developmental stressors. I propose new hypotheses that stimulate future research on behavioral host responses toward brood parasitism.

AB  - Natural products and botanicals continue to play a very important role in the development of cosmetics worldwide. The chemical constituents of a fine active fraction of the whole plant extract of Cuphea hookeriana Walp., and the tyrosinase and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) inhibitory and antioxidant activities of this fraction were investigated. The fine active fraction was mainly composed of seven natural compounds. The fine active fraction demonstrated substantial in vitro antioxidant potential using the ABTS assay (IC50 1.66 mu g/mL). It inhibited the two target enzymes (tyrosinase and MMP-1) engaged in skin whitening and aging with comparable IC50 values to the reference drugs. Acute toxicity experiments showed that mice gavage orally with the fine active fraction had no significant animal toxicity at a dose of 2000 mg/kg, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in mice was greater than 2000 mg/kg. In a model where ultraviolet light promotes the increase in melanin secretion in guinea pig skin tissues, both alpha-arbutin and the fine active fraction can reduce melanogenesis, and the effect of the fine active fraction is better than that of alpha-arbutin.

AB  - Porcine in vitro fertilization often results in low embryo development rates compared to other livestock species, which is often associated with either a low fertilization rate or high incidence of polyspermy. Since the quality of oocyte maturation is known to play a significant role in oocyte competence, we investigated the impact of supplementing in vitro maturation (IVM) medium containing porcine follic-ular fluid (pFF) with the growth factors FGF2, LIF and IGF1 (FLI), along with different combinations of cysteine, melatonin and ITS, on cumulus cell expansion, oocyte meiotic maturation, fertilization outcome, embryo development and blastocyst cell numbers. Maturation medium containing pFF yielded the greatest cumulus expansion. Compared to pFF and FLI individually, using pFF and FLI together resulted in the best embryo development rates over total oocyte placed in IVF (12.5% vs. 15.0% vs. 26.6%, respec-tively). Supplementation of IVM medium containing pFF and FLI with either cysteine, melatonin or insulin-transferrin-selenium, revealed that cysteine was essential to improve embryo development, while melatonin and ITS had a limited impact on improving blastocyst rates. Finally, we observed that pig oocytes matured in medium supplemented with pFF, FLI, cysteine and melatonin had a high proportion of monospermic zygotes (68.2%) and low proportion of polyspermic zygotes (15.9%) following IVF and yielded superior cleavage (78.2%) and blastocyst (32.0%) rates.

AB  - Length-weight relationships (LWRs) were estimated for 30 fish species, i.e. Abbottina rivularis, Alburnus chalcoides, A. oblongus, A. taeniatus, Carassius gibelio, Channa argus, Cottus spinulosus, Cyprinus carpio, Gambusia holbrooki, Glyptosternon oschanini, Gobio lepidolaemus, Hemiculter leucisculus, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, Iskandaria kuschakewitschi, Luciobarbus conocephalus, Micropercops cinctus, Opsariichthys bidens, Pelecus cultratus, Petroleuciscus squaliusculus, Pseudorasbora parva, Rhinogobius cf. lindbergi, Rhodeus ocellatus, Sabanejewia aralensis, Salmo oxianus, Schizothorax eurystomus, Triplophysa daryoae, T. elegans, T. ferganaensis, T. labiata, and T. strauchii from the Upper Syr Darya drainage, Uzbekistan. The LWR parameters were determined using a linear logarithmic regression model of the weight against the length, in which values for the slope of the regression, b, that were higher and lower than three indicated positive and negative allometric growth, respectively. The estimated values of parameter b ranged from 2.719 ( Cyprinus carpio) to 3.442 ( Pelecus cultratus). The correlation coefficient (r2) values varied from 0.945 to 0.998, indicating a strong positive relationship between the length and weight. This study established new maximum TLs for three species ( Glyptosternon oschanini, Gobio lepidolaemus, and Petroleuciscus squaliusculus) and presented LWRs for the first time for 17 fish species in the inland waters of Uzbekistan, including seven previously unreported in FishBase.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity damages play a crucial role in the onset and development of depression, especially in the hippocampus, which is more susceptible to stress and the most frequently studied brain region in depression. And, mitochondria have a major function in executing the complex processes of neurotransmission and plasticity. We have previously demonstrated that Iptakalim (Ipt), a new ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel opener, could improve the depressive-like behavior in mice. But the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The present study demonstrated that Ipt reversed depressive-like phenotype in vivo (chronic mild stress-induced mice model of depression) and in vitro (corticosterone-induced cellular model). Further study showed that Ipt could upregulate the synaptic-related proteins postsynaptic density 95 (PSD 95) and synaptophysin (SYN), and alleviated the synaptic structure damage. Moreover, Ipt could reverse the abnormal mitochondrial fission and fusion, as well as the reduced mitochondrial ATP production and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential in depressive models. Knocking down the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (Mito-KATP) channel subunit MitoK partly blocked the above effects of Ipt. Therefore, our results reveal that Ipt can alleviate the abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and function depending on MitoK, contributing to improve synaptic plasticity and exert antidepressive effects. These findings provide a candidate compound and a novel target for antidepressive therapy.

AB  - Rhinovirus infection frequently causes COPD and asthma exacerbations. Impaired anti-viral signaling and reduced viral clearance have both been seen in sick bronchial epithelium, potentially increasing exacerbations. Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), a Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3) ligand, has been shown to cause a viral exacerbation of severe asthma by detecting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The purpose of this work was to determine the effect of a TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor-Calbiochem drug in the prevention of Poly(I:C)-induced airway inflammation following TLR3 activation and to uncover a potential pathway for the cure of asthma through TLR3 inhibition. Mice were sensitized with Poly(I:C) as an asthma model before being challenged by PBS and ovalbumin (OVA) chemicals. The mice were administered a TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor. Throughout the trial, the mice's body weight was measured after each dosage. Biochemical methods are used to analyze the protein as well as enzyme composition in airway tissues. BALF specimens are stained using Giemsa to identify inflammatory cells and lung histopathology to determine morphological abnormalities in lung tissues. By using the ELISA approach, cytokine levels such as TNF-alpha, IL-13, IL-6, IL-5, and IgE antibody expression in lung tissue and blood serum were assessed. TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor drug significantly lowered the number of cells in BALF and also on Giemsa staining slides. It also downregulated the level of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in contrast to OVA and Poly(I:C) administered in animals. A TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor decreased the fraction of oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH, GPx, and CAT) in lung tissues while keeping the mice's body weight constant during the treatment period. By decreasing alveoli, bronchial narrowing, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and granulocyte levels, the TLR3/dsRNA complex blocker significantly reduced the histopathological damage caused by OVA and Poly(I:C) compounds. In an animal model utilizing ovalbumin, TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitors similarly reduced the bronchial damage produced by Poly(I:C). A novel TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor is expected to be employed in clinical studies since it suppresses airway inflammation without inducing antiviral approach resistance.

TI  - ENAMEL HYPOPLASIA AS A STRESS SIGNAL: UNVEILING PALEOENVIRONMENTAL STRESS EPISODES IN THE SIWALIK'S SUIDS OF PAKISTAN FROM THE MIDDLE MIOCENE TO EARLY PLEISTOCENE

AB  - Numerous paleontologists have used research on tooth enamel hypoplasia as a stress signal when assessing paleoenvironments. The goal of the current study was to identify and evaluate stress periods that occurred in the middle Miocene to early Pleistocene eras of the Siwaliks of Pakistan by analyzing enamel hypoplasia in eight extinct suids species: Listriodon pentapotamiae, Tetraconodon minor, Sivachoerus prior, Hippohyus lydekkeri, Hippohyus sivalensis, Hippopotamodon sivalense, Tetraconodon magnus, Propotamochoerus hysudricus. All suid species from all time intervals between 14.2 and 0.6 million years old (Myo) were analyzed, with the exception of those from the 11.2-9.0 Myo time frame (late Miocene), when no suids were found to show enamel hypoplasia. Enamel hypoplasia was the most common in suids from the middle Miocene Siwalik (63%), followed by those from the early Pliocene to the Pleistocene (43%), the late Miocene to the Pliocene (25%), and the late Miocene to the early Pleistocene (33%). The percentage of incidence of E.H with respect to each species was 62.50% in Listriodon pentapotamiae, 50% in Sivachoerus prior and Hippohyus sivalensis, 33.33% in Hippohyus lydekkeri and Propotamochoerus hysudricus and 0% in Tetraconodon minor and Tetraconodon magnus. The prevalence of enamel hypoplasia during the Neogene and Quaternary in the Siwalik region provides evidence for the occurrence of stress episodes, while the proportion of hypoplastic enamel illustrates the relative intensity of these stresses. These stressful events brought on by a lack of food or nutrition happened because of the historical periods' drastic shifts in weather, vegetation, ecology, and wildlife. These stress periods, which occurred from the early Miocene to the Pleistocene, may have spurred the evolution and speciation of the Siwalik fauna, notably the mammals.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemic injury. Here, we investigated the effects of aging on NO production during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR). Male Wister rats (WRs) were assigned to 12-month-old (older; n = 5) and 3-month-old (younger; n = 7) groups. Similarly, male spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) were allocated to 12-month-old (older; n = 6) and 3-month-old (younger; n = 8) groups. After anesthesia, their NO production was monitored using in vivo microdialysis probes inserted into the left striatum and hippocampus. Forebrain cerebral IR injuries were produced via ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries, followed by reperfusion. The change in the NO3 of the older rats in the SHR groups in the striatum was less compared to that of the younger rats before ischemia, during ischemia, and after reperfusion (p < 0.05). In the hippocampus, the change in the NO3- of the older rats in the SHR groups was lower compared to that of the younger rats after reperfusion (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two WR groups. Our findings suggested that aging in SHRs affected NO production, especially in the striatum, before and during cerebral ischemia, and after reperfusion. Hypertension and aging may be important factors impacting NO production in brain IR injury.

AB  - Following diagnosis but before treatment, up to 30% of breast cancer patients report behavioral side effects (e.g., anxiety, depression, memory impairment). Our rodent mammary tumor model recapitulates aspects of these behavioral sequelae, as well as elevated circulating and brain inflammatory mediators. Neuroinflammation is a proposed mechanism underlying the etiology of mood disorders and cognitive deficits, and therefore may be contributing to tumor-associated behavioral side effects. The cellular mechanisms by which tumor-induced neuroinflammation occurs remain unknown, making targeted treatment approaches inaccessible. Here, we tested the hypotheses that microglia are the primary cells driving tumor-induced neuroinflammation and behavioral side effects. Young adult female BALB/c mice were induced with a 67NR mammary tumor; tumor-free controls underwent a sham surgery. Mammary tumors increased IBA1+ and GFAP+ staining in the amygdala and hippocampus relative to tumor-free controls. However, tumors did not alter gene expression of Percoll-enriched microglia isolated from the whole brain. While cognitive, social, and anhedonia-like behaviors were not altered in tumor-bearing mice, tumors increased central tendency in the open-field test; microglia depletion did not reverse this effect. Brain region RT-qPCR data indicated that microglia depletion attenuated tumor-induced elevations of neuroinflammatory gene expression in a region- and mediator-specific manner. These results indicate a causal role of microglia in tumor-induced neuroinflammation. This research advances our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying tumor-induced neuroinflammation in order to understand how brain responses (e.g., behavior) may be altered with subsequent cancer-related immune challenges.
   An orthotopic, non-metastatic mammary tumor increased IBA1+ percent area staining in the hippocampus and amygdala, and increased gene expression of neuroinflammatory mediators in the amygdala. However, a mammary tumor did not alter gene expression of Percoll-enriched microglia isolated from the whole brain; region-specific isolation is warranted. Microglia depletion via PLX5622 attenuated tumor-induced increases of neuroinflammatory gene expression in the amygdala. Altogether, the data indicate that microglia contribute to mammary tumor-induced neuroinflammation in a female mouse model.image

AB  - Epidemiological studies showed the association between air pollution and dementia. A soluble fraction of particulate matters including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is suspected to be involved with the adverse effects of air pollution on the central nervous system of humans. It is also reported that exposure to benzopyrene (B[a]P), which is one of the PAHs, caused deterioration of neurobehavioral performance in workers. The present study investigated the effect of B[a]P on noradrenergic and serotonergic axons in mouse brains. In total, 48 wild-type male mice (10 weeks of age) were allocated into 4 groups and exposed to B[a]P at 0, 2.88, 8.67 or 26.00 & mu;g/mice, which is approximately equivalent to 0.12, 0.37 and 1.12 mg/kg bw, respectively, by pharyngeal aspiration once/week for 4 weeks. The density of noradrenergic and serotonergic axons was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas. Exposure to B[a]P at 2.88 & mu;g/mice or more decreased the density of noradrenergic or serotonergic axons in the CA1 area and the density of noradrenergic axons in the CA3 area in the hippocampus of mice. Furthermore, exposure to B[a]P dose-dependently upregulated Tnf & alpha; at 8.67 & mu;g/mice or more, as well as upregulating Il-1 & beta; at 26 & mu;g/mice, Il-18 at 2.88 and 26 & mu;g/mice and Nlrp3 at 2.88 & mu;g/mice. The results demonstrate that exposure to B[a]P induces degeneration of noradrenergic or serotonergic axons and suggest the involvement of proinflammatory or inflammation-related genes with B[a]P-induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - Teaching and understanding evolution is challenging because students must synthesize several biological processes that are traditionally taught separately. We developed a set of free online lessons and activities centered on a single evolutionary phenomenon - why deer mice have different fur colors in different subpopulations - to help high school students better understand how these different biological processes, operating at different scales, work together to influence a single organismal trait. Through scaffolded investigations, guiding questions, model building, and pointed analysis, students learn how ecology, cellular biology, molecular biology, genetic inheritance, and population genetics all work together to influence a shift in fur color over time. Using an innovative multilevel simulation, students manipulate and examine these different processes from the population level all the way down to the DNA level. In this article, we describe the lessons and materials we have developed for high school biology students. We outline the learning goals and highlight the major components of the technology and activities in each lesson. We then provide information on how to access our curricular and support materials, and conclude with user feedback from our pilot testing.

AB  - The significant link between stress and psychiatric disorders has prompted research on stress's impact on the brain. Interestingly, previous studies on healthy subjects have demonstrated an association between perceived stress and amygdala volume, although the mechanisms by which perceived stress can affect brain function remain unknown. To better understand what this association entails at a functional level, herein, we explore the association of perceived stress, measured by the PSS10 questionnaire, with disseminated functional connectivity between brain areas. Using resting-state fMRI from 252 healthy subjects spanning a broad age range, we performed both a seed-based amygdala connectivity analysis (static connectivity, with spatial resolution but no temporal definition) and a whole-brain data-driven approach to detect altered patterns of phase interactions between brain areas (dynamic connectivity with spatiotemporal information). Results show that increased perceived stress is directly associated with increased amygdala connectivity with frontal cortical regions, which is driven by a reduced occurrence of an activity pattern where the signals in the amygdala and the hippocampus evolve in opposite directions with respect to the rest of the brain. Overall, these results not only reinforce the pathological effect of in-phase synchronicity between subcortical and cortical brain areas but also demonstrate the protective effect of counterbalanced (i.e., phase-shifted) activity between brain subsystems, which are otherwise missed with correlation-based functional connectivity analysis.

AB  - Bioethanol is considered one of the most promising next-generation automotive fuels, as it is carbon neutral and can be produced from renewable resources, like lignocellulosic materials. The present research investigation aimed to utilize the elephant ear plant, a hazardous plant (weed) also considered an invasive species, as a font of non-edible lignocellulosic biomass for bioethanol production. The freshly collected elephant ear plant (leaves and stalk) was chopped into small pieces (1-2 cm) and then homogenized to a paste using a mechanical grinder. The sample pretreatment was done by flying ash for three different time durations (T1 = 0 min, T2 = 15 min, and T3 = 30 min) with 3 replications. All treatment samples were measured for total sugar and reducing sugar content. The concentration of reducing sugar archived was T1 = 0.771 +/- 0.1 mg/mL, T2 = 0.907 +/- 0.032 mg/mL, and T3 = 0.895 +/- 0.039 mg/mL, respectively. The results revealed that the chemical composition was different among treatments. The hydrolysis was performed using cellulase enzymes at 35 degrees C for the hydrolysis process. The hydrolysate was inoculated with 1% of S. cerevisiae and maintained at room temperature without oxygen for 120 h. Bioethanol concentration was measured by using an ebulliometer. The efficient ethanol percentage was 1.052 +/- 0.03 mg/mL achieved after the fermentation. Therefore, the elephant ear plant invasive weed could be an efficient feedstock plant for future bioethanol production.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is presented the most common form of focal epilepsy with involvement of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as important factors in its development. About one third of epileptic patients are intractable to currently available medications. Paeonol isolated from some herbs with traditional and medicinal uses has shown anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in different models of neurological disorders. In this research, we tried to evaluate the possible protective effect of paeonol in intrahippocampal kainate murine model of TLE. To induce TLE, kainate was microinjected into CA3 area of the hippocampus and paeonol was admin-istered at two doses of 30 or 50 mg/kg. The results of this study showed that paeonol at the higher dose significantly reduces incidence of status epilepticus, hippocampal aberrant mossy fiber sprouting and also pre-serves neuronal density. Beneficial protective effect of paeonol was in parallel with partial reversal of some hippocampal oxidative stress markers (reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde), caspase 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, heme oxygenase 1, DNA fragmentation, and inflammation-associated factors (nuclear factor -kappa B, toll-like receptor 4, and tumor necrosis factor alpha). Our obtained data indicated anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of paeonol which is somewhat attributed to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammation properties besides its attenuation of apoptosis, pyroptosis, and astrocyte activity.

AB  - The ability of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) to proliferate and differentiate is required through different stages of neurogenesis. Disturbance in the regulation of neurogenesis causes many neurological diseases, such as intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. However, the intrinsic mechanisms of this regulation in neurogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we report that Ash2l (Absent, small or homeotic discs-like 2), one core component of a multimeric histone methyltransferase complex, is essential for NSPC fate determination during postnatal neurogenesis. Deletion of Ash2l in NSPCs impairs their capacity for proliferation and differentiation, leading to simplified dendritic arbors in adult-born hippocampal neurons and deficits in cognitive abilities. RNA sequencing data reveal that Ash2l primarily regulates cell fate specification and neuron commitment. Furthermore, we identified Onecut2, a major downstream target of ASH2L characterized by bivalent histone modifications, and demonstrated that constitutive expression of Onecut2 restores defective proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs in adult Ash2l-deficient mice. Importantly, we identified that Onecut2 modulates TGF-& beta; signaling in NSPCs and that treatment with a TGF-& beta; inhibitor rectifies the phenotype of Ash2l-deficient NSPCs. Collectively, our findings reveal the ASH2L-Onecut2-TGF-& beta; signaling axis that mediates postnatal neurogenesis to maintain proper forebrain function.

AB  - Autologous mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have demonstrated important therapeutic effects in several diseases. Cardiovascular risk factors may impair MSC mitochondrial structure and function, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesized that metabolic syndrome (MetS) induces epigenetic alterations in mitochondria-related genes in swine MSCs. Pigs were fed a Lean or MetS diet (n = 6 each) for 16 weeks. MSCs were collected from subcutaneous abdominal fat, and DNA hydroxymethylation (5 hmC) profiles of mitochondria related genes (MitoCarta-2.0) were analyzed by hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq) in Lean-and MetS-MSCs untreated or treated with the epigenetic modulator vitamin (Vit)-C (n = 3 each). Functional analysis of genes with differential 5 hmC regions was performed using DAVID6.8. Mitochondrial structure (electron microscopy), oxidative stress, and membrane potential were assessed. hMeDIP-seq identified 172 peaks (associated with 103 mitochondrial genes) with higher and 416 peaks (associated with 165 mitochondrial genes) with lower 5 hmC levels in MetS-MSCs versus Lean-MSCs (=2-fold, p < 0.05). Genes with higher 5 hmC levels in MetS + MSCs were primarily implicated in fatty acid metabolism, whereas those with lower 5 hmC levels were associated with electron transport chain activity. Vit-C increased 5 hmC levels in mitochondrial antioxidant genes, improved mitochondrial structure and membrane potential, and decreased oxidative stress. MetS alters 5 hmC levels of mitochondria-related genes in swine MSCs. Vit-C modulated 5 hmC levels in these genes and preserved mitochondrial structure and function in MetS-MSCs. These observations may contribute to development of strategies to overcome the deleterious effects of MetS on MSCs.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a toxic heavy metal and environmental pollutant that adversely affects the nervous system. However, effective therapeutic drugs for Pb-induced neurotoxicity have yet to be developed. In the present study, we investigated the ameliorative effect of sodium para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS-Na) on Pb-induced neurotoxicity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with (CH3COO)(2) Pb center dot 4H(2)O (6 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, followed by 3 weeks of PAS-Na (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg). The results showed that subacute Pb exposure significantly decreased rats body-weight gains and increased liver coefficient, and impaired spatial learning and memory. HE staining showed that Pb damaged the structure of the hippocampus. Moreover, Pb activated the ERK1/2-p90(RSK)/ NF-kappa B pathway concomitant with increased inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta levels in rat hippocampus. PAS-Na reversed the Pb-induced increase in the liver coefficient as well as the learning and memory deficits. In addition, PAS-Na reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p90(RSK) and NF-kappa B p65, decreasing IL-1 beta levels in hippocampus. Our findings indicated that PAS-Na showed efficacy in reversing Pb-induced rats cognitive deficits and triggered an anti-inflammatory response. Thus, PAS-Na may be a promising therapy for treating Pb-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy is considered to be one of the most common and severe forms of focal epilepsies. Patients frequently develop cognitive deficits and emotional blunting along progression of the disease. The high incidence of refractoriness to antiepileptic drugs and a frequent lack of admissibility to surgery pose an unmet medical challenge. In the urgent quest for novel treatment strategies, neuropeptides and their receptors are interesting candidates. However, their therapeutic potential has not yet been fully exploited. This chapter focuses on the functional role of the dynorphins (Dyns) and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system in temporal lobe epilepsy and the hippocampus.
   Genetic polymorphisms in the prepro-dynorphin (pDyn) gene causing lower levels of Dyns in humans and pDyn gene knockout in mice increase the risk to develop epilepsy. This suggests a role of Dyns and KOR as modulators of neuronal excitability. Indeed, KOR agonists induce inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, as well as postsynaptic hyperpolarization in glutamatergic neurons, both producing anticonvulsant effects.
   The development of new approaches to modulate the complex KOR signalling cascade (e.g. biased agonism and gene therapy) opens up new exciting therapeutic opportunities with regard to seizure control and epilepsy. Potential adverse side effects of KOR agonists may be minimized through functional selectivity or locally restricted treatment. Preclinical data suggest a high potential of such approaches to control seizures.

AB  - The impacts of silicon dioxide nanoparticles (SiO 2 -NPs) on human health have attracted increasing interest due to their widespread utilization in medicine and food additives. However, the size -dependent effects of SiO 2 -NPs on brain health remain sparse. Herein we investigated alterations in behavioral patterns, the gut microbiota, inflammation and oxidative stress of mice after a 12 -week exposure to SiO 2 -NPs with either small size (NP -S) or large size (NP -L). A more pronounced deleterious effect of NP -S was found on anxiety -like behavior in mice relative to NP -L. We also found that SiO 2 -NPs exposure induced inflammation and oxidative stress in the colon, hippocampus and cortex of mice in a size -specific manner. Correlation network analysis revealed potential links between anxiety -like behavior and SiO 2 -NPs-induced shifts in the gut microbiota including Parvibacter , Faecalibaculum , Gordonibacter and Ileibacterium . Furthermore, anxiety -like behavior caused by SiO 2 -NPs exposure exhibited correlations with decreased levels of hippocampal IL -10 and cortex Nqo1 as well as increased levels of intestinal Acox1 and hippocampal TNF- alpha. Therefore, our findings suggest that exposure to SiO 2 -NPs promoted anxiety -like behavior through the mediation of interplay between the gut and the brain, and SiO 2 -NPs of smaller size may generate a more adverse effect on brain health.

AB  - Neurodegeneration, as indicated by brain dysfunction and cognitive decline, is one of the complications associated with obesity and estrogen deprivation. Calorie restriction and exercise regimes improved brain function in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the comparative effects of a combination of calorie restriction with exercise, calorie restriction, and an exercise regime alone on brain/cognitive function in obesity with or without estrogen deprivation have not been investigated. Sixty female rats were fed a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 27 weeks. At week 13, the ND-fed rats underwent a sham operation with sedentary lifestyle, HFD-fed rats were divided into two groups: each having either a sham operation (HFS) or ovariectomy (HFO). At week 20, HFD-fed rats in each group were divided into four subgroups undergoing either a sedentary lifestyle, calorie restriction, exercise regime or a combination of calorie restriction and exercise for 7 weeks. Insulin resistance, cognitive decline and hippocampal pathologies were found in both HFS and HFO rats. HFO rats had higher levels of insulin resistance and hippocampal reactive oxygen species levels than HFS rats. Calorie restriction decreased metabolic disturbance and hippocampal oxidative stress but failed to attenuate cognitive decline in HFS and HFO rats. Exercise attenuated metabolic/hippocampal dysfunctions, resulting in improved cognition only in HFS rats. Combined therapies restored brain function, and cognitive function in HFS and HFO rats. Therefore, a combination of calorie restriction with exercise is probably the greatest lifestyle modification to diminish the brain pathologies and cognitive decline in obesity with or without estrogen deprivation.

AB  - Despite widespread use, dosing regimens for antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) therapy are poorly unoptimized. ACS therapy exerts a programming effect on fetal development, which may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Having demonstrated that low-dose steroid therapy is an efficacious means of maturing the preterm lung, we hypothesized that a low-dose steroid exposure would exert fewer adverse functional and transcriptional changes on the fetal heart. We tested this hypothesis using low-dose steroid therapy (10 mg delivered to the ewe over 36 h via constant infusion) and compared cardiac effects with those of a higher dose treatment (30 mg delivered to the ewe over 24 h by intramuscular injection; simulating currently employed clinical ACS regimens). Fetal cardiac function was assessed by ultrasound on the day of ACS treatment initiation. Transcriptomic analyses were performed on fetal myocardial tissue. Relative to saline control, fetuses in the higher-dose clinical treatment group had significantly lower ratios between early diastolic ventricular filling and ventricular filling during atrial systole, and showed the differential expression of myocardial hypertrophy-associated transcripts including beta MHC, GADD45 gamma, and PPAR gamma. The long-term implications of these changes remain unstudied. Irrespective, optimizing ACS dosing regimens to maximize respiratory benefit while minimizing adverse effects on key organ systems, such as the heart, offers a means of improving the acute and long-term outcomes associated with this important obstetric therapy.

Previously only known in north-east Victoria from a resident population near Suggan Buggan, and isolated records <50 km from the NSW border, we report camera trap observations of O. r. robustus from Mt Loch, near Hotham Heights. This represents the highest altitude observation of the species (similar to 1720 m above sea level), the furthest Victorian record from NSW, and a south-westerly range extension of 73 km.

TI  - Evaluation of pig oocyte in vitro maturation and fertilization using three gonadotropin-based hormonal compounds
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTION
LA  - English
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of human chorionic gonadotropins (hCG) and equine chorionic gonadotropins (eCG) on in vitro gilt oocyte maturation and embryonic development, using frozen semen for fertilization.
   Methods: Two independent experiments (6 replicates each) were carried out to evaluate gilt oocyte maturation, and fertilization and embryonic development by using ovaries from a local abattoir. Totally, 712 oocytes were randomly distributed in four-well dishes to receive Novormon (eCG 5.0 IU), PG600 (eCG 5.0 IU and hCG 2.5 IU), Chorulon (hCG 5.0 IU), or no hormones. Oocytes were incubated with 5% CO2, 95% air and saturation humidity at 39 degrees C for 44 h. Maturation of the oocytes to metaphase II was assessed by using the aceto-orcein technique. In addition, 741 oocytes were used and randomly distributed in four-well dishes, and then oocyte maturation was carried out as mentioned, but matured oocytes were washed and placed in fertilization medium with frozen-thawed sperm. Gametes were co-incubated for 7 h, and then washed and placed in development medium, and incubated for further 7 days, at which time embryonic development was evaluated. Fertilization and embryo development media were not supplemented with the studied hormones.
   Results: Novormon (eCG) and PG600 (eCG+hCG) treatments significantly improved the percentages of metaphase II oocytes compared to the control group (P<0.05). Furthermore, a significant increase was also observed in the young blastocyst stage between the control group and the PG600 treatment group (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Hormonal products Novormon (eCG) and PG600 (eCG+hCG) can obtain the highest percentages of in vitro maturation in gilt oocytes; however, this effect is not transferred to fertilization rates.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the primary causes of mortality and disability, with arterial blood pressure being an important factor in the clinical management of TBI. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), widely used as a model of essential hypertension and vascular dementia, demonstrate dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which may contribute to glucocorticoid-mediated hippocampal damage. The aim of this study was to assess acute post-TBI seizures, delayed mortality, and hippocampal pathology in SHRs and normotensive Sprague Dawley rats (SDRs). Male adult SDRs and SHRs were subjected to lateral fluid-percussion injury. Immediate seizures were video recorded, corticosterone (CS) was measured in blood plasma throughout the study, and hippocampal morphology assessed 3 months post-TBI. Acute and remote survival rates were significantly higher in the SHRs compared to the SDRs (overall mortality 0% and 58%, respectively). Immediate seizure duration predicted acute but not remote mortality. TBI did not affect blood CS in the SHRs, while the CS level was transiently elevated in the SDRs, predicting remote mortality. Neuronal cell loss in the polymorph layer of ipsilateral dentate gyrus was found in both the SDRs and SHRs, while thinning of hippocampal pyramidal and granular cell layers were strain- and area-specific. No remote effects of TBI on the density of astrocytes or microglia were revealed. SHRs possess a unique resilience to TBI as compared with normotensive SDRs. SHRs show shorter immediate seizures and reduced CS response to the injury, suggesting the development of long-term adaptative mechanisms associated with chronic hypertension. Though remote post-traumatic hippocampal damage in ipsilateral dentate gyrus is obvious in both SHRs and SDRs, the data imply that physiological adaptations to high blood pressure in SHRs may be protective, preventing TBI-induced mortality but not hippocampal neurodegeneration. Understanding the mechanisms of resilience to TBI may also help improve clinical recommendations for patients with hypertension. Limitation: since more than a half of the SDRs with prolonged immediate seizures or elevated CS 3 days after TBI have died, survivorship bias might hamper correct interpretation of the data.

AB  - Mimosa pudica is a Neotropical legume that closes its leaves rapidly in response to touch stimulation, hypothetically as herbivory defence. Habituation to non-harmful stimuli and long-term memory of past events have been demonstrated in this species, the former with relatively heavy objects and the latter under laboratory conditions. This species should not habituate to harmful stimuli if leaf movement is a response to herbivore damage. We tested in Monteverde, Costa Rica, whether (1) memory occurs in wild plants, (2) whether habituation occurs under harmful stimuli: simulated herbivory, and (3) whether wild plants can habituate to light non-harmful stimuli. The degree of closing of the leaflets and time until reopening was measured in response to repeated harmful and non-harmful stimuli. The results showed habituation to repeated non-harmful very light stimuli and showed lack of habituation to simulated leaf damage. Wild plants also showed faster rehabituation to repeated non-harmful stimuli when they had been exposed 15 days previously, suggesting possible long-term memory. These results indicate that wild plants are capable of (1) distinguishing between harmful and non-harmful stimuli (only habituating to the latter), (2) memorizing previous events, and 3) habituating very light tactile stimuli commonly experienced in the field.

AB  - It has been hypothesised that inhalational anaesthetics such as isoflurane (Iso) may trigger the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the gaseous anaesthetic xenon (Xe) exhibits many features of a putative neuroprotective agent. Loss of synapses is regarded as one key cause of dementia in AD. Multiple EGF-like domains 10 (MEGF10) is one of the phagocytic receptors which assists the elimination of synapses by astrocytes. Here, we investigated how beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (A beta(1-42)), Iso and Xe interact with MEGF10-dependent synapse elimination. Murine cultured astrocytes as well as cortical and hippocampal ex vivo brain slices were treated with either A beta(1-42), Iso or Xe and the combination of A beta(1-42) with either Iso or Xe. We quantified MEGF10 expression in astrocytes and dendritic spine density (DSD) in slices. In brain slices of wild type and AAV-induced MEGF10 knock-down mice, antibodies against astrocytes (GFAP), pre- (synaptophysin) and postsynaptic (PSD95) components were used for co-localization analyses by means of immunofluorescence-imaging and 3D rendering techniques. A beta(1-42) elevated pre- and postsynaptic components inside astrocytes and decreased DSD. The combined application with either Iso or Xe reversed these effects. In the presence of A beta(1-42) both anaesthetics decreased MEGF10 expression. AAV-induced knock-down of MEGF10 reduced the pre- and postsynaptic marker inside astrocytes. The presented data suggest Iso and Xe are able to reverse the A beta(1-42)-induced enhancement of synaptic elimination in ex vivo hippocampal brain slices, presumably through MEGF10 downregulation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The classic traditional Chinese compound Naoluoxintong (NLXT) has been proven an effective remedy for ischemic stroke (IS). The protective effect of NLXT on neural stem cells (NSCs), however, remains unclear.Aim of the study: vcross_16pt_press_logoTo investigate the protective effect of NLXT on NSCs in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and the effect of Nestin expression in vivo.Materials and methods: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: the sham-operated group, the MCAO model group and the NLXT group. The MCAO model in rats was established by modified Longa wire embolization method. The sham-operated group, the model group and the NLXT groups were divided into three subgroups according to the sampling time points of 1 d, 3 d and 7 d after successful model-making. Immunofluorescence staining, including bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), I3-tubulinIII/GFAP, BrdU/doublecortin (DCX) and BrdU/neuronal nuclei (NeuN), was used to detect the proliferation and survival of NSCs in the hippocampal after drug administration. Protein expression of Nestin, DCX, GFAP and NeuN in the hippocampal was detected by Western blot (WB). Results: Immunofluorescence experiment of Nestin labeled: on the first day, a few Nestin-positive cells were found in the hippocampal DG area. Afterwards, the number of Nestin-labeled positive cells in the model group increased, while the number of cells in the sham group did not fluctuate significantly. The number of positive cells in each administration group increased more than that in the model and normal group. I3-tubulin III/GFAP double-labeled: a small amount of double labeled cells was expressed in the normal group, and the number subsequently fluctuated little. In the model group, I3-tubulin III/GFAP positive cells increased initially after acute ischemia, and gradually decreased afterwards. In the NLXT-treated group, I3-Tubulin III positive cells were significantly increased on day 1, 3 and 7, while GFAP positive cells had little change. BrdU/DCX double-labeled: initially, a small number of BrdU/DCX-labeled positive cells were observed in the normal group and the model group, but there was no increasing trend over time. The positive cells in the NLXT group increased over time, and those in the seven-day group were significantly higher than those in the one-day and three-day groups. BrdU/NEUN double-labeled: in the normal group, BrdU/NEUN positive cells were enriched and distributed regularly. The number of positive cells in the model group was small and decreased gradually with time, and the decrease was most obvious on the third day. The number of positive cells in the NLXT group was significantly higher than that in the model group, and the number of positive cells in the seven-day group was significantly higher than that in the one-day and three-day groups. WB results reflected those three proteins, Nestin, NeuN and DCX, showed an increase in expression, except GFAP, which showed a decreasing trend. Conclusions: Preliminarily, NLXT can promote the migration and differentiation of NSCs. It may have a protective effect on the brain by promoting repair of brain tissue damage through upregulation of Nestin after IS.

AB  - Persistent inflammation, characterized by the intense interplay of inflammatory chemokine secretion and immune cell infiltration, is a hallmark of many skin disorders including diabetic wounds and psoriasis with inadequate therapeutic interventions. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is an inflammatory chemokine that plays a key role in recruiting and polarizing monocytes into pro-inflammatory macrophages to establish a vicious cycle that worsens the inflamed tissue microenvironment. Here, the sponge-like microneedles (HPMN) technology is described to alleviate inflammatory skin disorders. Heparin/4-arm PEG-NH2 network crosslinked onto microneedle surface spatially attracted and sequestered multiple inflammatory chemokines including MCP-1. Enrichment of MCP-1 on microneedles recruits and traps inflammatory monocytes within the porous structure of microneedles. Subsequent removal of microneedles not only depletes inflammatory chemokine, MCP-1, but also its cellular source. As a result, HPMN treatment facilitates 47.1% smaller open wound area in mice and 27.2% shorter wound length in pigs. To demonstrate the versatility of the HPMN technology, it is also shown that combining the method with standard-of-care immunosuppressants reduces 45.1% epidermis thickening and attenuated immune cell influx in a mouse psoriasis model. Overall, the HPMN technology is a novel demonstration of employing inflammatory chemokine and cell extraction to treat a broad range of inflammatory skin disorders.
   This paper describes a microneedle that extracts inflammatory chemokines and immune cells via heparin coating and porous structures to accelerate the recover of inflammatory skin disorders. image

AB  - Presence of inflammatory factors in the tumor microenvironment is well-documented yet their specific role in tumorigenesis is elusive. The core inflammatory pathways like the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) and the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) pathway are conserved in Drosophila. We induced GFP-marked epithelial tumors by expressing activated oncogenic forms of Ras(V12) or Yorkie (Yki(3SA), mammalian YAP) in scribble deficient cells (scrib(RNAi), mammalian SCRIB) to study the role of inflammatory factors in tumorigenesis. Similar to Ras(V12)scrib(RNAi), we found that Yki(3SA)scrib(RNAi) form invasive neoplastic lethal tumors that induce a systemic inflammatory response. We identified Cactus (Cact, mammalian I kappa B alpha), the negative regulator of TLR, as a key player in tumor growth. Cact accumulates in the cytoplasm in Drosophila tumor models, similar to squamous cell carcinoma in mice models and human patients where cytoplasmic I kappa B alpha favors oncogenic transformation. Further, cact is transcriptionally upregulated in tumors, and downregulation of Cact affects tumor growth. We investigated if TLR or TNF pathway affect tumor growth through activation of Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway and its target Matrix Metalloprotease1 (MMP1). Genetically manipulating levels of TLR components or TNF receptors showed that Cact acts upstream of JNK signaling and regulates JNK via a non-canonical mechanism during tumorigenesis. Further, Hippo coactivator Yki transcriptionally regulates cact expression, and downregulation of Yki or Cact is sufficient to cause downregulation of JNK-mediated signaling that promotes tumorigenesis. Here, we report a link between Hippo, I kappa B alpha and JNK signaling that may induce inflammation and innate immune response in tumorigenesis.

AB  - We used a step -wheel system to examine the activity of striatal projection neurons as mice practiced stepping on complexly arranged foothold pegs in this Ferris -wheel -like device to receive reward. Sets of dorsolateral striatal projection neurons were sensitive to specific parameters of repetitive motor coordination during the runs. They responded to combinations of the parameters of continuous movements (interval, phase, and repetition), forming "chunking responses"-some for combinations of these parameters across multiple body parts. Recordings in sensorimotor cortical areas exhibited notably fewer such responses but were documented for smaller neuron sets whose heterogeneity was significant. Striatal movement encoding via chunking responsivity could provide insight into neural strategies governing effective motor control by the striatum. It is possible that the striking need for external rhythmic cuing to allow movement sequences by Parkinson's patients could, at least in part, reflect dysfunction in such striatal coding.

AB  - Tea oil camellia (Camellia oleifera), an important woody oil tree, is a source of seed oil of high nutritional and medicinal value that is widely planted in southern China. However, there is no report on the identification of the miRNAs involved in lipid metabolism and seed development in the high- and low-oil cultivars of tea oil camellia. Thus, we explored the roles of miRNAs in the key periods of oil formation and accumulation in the seeds of tea oil camellia and identified miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules involved in lipid metabolism and seed development. Sixteen small RNA libraries for four development stages of seed oil biosynthesis in high- and low-oil cultivars were constructed. A total of 196 miRNAs, including 156 known miRNAs from 35 families, and 40 novel miRNAs were identified, and 55 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were found, which included 34 upregulated miRNAs, and 21 downregulated miRNAs. An integrated analysis of the miRNA and mRNA transcriptome sequence data revealed that 10 miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules were related to lipid metabolism; for example, the regulatory modules of ath-miR858b-MYB82/MYB3/MYB44 repressed seed oil biosynthesis, and a regulation module of csi-miR166e-5p-S-ACP-DES6 was involved in the formation and accumulation of oleic acid. A total of 23 miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules were involved in the regulation of the seed size, such as the regulatory module of hpe-miR162a_L-2-ARF19, involved in early seed development. A total of 12 miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules regulating growth and development were identified, such as the regulatory modules of han-miR156a_L+1-SPL4/SBP2, promoting early seed development. The expression changes of six miRNAs and their target genes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR, and the targeting relationship of the cpa-miR393_R-1-AFB2 regulatory module was verified by luciferase assays. These data provide important theoretical values and a scientific basis for the genetic improvement of new cultivars of tea oil camellia in the future.

AB  - The spurge hawkmoth Hyles euphorbiae (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) is an insect herbivore feeding exclusively on spurges (Euphorbia). These are toxic due to their secondary metabolites including diterpene esters with numerous harmful biological activities, preventing their use by most herbivores. Extracts of frass from H. euphorbiae and of its main larval food plant in Central Europe, the cypress spurge (Euphorbia cyparissias L.), were analyzed via liquid chromatography using a triple-quadrupole (MS/MS) and a high-resolution-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF-MS). We report for the first time the finding of the tigliane (phorbol ester) phorbol-13-acetate and two 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) isomers of unknown structure (compounds 2 and 3) in E. cyparissias. Our data support the assignment of these two compounds as tiglianes and are therefore referred to by us as "putative tiglianes". Additionally, the distribution of the three reported compounds within the plant parts (leaves, stem and root) was analyzed to gain first insights into the metabolite conditions H. euphorbiae copes with in nature. Phorbol-13-acetate was detected in the plant's root only, while the other compounds were observed in all three plant parts, although in different distributions. Moreover, our results indicate that the occurrence of compound 3 rises upon larval feeding. Finally, the presence of the plant-derived putative tiglianes in frass from E. cyparissias leaves feeding larvae is confirmed, corroborating the close plant-herbivore interaction.

AB  - Translocation of threatened terrestrial orchids is increasingly seen as a viable ameliorative conservation option when habitat is destroyed or modified through changing land use. Most orchid translocations reported in the literature detail nursery-raised seedlings planted into intact and suitable habitat, and few involve translocation of entire plants and their mycorrhizal fungal associates. As part of a larger translocation study, soil cores containing 46 individuals of the threatened Painted Diuris (Diuris tricolor) were translocated into herbivore-proof plots on restored and rehabilitated post-mining lands in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. After 3 years of annual flowering and fruiting, new recruits (mature flowering plants) were observed within translocation plots but outside of original soil cores, and at 6 years following translocation 29 new individuals were observed. Two of these individuals germinated outside of fenced plots. At peak flowering in 2020, a search of rehabilitated lands outside of translocation plots failed to locate any orchids, discounting the unlikely possibility that orchid tubers may have survived the process of topsoil stockpiling and respreading. Successful recruitment of Painted Diuris into mining rehabilitation has the potential to significantly offset any losses of this species resulting from mining operations within the region.

AB  - Being a common environmental pollutant, cadmium causes detrimental health effects, including testicular injury. Herein, we document the ameliorative potential of quercetin, a potent antioxidant, against cadmium-induced geno-cytotoxicity and steroidogenic toxicity in goat testicular tissue. Cadmium induced different comet types (Type 0 - Type 4), indicating the varying degree of DNA-damage in testicular cells. The quantitative analysis at 50 and 100 mu M cadmium concentration revealed the DNA damage with per cent tail DNA as 75.78 +/- 1.49 and 94.65 +/- 0.95, respectively, in comparison to the control group (8.87 +/- 0.48) post 8 h exposure duration. Cadmium caused a substantial decrease in the activity of key steroidogenic enzymes' (3 beta-HSD and 17 beta-HSD) along with reduction of testosterone level in testicular tissue. Furthermore, cadmium treatment induced various types of deformities in sperm, altered the Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio in testicular tissue and thus suggesting the apoptosis-mediated death of testicular cells. Simultaneous quercetin supplementation, however, significantly (p < 0.05) averted the aforementioned cadmium-mediated damage in testicular tissue. Conclusively, the cadmium-induced DNA-damage and decrease in steroidogenic potential results in death of testicular cells via apoptosis, which was significantly counteracted by quercetin co-supplementation, and thus preventing the cadmium-mediated cytotoxicity of testicular cells.

AB  - Our brain has remarkable computational power, generating sophisticated behaviors, storing memories over an individual's lifetime, and producing higher cognitive functions. However, little of our neuroscience knowledge covers the human brain. Is this organ truly unique, or is it a scaled version of the extensively studied rodent brain? Combining multicellular patch-clamp recording with expansion-based superresolution microscopy and full-scale modeling, we determined the cellular and microcircuit properties of the human hippocampal CA3 region, a fundamental circuit for memory storage. In contrast to neocortical networks, human hippocampal CA3 displayed sparse connectivity, providing a circuit architecture that maximizes associational power. Human synapses showed unique reliability, high precision, and long integration times, exhibiting both species- and circuit-specific properties. Together with expanded neuronal numbers, these circuit characteristics greatly enhanced the memory storage capacity of CA3. Our results reveal distinct microcircuit properties of the human hippocampus and begin to unravel the inner workings of our most complex organ.

AB  - Genome annotation plays a crucial role in providing comprehensive catalog of genes and transcripts for a particular species. As research projects generate new transcriptome data worldwide, integrating this information into existing annotations becomes essential. However, most bioinformatics pipelines are limited in their ability to effectively and consistently update annotations using new RNA-seq data. Here we introduce TAGADA, an RNA-seq pipeline for Transcripts And Genes Assembly, Deconvolution, and Analysis. Given a genomic sequence, a reference annotation and RNA-seq reads, TAGADA enhances existing gene models by generating an improved annotation. It also computes expression values for both the reference and novel annotation, identifies long non-coding transcripts (lncRNAs), and provides a comprehensive quality control report. Developed using Nextflow DSL2, TAGADA offers user-friendly functionalities and ensures reproducibility across different computing platforms through its containerized environment. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of TAGADA using RNA-seq data from the GENE-SWiTCH project alongside chicken and pig genome annotations as references. Results indicate that TAGADA can substantially increase the number of annotated transcripts by approximately $300\%$ in these species. Furthermore, we illustrate how TAGADA can integrate Illumina NovaSeq short reads with PacBio Iso-Seq long reads, showcasing its versatility. TAGADA is available

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Clostridium butyricum (C. butyricum) on the prevention of the diarrhea rates and growth performances of weaned piglets induced by Escherichia coli K88 (E. coli K88). Twenty-four weaned piglets (6.92 +/- 0.11 kg) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups for a period of 21 days. Each group consisted of eight pigs, with each pig being housed in an individual pen. Group I received the control diet along with normal saline, Group II received the control diet along with E. coli K88, and Group III received the control diet supplemented with 5 x 10(8) CFU/kg of C. butyricum and E. coli K88. We examined alterations in rectal microbiota and metabolites, analyzed the incidence of diarrhea, and investigated the interactions between microbiota and metabolites through the application of Illumina MiSeq sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that, from days 14 to 21, the diarrhea incidence in Group III decreased significantly by 83.29% compared to Group II (p < 0.05). Over the entire experimental duration, the average daily feed intake of Group III decreased significantly by 11.13% compared to Group I (p < 0.05), while the diarrhea incidence in Group III decreased by 71.46% compared to Group II (p < 0.05). The predominant microbial flora in the rectum consisted of Firmicutes (57.32%), Bacteroidetes (41.03%), and Proteobacteria (0.66%). Administering E. coli K88 orally can elevate the relative abundance of Megasphaera (p < 0.05). Conversely, the supplementation of C. butyricum in the diet reduced the relative abundance of Megasphaera (p < 0.05), while increasing the relative abundance of unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae (p < 0.05). Rectal metabolomics analysis revealed that supplementing C. butyricum in the feed significantly altered the amino acids and fatty acids of the piglets infected with E. coli K88 (p < 0.05). The correlation analysis showed that the occurrence of diarrhea was inversely related to adipic acid (p < 0.05) and positively associated with (5-hydroxyindol-3-YL) acetic acid and L-aspartic acid (p < 0.05). Prevotella_1 exhibited a negative correlation with octadecanoic acid (p < 0.05). Prevotellaceae_UCG-005 showed a negative correlation with (5-hydroxyindol-3-YL) acetic acid (p < 0.05). The findings from this research study aid in probiotic development and the enhancement of healthy growth in weaned piglets.

AB  - The hippocampus is a temporal lobe structure critical for cognition, such as learning, memory, and attention, as well as emotional responses. Hippocampal dysfunction can lead to persistent anxiety and/or depression. However, how millions of neurons in the hippocampus are molecularly and structurally organized to engage their divergent functions remains unknown. Here, we genetically target a subset of neurons expressing the coagulation factor c homolog (COCH) gene. COCH-expressing neurons or COCH neurons are topographically segregated in the distal region of the ventral CA3 hippocampus and express Mtf1 and Cacna1h. MTF1 activation of Cacnalh transcription in COCH neurons encodes the ability of COCH neurons to burst action potentials and cause social-stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors by synapsing directly with a subset of GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the lateral septum. Together, this study provides a molecular and circuitry-based framework for understanding how COCH neurons in the hippocampus are assembled to engage social behavior.

AB  - We utilized a two-phase analysis using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to create an automated technology that enabled us to detect and count saigas (Saiga tatarica) in satellite images with a resolution of 0.3-0.5 m/pixel (Eros-B 2012; 2013 and Beijing KA 2022 satellites). In the first phase, the satellite image is automatically divided into sections and checked for the presence or absence of clusters of objects (the "classification" phase). Then, during the second phase, only the fragments of the satellite image where at least one saiga was previously found are analyzed (the "detection" phase). The method was calibrated by training a neural network on the results of the preliminary processing of archival satellite images from 2012 and 2013, carried out manually by zoological experts. When we tested the DCNN work with a "confidence threshold" of 0.3, we identified 1284 saigas on the entire model satellite image, while a zoological expert manually identified 1412 saigas. For practical use and to assess the effectiveness of this method, we counted saigas on a 2022 image covering two adjacent specially protected natural areas (PAs) located in the Republic of Kalmykia and the Astrakhan region (Russian Federation). The results are presented with different "thresholds of confidence."

AB  - Tetranychus urticae is a polyphagous spider mite that can feed on more than 1100 plant species including cyanogenic plants. The herbivore genome contains a horizontally acquired gene tetur10g01570 (TuCAS) that was previously shown to participate in cyanide detoxification. To understand the structure and determine the function of TuCAS in T. urticae, crystal structures of the protein with lysine conjugated pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) were determined. These structures reveal extensive TuCAS homology with the beta-substituted alanine synthase family, and they show that this enzyme utilizes a similar chemical mechanism involving a stable alpha-aminoacrylate intermediate in beta-cyanoalanine and cysteine synthesis. We demonstrate that TuCAS is more efficient in the synthesis of beta-cyanoalanine, which is a product of the detoxification reaction between cysteine and cyanide, than in the biosynthesis of cysteine. Also, the enzyme carries additional enzymatic activities that were not previously described. We show that TuCAS can detoxify cyanide using O-acetyl-L-serine as a substrate, leading to the direct formation of beta-cyanoalanine. Moreover, it catalyzes the reaction between the TuCAS-bound alpha-aminoacrylate intermediate and aromatic compounds with a thiol group. In addition, we have tested several compounds as TuCAS inhibitors. Overall, this study identifies additional functions for TuCAS and provides new molecular insight into the xenobiotic metabolism of T. urticae.

AB  - Simple Summary The diets fed to geese traditionally contain more forages and less concentrates, but there are many reasons, including veterinarian and environmental restrictions when intensive rearing should be adopted. It is also important to use different cheaper feed resources for geese, and one of these could be by-products of oil production such as rapeseed and camelina cakes. The present study was aimed at assessing the effects of rapeseed cake and camelina seed cake supplements on the physical and technological attributes of goose meat quality. The oil seed cake-supplemented diets did not reveal any differences in goose meat colour; however, it demonstrated the effects on moisture loss and on texture parameters determined by the texture profile analysis. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of commercial diet supplemented with rapeseed and camelina seed cakes on the physical and technological attributes of goose meat quality. The breast and thigh muscles from thirty geese of both sexes of the Lithuanian native breed Vistines fed the diet containing either rapeseed cake (group 1) or camelina cake (group 2) at the age of 13 weeks were used for the evaluation of physical and technological attributes. The diet did not affect the colour of goose meat; however, females showed higher (p < 0.05) values of breast yellowness (b*) and hue angle (h). The camelina group demonstrated higher (p < 0.001) cooking losses of breast and thigh muscles and also higher (p < 0.05) EZ drip loss and thawing loss of thigh muscles compared with the rapeseed group. Females had higher (p < 0.05) cooking loss of the breast, whereas males had higher (p < 0.05) cooking loss of the thigh. The growth rate of geese and their slaughter time showed an effect (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) on pH of thigh muscles. Higher (p < 0.01) hardness of the breast muscle in the camelina group compared with the rapeseed group was detected by the texture profile analysis (TPA) as well as other parameters such as cohesiveness and gumminess, chewiness. Despite some differences in technological meat quality attributes, the quality of goose meat produced with diet supplementation of 10% of rapeseed cake and camelina seed cake can be considered as suitable.

AB  - Plant extracts are increasingly being investigated due to their high content of pharmacologically active substances. The primary focus is placed on angiosperms, while pteridophytes are less popular, although their medicinal properties have been recognized for centuries. In this study, we uncover some biological properties of the extract from Dryopteris erythrosora (DEE), a fern traditionally used for liver treatment in Asia, which has not been widely explored in this context before. This study involved the determination of the total content of polyphenols and flavonoids as well as the evaluation of the antioxidant potential of DEE. Its antimicrobial activity was tested against selected bacteria. The MIC values ranged from 1.25 to 0.375 mg/mL. DEE showed no inhibitory effect against a representative fungus, Candida albicans. Additionally, this study demonstrated its excellent anticancer activity against AGS, MCF-7, and SW-480 cancer cells, with IC50 values of 19.44, 76.90, and 24.97 mu g/mL, respectively. A study on human herpesvirus type 1 (HHV-1) revealed that the DEE had no antiviral activity. The safety of DEE was confirmed with the use of sheep erythrocytes and VERO cells. Since D. erythrosora is a rich source of compounds with antibacterial and anticancer properties, it can complement the arsenal of natural therapeutics.

AB  - The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is one of three major pathways involved in glucose metabolism, which is regulated by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) controls NADPH formation. NADPH, in turn, regulates the balance of oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. G6PD dysfunction, affecting the PPP, is implicated in neurological disorders, including epilepsy. However, PPP's role in epileptogenesis and ROS production during epileptic activity remains unclear. To clarify these points, we conducted electrophysiological and imaging analyses on mouse hippocampal brain slices. Using the specific G6PD inhibitor G6PDi-1, we assessed its effects on mouse hippocampal slices, examining intracellular ROS, glucose/oxygen consumption, the NAD(P)H level and ROS production during synaptic stimulation and in the 4AP epilepsy model. G6PDi-1 increased basal intracellular ROS levels and reduced synaptically induced glucose consumption but had no impact on baselevel of NAD(P)H and ROS production from synaptic stimulation. In the 4AP model, G6PDi-1 did not significantly alter spontaneous seizure frequency or H2O2 release amplitude but increased the frequency and peak amplitude of interictal events. These findings suggest that short-term PPP inhibition has a minimal impact on synaptic circuit activity.

AB  - BackgroundTumor documentation in Germany is currently a largely manual process. It involves reading the textual patient documentation and filling in forms in dedicated databases to obtain structured data. Advances in information extraction techniques that build on large language models (LLMs) could have the potential for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of this process. Evaluating LLMs in the German medical domain, especially their ability to interpret specialized language, is essential to determine their suitability for the use in clinical documentation. Due to data protection regulations, only locally deployed open source LLMs are generally suitable for this application.MethodsThe evaluation employs eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1 to 70 billion model parameters. Three basic tasks were selected as representative examples for the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general.ResultsThe models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation.ConclusionsOpen source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the data set under https://huggingface.co/datasets/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEvalSet providing a valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.

AB  - Seahorses have evolved many unique biological traits, including a male brood pouch, the absence of caudal and pelvic fins, and the lack of spleen and gut-associated lymphatic tissue. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are known to be involved in various important biological processes including growth, differentiation, immunity, and stress responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that the adaptive evolution and expression of the MAPK gene family in seahorse may differ from those of other teleost species. We identified positive selection sites in the erk2, erk5, jnk1, and p38 alpha MAPK genes of the lined seahorse Hippocampus erectus and tiger-tailed seahorse Hippocampus comes. A novel expression profile of MAPK cascade genes was found in seahorse larvae during the first day after birth based on the RNA-seq data of H. erectus, which reflected vital signs of immune response to its parental immune system. The expression patterns of the four positively selected MAPK genes were analyzed following the bacterial challenge of Vibrio fortis, revealing their upregulation pattern in brood pouch and other immune tissues. This study enriched our knowledge of the evolution of the H. erectus MAPK subfamilies, and could help better understanding the functional role of MAPKs in teleosts.

AB  - The absolute reliance of the mammalian brain on oxygen to generate ATP renders it acutely vulnerable to hypoxia, whether at high altitude or in clinical settings of anemia or pulmonary disease. Hypoxia is pivotal to the pathogeneses of myriad neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Conversely, reduced environmental oxygen, e.g. sojourns or residing at high altitudes, may impart favorable effects on aging and mortality. Moreover, controlled hypoxia exposure may represent a treatment strategy for age-related neurological disorders. This review discusses evidence of hypoxia's beneficial vs. detrimental impacts on the aging brain and the molecular mechanisms that mediate these divergent effects. It draws upon an extensive literature search on the effects of hypoxia/altitude on brain aging, and detailed analysis of all identified studies directly comparing brain responses to hypoxia in young vs. aged humans or rodents. Special attention is directed toward the risks vs. benefits of hypoxia exposure to the elderly, and potential therapeutic applications of hypoxia for neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, important questions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary: Environmental pollutants have been suggested to be among the possible causes that play a role in the generation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Included in these environmental pollutants, we find the highly used plasticizer bisphenol-A, which produces neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders similar to those induced in AD. However, the mechanisms through which this and other environmental pollutants produce these effects are unknown. In AD, as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases that produce cognitive disorders, a selective cholinergic neuronal loss is induced in the brain region of the basal forebrain, which in turn leads to the denervation of the hippocampus and cortex, producing neurodegeneration in these regions and, eventually, cognitive disorders. Our results show the alteration of some mechanisms that could mediate bisphenol-A disruption of synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration induction in this specific type of basal forebrain neurons. These results may assist to elucidate the processes that mediate the cognition alterations produced by bisphenol-A and other environmental pollutants, which it shares mechanisms with, and could lead to the development of preventive and therapeutic tools to avoid and treat these effects in the population.
   The widely used plasticizer bisphenol-A (BPA) is well-known for producing neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders, following acute and long-term exposure. Although some of the BPA actions involved in these effects have been unraveled, they are still incompletely known. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) regulate memory and learning processes and their selective loss, as observed in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, leads to cognitive decline. In order to study the BPA neurotoxic effects on BFCN and the mechanisms through which they are induced, 60-day old Wistar rats were used, and a neuroblastoma cholinergic cell line from the basal forebrain (SN56) was used as a basal forebrain cholinergic neuron model. Acute treatment of rats with BPA (40 mu g/kg) induced a more pronounced basal forebrain cholinergic neuronal loss. Exposure to BPA, following 1- or 14-days, produced postsynaptic-density-protein-95 (PSD95), synaptophysin, spinophilin, and N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor-subunit-1 (NMDAR1) synaptic proteins downregulation, an increase in glutamate content through an increase in glutaminase activity, a downregulation in the vesicular-glutamate-transporter-2 (VGLUT2) and in the WNT/beta-Catenin pathway, and cell death in SN56 cells. These toxic effects observed in SN56 cells were mediated by overexpression of histone-deacetylase-2 (HDAC2). These results may help to explain the synaptic plasticity, cognitive dysfunction, and neurodegeneration induced by the plasticizer BPA, which could contribute to their prevention.

AB  - Purpose: We hypothesized that a combined growth factor hydrogel would improve chronic rotator cuff tear healing in a rat and sheep model. Insulin-like growth factor 1, transforming growth factor beta 1, and parathyroid hormone were combined into a tyraminated poly-vinyl-alcohol (PVA-Tyr) hydrogel and applied directly at the enthesis.Materials and Methods: In total, 30 Sprague-Dawley rats and 16 Romney ewes underwent unilateral rotator cuff tenotomy and then delayed repairs were performed after 3-4 weeks. The animals were divided into a control group (repair alone) and treatment group. The rotator cuffs were harvested at 12 weeks after surgery for biomechanical and histological analyses of the repair site.Experiment: In the rat model, the stress at failure and Young's modulus were higher in the treatment group in comparison with the control group (73% improvement, p = 0.010 and 56% improvement, p = 0.028, respectively). Histologically, the repaired entheses in the treatment group demonstrated improved healing with higher semi-quantitative scores (10.1 vs. 6.55 of 15, p = 0.032). In the large animal model, there was no observable treatment effect.Discussion: This PVA-Tyr bound growth factor system holds promise for improving rotator cuff healing. However, our approach was not scalable from a small to a large animal model. Further tailoring of this growth factor delivery system is still required.

AB  - Diverse neuron classes in hippocampal CA1 have been identified through the heterogeneity of their cellular/ molecular composition. How these classes relate to hippocampal function and the network dynamics that support cognition in primates remains unclear. Here, we report inhibitory functional cell groups in CA1 of freely moving macaques whose diverse response profiles to network states and each other suggest distinct and specific roles in the functional microcircuit of CA1. In addition, pyramidal cells that were grouped by their superficial or deep layer position differed in firing rate, burstiness, and sharp-wave ripple-associated firing. They also showed strata-specific spike-timing interactions with inhibitory cell groups, suggestive of segregated neural populations. Furthermore, ensemble recordings revealed that cell assemblies were preferentially organized according to these strata. These results suggest that hippocampal CA1 in freely moving macaques bears a sublayer-specific circuit organization that may shape its role in cognition.

AB  - In the freshwater snail L. stagnalis, two hours of shallow water crawling exercise are accompanied by the formation of memory, metabolic, neuronal, and behavioral changes, such as faster orientation in a novel environment. Interestingly, rest following exercise enhances serotonin and dopamine metabolism linked to the formation of memory and adaptation to novel conditions. However, the underlying transcriptional responses are not characterized. In this paper, we show that, while two hours of forced crawling exercise in L. stagnalis produce significant changes in nervous system gene expression, the subsequent rest induces a completely distinct transcriptional program. Chromatin-modifying, vesicle transport, and cell cycle genes were induced, whereas neurodevelopmental, behavioral, synaptic, and hormone response genes were preferentially repressed immediately after two hours of exercise. These changes were normalized after two hours of the subsequent rest. In turn, rest induced the expression of genes functioning in neuron differentiation and synapse structure/activity, while mitotic, translational, and protein degradation genes were repressed. Our findings are likely relevant to the physiology of exercise, rest, and learning in other species. For example, chronic voluntary exercise training in mice affects the expression of many homologous genes in the hippocampus. Moreover, in humans, homologous genes are pivotal for normal development and complex neurological functions, and their mutations are associated with behavioral, learning, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities.

AB  - Insect CYP2 and mitochondrial clan P450s are relatively conserved genes encoding enzymes generally thought to be involved in biosynthesis or metabolism of endobiotics. However, emerging evidence argues they have potential roles in chemical defense as well, but their actual detoxification functions remain largely unknown. Here, we focused on the full complement of 8 CYP2 and 10 mitochondrial P450s in the generalist herbivore, Helicoverpa armigera. Their varied spatiotemporal expression profiles were analyzed and reflected their specific functions. For functional study of the mitochondrial clan P450s, the redox partners, adrenodoxin reductase (AdR) and adrenodoxin (Adx), were identified from genomes of eight insects and an efficient in vitro electron transfer system of mitochondrial P450 was established by co-expression with Adx and AdR of H. armigera. All CYP2 clan P450s and 8 mitochondrial P450s were successfully expressed in Sf9 cells and compared functionally. In vitro metabolism assays showed that two CYP2 clan P450s (CYP305B1 and CYP18A1) and CYP333B3 (mito clan) could epoxidize aldrin to dieldrin, while CYP305B1 and CYP339A1 (mito clan) have limited but significant hydroxylation capacities to esfenvalerate. CYP303A1 of the CYP2 clan exhibits high metabolic efficiency to 2-tridecanone. Screening the xenobiotic metabolism competence of CYP2 and mitochondrial clan P450s not only provides new insights on insect chemical defense but also can give indications on their physiological functions in H. armigera and other insects.

AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, has become one of the most important pests on corn in China since it invaded in 2019. Although FAW has not been reported to cause widespread damage to rice plants in China, it has been sporadically found feeding in the field. If FAW infests rice in China, the fitness of other insect pests on rice may be influenced. However, how FAW and other insect pests on rice interact remains unknown. In this study, we found that the infestation of FAW larvae on rice plants prolonged the developmental duration of the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens (Stal)) eggs and plants damaged by gravid BPH females did not induce defenses that influenced the growth of FAW larvae. Moreover, co-infestation by FAW larvae on rice plants did not influence the attractiveness of volatiles emitted from BPH-infested plants to Anagrus nilaparvatae, an egg parasitoid of rice planthoppers. FAW larvae were able to prey on BPH eggs laid on rice plants and grew faster compared to those larvae that lacked available eggs. Studies revealed that the delay in the development of BPH eggs on FAW-infested plants was probably related to the increase in levels of jasmonoyl-isoleucine, abscisic acid and the defensive compounds in the rice leaf sheaths on which BPH eggs were laid. These findings indicate that, if FAW invades rice plants in China, the population density of BPH may be decreased by intraguild predation and induced plant defenses, whereas the population density of FAW may be increased.

AB  - Coloniality may grant colony members an energetic advantage in the form of lower individual respiration rates as colony size increases. If this occurs it should be apparent as negative allometric scaling of respiration with colony size, and colonial organisms should have scaling factors < 1. However, colonial members from phylum Rotifera have yet to be examined. To test if colonial rotifers possess allometric scaling relationships between respiration rate and colony size, we measured respiration rates for four solitary and three colonial rotifer species; from these respiration rates we estimated scaling factors. We found mixed evidence for allometric scaling of respiration rate in colonial rotifers. Both rotifers with allometric scaling of respiration rate, Conochilus hippocrepis and Lacinularia flosculosa, have extensive mucilaginous coverings. These coverings may represent an investment of colony members into a shared structure, lowering individual metabolic costs and thus respiratory needs. Additionally, we determined which traits are associated with allometric scaling of respiration. We compiled known scaling factors for animal phyla from a wide phylogenetic spectrum with colonial representatives and conducted a hierarchical mixed regression that included attributes of colonies. Traits associated with allometric scaling in colonial animals included colony shape, the presence of shared extrazooidal structures, and planktonic lifestyle. There are many other colonial rotifers and animal taxa for which allometric scaling factors have yet to be estimated, knowing these may enhance our understanding of the benefits of coloniality in animals.

AB  - As silicon is known to have a positive role in enhancing the resistance of rice plants to insects, an investigation on one aspect of the biochemical and molecular basis of rice plant defences mediated by silicon amendments against brown plant hopper Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), comprising field, pot culture and laboratory experiments was undertaken in OUAT. Two organic products; Diatomaceous Earth (DAE) at 0.15, 0.30 and 0.45 t/ha, and Rice Hull Ash (RHA) at 2, 3, 4 t/ha, along with one inorganic source, calcium silicate (CaSiO3) at 2, 3, 4 t/ha were soil applied as basal to evaluate their effects on the accumulation of silicon, proline, phenol, carbohydrates and protein in the plant tissues along with proteomic and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) studies. Results showed decreasing in proline and protein contents and increasing in silicon, phenol and carbohydrates contents in infected Si amended plants as compared to the control. Proteomic study showed appearing of a thick band of about 20 KDa in infested plants indicating its role in defense mechanism. Under SEM, the dumbbell shaped deposits of Si were marked clearly at different doses of silicon, indicating that the increase in silica dose enhanced its deposits, which was supported by EDAX-SEM data. Results of this study clearly demonstrated that soil amendments with silicon through organic and inorganic sources effectively caused biochemical and molecular changes that ultimately support the plant defenses against BPH.

AB  - N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is one of the major epigenetic modifications in eukaryotes. Although increasing functions of m(6)A have been identified in insects, its role in Plutella xylostella L. for host plant adaptation remains unclear. In the current study, we show that the m(6)A content of P. xylostella was relatively low in different developmental stages and tissues, with no significant differences. Two RNA methyltransferase genes, PxMETTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) and PxMETTL14 (methyltransferase-like 14), were identified and characterized. PxMETTL3 could be transcribed into two transcripts, and PxMETTL14 had only one transcript; both of these genes were highly expressed in egg and adult stages and reproductive tissues. The CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of PxMETTL3 (Delta PxMETTL3-2) or PxMETTL14 (Delta PxMETTL14-14) confirmed their function in m(6)A installation into RNA. Furthermore, upon transfer from an artificial diet to the host plant, the mutant strains were affected in terms of larval and pupal weight or adult emergence rate, while the wildtype (WT) strain did not exhibit any difference. In addition, the fecundity and egg hatching rate of the WT strain decreased significantly, whereas only the Delta PxMETTL14-14 mutant strain displayed significantly decreased fecundity. There seemed to be a tradeoff between the stress adaptation and reproduction in P. xylostella mediated by m(6)A modification. During host transfer, the expression of PxMETTL14 was consistent with the change in m(6)A content, which implied that PxMETTL14 could respond to host plant defense effectively, and may regulate m(6)A content. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts with changes in m(6)A levels revealed that the potential functions of m(6)A-related genes may be involved in steroid biosynthesis for larval performance and metabolic pathways for adult reproduction. Overall, our work reveals an epigenetic regulation mechanism for the rapid adaptation of P. xylostella to variations in the host environment.

AB  - The hippocampal formation of the brain contains a series of nerve cells related to environmental cognition and navigation. These cells can integrate their moment information and external perceptual information and acquire episodic cognitive memory. Through episodic cognition and memory, organisms can achieve autonomous navigation in complex environments. This paper mainly studies the strategy of robot episode navigation in complex environments. After exploring the environment, the robot obtains subjective environmental cognition and forms a cognition map. The grid cells information contained in the cognitive map can obtain the direction and distance of the target through vector calculation, which can get a shortcut through the inexperienced area. The synaptic connection of place cells in the cognitive map can be used as the topological relationship between episode nodes. When the target-oriented vector navigation encounters obstacles, the obstacles can be realized by setting closer sub-targets. Based on the known obstacle information obtained from boundary cells in the cognitive map, topological paths can be divided into multi-segment vector navigation to avoid encountering obstacles. This paper combines vector and topological navigation to achieve goal-oriented and robust navigation capability in a complex environment.

AB  - Existing methods for estimating critical bed shear stress are limited and usually do not consider local scour processes; therefore, the accuracy of numerical modeling is usually compromised. This paper presents the results of physical experiments on scour downstream of low-head weirs and proposes new equations for estimating the critical bed shear stress in scour holes. The experiments were done using a camel hump weir and coarse-bed materials which are applicable to steep streams with coarse-bed materials (gravel, rocks, etc.). The critical shear stress was regarded as the bed shear stress within the scour holes, which was determined using the three-dimensional (3D) flow field and bed morphology measured at the equilibrium scour state. The influence of the sediment size also was investigated. The experimental results showed that a scour hole can be divided into three zones: Zone-I for the upstream scour slope, Zone-II for the downstream scour slope, and Zone-III for the downstream slope of the sediment deposit downstream of the hole. The relation between the critical shear stress of the bed surface in Zone-I, the flow rate, and bed position was established, and the new equations yielded better accuracy than existing methods. In addition, the relation between the critical shear stress and the slope of the bed and the ratio of the local water depth to the particle size in Zone-II and Zone-III were established. After verification, the calculation results of the newly proposed equations were in good agreement with the standard values of the dimensionless critical Shields parameter obtained through processing the experimental results in the current study. Further discussion is provided regarding the integration of the parameters calculated applying the new parameters in the numerical models.

AB  - Diquat (DQ) is a widely utilized nonselective herbicide that is primarily used to control a wide range of weeds and crop residues. It also has significant environmental implications. DQ exposure can cause severe damage to the central nervous system (CNS), a critical symptom of acute poisoning that endangers patients. Despite its severity, the underlying mechanisms of DQ-induced toxic encephalopathy remain unclear, hindering the development of precise treatments. Our research demonstrated that acute DQ exposure in mice significantly increases oxidative stress and triggers neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. Furthermore, in vitro findings indicate that the detrimental effects of DQ are mediated by its disruption of autophagic processes, leading to exacerbated neural damage. DQ initially promotes autophagy in BV2 microglia for self-protection against oxidative stress and inflammation. However, this process is subsequently blocked, intensifying neural damage. Crucially, our results show that the activation of autophagy can reverse these adverse effects. This study not only sheds light on the intricate mechanisms of DQ neurotoxicity but also provides potential therapeutic targets for mitigating DQ-induced toxic encephalopathy.

AB  - Background: Humanin (HN) is an endogenous 24-residue peptide that was first identified as a protective factor against neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously demonstrated that the highly potent HN derivative HNG (HN with substitution of Gly for Ser14) ameliorated cognitive impairment in AD mouse models. Despite the accumulating evidence on the antagonizing effects of HN against cognitive deficits, the mechanisms behind these effects remain to be elucidated.
   Methods: The extracellular fluid in the hippocampus of wild-type young mice was collected by microdialysis and the amounts of neurotransmitters were measured. The kinetic analysis of exocytosis was performed by amperometry using neuroendocrine cells.
   Results: The hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) levels were increased by intraperitoneal injection of HNG. HNG did not affect the physical activities of the mice but modestly improved their object memory. In a neuronal cell model, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, HNG enhanced ACh-induced dopamine release. HNG increased ACh-induced secretory events and vesicular quantal size in primary neuroendocrine cells.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that HN directly enhances regulated exocytosis in neurons, which can contribute to the improvement of cognitive functions. General significance: The regulator of exocytosis is a novel physiological role of HN, which provides a molecular clue for HN's effects on brain functions under health and disease.

AB  - Whole-transcriptome data were used to study the changes in expression of genes coding proteins involved in the calcium regulation processes in the hippocampus of male mice with symptoms of depression caused by chronic social defeat stress. Cacna1g, Cacnb3, Camk1g, Camk2d, Camk2n2, Caly, Caln1, S100a16, and Slc24a4 genes were upregulated in the hippocampus of depressed mice compared to a control, while C-acna2d1, Cacng5, Grin2a, and Calm2 were downregulated. The greatest number of significant correlations was observed between the expression level of Calm2, which showed the highest transcriptional activity, and other differentially expressed genes. Calcium signaling in the hippocampus was assumed to be disrupted in mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress. The involvement of Calm2, Camk1g, Camk2d, and Camk2n2 genes in the process is discussed.

AB  - Abnormal activation of the extrasynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ceftriaxone (Cef) can improve cognitive impairment by upregulating glutamate transporter-1 and promoting the glutamate-glutamine cycle in an AD mouse model. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Cef on synaptic plasticity and cognitive-behavioral impairment and to unravel the associated underlying mechanisms. We used an APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD in this study. Extrasynaptic components from hippocampal tissue homogenates were isolated using density gradient centrifugation. Western blot was performed to evaluate the expressions of extrasynaptic NMDAR and its downstream elements. Intracerebroventricular injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-striatal enriched tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP61) and AAV-STEP61-shRNA were used to modulate the expressions of STEP61 and extrasynaptic NMDAR. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. The results showed that the expressions of GluN2B and GluN2B(Tyr1472) in the extrasynaptic fraction were upregulated in AD mice. Cef treatment effectively prevented the upregulation of GluN2B and GluN2B(Tyr1472) expressions. It also prevented changes in the downstream signals of extrasynaptic NMDAR, including increased expressions of m-calpain and phosphorylated p38 MAPK in AD mice. Furthermore, STEP61 upregulation enhanced, whereas STEP61 downregulation reduced the Cef-induced inhibition of the expressions of GluN2B, GluN2B(Tyr1472), and p38 MAPK in the AD mice. Similarly, STEP61 modulation affected Cef-induced improvements in induction of LTP and performance in MWM tests. In conclusion, Cef improved synaptic plasticity and cognitive behavioral impairment in APP/PS1 AD mice by inhibiting the overactivation of extrasynaptic NMDAR and STEP61 cleavage due to extrasynaptic NMDAR activation.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychiatric disorder, affecting approximately 25-35% of individuals exposed to significant psychological trauma. Despite extensive research, the underlying biological mechanisms of PTSD remain poorly understood, and the effectiveness of trauma-focused psychotherapeutic interventions is limited. To date, animal studies investigating trauma responses have primarily relied on rodent models, with the potential contributions of non-human primates relatively neglected. In this study, matched-control observations were employed to examine maternal caregiving behaviors, prosocial interactions, and responses to alarm calls in free-ranging golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) before and after an infanticide event. Results indicated a significant decrease in prosocial behaviors among some mothers, accompanied by significant increases in caregiving behaviors, heightened responsiveness to alarm calls, and indications of low mood. These findings provide evidence of trauma-related behavioral changes in golden snub-nosed monkeys, underscoring their utility as a model for studying PTSD given the similarity to trauma responses observed in humans. Overall, this study provides a foundation for further investigation into the evolutionary and biological aspects of PTSD, as well as the interactions between species-specific trauma responses. Future research should explore the use of non-human primate models to deepen our understanding of PTSD mechanisms.

AB  - Behavioral testing is a popular and reliable method of neurocognitive assessment of rodents but the lack of standard operating procedures has led to a high variation of protocols in use. Therefore, there exists a strong need to standardize protocols for a combined behavioral platform in order to maintain consistency across institutions and assist newcomers in the field. This paper provides details on the methodology of several behavioral tasks which have been validated in identifying radiation induced cognitive impairment as well as provide guidance on timescales and best practices. The cognitive assessments outlined here are optimized for rodent studies and either target learning and memory (open field task, object in updated location, novel object recognition, object in place, and temporal order) or mood and cognition (social interaction, elevated plus maze, light dark box, forced swim test, and fear extinction). We have utilized this platform successfully in evaluating cognitive injury induced by various radiation types, doses, fractionation schedules and also with ultra-high dose rate FLASH radiotherapy. Recommended materials and software are provided as well as advice on methods of data analysis. In this way a comprehensive behavioral platform is described with broad applicability to assess cognitive endpoints critical to therapeutic outcome.

AB  - Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) may serve as targets for remyelination-enhancing therapy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been demonstrated to ameliorate myelin loss and inhibit neuroinflammation in animal models of brain disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms through which LIPUS stimulates remyelination and glial activation are not well-understood. This study explored the impacts of LIPUS on remyelination and resident cells following lysolecithin (LPC)-induced local demyelination in the hippocampus. Demyelination was induced by the micro-injection of 1.5 mu L of 1% LPC into the rat hippocampus, and the treatment groups received daily LIPUS stimulation for 5 days. The therapeutic effects of LIPUS on LPC-induced demyelination were assessed through immunohistochemistry staining. The staining was performed to evaluate remyelination and Iba-1 staining as a microglia marker. Our data revealed that LIPUS significantly increased myelin basic protein (MBP) expression. Moreover, the IHC results showed that LIPUS significantly inhibited glial cell activation, enhanced mature oligodendrocyte density, and promoted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression at the lesion site. In addition, a heterologous population of microglia with various morphologies can be found in the demyelination lesion after LIPUS treatment. These data show that LIPUS stimulation may serve as a potential treatment for accelerating remyelination through the attenuation of glial activation and the enhancement of mature oligodendrocyte density and BDNF production.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising alternatives to existing treatments for multidrug-resistant bacteria-infected wounds. Therefore, the effect of protegrin-1 (PG1), a potent porcine AMP with broad-spectrum activity, on wound healing was evaluated. PG1-overexpressing transgenic mice were used as an in vivo model to evaluate its healing efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus-infected (10(6) colony forming units) wounds. We analyzed the wounds under four specific conditions in the presence or absence of antibiotic treatment. We observed the resolution of bacterial infection and formation of neo-epithelium in S. aureus-infected wounds of the mice, even without antibiotic treatment, whereas all wild-type mice with bacterial infection died within 8 to 10 days due to uncontrolled bacterial proliferation. Interestingly, the wound area on day 7 was smaller (p < 0.01) in PG1 transgenic mice than that in the other groups, including antibiotic-treated mice, suggesting that PG1 exerts biological effects other than bactericidal effect. Additionally, we observed that the treatment of primary epidermal keratinocytes with recombinant PG1 enhanced cell migration in in vitro scratch and cell migration assays. This study contributes to the understanding of broad-spectrum endogenous cathelicidins with potent antimicrobial activities, such as PG1, on wound healing. Furthermore, our findings suggest that PG1 is a potent therapeutic candidate for wound healing.

AB  - 1. Open data and code can be transformative tools in supporting evidence-informed solutions for stakeholders. Data can take many forms of evidence in the discipline of applied ecology including tables, lists, maps and visualizations to name a few.
   2. Endangered and listed species are often a catalyst for research, conservation and planning. Here, a novel, open data set summarizing all the reported diet and prey items for all endangered, terrestrial dryland species listed in central California is provided as a case study. These data highlight the critical need for sharing data rapidly and transparently to support ecological solution science.
   3. Systematic review practices were used, data were compiled and the resulting data set was published in an open access, federated data repository using ecological metadata language and FAIR principles. The goal is to show that these data can now be used and analysed by applied ecologists and stakeholders to identify not only the habitat and spatial needs for the endangered species but to widen the conservation protection net to include prey species.
   4. Conserving viable habitat with higher likelihoods of prey presence will better support conservation of endangered species, and data describing reported species are a crucial first step. Interactive tables, local species lists and maps are simple tools that can now be developed regionally with open data such as these.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Sleep problems, according to Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) philosophy, are attributed to the imbalance between yin and yang. Zhumian Granules, also known as Sleep-aid Granules or ZG, are a traditional Chinese herbal remedy specifically designed to alleviate insomnia. This formula consists of many components, including Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus), Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi Spinosae Semen), and other medicinal plants. According to the pharmacology of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Wu Wei Zi and Suan Zao Ren have the ability to relax the mind and promote sleep. When taken together, they may balance the opposing forces of yin and yang. Therefore, ZG may potentially be used as a therapeutic treatment for insomnia. Aim of the study: This research was specifically developed to establish a strong empirical basis for the subsequent advancement and utilization of ZG in the management of insomnia. This research aimed to gather empirical data to support the effectiveness of ZG, thereby providing useful insights into its potential therapeutic advantages for persons with insomnia. Materials and methods: This study utilized Zhumian Granules (ZG), a traditional Chinese herbal decoction, to examine its sedative and hypnotic effects on mice with PCPA-induced insomnia. The effects were assessed using the pentobarbital-induced sleep test (PIST), Morris water maze test (MWM), and autonomic activity test. The levels of neurotransmitters in each group of mice were evaluated using UPLC-QQQ-MS. The impact of ZG on the quantity and structure of hippocampal neurons was seen in brain tissue slices using immunofluorescence labeling. Results: ZG was shown to possess active sedative properties, effectively lowering the distance of movement and lengthening the duration of sleep. ZG mitigated the sleeplessness effects of PCPA by elevating the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), while reducing the levels of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE), as well as decreasing neuronal death. Conclusions: This research confirmed the sedative and hypnotic properties of ZG and elucidated its probable mechanism involving neurotransmitters.

AB  - The hypothesis that reversed, excitatory GABA may be involved in various brain pathologies, including epi-leptogenesis, is appealing but controversial because of the technical difficulty of probing endogenous GABAergic synaptic function in vivo. We overcome this challenge by non-invasive extracellular recording of neuronal firing responses to optogenetically evoked and spontaneously occurring inhibitory perisomatic GABAergic field potentials, generated by individual parvalbumin interneurons on their target pyramidal cells. Our direct probing of GABAergic transmission suggests a rather anecdotal participation of excitatory GABA in two specificmodels of epileptogenesis in the mouse CA3 circuit in vivo, even though this does not preclude its expression in other brain areas or pathological conditions. Our approach allows the detection of distinct alterations of inhibition during spontaneous activity in vivo, with high sensitivity. It represents a promising tool for the investigation of excitatory GABA in different pathological conditions that may affect the hippocampal circuit.

AB  - The viruses associated with bats have generated significant concern; however, there is limited knowledge regarding the endoparasites that affect these mammals. This study involved the collection of seven nematode specimens (three males and four females) from the intestines of Hipposideros armiger in Shaoguan City, Guangdong, China. Next-generation sequencing was employed to obtain the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome, which was determined to be 14,130 base pairs in length. The mitochondrial genome comprised 12 protein-coding genes, 21 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and an AT-rich non-coding region. Phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA sequences indicated that the nematode forms a sister clade to Nematodirus, exhibiting only 74% nucleotide identity. In contrast, the nuclear ITS1 gene demonstrated a high degree of nucleotide identity (98.6%-98.8%) with Durettenema guangdongense. Consequently, the parasitic nematode identified from H. armiger is likely to belong to the genus Durettenema and has been designated as Durettenema sp. 888. Furthermore, an epidemiological investigation revealed the presence of the parasitic nematode infections in H. armiger collected from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou Provinces. Given the widespread distribution of H. armiger and their tendency to inhabit areas in close proximity to human dwellings, the influence of parasite prevalence on bat population numbers and potential for human and domestic animal transmission of this pathogen warrants further investigation.

AB  - Objective:Magnetically-coupled resonant wireless power transfer (MCR-WPT) has the advantages of large transmission distance, high transmission efficiency and penetration, which brings convenience to people's lives. However, the safety of bioelectromagnetic effects caused by MCR-WPT has attracted much attention. In this paper, the influence of MCR-WPT electromagnetic environment on the characteristics of neuronal K+ channels in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the mouse hippocampus was studied, in order to provide an experimental basis for the development and rational development and application of WPT technology. Methods:Mice were continuously irradiated for 5 h for 30 d, and the learning and memory ability, instantaneous outward K+ channel current (IA) and delayed rectification K+ channel current (IK) of neurons in the hippocampal DG region were compared and analyzed by the control group and the magnetic field exposure groups of 5 d, 15 d and 30 d. Results:The activation process of transient outward potassium channels in the magnetic field exposure group was inhibited, and the activation characteristics of delayed rectified potassium channels shifted to the depolarization direction, which reduced the outflow of K+ and enhanced the nerve excitability, but there was no significant change in the behavior of the magnetic field exposed group mice. Conclusion:Long-term exposure to the electromagnetic environment of MCR-WPT altered the I -V properties and kinetic properties of K+ ion channels, inhibited IA and IK, and changed the frequency of neuronal action potential issuance, but these changes did not cause a decrease in learning memory capacity and cognitive dysfunction in mice.

AB  - YAP (gene symbol YAP1) as a potential oncoprotein, is positively correlated with the malignancy of various tumors. However, overexpression of YAP alone in multiple normal tissue cells has failed to induce tumor formation and the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Herein, we show that YAP activation directly induces transcription of its negative regulator, SAV1, to constitute a negative feedback loop, which plays a vital role in maintaining lung epithelial cell homeostasis and was dysregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Notably, smoking promotes the hypermethylation of the SAV1 promoter region, which disrupts YAP negative feedback by inactivating the Hippo pathway. Besides, exogenous overexpression of SAV1 can act as a traffic protein, activating the Hippo signaling and concurrently inhibiting the WNT pathway to decrease cancer cell growth. Furthermore, using the lung cancer organoids, we found that lentivirus-mediated SAV1 gene transfer combined with methylation inhibitor and YAP-TEAD inhibitor is a potential feasible clinical medication regimen for the lung cancer patient, especially among the smoking population. Thus, this SAV1 mediated feedback loop provides an efficient mechanism to establish the robustness and homeostasis of YAP regulation and as a potential target of gene therapy for the smoking NSCLC population.

AB  - Even in the recent past, kulans (Equus hemionus Pallas, 1775) lived in the Eurasian steppes and deserts, from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea to China. On the territory of Russia, the kulan was last encountered in 1926 in the Torey Lakes region, and in recent years the question has been raised about the possibility of reintroducing these animals into the Daursky Reserve. This review provides information on the current state of the Mongolian and Turkmenian kulan populations living in the countries of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Mongolia and China) bordering Russia. Currently, in countries adjacent to Russia, autochthonous populations of the kulan have been preserved in the southern regions of Mongolia and adjacent parts of northern China, where the Mongolian kulan lives (E.h. hemionus Pallas, 1775). The largest population lives in Mongolia, where currently, according to experts, approximately 70 000 individuals are found (or 83% of the world population of the species). Almost half of the kulan's range in Mongolia (42%) is located in nationally protected areas, but the size of existing protected areas, where kulans spend only about 23% of their time, is not large enough for the animals to be fully protected. The expansion of the network of protected areas to 30% of the country's territory by 2030 suggests that the kulan, like other migratory ungulate species of the arid zone, have good prospects. About 80% (or just over 3000 individuals) of the kulan population in China currently lives in the Kalamaili National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang, making this protected area extremely important for the conservation of the species. In the 1930s, the kulans disappeared from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In Turkmenistan the aboriginal population of the Turkmenian kulan was preserved until the end of the 1990s (E.h. kulan Groves and Mazak, 1967) in the Badkhyz Nature Reserve, but was most likely lost in recent years. A successful program for the reintroduction of kulans, which begun in the 1950s, and since the 1980s took on a larger scale, made it possible to preserve these animals (mainly in protected natural areas) within their historical range. In 2023, just over 30 kulan individuals lived in Turkmenistan in two areas with a total area of 800 km2: in the Tersakan river valley west of the borders of the Syunt Hasardag State Nature Reserve and on the territory of the Kaplankyr State Nature Reserve in the border zone. According to experts, it is very likely that in the near future the species will completely disappear from the country, since none of the indicated groups can be considered viable. The number of kulans living in the territory of the Saigachiy and Sudochye sanctuaries, as well as the Southern Ustyurt National Park in Uzbekistan, is currently estimated at 170 animals. Kulans are also actively breeding in the Jeyran eco-center. The reintroduction of kulans in Kazakhstan is progressing successfully in six protected areas; in 2022-2023 there were about 4400 kulans, and this work continues. From the presented review of the current state of the kulan living on the territory of the Central Asian states, it follows that great attention has been and is being given to the restoration and protection of the species throughout its range.
   This includes providing animals with suitable living conditions, including organizing a network of watering places, removing obstacles in the form of linear structures that interfere with animal migration, regulating the number of livestock, forming a network of protected areas at various levels, including the species in the Red Data Books and adopting legislation on liability for its illegal extraction, as well as creation of centers for breeding and keeping kulans for their subsequent reintroduction and conducting joint long-term and systematic research, including monitoring of populations.

AB  - Aluminum has been found to be closely related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and damage learning and memory functions. Many changes in epigenetics may be one of the mechanisms of aluminum neurotoxicity. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the mechanism of action of sub-chronic aluminum exposure on learning memory and histone H4 acetylation modification in Wistar rats, and the correlation between learning memory impairment and histone H4 acetylation in aluminum-exposed rats. Rats in each dose group were given 0.0 g/L, 2.0 g/L, 4.0 g/L, and 8.0 g/L of AlCl3 distilled water daily for 12 weeks. The learning and memory ability of rats was measured by the Morris water maze test; the neuronal morphology of rat hippocampus was observed by Nissl staining and transmission electron microscope; real-time PCR, and Western blot were used to detect mRNA expression and protein content in hippocampus of rats. The results suggest that aluminum may affect the gene and protein expression of HAT1 and HDAC2, and then affect histone H4 and the acetylation of H4K12 (acH4K12), which may lead to learning and memory dysfunction in rats.

AB  - Cohesin and CTCF are major drivers of 3D genome organization, but their role in neurons is still emerging. Here, we show a prominent role for cohesin in the expression of genes that facilitate neuronal maturation and homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we observed two major classes of activity-regulated genes with distinct reliance on cohesin in mouse primary cortical neurons. Immediate early genes (IEGs) remained fully inducible by KCl and BDNF, and short-range enhancer-promoter contacts at the IEGs Fos formed robustly in the absence of cohesin. In contrast, cohesin was required for full expression of a subset of secondary response genes characterized by long-range chromatin contacts. Cohesin-dependence of constitutive neuronal genes with key functions in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter signaling also scaled with chromatin loop length. Our data demonstrate that key genes required for the maturation and activation of primary cortical neurons depend on cohesin for their full expression, and that the degree to which these genes rely on cohesin scales with the genomic distance traversed by their chromatin contacts.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRDs) are among the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by progressive cognitive decline driven by complex and overlapping pathological mechanisms. While amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and Lewy bodies are well-established hallmarks, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology has emerged as a critical contributor to disease progression, particularly in cases exhibiting hippocampal sclerosis and severe brain atrophy. TDP-43 pathology is defined by its cytoplasmic mislocalization, aberrant aggregation, and nuclear depletion, leading to disruptions in RNA metabolism, stress granule dynamics, and mitochondrial function. Increasing evidence suggests that TDP-43 pathology not only exacerbates neuronal degeneration but also interacts with A beta plaques, tau tangles, and alpha-synuclein aggregates, compounding neurodegenerative processes and accelerating cognitive decline. Despite its growing recognition, TDP-43 pathology remains underexplored compared to other proteinopathies in AD and ADRDs, highlighting the need for further mechanistic studies and targeted therapeutic development. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of TDP-43 pathology in AD and ADRDs, with a focus on its role in disease progression. We further discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration in AD and ADRDs, emphasizing RNA dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted protein homeostasis, stress response alternations, and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport impairments. Lastly, given the significant impact on disease pathology, we review ongoing efforts to treat TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration, including antisense oligonucleotides, small-molecule inhibitors, and peptide-based interventions aimed at restoring TDP-43 function or preventing its neurotoxicity and pathological aggregation.

AB  - Capsaicin (CAP) is a primary indicator for assessing the level of pungency. Herein, iron-based single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) (Fe/NC) with exceptional oxidase-like activity were used to construct an immunosensor for CAP analysis. Fe/NC could imitate oxidase actions by transforming O-2 to O-center dot(2)- radicals in the absence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which could avoid complex operations and unstable results. By regulating the Fe atom loads, an optimal Fe-0.7/NC atom usage rate could improve the catalytic activity (Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m) = 0.09 mM). Fe-0.7/NC was integrated with goat antimouse IgG by facile mix incubation to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our Fe-0.7/NC immunosensing platform is anticipated to outperform the conventional ELISA in terms of stability and shelf life. The proposed immunosensor provided color responses across 0.01-1000 ng/mL CAP concentrations, with a detection limit of 0.046 ng/mL. Fe/NC may have potential as nanozymes for CAP detection in spicy foods, with promising applications in food biosensing.

AB  - There is an increased need and focus to understand how local brain microstructure affects the transport of drug molecules directly administered to the brain tissue, for example in convection-enhanced delivery procedures. This study reports a systematic attempt to characterize the cytoarchitecture of commissural, long association and projection fibres, namely the corpus callosum, the fornix and the corona radiata, with the specific aim to map different regions of the tissue and provide essential information for the development of accurate models of brain biomechanics. Ovine samples are imaged using scanning electron microscopy combined with focused ion beam milling to generate 3D volume reconstructions of the tissue at subcellular spatial resolution. Focus is placed on the characteristic cytological feature of the white matter: the axons and their alignment in the tissue. For each tract, a 3D reconstruction of relatively large volumes, including a significant number of axons, is performed and outer axonal ellipticity, outer axonal cross-sectional area and their relative perimeter are measured. The study of well-resolved microstructural features provides useful insight into the fibrous organization of the tissue, whose micromechanical behaviour is that of a composite material presenting elliptical tortuous tubular axonal structures embedded in the extra-cellular matrix. Drug flow can be captured through microstructurally-based models using 3D volumes, either reconstructed directly from images or generated in silico using parameters extracted from the database of images, leading to a workflow to enable physically-accurate simulations of drug delivery to the targeted tissue.
   Imaging and reconstruction of sheep brain axonal cytoarchitecture provides insight for brain biomechanics models that simulate drug delivery and other biological processes governed by interstitial fluid flow and transport.

AB  - Improving the economic benefits of Camellia oleifera is a major problem for C. oleifera growers, and girdling and foliar fertilizer have significant effects on improving the economic benefits of plants. This study explains the effects of girdling, girdling + foliar fertilizer on nutrient distribution, and the economic benefits of C. oleifera at different times. It also explains the N, P, and K contents of roots, leaves, fruits, and flower buds (sampled in March, May, August, and October 2021) and their economic benefits. The results showed girdling promoted the accumulation of N and K in leaves in March 2021 (before spring shoot emergence) but inhibited the accumulation of P, which led to the accumulation of P in roots and that of N in fruits in August 2021 (fruit expansion period). Foliar fertilizer application after girdling replenished the P content of leaves in March 2021, and P continued to accumulate in large quantities at the subsequent sampling time points. The N and P contents of the root system decreased in March. In October (fruit ripening stage), girdled shrubs showed higher contents of N and K in fruits and flower buds, and consequently lower relative contents of N and K in roots and leaves but higher content of P in leaves. Foliar fertilizer application slowed down the effects of girdling on nutrient accumulation in fruits and flower buds. Spraying foliar fertilizer decreased the N:P ratio in the flower buds and fruits of girdled plants. Thus, foliar fertilizer spray weakened the effects of girdling on the nutrient content and economic benefits of C. oleifera. In conclusion, girdling changed the nutrient accumulation pattern in various organs of C. oleifera at different stages, increased leaf N:K ratio before shoot emergence, reduced root K content at the fruit expansion stage and the N:K ratio of mature fruit, and promoted economic benefits.

AB  - In this paper, we assess the nephroprotective effects of thyrotropin and follitropin during ischaemia. The studies were performed in vitro in a model of isolated porcine kidneys stored in Biolasol (FZNP, Biochefa, Sosnowiec, Poland) and modified Biolasol (TSH: 1 mu g/L; FSH 1 mu g/L). We used the static cold storage method. The study was carried out based on 30 kidneys. The kidneys were placed in 500 mL of preservation solution chilled to 4 degrees C. The samples for biochemical tests were collected during the first kidney perfusion (after 2 h of storage) and during the second perfusion (after 48 h of storage). The results of ALT, AST, and LDH activities confirm the effectiveness of Biolasol + p-TSH in maintaining the structural integrity of renal cell membranes. Significantly reduced biochemical parameters of kidney function, i.e., creatinine and protein concentrations were also observed after 48 h storage. The protective effect of Biasol + p-TSH is most pronounced after 2 h of storage, suggesting a mild course of damage thereafter. A mild deterioration of renal function was observed after 48 h. The results of our analyses did not show any protective effect of Biolasol + p-FSH on the kidneys during ischaemia.

AB  - Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are important type-II detoxification enzymes that protect DNA and proteins from damage and are often used as protein tags for the expression of fusion proteins. In the present work, octa-aminopropyl caged polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (OA-POSS) was prepared via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and polymerized on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) through an amidation reaction. Glutathione (GSH) was then modified to GO-POSS through a Michael addition reaction to obtain a GSH-functionalized GO-POSS composite (GPG). The structure and characteristics of the as-prepared GPG composite were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravity analysis, and surface charge analysis. The specific binding interactions between glutathione and GST gave GPG favorable adsorption selectivity towards GST, and other proteins did not affect GST adsorption. The adsorption behavior of GST on the GPG composite conformed to the Langmuir isotherm model, and the adsorption capacity of GST was high up to 364.94 mg g(-1) under optimal conditions. The GPG-based solid-phase adsorption process was applied to the extraction of GST from a crude enzyme solution of pig liver, and high-purity GST was obtained via SDS-PAGE identification.

AB  - It has recently been recognised that populations are rarely in demographic equilibrium, but rather in a 'transient' state. To examine how transient dynamics influence our empirical understanding of the links between changes in demographic rates and population growth, we conducted a 32-year study of Columbian ground squirrels. The population increased rapidly for 10 years, followed by a 2-year crash, and a gradual 19-year recovery. Transient life table response experiment (LTRE) analysis showed that demographic stochasticity accounted for approximately one-fourth of the variation in population growth, leaving the majority to be explained by environmental influences. These relatively small rodents appeared to have a slow pace of life. But unlike the general pattern for large mammals with slow life histories, ground squirrel survival did not exhibit low variation associated with environmental 'buffering'; instead, survival varied substantially over time and contributed substantially (78%) to changes in abundance over the long-term study, with minor contributions from reproduction and unstable stage structure.

AB  - Host plant specialisation can promote evolutionary divergence between herbivore populations associated with different plant species. While the mechanisms by which specialist species exploit their hosts have been studied widely across taxa, less is known about the mechanisms that allow intraspecific variants to arise and to be maintained across spatial and temporal scales. To understand whether adaptations to plant defences against herbivory contribute to the co-existence of genetically distinct populations of an herbivore, we investigate the interaction between honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) and sympatric specialist and generalist populations of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. We found that mite folivory induces the production of sticky droplets on honeysuckle, which have a defensive role: they increase mite mortality directly, and potentially indirectly by increasing the arrestment of a predator. We show that droplet induction and the preference to feed on honeysuckle depend on mite genotype, where the generalist avoids this host and the specialist suppresses droplet production. These traits are heritable and dominant in F1 hybrids between generalists and specialists. Selection pressure from honeysuckle and differences in host preference likely reduce the opportunity of mating encounters on this host. We propose that the interplay between selection from host plant defences and ecological barriers to hybridisation contribute to the persistence of genetically distinct populations of a single species in sympatry.

AB  - Remaining with the family group may reduce long-term stress effects in orphaned African elephants.
   Social relationships have physiological impacts. Here, we investigate whether loss of the mother/offspring relationship has lasting effects on fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations in wild African elephant orphans several years following their mothers' deaths. We find no difference in fGCM concentrations between orphans and nonorphans, but find lower fGCM concentrations in elephants with more age mates in their family. We also unexpectedly identify lower concentrations in orphans without their natal family versus nonorphans and natal orphans, which we speculate may be due to the development of hypocortisolism following a prolonged period without familial support. An index of plant productivity (i.e. food) shows the largest correlation with fGCM concentrations. Our findings indicate no lasting differences in glucocorticoid concentrations of surviving orphan elephants who are with their family, suggest the presence of age mates may reduce glucocorticoid concentrations in elephants, and emphasize that basic survival needs are the primary regulators of the stress response.

AB  - Current anti-seizure drugs fail to control approximately 30% of epilepsies. Therefore, there is a need to develop more effective anti-seizure drugs, and medicinal plants provide an attractive source for new compounds. This study aimed to evaluate the possible anti-seizure and neuroprotective effects of neferine, an alkaloid from the lotus seed embryos of Nelumbo nucifera, in a kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure rat model and its underlying mechanisms. Rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administrated neferine (10 and 50 mg/kg) 30 min before KA injection (15 mg/kg, i.p.). Neferine pretreatment increased seizure latency and reduced seizure scores, prevented glutamate elevation and neuronal loss, and increased presynaptic protein synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 expression in the hippocampi of rats with KA. Neferine pretreatment also decreased glial cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) expression in the hippocampi of rats with KA. In addition, NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, caspase-1, and interleukin-18 expression levels were decreased in the hippocampi of seizure rats pretreated with neferine. These results indicated that neferine reduced seizure severity, exerted neuroprotective effects, and ameliorated neuroinflammation in the hippocampi of KA-treated rats, possibly by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and decreasing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Our findings highlight the potential of neferine as a therapeutic option in the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Given the increasing interest in bioactive dietary components that can modulate gene expression enhancing human health, three metabolites isolated from hemp seeds-cannabidiolic acid, N-trans-caffeoyltyramine, and cannabisin B-were examined for their ability to change the expression levels of microRNAs in human neural cells. To this end, cultured SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the three compounds and their microRNA content was characterized by next-generation small RNA sequencing. As a result, 31 microRNAs underwent major expression changes, being at least doubled or halved by the treatments. A computational analysis of the biological pathways affected by these microRNAs then showed that some are implicated in neural functions, such as axon guidance, hippocampal signaling, and neurotrophin signaling. Of these, miR-708-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-190a-5p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-143-3p are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease and their expression changes are expected to ameliorate neural function. Overall, these results provide new insights into the mechanism of action of hemp seed metabolites and encourage further studies to gain a better understanding of their biological effects on the central nervous system.

AB  - Neuronal circuits integrating Parvalbumin-positive GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (PV) are essential for normal brain function and are often altered in psychiatric conditions. During development, Dlx5 and Dlx6 (Dlx5/6) genes are involved in the differentiation of PV-interneurons. In the adult, Dlx5/6 continue to be expressed at low levels in most telencephalic GABAergic neurons, but their importance in determining the number and distribution of adult PV-interneurons is unknown. Previously, we have shown that targeted deletion of Dlx5/6 in mouse GABAergic neurons (Dlx5/6(VgatCre) mice) results in altered behavioural and metabolic profiles. Here we evaluate the consequences of targeted Dlx5/6 gene dosage alterations in adult GABAergic neurons. We compare the effects on normal brain of homozygous and heterozygous (Dlx5/6(VgatCre) and Dlx5/6(VgatCre/+) mice) Dlx5/6 deletions to those of Dlx5 targeted overexpression (GABAergic(Dlx5/+) mice). We find a linear correlation between Dlx5/6 allelic dosage and the density of PV-positive neurons in the adult prelimbic cortex and in the hippocampus. In parallel, we observe that Dlx5/6 expression levels in GABAergic neurons are also linearly associated with the intensity of anxiety and compulsivity-like behaviours. Our findings reinforce the notion that regulation of Dlx5/6 expression is involved in individual cognitive variability and, possibly, in the genesis of certain neuropsychiatric conditions.

AB  - Cataract, a painless and progressive disorder is manifested as the opacification of the lens that represents the most significant cause of blindness worldwide. The objective of this study is to unveil the function of Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) and potential action mechanisms against cataract. The ferroptosis-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pivot genes were extracted through the comprehensive bioinformatics methods. Erastin was applied for inducing ferroptosis in hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-treated SRA01/04 cells, and validated by detecting content of intracellular iron, glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA). Additionally, the effects of KRAS deficiency on ferroptosis were determined by functional assays. The proteins expression related to ferroptosis and Hippo pathway were determined by Western blotting. A total of 73 ferroptosis-related DEGs were discovered, and 6 critical core genes were confirmed upregulation in cataract cell model. The H 2 O 2-treated SRA01/04 cells exhibited decrease of cell viability and proliferation, iron accumulation, MDA increase, GSH consumption, rise of COX2 and decline of GPX4, with further aggravated under erastin treatment, while the phenomena were improved by KRAS knockdown. Additionally, KRAS deficiency was involved in the Hippo signalling pathway activation. Downregulation of KRAS might restrain ferroptosis and affect Hippo pathway in cataract.

Em alguns casos, porem, as formigas sAo ineficazes contra os herbivoros. Tais eventos ocorrem, por exemplo, quando os herbivoros apresentam adaptacoes para evitar a predacAo pelas formigas. Assim, os resultados dessas interacoes dependem de fatores como a identidade da formiga, fenologia da planta e caracteristicas do herbivoro. Aqui, investigamos o impacto de besouros florivoros endofiticos sobre o sucesso reprodutivo de suas plantas hospedeiras, duas especies simpatricas de Banisteriopsis (Malpighiaceae), dependendo da acAo das formigas visitantes de nectarios extraflorais. Manipulamos experimentalmente a presenca de formigas e herbivoros nas especies B. malifolia e B. laevifolia durante seu periodo reprodutivo para testar a eficacia do mutualismo formigas-NEFs na producAo do conjunto de frutos da planta. Realizamos tratamentos onde tres inflorescencias similares foram selecionadas para serem (I) ramo de controle, sem manipulacoes, (II) ramo livre de besouros, isolado com cobertura de tecido e (III) ramo livre de formigas, isolado na base com cera atoxica. Formulamos a hipotese de que os herbivoros endofiticos tem um impacto negativo sobre o sucesso reprodutivo das plantas porque escapam da acAo das formigas (defesas bioticas). Como resultado, observamos (i) que os besouros florivoros Anthonomus tem um impacto negativo no sucesso reprodutivo de Banisteriopsis; (ii) as formigas falham na protecAo das plantas contra os besouros endofiticos florivoros; e (iii) a maioria dos resultados foram especificos da especie. Nossos resultados indicam que estes sistemas apresentam resultados condicionais que dependem dos fatores intrinsecos de cada especie de planta.

AB  - Explanations for the evolution of social monogamy in mammals typically emphasise one of two possibilities: females are overdispersed (such that males cannot defend access to more than one female at a time) or males provide a service to the female. However, the first claim has never been formally tested. I test it directly at three levels using population-level data from primates and ungulates. First, I show that the females of monogamous genera do not have territories that are significantly larger, either absolutely or relatively, than those of polygynous genera. Second, using two indices of territorial defendability, I show that, given their typical day journey lengths, males of most monogamous species could easily defend an area large enough to allow them to monopolise as many as 5-10 females if they ranged solitarily. Finally, I use a model of male mate searching strategies to show that the opportunity cost incurred by pairbonded males is typically 5-10 times the reproductive success they actually obtain by being obligately monogamous. This suggests that the selection pressure dissuading them from pursuing a roving male strategy must be very considerable. At present, the evidence is undecided as to whether mitigating predation or infanticide risk is the primary function, but estimates of their impacts suggest that both are in fact plausible.

AB  - While mechanisms of plant- plant communication for alerting neighbouring plants of an imminent insect herbivore attack have been described aboveground via the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), we are yet to decipher the specific components of plant- plant signalling belowground. Using bioassay-guided fractionation, we isolated and identified the non-protein amino acid L-DOPA, released from roots of Acyrtosiphon pisum aphid-infested Vicia faba plants, as an active compound in triggering the production of VOCs released aboveground in uninfested plants. In behavioural assays, we show that after contact with L-DOPA, healthy plants become highly attractive to the aphid parasitoid (Aphidius ervi), as if they were infested by aphids. We conclude that L- DOPA, originally described as a brain neurotransmitter precursor, can also enhance immunity in plants.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) usually causes cognitive disorders, including learning difficulties, that emerge before motor symptoms. Mutations related to lysosomal trafficking are linked to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, whereas the cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we discover a reduction in the dendritic density of lysosomes in the hippocampus that correlates with deficits in synaptic plasticity and spatial learning in early CAG-140 HD model mice. We directly manipulate intraneuronal lysosomal positioning with light-induced CRY2:CIB1 dimerization and demonstrate that lysosomal abundance in dendrites positively modulates long-term potentiation of glutamatergic synapses onto the neuron. This modulation depends on lysosomal Ca2+ release, which further promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) entry into spines. Importantly, optogenetically restoring lysosomal density in dendrites rescues the synaptic plasticity deficit in hippocampal slices of CAG-140 mice. Our data reveal dendritic lysosomal density as a modulator of synaptic plasticity and suggest a role of lysosomal mispositioning in cognitive decline in HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitrification is a technique of cryopreservation that has been proposed as a promising alternative method for the preservation of oocytes, embryos and gonadal tissue. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of different antioxidants on post-thaw viability, morphology of retrieved oocytes and histology of vitrified ovarian tissue.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four different antioxidants [i.e., resveratrol (20 mu M), ZnSO4 (500 mu M), curcumin (25 mu M) and quercetin (1 mu M)] were evaluated after their addition to the vitrification and warming media for their effects on the viability and morphology of retrieved oocytes and the histology of vitrified ovarian tissue. RESULTS: The number of oocytes retrieved from ovarian tissue from the above mentioned antioxidants and vitrified control were 34, 41, 26, 31 and 46 respectively. Among these the number of viable oocytes were found to be 24 (70.6%), 30 (73.1%), 20 (76.9%), 26 (83.9%) and 33 (71.7%) and the number of oocytes found morphologically normal were 24 (70.6%), 26 (63.4%), 18 (69.2%), 21 (67.7%) and 34 (73.9%) for the above mentioned different antioxidants and vitrified control, respectively. Nonsignificant (P>0.05) differences were found between different treatment groups. Histomorphological evaluation of the ovarian cortical tissue showed that the percentage of intact follicles was significantly (P <= 0.05) higher in the fresh control (84.19 +/- 3.9) than in other groups. Non-significant differences were found between resveratrol (50.2 +/- 5.5), curcumin (48.7 +/- 5.7), quercetin (51.6 +/- 4.8) and the vitrified control (42.7 +/- 6.1) groups; however, the ZnSO4 supplemented group (23.1 +/- 8.54) differed significantly (P <= 0.05) from other antioxidant groups but was non-significant (P>0.05) with the vitrified control group (42.7 +/- 6.1). CONCLUSION: The addition of antioxidants resveratrol, curcumin and quercetin at these concentrations tended to non-significantly improve the follicular integrity after vitrification.

AB  - Background: It has been established that sphingomyelin present human breast milk is useful for the brain maturation and cognitive development. At 10 days of breastfeeding the sphingomyelin content is double that present in cow's milk and its content is independent of the maternal diet. The aim of the study was to analyze the content of sphingomyelin in breast milk at 3 months of breastfeeding and to consider the effect of this molecule on synaptic function and nerve conduction through the probable expansion of myelinated axons. Methods: Therefore, to begin to define and assess this, we performed sphingolipidomic analysis in human breast milk. Then, we cultured embryonic hippocampal cells (HN9.10) in the presence of sphingomyelin at a concentration from 0.6% to 31% of human milk, estimated by considering its bioavailability and its passage into the interstitial fluid. To highlight the effect of sphingomyelin in the cells, cell viability and morphology were evaluated. Analyses of neutral sphingomyelinase gene and protein expression was performed. The entry of sphingomyelin into the cell was studied in immunofluorescence; the expression of heavy neurofilament (NF200) was tested with immunocytochemical technique. Results: We demonstrated that sphingomyelin is able to enter cell nucleus and overexpress the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 4 (SMPD4) gene encoding for neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), an enzyme useful for its own metabolism. Later, cells displayed changes of the soma and the appearance of neurites supported by NF200 overexpression. Conclusions: We speculated that the sphingomyelin present in human breast milk is useful in part to regulate nuclear activity and in part to form myelin sheet to facilitate nerve cell maturation. As brain development occurs at 0-3 years, these data open a new avenue of potential intervention to integrate the infant formulas with SM to obtain a product similar to the maternal milk.

AB  - Sex selection technologies have immensely impacted swine production globally. Conventional earlier embryo sex identification methods require professional technicians and sophisticated laboratory instruments. Rapid on-site gender identification of porcine embryos and pork products remains challenging. In this study, we developed a CRISPR/Cas12a-based fluorescence visualization point-of-care sex determination test that is rapid, accurate and easy to implement on-site. The CRISPR/Cas12a assay coupled with either the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) employs precisely designed primers and single-guide RNAs targeting the sex-determining region Y (SRY) and the zinc finger protein X-linked (ZFX) genes. PCR and LAMP amplicons were cleaved with the subsequent generation of fluorescing products detectable with portable blue and ultraviolet light transilluminators. Approximately two copies per microliter of the ZFX and SRY genes were detected using the RApid VIsual CRISPR (RAVI-CRISPR) assay. This method is a sensitive, inexpensive, versatile, and point-of-care test. The technology has other potential applications like determining the sex of diverse livestock species, detecting livestock disease-causing pathogens and evaluating the quality of meat products.

AB  - The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is critically involved in modulation of memory by stress hormones. Noradrenergic activation of the BLA enhances memory consolidation and plays a necessary role in the enhancing or impairing effects of stress hormones on memory. The BLA is not only involved in the consolidation of aversive memories but can regulate appetitive memory formation as well. Extensive evidence suggests that the BLA is a modulatory structure that influences consolidation of arousing memories through modulation of plasticity and expression of plasticity-related genes, such as the activity regulated cytoskeletal-associated (Arc/Arg 3.1) protein, in efferent brain regions. ARC is an immediate early gene whose mRNA is localized to the dendrites and is necessary for hippocampus-dependent long-term potentiation and long-term memory formation. Posttraining intra-BLA infusions of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol, enhances memory for an aversive task and increases dorsal hippocampus ARC protein expression following training on that task. To examine whether this function of BLA noradrenergic signaling extends to the consolidation of appetitive memories, the present studies test the effect of post-training intra-BLA infusions of clenbuterol on memory for the appetitive conditioned place preference (CPP) task and for effects on ARC protein expression in hippocampal synapses. Additionally, the necessity of increased hippocampal ARC protein expression was also examined for long-term memory formation of the CPP task. Immediate post-training intra-BLA infusions of clenbuterol (4 ng/0.2 mu L) significantly enhanced memory for the CPP task. This same memory enhancing treatment significantly increased ARC protein expression in dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampal synaptic fractions. Furthermore, immediate posttraining intra-dorsal hippocampal infusions of Arc antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), which reduce ARC protein expression, prevented long-term memory formation for the CPP task. These results suggest that noradrenergic activity in the BLA influences long-term memory for aversive and appetitive events in a similar manner and the role of the BLA is conserved across classes of memory. It also suggests that the influence of the BLA on hippocampal ARC protein expression and the role of hippocampal ARC protein expression are conserved across classes of emotionally arousing memories.

AB  - Recombinant human peroxiredoxin-5 (hPRDX5), isolated from anti-cancer bioactive peptide (ACBPs), shows a homology of 89% with goat peroxiredoxin-5 (gPRDX5) and is reported to display anti-tumor activity in vivo. Herein, we explored the effect of hPRDX5 and the responsible mechanism in treating pancreatic cancer. Tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into normal PBS group and treatment group (n=5; 10 mg/kg hPRDX5). Flow cytometry was employed to examine lymphocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cell subsets, and the function proteins of natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood, spleen, and tumor tissues of mice. Western blot was used to measure the protein expressions of the key nodes in TLR4-MAPK-NF-kappa B signaling pathway. The rate of tumor suppression was 57.6% at a 10 mg/kg dose in orthotopic transplanted tumor mice. Moreover, the population of CD3+ CD4 + T cells, NK cells, and CD3 + CD8 + T cells was significantly increased in the tumor tissue of the hPRDX5 group, while the proportion of granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells decreased slightly. In addition, after treatment with hPRDX5, the percentage of NK cells in blood increased more than 4-fold. Our findings indicated that hPRDX5 effectively suppressed pancreatic cancer possibly via the TLR4-MAPK-NF-kappa B signaling cascade; hence hPRDX5 could be a prospective immunotherapy candidate for treating pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a multidimensional psychiatric disorder that is estimated to affect around 350 million people worldwide. Generating valid and effective animal models of depression is critical and has been challenging for neuroscience researchers. For preclinical studies, models based on stress exposure, such as unpredictable chronic mild stress (uCMS), are amongst the most reliable and used, despite presenting concerns related to the standardization of protocols and time consumption for operators. To overcome these issues, we developed an automated system to expose rodents to a standard uCMS protocol. Here, we compared manual (uCMS) and automated (auCMS) stress-exposure protocols. The data shows that the impact of the uCMS exposure by both methods was similar in terms of behavioral (cognition, mood, and anxiety) and physiological (cell proliferation and endocrine variations) measurements. Given the advantages of time and standardization, this automated method represents a step forward in this field of preclinical research.

AB  - Recent studies show that, even in constant environments, the tuning of single neurons changes over time in a variety of brain regions. This representational drift has been suggested to be a consequence of continuous learning under noise, but its properties are still not fully understood. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we trained an artificial network on a simplified navigational task. The network quickly reached a state of high performance, and many units exhibited spatial tuning. We then continued training the network and noticed that the activity became sparser with time. Initial learning was orders of magnitude faster than ensuing sparsification. This sparsification is consistent with recent results in machine learning, in which networks slowly move within their solution space until they reach a flat area of the loss function. We analyzed four datasets from different labs, all demonstrating that CA1 neurons become sparser and more spatially informative with exposure to the same environment. We conclude that learning is divided into three overlapping phases: (i) Fast familiarity with the environment; (ii) slow implicit regularization; and (iii) a steady state of null drift. The variability in drift dynamics opens the possibility of inferring learning algorithms from observations of drift statistics.

AB  - Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons located in the nucleus of hippocampal commissure (NHpC) have been proposed to be involved in the avian neuroendocrine regulation of stress and appeared to respond prior to CRH neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) when food deprivation stress was applied. Since the response of the NHpC was rapid and short-lived, was it regulated differentially from CRH neurons in the PVN? We, therefore, applied immobilization stress to test whether the NHpC response was stressor specific. Gene expression of CRH and stress-related genes in the NHpC, PVN, anterior pituitary (APit) as well as plasma corticosterone (CORT) were determined. Furthermore, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were examined regarding their possible roles in the regulation of CRH neurons. Data showed that rapid activation of CRH mRNA in the NHpC occurred and preceded a slower gene activation in the PVN, upregulation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) transcripts in the APit and significant increases of CORT concentrations. Results suggested BDNF's role in negative feedback between CRH and CRHR1 in the NHpC and positive feedback between CRH and CRHR1 in the PVN. In the APit, V1bR activation appeared responsible for sustaining CORT release when stress persisted. Overall, data suggest that the NHpC functions as part of the HPA axis of birds and perhaps a comparable extra-hypothalamic structure occurs in other vertebrates.Lay Summary The nucleus of the hippocampal commissure, a structure outside of the hypothalamus, shows rapidly increased neural gene expression that appears to contribute to the early activation of the traditional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsible for the production of stress hormones.

AB  - The proportion of leaves of downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) damaged by insects at ten sites of coniferous forest along the pollution gradient of the Middle Ural copper smelter was analyzed. The study was conducted during periods of moderate (2009) and low (2019) emissions in early and late summer. The proportion of damaged leaves was higher in 2019 and increased towards the end of the growing season but was not associated with distance to the smelter and lead concentration in leaves.

AB  - Conceptual context: Wildlife crop consumption is a worldwide problem. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of profit and utility maximization from economics as established in the theory of optimal foraging, bringing this perspective to the issue of wildlife crop consumption by testing whether elephants forage for crops in an optimal way. Methodological approach: Using combinatorial optimization in an agent-based model, in which elephants' objective is to find a valid walk that maximizes their energy balance. We used empirical data from GPS collars on African savanna elephants to train and test the model. Main results and conclusions: When we focused solely on which terrain blocks the elephants of GNP visit and spend time in, our ABM got 56 percent of these blocks correct. Our ABM performed roughly 25 percent better than two alternative models, including the random walk model. In both subsamples of data that we looked at, the ABM performed better in terms of fitting the data on real walks than the alternative models. The ABM's performance improved, and the alternative models' performance worsened, when we only looked at data on real walks that involve crop consumption. This suggests that there is more randomness involved when elephants are engaged in foraging activity that do not include crop consumption. At the same time, elephant walks involving crop consumption seem to more closely follow optimizing principles. Findings from this ABM approach support ecological understanding of elephant crop foraging, highlighting the optimal movements involved in crop foraging events as well as the importance of trespassing costs and landscape configuration. It may give conservationists and policy-makers a starting point to use in formulating policies to minimize the harms and costs that result from elephant crop consumption.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a common and serious complication following anesthesia and surgery; however, the precise mechanisms of POCD remain unclear. Our previous research showed that sevoflurane impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and thus cognitive function in the aged brain by affecting neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) expression; however, the signaling mechanism involved remains unexplored. In this study, we found a dramatic decrease in the proportion of differentiated neurons with increasing concentrations of sevoflurane, and the inhibition of neural stem cell differentiation was partially reversed after the administration of exogenous NT-3. Understanding the molecular underpinnings by which sevoflurane affects NT-3 is key to counteracting cognitive dysfunction. Here, we report that sevoflurane administration for 2 days resulted in upregulation of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) expression, which led to transcriptional inactivation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). Due to the colocalization of HDAC9 and CREB within cells, this may be related to the interaction between HDAC9 and CREB. Anyway, this ultimately led to reduced NT-3 expression and inhibition of neural stem cell differentiation. Furthermore, knockdown of HDAC9 rescued the transcriptional activation of CREB after sevoflurane exposure, while reversing the downregulation of NT-3 expression and inhibition of neural stem cell differentiation. In summary, this study identifies a unique mechanism by which sevoflurane can inhibit CREB transcription through HDAC9, and this process reduces NT-3 levels and ultimately inhibits neuronal differentiation. This finding may reveal a new strategy to prevent sevoflurane-induced neuronal dysfunction.

AB  - The neuropeptide relaxin-3 and its cognate receptor, relaxin family peptide-3 receptors (RXFP3), have been implicated in modulating learning and memory processes, but their specific roles remain unclear. This study utilized behavioral and molecular approaches to investigate the effects of putatively reversible blockade of RXFP3 in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) of the hippocampus on spatial and fear memory formation in rats. Male Wistar rats received bilateral vDG cannula implantation and injections of the RXFP3 antagonist, R3(B Delta 23-27)R/ I5 (400 ng/0.5 mu L per side), or vehicle at specific time points before acquisition, consolidation, or retrieval phases of the Morris water maze and passive avoidance learning tasks. RXFP3 inhibition impaired acquisition in the passive avoidance task but not the spatial learning task. However, both memory consolidation and retrieval were disrupted in both tasks following RXFP3 antagonism. Ventral hippocampal levels of the consolidation-related kinase p70-S6 kinase (p70S6K) were reduced RXFP3 blockade. These findings highlight a key role for ventral hippocampal RXFP3 signaling in the acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of spatial and emotional memories, extending previous work implicating this neuropeptide system in hippocampal memory processing.

AB  - The ETS transcription factor Fli-1, known for regulating the vitality of pericyte in mice, has not been thoroughly investigated in traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we used a mouse TBI model to demonstrate that Fli-1 expression in pericyte within the ipsilateral hippocampus is significantly increased following TBI and is associated with pericyte loss. Interfering with Fli-1 expression in pericyte disrupted their interactions with microglia, which in turn inhibited the transformation of microglia to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Administration of Fli-1 siRNA via lateral ventricle injection reduced pericyte loss, microglial activation, and neuroinflammation induced by TBI. Additionally, Fli-1 siRNA treatment reduced neurological damage in the hippocampus and improved memory and cognitive function. Overall, our findings suggest that Fli-1 expression in pericyte is closely linked to pericyte apoptosis and pericyte-microglia interactions. Inhibiting Fli-1 could mitigate pericyte loss, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, and cognitive decline, indicating that targeting Fli-1 may be a viable clinical strategy for TBI intervention.

AB  - Here, we present a novel in vitro maturation (IVM) system comprising an agarose matrix supplemented with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins for enhanced maturation of immature oocytes within cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) derived from porcine medium antral follicles (MAFs). Immunocytochemical analyses of integrin subunit alpha(2), alpha(5), alpha(6), beta(1), and beta(4) expression suggested that integrin alpha(2)beta(1), alpha(5)beta(1), alpha(6)beta(1), and alpha(6)beta(4) play pivotal roles in IVM of porcine immature oocytes. Combinatorial supplementation of fibronectin interacting with integrin alpha(5)beta(1), collagen interacting with integrin alpha(2)beta(1), and laminin interacting with integrin alpha(6)beta(1) and alpha(6)beta(4) to the agarose matrix had no significant effect on nuclear maturation. However, the number of parthenogenetic embryos that developed into blastocysts increased when oocytes were matured using agarose IVM matrices supplemented with fibronectin, collagen, or laminin. Furthermore, significant increases in cytoplasmic maturation-related parameters (BMP15 level, cumulus cell expansion score, intra-oocyte ATP level, and index of cortical granule distribution) were observed in COCs matured in vitro using ECM protein-incorporated agarose matrices. Our data suggest that mature porcine oocytes with enhanced developmental competence and high-quality cytoplasm can be generated via IVM using agarose matrices supplemented with fibronectin, collagen, or laminin.

AB  - Fermented soybean lipids (FSE-C) is an extract enriched in active lipid classes. To explore whether FSE-C can alleviate cognitive damage triggered by the exposure to microwave radiation through regulating lipid metabolism, we employed lipidomic profiling based on a UPLC-MS to investigate differential lipid metabolites in the serum and hippocampus of rats. The results showed that orally administered FSE-C could protect from cognitive damage in microwave-induced rats. Serum lipidomics indicated that FSE-C effectively facilitated the recovery of 43 differential lipid metabolites including 6 phosphatidylcholines (PCs), 5 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), 1 phosphatidylinositol, 3 lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), 6 lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs), and 22 triglycerides (TGs), which was consistent with the analysis of serum TG levels. Moreover, FSE-C positively coordinated hexacosanoic acid, 2 PCs, 4 sphingomyelins (SMs), and 11 TGs, through the hippocampal lipidomics. Collectively, these findings suggested that phospholipid and TG metabolisms were significantly modified in microwave-exposed rats. TGs may be regarded as potential biomarkers to further investigate and evaluate the roles and functions of FSE-C on the attenuation of cognitive damage induced by microwave radiation.

AB  - Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an increasingly needed, life-maintaining kidney replacement therapy; efficient solute transport is critical for patient outcome. While the role of peritoneal perfusion on solute transport in PD has been described, the role of cellular barriers is uncertain, the mesothelium has been considered irrelevant. We calculated peritoneal blood microvascular endothelial surface area (BESA) to mesothelial surface area (MSA) ratio in human peritonea in health, chronic kidney disease, and on PD, and performed molecular transport related gene profiling and single molecule localization microscopy in two mesothelial (MC) and two endothelial cell lines (EC). Molecular-weight dependent transport was studied in-vitro, ex-vivo and in mice. Peritoneal BESA is 1-3-fold higher than MSA across age groups, and increases with PD, while the mesothelium is preserved during the first 2 years of PD. Tight junction, transmembrane and transcytotic transporter expression are cell-type specifically expressed. At nanoscale, tight junction anchoring protein Zonula occludens-1 is more abundant and more continuously expressed along the MC than the EC. Ionic conductance is 3-fold lower across the MC than human microvascular EC, as is the permeability for creatinine, 4- and 10-kDa, but not for 70-kDa dextran. MC removal from sheep peritoneum abolishes ionic barrier function. Short term intraperitoneal LPS exposure in mice selectively affects peritoneal mesothelial integrity and increases transperitoneal solute transport. We provide molecular correlates and consistent functional evidence for the mesothelium as a barrier for peritoneal solute transport, ie, essential information on peritoneal transport modeling, and for interventions to improve PD efficiency and biocompatibility, and beyond.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the clinical mechanism of propofol in relieving myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in type 2 diabetic patients. In the present study, 369 patients suffering from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in our hospital from January 2018 to May 2019 were selected as study subjects and randomly divided into low-dose propofol group (n=123; intravenously injected with 25 mg before angiography), high-dose propofol group (n=123; intravenously injected with 50 mg before angiography) and control group (n=123; receiving local anesthesia before angiography, subcutaneously injected with 2% lidocaine 2.5 ml at puncture point). After coronary angiography in each group, the serum nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and cardiac troponin (cTnT) contents in different treatment groups were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Coronary blood samples were obtained during coronary angiography. Expressions of interleukin-10 (IL -10), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were detected by Western blotting (WB). The protein contents of B-cell lymphoma factor 2 (Bcl-2), apoptosis-related genes Bax and caspase-3 were detected by WB. The contents of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results showed that compared with the control group, the low-dose propofol group had increased NO, decreased ET-1 and cTnT contents (P<0.05), and high-dose propofol group had further increased NO and further decreased ET-1 and cTnT contents compared with low-dose propofol group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the low-dose propofol group had reduced IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-alpha expressions (P<0.05), and high-dose propofol group had further reduced IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-alpha expressions compared with low-dose propofol group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the low-dose propofol group had increased Bcl-2 protein content, decreased Bax and Caspase-3 protein contents (P<0.05); compared with low-dose propofol group, high-dose propofol group had further increased Bcl-2 protein content, further decreased Bax and Caspase-3 protein contents (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, low -dose propofol group had decreased SOD content, increased LDH, CK, and MAD contents (P<0.05). Compared with low-dose propofol group, high-dose propofol group had further decreased SOD content, further increased LDH, CK and MAD contents (P<0.05). We conclude that, Propofol has a protective effect on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in type 2 diabetic patients, the mechanism of which is to up-regulate serum NO, Bcl-2 and SOD, and down-regulate serum ET-1, cTnT, IL-10, IL-6, TNF-alpha, BAX, LDA, CK, MAD, thus protecting cardiomyocytes.

AB  - Transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) transcription factors undergo auto-palmitoylation, which is critical to mediate their function and maintain stability. Targeting the palmitate binding pocket of TEAD holds considerable promise for drug discovery, and it can be characterised into three components: a conserved cysteine, a hydrophobic main pocket, and a hydrophilic side pocket. Endogenous palmitate and several known TEAD inhibitors interact with the cysteine and hydrophobic residues in the deep hydrophobic pocket. We anticipate that precise targeting of the polar side pocket could facilitate the discovery of inhibitors with enhanced potencies and properties. Herein, we selected niflumic acid as the core scaffold suitable for targeting the three characteristic components of TEAD palmitate pocket. Reversible and irreversible compounds with substituents capable of directing each part of the palmitate pocket were designed. The newly synthesised compounds inhibited the palmitoylation and transcriptional activity of TEAD and elicited growth-inhibitory effects against several carcinomas, including mesothelioma.

AB  - A negative correlation between constitutive and inducible resistance across plant populations is expected for a variety of reasons; however, empirical evidence for such trade-offs remain ambiguous, particularly for crop plants. The current study investigated the relationship between constitutive and inducible resistance in vegetative-stage soybeans (V5-V6) against larvae of the generalist defoliator, Spodoptera frugiperda. Eighteen soybean genotypes differing in their constitutive resistance to coleopteran or lepidopteran defoliators were used over four experiments. Exogenous jasmonic acid (JA, 2 mM) was used to induce plants. Constitutive resistance of each genotype was estimated by measuring weight gains, foliar consumption, and foliar conversion efficiency in short-term feeding assays on excised leaf disks of terminal trifoliate leaves of plants not treated with JA. JA was applied to plants immediately after removing leaf material for assays of constitutive resistance, and induced resistance was estimated 48 h after application of JA using leaf disks from the remaining leaf tissue of the same trifoliate used for measuring constitutive resistance. Larval weight gains before JA treatments revealed genotypic variability in constitutive resistance.. Overall, reductions in weight gain (28.7% to 76.7%), foliar consumption (3.7% - 65%) and conversion efficiency (10.9% - 42.2%) were found in JA treatments. Significant (P < 0.05) or marginally significant (P < 0.10) negative correlations between constitutive resistance (larval weight gains on non-induced plants) and induced resistance (differences in weight gains before and after induction) were found in all four experiments, suggesting tradeoff between the two modes of resistance does exist in soybean for this herbivore. Additional evidence for tradeoffs between constitutive and inducible resitance was also found in the analysis of consumption data. Comparisons of consumption and conversion efficiencies suggest that similar antibiotic and antixenotic factors are involved in constitutive and inducible resistance to fall armyworm in soybean.

AB  - Objective: Pharmacoresistant bilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy often implies poor resective surgical candidacy. Low-frequency stimulation of a fiber tract connected to bilateral hippocampi, the fornicodorsocommissural tract, has been shown to be safe and efficacious in reducing seizures in a previous shortterm study. Here, we report a single-blinded, within-subject control, long-term deep-brain stimulation trial of low-frequency stimulation of the fornicodorsocommissural tract in bilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Outcomes of interest included safety with respect to verbal memory scores and reduction of seizure frequency. Methods: Our enrollment goal was 16 adult subjects to be randomized to 2-Hz or 5-Hz low-frequency stimulation of the fornicodorsocommissural tract starting at 2 mA. The study design consisted of four two-month blocks of stimulation with a 50%-duty cycle, alternating with two-month blocks of no stimulation. Results: We terminated the study after enrollment of five subjects due to slow accrual. Fornicodorsocommissural tract stimulation elicited bilateral hippocampal evoked responses in all subjects. Three subjects underwent implantation of pulse generators and long-term low-frequency stimulation with mean monthly seizures of 3.14 +/- 2.67 (median 3.0 [IQR 1-4.0]) during stimulation-off blocks, compared with 0.96 +/- 1.23 (median 1.0 [IQR 0-1.0]) during stimulation-on blocks (p = 0.0005) during the blinded phase. Generalized Estimating Equations showed that low-frequency stimulation reduced monthly seizure-frequency by 0.71 per mA (p < 0.001). Verbal memory scores were stable with no psychiatric complications or other adverse events. Significance: The results demonstrate feasibility of stimulating both hippocampi using a single deep brain stimulation electrode in the fornicodorsocommissural tract, efficacy of low-frequency stimulation in reducing seizures, and safety as regards verbal memory.

AB  - This study analyses the impact of Spanish financial institutions' risk profile on their contribution to the 2030 Agenda. Financial institutions play a significant role in ensuring financial inclusion and sustainable economic growth and usually incorporate environmental and social considerations into their risk management systems. The results show that financial institutions with less capital risk, with lower management efficiency and with higher market risk usually make higher contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), according to their sustainability reports. The novel aspect of the present study is that it identifies the risk profile of financial institutions that incorporate sustainability into their business operations and measure the impact generated in the environment and in society. The study findings have important implications for shareholders, investors and analysts, according to the view that sustainability reporting is a vehicle that financial institutions use to express their commitment to the 2030 Agenda and to higher quality corporate reporting.

AB  - DNA methylation in insects is generally low in abundance, and its role is not well understood. It is often localised in protein coding regions and associated with the expression of 'housekeeping' genes. Few studies have explored DNA methylation dynamics during lifecycle stage transitions in holometabolous (metamorphosing) insects. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we have found a significant difference in global DNA methylation levels between larvae, pupae and adults of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) H & uuml;bner, a polyphagous pest of agricultural importance. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing confirmed these observations and pointed to non-CG context being the primary explanation for the difference observed between pupa and adult. Non-CG methylation was enriched in genes specific to various signalling pathways (Hippo signalling, Hedgehog signalling and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling) and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling. Understanding the function of this epigenetic mark could be a target in future studies focusing on integrated pest management.

AB  - Heat exposure is an environmental stressor that has been associated with cognitive impairment. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon have yet to be extensively investigated. The Morris water maze test was utilized to assess cognitive performance. RNA sequencing was employed to discover the primary regulators and pathological pathways involved in cognitive impairment caused by heat. Before heat exposure in vivo and in vitro, activation of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) calcium (Ca2+)-ATPase (SERCA) was achieved by CDN1163. Hematoxylin-Eosin, Nissl staining, calcium imaging, transmission electron microscopy, western blot, and immunofluorescence were utilized to visualize histological changes, intracellular calcium levels, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) markers, apoptosis, and synaptic proteins alterations. Heat stress (HS) significantly induced cognitive decline and neuronal damage in mice. By the transcriptome sequencing between control (n = 5) and heat stress (n = 5) mice in hippocampal tissues, we identified a reduction in the expression of the atp2a gene encoding SERCA, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in its protein level. Consequently, this dysregulation resulted in an excessive accumulation of intracellular calcium ions. Furthermore, HS exposure also activated ERS and apoptosis, as evidenced by the upregulation of p-PERK, p-eIF2 alpha, CHOP, and caspase-3. Consistently, a reduction in postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin (SYN) expressions indicated modifications in synaptic function. Notably, the impacts on neurons caused by HS were found to be mitigated by CDN1163 treatment both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, SERCA-mediated ERS-induced apoptosis was attenuated by GSK2606414 treatment via inhibiting PERK-eIF2 alpha-CHOP axis that not only curtailed the level of caspase-3 but also elevated the levels of PSD95 and SYN. These findings highlight the significant impact of heat stress on cognitive impairment, and further elucidate the underlying mechanism involving SERCA/PERK/eIF2 alpha pathway.
   Heat exposure as an important environmental stressor can profoundly induce cognitive impairment, as presented by learning and memory decline. Heat stress initially induces SERCA downregulation and intracellular calcium overload to subsequent ERS-mediated apoptosis and neuronal damage. Targeting SERCA/PERK/eIF2 alpha axis might be a promising therapeutic approach to prevent cognitive deficits subsequent to heat stress.

AB  - Objective Arsenic (As) and fluoride (F) are two of the most common elements contaminating groundwater resources. A growing number of studies have found that As and F can cause neurotoxicity in infants and children, leading to cognitive, learning, and memory impairments. However, early biomarkers of learning and memory impairment induced by As and/or F remain unclear. In the present study, the mechanisms by which As and/or F cause learning memory impairment are explored at the multi-omics level (microbiome and metabolome).Methods We stablished an SD rats model exposed to arsenic and/or fluoride from intrauterine to adult period.Results Arsenic and/fluoride exposed groups showed reduced neurobehavioral performance and lesions in the hippocampal CA1 region. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that As and/or F exposure significantly altered the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome, featuring the Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Ruminococcus_1, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, [Eubacterium]_ xylanophilum_group. Metabolome analysis showed that As and/or F-induced learning and memory impairment may be related to tryptophan, lipoic acid, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) synapse, and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. The gut microbiota, metabolites, and learning memory indicators were significantly correlated.Conclusion Learning memory impairment triggered by As and/or F exposure may be mediated by different gut microbes and their associated metabolites.

AB  - Simple Summary The effect of social rank (i.e., low or high) in adult Dorper rams on sexual behavior, body condition score, seminal quality, and whole blood count was evaluated. The high-social-ranked Dorper rams displayed more sexual behaviors compared with low-social-ranked rams. In parallel, high-social-ranked rams had a higher body condition score and a larger ejaculate volume compared with low-social-ranked rams; they also showed an optimal health and wellness status, reflected by the whole blood count. Such behavioral, metabolic, sexual, seminal, and health advantages shown by the high-social-ranked Dorper rams must be taken into account to avoid reproductive failures. While there is still limited evidence on the role that social rank plays in out-of-season reproductive success, this study helps to better comprehend how social dominance is associated with male-to-male competitiveness, male-to-female sexual behavior, seminal quality, and blood cell components, and how their interaction with each other modulates and even determines out-of-season reproductive success in Dorper rams. Dorper rams (n = 24) were evaluated during the sexual resting season to determine their social rank (SR), either high (HSR) or low (LSR), under intensive management conditions in northern Mexico (25 degrees N). Aggressive behaviors were quantified during male-to-male interactions, and appetitive and consummatory sexual behaviors during male-to-female interactions. Morphometric, live weight (LW), and body condition score (BCS) were recorded. During the early reproductive season, male-to-female behaviors were newly itemized simultaneously by seminal quality and quantity sampling. Finally, the dependent variables of the hemogram components were also quantified. Neither LW (61.25 +/- 2.4 kg) nor morphometric variables differed between SR groups. However, BCS (2.25 vs. 2.66 u), sexual behaviors (i.e., approaches: 59.6 vs. 21.73 n, mating with ejaculation: 77.7 vs. 42.86 %, latency to ejaculation: 16.6 vs. 143.07 s), ejaculate volume (0.57 vs. 0.23 mL), and hemogram components favored the HSR rams (p < 0.05). Moreover, in their first male-to-female interaction, >50% of the LSR rams failed to display any sexual activity. HSR rams displayed a greater number of threatening behaviors, managing to displace LSR rams when exposed to estrus ewes during the male sexual resting season; more sexual behaviors; and an increased seminal volume in a non-live weight-dependent fashion.

AB  - For serodiagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based competitive ELISA (cELISA) is commonly used since it allows simple and reproducible detection of antibody response to FMDV. However, the use of mouse-origin MAb as a detection reagent is questionable, as antibody responses to FMDV in mice may differ in epitope structure and preference from those in natural hosts such as cattle and pigs. To take advantage of natural host-derived antibodies, a phage-displayed scFv library was constructed from FMDV-immune cattle and subjected to two separate pannings against inactivated FMDV type O and A. Subsequent ELISA screening revealed high-affinity scFv antibodies specific to a serotype (O or A) as well as those with pan-serotype specificity. When BvO17, an scFv antibody specific to FMDV type O, was tested as a detection reagent in cELISA, it successfully detected FMDV type O antibodies for both serum samples from vaccinated cattle and virus-challenged pigs with even higher sensitivity than a mouse MAb-based commercial FMDV type O antibody detection kit. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using natural host-derived antibodies such as bovine scFv instead of mouse MAb in cELISA for serological detection of antibody response to FMDV in the susceptible animals.

AB  - The stressful experiences, by triggering a cascade of hormonal and neural changes, can produce antinociception commonly referred to as stress-induced antinociception (SIA). Orexin neuropeptides have an essential role in stress responses and pain modulation. The dentate gyrus receives orexinergic projections and has been shown to be involved in pain processing. The current study investigated the possible role of orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors (OX1r and OX2r, respectively) within the dentate gyrus in SIA in a rat model of formalin-induced pain behavior in one hind paw. Male Wistar rats weighing 230-250 g underwent stereotaxic surgery and a cannula was implanted in their brains, above the dentate gyrus region. Either SB334867 or TCS OX2 29 (OX1r and OX2r antagonists, respectively) was microinjected into the dentate gyrus region at a range of doses at 1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol (control group received DMSO 12% as vehicle), 5 min before the forced swim stress (FSS) exposure. The formalin test was performed to assess pain-related behaviors. The results indicated that FSS exposure relieves pain-related behavior in the early and late phases of the formalin test. Blockade of intra-dentate gyrus OX1 or OX2 receptors reduced the antinociceptive responses induced by FSS in the formalin test, with more impact during the late phase. Our findings support the potential role of intra-dentate gyrus orexin receptors as target sites of orexin neurons in painful and stressful situations. Therefore, understanding the exact mechanisms of SIA and the role of the orexinergic system in this phenomenon can lead to identifying the strategies to guide future research and offer a new approach to discovering new pain therapeutic agents.

AB  - BACKGROUNDMultiple and simultaneous attacks by pathogens and insect pests frequently occur in nature. Plants respond to biotic stresses by activating distinct defense mechanisms, but little is known about how plants cope with multiple stresses. The focus of this study was the combined interaction of fungal infection caused by Leptosphaeria maculans (synonym Plenodomus lingam) and arthropod infestation by the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) in oilseed rape (Brassica napus). We hypothesized that infection by the fungal pathogen L. maculans could alter oilseed rape palatability to P. xylostella-chewing caterpillars. Feeding preference tests were complemented with analyses of defense gene transcription, and levels of glucosinolates (GLSs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in L. maculans-inoculated and non-inoculated (control) leaves to determine possible causes of larval choice.RESULTSCaterpillars preferred true leaves to cotyledons, hence true leaves were used for further experiments. True leaves inoculated with L. maculans were more palatable to caterpillars over control leaves during the early stage of infection at 3 days post inoculation (dpi), but this preference disappeared in the later stages of infection at 7 dpi. In parallel, genes involved in the salicylic acid and ethylene pathways were up-regulated in L. maculans-inoculated leaves at 3 and 7 dpi; L. maculans increased the level of total aliphatic GLSs, specifically glucobrassicanapin, and decreased the level of glucoiberin at 3 dpi and altered the content of specific VOCs. A group of 55 VOCs with the highest variability between treatments was identified.CONCLUSIONWe suggest that the P. xylostella preference for L. maculans-inoculated leaves in the early stage of disease development could be caused by the underlying mechanisms leading to changes in metabolic composition. Further research should pinpoint the compounds responsible for driving larval preference and evaluate whether the behavior of the adult moths, i.e. the stage that makes the first choice regarding host plant selection in field conditions, correlates with our results on larval host acceptance.

   Fungal infection of Brassica napus by Leptosphaeria maculans increases plant palatability to Plutella xylostella caterpillars during early but not later stages of infection. To explain this finding, involvement of plant signaling pathways, analyses of glucosinolates and volatile organic compounds.dagger image

AB  - Steroid hormones and growth factors control neuritogenesis through their cognate receptors under physiological and pathological conditions. We have already shown that nerve growth factor and androgens induce neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells through a reciprocal crosstalk between the NGF receptor, TrkA and the androgen receptor. Here, we report that androgens or NGF induce neuritogenesis in PC12 cells through inactivation of RhoA. Ectopic expression of the dominant negative RhoA N19 promotes, indeed, the neurite-elongation of unchallenged and androgen- or NGF-challenged PC12 cells and the increase in the expression levels of beta III tubulin, a specific neuronal marker. Pharmacological inhibition of the Ser/Thr kinase ROCK, an RhoA effector, induces neuritogenesis in unchallenged PC12 cells, and potentiates the effect of androgens and NGF, confirming the role of RhoA/ROCK axis in the neuritogenesis induced by androgen and NGF, through the phosphorylation of Akt. These findings suggest that therapies based on new selective androgen receptor modulators and/or RhoA/ROCK inhibitors might exert beneficial effects in the treatment of neuro-disorders, neurological diseases and ageing-related processes.

AB  - The interactions between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HC) are critical for memory and decision making and have been specifically implicated in several neurological disorders including schizophrenia, epilepsy, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. The ventral midline thalamus (vmThal), and lateral entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex (LEC/PER) constitute major communication pathways that facilitate mPFC-HC interactions in memory. Although vmThal and LEC/PER circuits have been delineated separately we sought to determine whether these two regions share cell-specific inputs that could influence both routes simultaneously. To do this we used a dual fluorescent retrograde tracing approach using cholera toxin subunit-B (CTB-488 and CTB-594) with injections targeting vmThal and the LEC/PER in rats. Retrograde cell body labeling was examined in key regions of interest within the mPFC-HC system including: (1) mPFC, specifically anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsal and ventral prelimbic cortex (dPL, vPL), and infralimbic cortex (IL); (2) medial and lateral septum (MS, LS); (3) subiculum (Sub) along the dorsal-ventral and proximal-distal axes; and (4) LEC and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Results showed that dual vmThal-LEC/PER-projecting cell populations are found in MS, vSub, and the shallow layers II/III of LEC and MEC. We did not find any dual projecting cells in mPFC or in the cornu ammonis (CA) subfields of the HC. Thus, mPFC and HC activity is sent to vmThal and LEC/PER via non-overlapping projection cell populations. Importantly, the dual projecting cell populations in MS, vSub, and EC are in a unique position to simultaneously influence both cortical and thalamic mPFC-HC pathways critical to memory.Significance statement: The interactions between mPFC and HC are critical for learning and memory, and dysfunction within this circuit is implicated in various neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. mPFC-HC interactions are mediated through multiple communication pathways including a thalamic hub through the vmThal and a cortical hub through lateral entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex. Our data highlight newly identified dual projecting cell populations in the septum, Sub, and EC of the rat brain. These dual projecting cells may have the ability to modify the information flow within the mPFC-HC circuit through synchronous activity, and thus offer new cell-specific circuit targets for basic and translational studies in memory.

AB  - This experiment aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementing tributyrin (TB) on the meat quality characteristics of foreshank muscle of weaned lambs. A total of 30 healthy weaned Small-Tailed Han female lambs with body weights ranging from 23.4 to 31.6 kg were selected and randomly divided into five groups, and each group consisted of 6 lambs. The control group was fed a basic total mixed ration, while other groups were fed the same ration supplemented with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 g/kg TB, respectively. The experiment lasted 75 d, including 15 d of adaptation. Foreshank muscle obtained at the same position from each lamb was used for chemical analysis and sensory evaluation. The results showed that supplementing TB increased the muscle contents of ether extract (p = 0.029), calcium (p = 0.030), phosphorus (p = 0.007), and intermuscular fat length (p = 0.022). Besides, TB increased the muscle pH (p = 0.001) and redness (p < 0.001) but reduced the lightness (p < 0.001), drip loss (p = 0.029), cooking loss (p < 0.001), shear force (p = 0.001), hardness (p < 0.001), cohesiveness (p < 0.001), springiness (p < 0.001), gumminess (p < 0.001), and chewiness (p < 0.001). In addition, TB increased the muscle content of inosine-5 '-phosphate (p = 0.004). Most importantly, TB increased the muscle contents of essential amino acids (p < 0.001). Furthermore, TB increased the saturated fatty acids level in the muscle (p < 0.001) while decreasing the unsaturated fatty acids content (p < 0.001). In conclusion, supplementing TB could influence the meat quality of foreshank muscle of weaned lambs by modifying the amino acid and fatty acid levels.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of adding different levels of punicalagin or oleuropein to TRIS diluent on the quality of frozen-thawed semen from Najdi rams. Semen was diluted using TRIS-based diluter with 15% egg yolk (control group); supplemented with 0.1, 0.5, or 1 mg/100 mL punicalagin (in Experiment 1); or supplemented with 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/100 mL oleuropein (in Experiment 2). The collected semen was evaluated and cryopreserved, with the motility and concentration of sperm assessed using a CASA system. The results showed that the total motile spermatozoa (TMS), percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa (PMS), curvilinear velocity (VCL), rectilinear velocity, average path velocity (VAP), linearity coefficient, straightness index, minor defects, and sperm vitality were higher in the 0.1 mg/100 mL punicalagin group (p < 0.05) than in other groups. HOST% post-thawing was significantly higher in all punicalagin groups compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The percentages of PMS, TMS, VCL, minor defects, and sperm vitality were higher in the 1 mg/100 mL oleuropein group (p < 0.05) than in other groups. Oleuropein supplementation at 5 mg/100 mL decreased VAP in cooled sperms, while all levels increased VAP post-thawing. HOST-positive sperms% post-thawing was higher in all oleuropein-treated groups than the control group (p < 0.001). Moreover, oleuropein nonsignificantly increased the acrosome integrity in cooled sperms, while higher studied concentrations of oleuropein (2.5 and 5 mg/100 mL) decreased the acrosome integrity in frozen sperms. In conclusion, adding punicalagin (0.1 mg/100 mL) or oleuropein (1 mg/100 mL) to TRIS diluent improved the quality of frozen-thawed semen from rams.

AB  - Electrochemical techniques are considered to be highly sensitive, capable of fast response and can be easily miniaturized, properties which can aid with regard to the fabrication of compact point-of-care medical devices; however, the main challenge in developing such a tool is overcoming a ubiquitous, problematic phenomenon known as non-specific adsorption (NSA). NSA is due to the fouling of non-target molecules in the blood on the recognition surface of the device. To overcome NSA, we have developed an affinity-based electrochemical biosensor using medical-grade stainless steel electrodes and following a unique and novel strategy using silanebased interfacial chemistry to detect lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a highly promising biomarker, which was found to be elevated in 90 % of stage I OC patients and gradually increases as the disease progresses to later stages. The biorecognition surface was developed using the affinity-based gelsolin-actin system, which was previously investigated by our group to detect LPA using fluorescence spectroscopy. We demonstrate the capability of this label-free biosensor to detect LPA in goat serum with a detection limit of 0.7 & mu;M as a proof-ofconcept for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer.

AB  - The serotonergic system is involved in various psychiatric and neurological conditions, with serotonergic drugs often used in treatment. These conditions frequently affect spatial memory, which can serve as a model of declarative memory due to well-known cellular components and advanced methods that track neural activity and behavior with high temporal resolution. However, most findings on serotonin's effects on spatial learning and memory come from studies lacking refined analytical techniques and modern approaches needed to uncover the underlying neuronal mechanisms. This In Focus review critically investigates available studies to identify areas for further exploration. It finds that well-established behavioral models could yield more insights with modern tracking and data analysis approaches, while the cellular aspects of spatial memory remain underexplored. The review highlights the complex role of serotonin in spatial memory, which holds the potential for better understanding and treating memory-related disorders.

AB  - Feline overpopulation raises issues concerning health, ecology, economy, and ethics. Procedures to limit overpopulation should carefully address animal welfare, efficiency, costs, and feasibility. Vasectomy in unowned cats is suggested as preferable to standard neutering as it maintains male sexual behaviour which may induce ovulation and pseudopregnancy in intact females and may prevent immigration of other males. Vasectomy is not performed routinely because it is fastidious, time consuming and requires more material than standard neutering. We describe epididymectomy as an alternative. In a first experiment, we analysed semen, testosterone, behaviour and pain in six experimental cats before and after epididymectomy, and after castration two months later. Excised tissues were analysed histologically. Testosterone concentrations did not differ significantly between intact and epididymectomised animals but were significantly different after castration. Sexual behaviour and testicular spermatogenesis persisted after epididymectomy, but with a marked drop in the semen count after 7 days. The Glasgow pain scores did not differ significantly after epididymectomy and castration. In a subsequent experiment, 20 privately owned cats were epididymectomised and castrated immediately afterwards, to analyse the learning curve and perioperative complications. The time required for an epididymectomy was significantly shorter than for castration. The study confirms that epididymectomy is quicker and less invasive than castration, it is associated with minimal risks and post-operative pain while easy to learn and inexpensive. Further field studies are required to test its efficiency for feline feral population control or in other species such as in bears, lions or deer, where infertility is required and castration not wanted.

KW  - HIPPO PATHWAY
AB  - The developed resistance of trastuzumab remained a problem for clinical therapy of HER2-positive breast cancer. However, effects of YAP/TAZ pathway on resistance of trastuzumab have not been explored. Tumor tissues were collected from 40 breast cancer patients for clinical studies. For in vitro studies, human breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3-TS was obtained, and trastuzumab resistant model SK-BR-3-TR was constructed. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Protein and mRNA expression was measured using western blotting and RT-qPCR, respectively. The mRNA and protein level of YAP was significantly increased in the tumor tissues of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Consistently, the expression of YAP and TAZ were both dramatically upregulated in SK-BR-3-TR cells. The cell viability was increased, while cell apoptosis was inhibited in SK-BR-3-TS cells compared with SK-BR-3-TS. The depletion of YAP by si-YAP reversed the YAP/TAZ expression, cell viability and cell apoptosis in SK-BR-3-TR cells. YAP/TAZ pathway might induce the trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer and targeting YAP would be an alternative way for the clinical therapeutic methods of HER2 positive breast cancer.

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated hippocampal alterations in individuals experiencing elevated stress. The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) is a hippocampal-dependent task sensitive to age-related hippocampal decline, but it is unknown how performance on this task is related to one's experience of daily stress. We conducted separate discovery and replication analyses in 510 participants who completed the MST across four different Mechanical Turk studies. We hypothesized that higher scores on the Perceived Stress Scale would be associated with poorer discrimination of "lure" items from previously seen targets - a behavioral index of pattern separation - but not with recognition memory. The zero-order relationship between perceived stress and lure discrimination was not significant in the discovery or replication sample. Exploratory analyses involving anhedonic depression symptoms (from the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire) revealed a robust perceived stress*anhedonic depression interaction in the discovery sample that was confirmed in the replication sample. In both samples, individuals with low but not high anhedonic depression symptoms showed an inverse association between perceived stress and lure discrimination ability. Contrary to hypotheses, a similar interaction was observed for recognition memory. The novel association between perceived stress and behavioral pattern separation suggests a candidate behavioral process associated with stress-related hippocampal deficits. The specificity of this effect for individuals with low anhedonic depression symptoms - and the lack of behavioral specificity - highlight the need for additional research to unpack the clinical and neurobiological significance of these findings.

AB  - Four new alkaloids, hippobrines A-D (1-4), along with three new polyacetylenes, hippobrenes A-C (5-7), were isolated from Hippobroma longiflora. Compounds 1-3 possess an unprecedented carbon skeleton. All of the new structures were determined by analyzing their mass and NMR spectroscopic data. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were confirmed by single crystal X-ray analyses, and the absolute configurations of 3 and 7 were deduced using their ECD spectra. Plausible biogenetic pathways of 1 and 4 were proposed. In regard to bioactivities, all compounds (1-7) exhibited weak antiangiogenic activity against human endothelial progenitor cells, with IC50 values ranging from 21.1 +/- 1.1 to 44.0 +/- 2.3 mu g/mL.

AB  - Progenitor cells are critical in preserving organismal homeostasis, yet their diversity and dynamics in the aged brain remain underexplored. We introduced TrackerSci, a single-cell genomic method that combines newborn cell labeling and combinatorial indexing to characterize the transcriptome and chromatin landscape of proliferating progenitor cells in vivo. Using TrackerSci, we investigated the dynamics of newborn cells in mouse brains across various ages and in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our dataset revealed diverse progenitor cell types in the brain and their epigenetic signatures. We further quantified aging-associated shifts in cell-type-specific proliferation and differentiation and deciphered the associated molecular programs. Extending our study to the progenitor cells in the aged human brain, we identified conserved genetic signatures across species and pinpointed region-specific cellular dynamics, such as the reduced oligodendrogenesis in the cerebellum. We anticipate that TrackerSci will be broadly applicable to unveil cell-type specific temporal dynamics in diverse systems.

AB  - A large number of clinical studies demonstrate that the ketogenic diet (KD) may be an effective approach to the reduction of epileptic seizures in children and adults. Such dietary therapy could also help pregnant women with epilepsy, especially since most antiseizure drugs have teratogenic action. However, there is a lack of medical data, considering the safety of using KD during gestation for the progeny. Therefore, we examined the influence of KD used prenatally in rats on the elemental composition of the selected brain regions in their offspring. For this purpose, synchrotron radiation-induced X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) microscopy was utilized, and elements such as P, S, K, Ca, Fe, and Zn were determined. Moreover, to verify whether the possible effects of KD are temporary or long-term, different stages of animal postnatal development were taken into account in our experiment. The obtained results confirmed the great applicability of SR-XRF microscopy to track the element changes occurring in the brain during postnatal development as well as those induced by prenatal exposure to the high-fat diet. The topographic analysis of the brains taken from offspring of mothers fed with KD during pregnancy and appropriate control individuals showed a potential influence of such dietary treatment on the brain levels of elements such as P and S. In the oldest progeny, a significant reduction of the surface of brain areas characterized by an increased P and S content, which histologically/morphologically correspond to white matter structures, was noticed. In turn, quantitative elemental analysis showed significantly decreased levels of Fe in the striatum and white matter of 30-day-old rats exposed prenatally to KD. This effect was temporary and was not noticed in adult animals. The observed abnormalities may be related to the changes in the accumulation of sphingomyelin and sulfatides and may testify about disturbances in the structure and integrity of the myelin, present in the white matter.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Miq. ex Havil. is a plant species that is routinely devoted in traditional Chinese medicine to treat central nervous system disorders. Rhynchophylline (Rhy), a predominant alkaloid isolated from Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Miq. ex Havil., has been demonstrated to reverse methamphetamine-induced (METH-induced) conditioned place preference (CPP) effects in mice, rats and zebrafish. The precise mechanism is still poorly understood, thus further research is necessary. Aim of study: This study aimed to investigate the role of miRNAs in the inhibitory effect of Rhy on METH dependence. Materials and methods: A rat CPP paradigm and a PC12 cell addiction model were established. Microarray assays were used to screen and identify the candidate miRNA. Behavioral assessment, real-time PCR, dual-luciferase reporter assay, western blotting, stereotaxic injection of antagomir/agomir and cell transfection experiments were performed to elucidate the effect of the candidate miRNA and intervention mechanism of Rhy on METH dependence. Results: Rhy successfully reversed METH-induced CPP effect and the upregulated miR-181a-5p expression in METH-dependent rat hippocampus and PC12 cells. Moreover, suppression of miR-181a-5p by antagomir 181a reversed METH-induced CPP effect. Meanwhile, overexpression of miR-181a-5p by agomir 181a in combination with low-dose METH (0.5 mg/kg) elicited a significant CPP effect, which was blocked by Rhy through inhibiting miR-181a-5p. Finally, the result demonstrated that miR-181a-5p exerted its regulatory role by targeting gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor alpha 1 (GABRA1) both in vivo and in vitro. Conclusion: This finding reveals that Rhy inhibits METH dependence via modulating the miR-181a-5p/GABRA1 axis, which may be a promising target for treatment of METH dependence.

AB  - Exercise-with-melatonin therapy has complementary and synergistic effects on spinal cord injury and Alzheimer's disease, but its effect on stroke is still poorly understood. In this study, we established a rat model of ischemic stroke by occluding the middle cerebral artery for 60 minutes. We treated the rats with exercise and melatonin therapy for 7 consecutive days. Results showed that exercise-with-melatonin therapy significantly prolonged sleep duration in the model rats, increased delta power values, and regularized delta power rhythm. Additionally, exercise-with-melatonin therapy improved coordination, endurance, and grip strength, as well as learning and memory abilities. At the same time, it led to higher hippocampal CA1 neuron activity and postsynaptic density thickness and lower expression of glutamate receptor 2 than did exercise or melatonin therapy alone. These findings suggest that exercise-with-melatonin therapy can alleviate sleep disorder and motor dysfunction by increasing glutamate receptor 2 protein expression and regulating hippocampal CA1 synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Cariprazine, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor partial agonist with high affinity for D3 receptors, is effective in treating bipolar disorder and depression; however, the precise neural mechanisms underlying its actions remain incompletely understood. This study investigates how cariprazine modulates affective and social behaviors through D3 neurons in the olfactory tubercle (OT). Local infusion of cariprazine specifically into the OT, but not the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or hippocampus, induced anxiety-like behaviors, impaired struggling behaviors in depression-related tests, and increased huddling behavior, a measure of thermoregulation and social interaction. These behavioral changes were associated with decreased D3 neuronal activity in the OT, as evidenced by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Optogenetic activation of OT D3 neurons normalized cariprazine-induced anxiety-like behaviors and blunted the increase in struggling and huddling behavior. Additionally, cariprazine administration elevated body temperature, likely due to enhanced huddling behavior. These findings underscore the critical role of OT D3 neurons in mediating cariprazine's effects on affective and social behaviors, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying its therapeutic actions and the involvement of ventral striatal D3 neurons in neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Several internal and external factors can influence animals' hormonal activity. Cortisol level in hair and wool determines chronic stress, which is connected with the long-term HPA axis effect. Wool cortisol levels in alpacas have never been determined to this time. The study aimed to assess the influence of selected factors on wool cortisol concentration in alpacas. The study included 36 alpacas. Wool samples were collected during shearing in June 2021, cut with an electric clipper from the right shoulder and the rump. Wool samples were fragmented into proximal (winter-spring regrowth) and distal (summer-fall regrowth) segments. Alpacas' Heat Stress Index (HSI) for the summer of 2020 was 139.4, and 116 for the winter of 2021. The cortisol levels in the wool samples were determined with the General Cortisol ELISA Kit assay. The most significant differences in wool cortisol concentrations were caused by two factors: the wool segment (P < 0.001; eta 2 = 0.889) and the region on the body (P < 0.001; eta 2 = 0.876). Wool cortisol level was higher in the distal segment (referring to the summer-fall season) than in the proximal one (referring to the winter-spring season). It is suggested that alpacas can feel heat stress in summer (HSI = 139.4), which could influence higher cortisol levels in the distal segment. The wool cortisol level was higher in the rump samples than the shoulder ones. Therefore, it is essential in future studies that wool samples from all tested animals should be completed from the same body region. Differences among age and sex groups were also observed. Wool cortisol level was higher in older animals, as differences between age groups were observed in samples from the rump in the distal and proximal segments (distal, the rump younger*older: P < 0.001; eta(2) = 0.321; proximal, the rump older*younger: P = 0.007; eta(2) = 0.195). Males showed higher cortisol levels than females, as a difference between sexes was observed in samples from the rump in the proximal segment (P = 0.001, eta(2) = 0.271). This study emphasizes that various factors may significantly influence wool cortisol levels, which can be helpful in alpacas' welfare estimation using this hormonal indicator as a noninvasive long-term stress assessment method.

AB  - In this study, the effects of a 12-week exercise program combining aerobic and resistance training on high-fat diet-induced obese Sprague Dawley (SD) rats after the injection of beta-amyloid into the cerebral ventricle were investigated. Changes in physical fitness, cognitive function, blood levels of beta-amyloid and metabolic factors, and protein expressions of neurotrophic factors related to brain function such as BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the quadriceps femoris, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex were analyzed. The subjects were thirty-two 10-week-old SD rats (DBL Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea). The rats were randomized into four groups: beta-Non-Ex group (n = 8) with induced obesity and beta A25-35 injection into the cerebral ventricle through stereotactic biopsy; beta-Ex group (n = 8) with induced obesity, beta A25-35 injection, and exercise; S-Non-Ex group (n = 8) with an injection of saline in lieu of beta A25-35 as the control; and S-Ex group (n = 8) with saline injection and exercise. The 12-week exercise program combined aerobic training and resistance training. As for protein expressions of the factors related to brain function, the combined exercise program was shown to have a clear effect on activating the following factors: PGC-1 alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha), FNDC5 (fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5), and BDNF in the quadriceps femoris; TrkB (Tropomyosin receptor kinase B), FNDC5, and BDNF in the hippocampus; PGC-1 alpha, FNDC5, and BDNF in the cerebral cortex. The protein expression of beta-amyloid in the cerebral cortex was significantly lower in the beta-Ex group than in the beta-Non-Ex group (p < 0.05). The 12-week intervention with the combined exercise program of aerobic and resistance training was shown to improve cardiopulmonary function, muscular endurance, and short-term memory. The results demonstrate a set of positive effects of the combined exercise program, which were presumed to have arisen mainly due to its alleviating effect on beta-amyloid plaques, the main cause of reduced brain function, as well as the promotion of protein expressions of PGC-1 alpha, FNDC5, and BDNF in the quadriceps femoris, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex.

TI  - Chlorogenic Acid Mitigates Ferroptosis by Activating the Nrf2/GPX4 Pathway through Keap1 Blockade in Vascular Dementia Rats
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY
LA  - English
AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a dietary phenolic acid widely distributed in daily food and plants, but its role in vascular dementia (VaD) is still unclear. Hence, this study aimed to investigate whether CGA could rescue cognitive impairment in VaD, providing a new option for drug discovery. Novel object recognition and Morris water maze experiments revealed that CGA enhanced the learning and memory abilities in VaD rats. Nissl staining, Western blot, and transmission electron microscopy results demonstrated that CGA inhibited neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA1 region of VaD rats, increased the expression of synaptic-related markers SYP and PSD95, thickened the postsynaptic density, and suppressed mitochondrial ridge rupture in neurons. GSH detection, MDA detection, and Western blot experiments indicated that CGA alleviated hippocampal GSH reduction and MDA elevation and increased the protein levels of GPX4 and SLC7A11. Cell activity, ROS detection, lipid peroxidation detection, intracellular Fe2+ level detection, GSH detection, and Western blot revealed that CGA inhibited the increase of intracellular Fe2+, ROS, and lipid peroxidation induced by OGD in PC12 cells, mitigated GSH reduction, and increased the protein levels of GPX4, SLC7A11, SYP, and PSD95. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining showed that CGA increased the expression of pSer40-Nrf2 in the hippocampal tissue of VaD rats and PC12 cells, promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Knockdown of Nrf2 prevented CGA from rescuing ferroptosis and synaptic damage induced by OGD in PC12 cells, as well as Nrf2 pathway activation. Molecular docking analysis suggested that CGA competitively bound to the Kelch domain of Keap1 with Nrf2 and then promoted Nrf2 release and activated downstream signaling pathways. In conclusion, our study suggests that CGA may activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway by disrupting the interaction between Nrf2 and Keap1 proteins, thereby inhibiting hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and synaptic damage and ameliorating cognitive impairment in VaD. Practical Applications. Vascular dementia (VaD) stands as the second most prevalent type of dementia following Alzheimer's disease. However, there is no effective clinical treatment drug available, and its pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive. This study proposed that CGA might activate the Nrf2-GPX4 signaling pathway by competitively binding to Keap1, thereby attenuating hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and synaptic damage and consequently ameliorating cognitive impairment in VaD. Our study may provide a novel option for drug research and development for VaD.

AB  - The accumulation of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease greatly impacts neuronal health and synaptic function. To maintain network stability in the face of altered synaptic activity, neurons engage a feedback mechanism termed homeostatic scaling; however, this process is thought to be disrupted during disease progression. Previous proteomics studies have shown that one of the most highly regulated proteins in cell culture models of homeostatic scaling is the small secretory chaperone proSAAS. Our prior work has shown that proSAAS exhibits anti-aggregant behavior against alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid fibrillation in vitro and is up-regulated in cell models of proteostatic stress. However, the specific role that this protein might play in homeostatic scaling, and its anti-aggregant role in Alzheimer's progression, is not clear. To learn more about the role of proSAAS in maintaining hippocampal proteostasis, we compared its expression in a primary neuron model of homeostatic scaling to other synaptic components using western blotting and qPCR, revealing that proSAAS protein responses to homeostatic up- and down-regulation were significantly higher than those of two other synaptic vesicle components, 7B2 and carboxypeptidase E. However, proSAAS mRNA expression was static, suggesting translational control and/or altered protein degradation. ProSAAS was readily released upon depolarization of differentiated hippocampal cultures, supporting its synaptic localization. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated abundant proSAAS within the mossy fiber layer of the hippocampus in both wild-type and 5xFAD mice; in the latter, proSAAS was also concentrated around amyloid plaques. Importantly, overexpression of proSAAS in the CA1 region via stereotaxic injection of proSAAS-encoding AAV2/1 significantly decreased amyloid plaque burden in 5xFAD mice. We hypothesize that dynamic changes in proSAAS expression play a critical role in hippocampal proteostatic processes, both in the context of normal homeostatic plasticity and in the control of protein aggregation during Alzheimer's disease progression.image

AB  - Spatial navigation is essential for wellbeing and independence and shows significant declines as part of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Navigation is also one of the earliest behaviors impacted by this devastating disease. Neurobiological models of aging and spatial navigation have focused primarily on the cognitive factors that account for impaired navigation abilities during the course of healthy aging and early stages of preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. The contributions of physical factors that are essential to planning and executing movements during successful navigation, such as gait and dynamic balance, are often overlooked despite also being vulnerable to early stages of neurodegenerative disease. We review emerging evidence that spatial navigation and functional mobility each draw on highly overlapping sensory systems, cognitive processes, and brain structures that are susceptible to healthy and pathological aging processes. Based on this evidence, we provide an alternative to models that have focused primarily on spatial navigation as a higher order cognitive function dependent on brain areas such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Instead, we argue that spatial navigation may offer an ecologically valid cognitive-motor phenotype of age-related cognitive dysfunction. We propose that dual cognitive-motor deficits in spatial navigation may arise from early changes in neuromodulatory and peripheral sensory systems that precede changes in regions such as the entorhinal cortex.<br /> (c) 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A beta(1-42) (amyloid beta) oligomers, the major neurotoxic culprits in Alzheimer's disease, initiate early pathophysiological events, including neuronal hyperactivity, that underlie aberrant network activity and cognitive impairment. Although several synaptotoxic effects have been extensively studied, neuronal hyperexcitability, which may also contribute to cognitive deficits, is not fully understood. Here, we found several adverse effects of in vivo injection of A beta(1-42) oligomers on contextual memory and intrinsic properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Male rats underwent behavioral and electrophysiological studies 1 week after microinjections into the dorsal CA1 region, followed by histological analysis. After 1 week, A beta(1-42) oligomers impaired contextual learning without affecting basic physiological functions and triggered training-induced neuronal excitability. Furthermore, riluzole, a persistent sodium current (I-NaP) blocker, dose-dependently reduced A beta(1-42) oligomer-induced hyperexcitability. Congo red staining, which detects insoluble amyloid deposits, further identified labeling of CA1 pyramidal neurons while immunohistochemistry with lecanemab, which detects soluble A beta oligomers, revealed immunoreactivity of both pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells in the target area. Therefore, our study suggests that a single injection of A beta(1-42) oligomers resulted in contextual memory deficits along with concomitant neuronal hyperexcitability and amyloid deposition in the CA1 region after 1 week.

AB  - The TEAD family of transcription factors is best known as the DNA-binding factor in the Hippo pathway, where these factors act by interacting with transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ). Despite the importance of the Hippo pathway, the in vivo functions of TEAD in mammals have not been well established. By comparing mouse mutants lacking TEAD1 and TEAD2 (TEAD1/2) with those lacking YAP/TAZ, we found that TEAD1/2 have both YAP/TAZ-dependent and YAP/TAZ-independent functions during ventral telencephalon development. TEAD1/2 loss and YAP/TAZ loss similarly disrupt neuroepithelial apical junctions. However, the impacts of their losses on progenitor lineage progression are essentially opposite: YAP/TAZ loss depletes early progenitors and increases later progenitors, consistent with their established function in promoting progenitor self-renewal and proliferation, whereas TEAD1/2 loss expands early progenitors and reduces late progenitors, indicating that TEAD1/2 promote lineage progression. We further show that TEAD1/2 promote neural progenitor lineage progression by at least in part inhibiting Notch signaling and by cooperating with insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1). Orthologs of TEAD and INSM1 have been shown to cooperatively regulate neuronal cell fate decisions in worms and flies. Our study reveals a remarkable evolutionary conservation of the function of this transcription factor complex during metazoan neural development.

AB  - Structural changes of astrocytes and their perisynaptic processes occur in response to various physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. They are thought to profoundly affect synaptic signalling and neuron-astrocyte communication. Understanding the causal relationship between astrocyte morphology changes and their functional consequences requires experimental tools to selectively manipulate astrocyte morphology. Previous studies indicate that RhoA-related signalling can play a major role in controlling astrocyte morphology, but the direct effect of increased RhoA activity has not been documented in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we established a viral approach to manipulate astrocytic RhoA activity. We tested if and how overexpression of wild-type RhoA, of a constitutively active RhoA mutant (RhoA-CA), and of a dominant-negative RhoA variant changes the morphology of cultured astrocytes. We found that astrocytic expression of RhoA-CA induced robust cytoskeletal changes and a withdrawal of processes in cultured astrocytes. In contrast, overexpression of other RhoA variants led to more variable changes of astrocyte morphology. These induced morphology changes were reproduced in astrocytes of the hippocampus in vivo. Importantly, astrocytic overexpression of RhoA-CA did not alter the branching pattern of larger GFAP-positive processes of astrocytes. This indicates that a prolonged increase of astrocytic RhoA activity leads to a distinct morphological phenotype in vitro and in vivo, which is characterized by an isolated reduction of fine peripheral astrocyte processes in vivo. At the same time, we identified a promising experimental approach for investigating the functional consequences of astrocyte morphology changes.

AB  - Astrocytes establish extensive networks via gap junctions that allow each astrocyte to connect indirectly to the vasculature. However, the proportion of astrocytes directly associated with blood vessels is unknown. Here, we quantify structural contacts of cortical astrocytes with the vasculature in vivo. We show that all cortical astrocytes are connected to at least one blood vessel. Moreover, astrocytes contact more vessels in deeper cortical layers where vessel density is known to be higher. Further examination of different brain regions reveals that only the hippocampus, which has the lowest vessel density of all investigated brain regions, harbors single astrocytes with no apparent vascular connection. In summary, we show that almost all gray matter astrocytes have direct contact to the vasculature. In addition to the glial network, a direct vascular access may represent a complementary pathway for metabolite uptake and distribution.

AB  - Introduction Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterized by age-dependent amyloid beta (Ab) aggregation and accumulation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. Significantly, there are prominent sex differences in the risk, onset, progression, and severity of AD, as well as response to therapies, with disease burden disproportionately affecting women. Although menopause onset (i.e., perimenopause) may be a critical transition stage for AD susceptibility in women, the role of early ovarian decline in initial disease pathology, particularly key neuroinflammatory processes, is not well understood.Methods To study this, we developed a unique mouse model of perimenopausal AD by combining an accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) model of menopause induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) with the 5xFAD transgenic AD mouse model. To target early stages of disease progression, 5xFAD females were studied at a young age (similar to 4 months) and at the beginning stage of ovarian failure analogous to human perimenopause (termed "peri-AOF"), and compared to age-matched males. Assessment of neuropathology was performed by immunohistochemical labeling of Ab as well as markers of astrocyte and microglia activity in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory that is deleteriously impacted during AD.Results Our results show that genotype, AOF, and sex contributed to AD-like pathology. Aggregation of Ab was heightened in female 5xFAD mice and further increased at peri-AOF, with hippocampal subregion specificity. Further, select increases in glial activation also paralleled Ab pathology in distinct hippocampal subregions. However, cognitive function was not affected by peri-AOF.Discussion These findings align with the hypothesis that perimenopause constitutes a period of susceptibility for AD pathogenesis in women.

AB  - Alcohol-induced cognitive impairment (AICI) has become a public health concern and thus effective intervention is urgently needed. The present study aims to assess the amelioration effect of walnut protein hydrolysate (WPH) in AICI rats and elucidate the associated mechanism. The Morris water maze task verified the significant amelioration effect of WPH against learning and memory deficits. Moreover, a reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation in brain tissues was observed and the significant enhancement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), postsynaptic density protein (PSD95) and cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB) expression (P < 0.05) indicated the rescue of damaged hippocampal synaptic plasticity. In addition, after WPH administration, disorders of ERK and caspase-3 signal pathways, abnormality in the release of the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and histopathological impairment in the hippocampus of AICI rats were ameliorated in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, the amelioration of AICI by WPH might result from the alleviation of oxidative stress and inflammation in brain tissue and the improvement of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Background Newly identified multifunctional peptidergic modulators of stress responses: neuromedin U (NMU) and neuropeptide S (NPS) are involved in the wide spectrum of brain functions. However, there are no reports dealing with potential molecular relationships between the action of diverse anxiolytic or antidepressant drugs and NMU and NPS signaling in the brain. The present work was therefore focused on local expression of the aforementioned stress-related neuropeptides in the rat brain after long-term treatment with escitalopram and clonazepam. Methods Studies were carried out on adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats that were divided into 3 groups: animals injected with saline (control) and experimental individuals treated with escitalopram (at single dose 5 mg/kg daily), and clonazepam (at single dose 0.5 mg/kg). All individuals were sacrificed under anaesthesia and the whole brain excised. Total mRNA was isolated from homogenized samples of amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum and brainstem. Real time-PCR method was used for estimation of related NPS, NPS receptor (NPSR), NMU, NMU and receptor 2 (NMUR2) mRNA expression. The whole brains were also sliced for general immunohistochemical assessment of the neuropeptides expression. Results Chronic administration of clonazepam resulted in an increase of NMU mRNA expression and formation of NMU-expressing fibers in the amygdala, while escitalopram produced a significant decrease in NPSR mRNA level in hypothalamus. Long-term escitalopram administration affects the local expression of examined neuropeptides mRNA in a varied manner depending on the brain structure. Conclusions Pharmacological effects of escitalopram may be connected with local at least partially NPSR-related alterations in the NPS/NMU/NMUR2 gene expression at the level selected rat brain regions. A novel alternative mode of SSRI action can be therefore cautiously proposed.

AB  - Stereotypies are abnormal behaviors found in a wide range of animals that have been used as indicators of poor welfare. Elephants used in tourism have been reported to perform stereotypic behavior, but the occurrence has not been systematically assessed. The aims of this study were to ascertain the percentage of stereotypic behaviors exhibited by tourist camp elephants and relationship with demographic variables. This study surveyed 283 elephants from 20 elephant camps in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Amounts and types of stereotypic behavior were determined from 15-min direct observations. Additionally, demographic data and occurrence of stereotypic behavior (yes/no) were obtained from mahouts of 181 elephants using a questionnaire. Direct behavioral observations revealed that 57% (N = 161: 44 males and 117 females) of the elephants performed stereotypic behavior, while in mahout interviews, 58% were scored 'yes'. There were no differences in the least-squares mean score of stereotypic behaviors between males and females (p = 0.32), whereas there were differences among age groups (p < 0.05), with the highest in elephants 4-10 years of age, followed by 11-30 years of age, 31-50 years of age, > 50 years of age. Calves 0-3 years of age displayed the lowest rate of stereotypic behavior, when most were still with their mothers. The most common type of stereotypic behavior was swaying. Our results indicate that scores of stereotypic behaviors in elephants used in tourism differed among age categories. The next step will be to determine how management factors affect stereotypic behavior of elephants in this population and steps to mitigate it.

AB  - BACKGROUND Plant viruses are transmitted mainly by piercing-sucking herbivores, and viral disease management relies on chemical control of vectors. Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) is transmitted by the white-backed planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of silicon (Si) amendment for reducing SRBSDV transmission.
   RESULTS The settling and ovipositional preferences of WBPH females decreased significantly by 14.6-43.7% for plants treated with either 0.16 g or 0.32 g SiO2 kg(-1) soil during SRBSDV acquisition and by 26.2-28.3% for plants treated with 0.32 g SiO2 kg(-1) soil during SRBSDV inoculation, compared with controls. Adding either 0.16 or 0.32 g SiO2 kg(-1) soil significantly reduced SRBSDV inoculation rate by 31.3% and 45.3%, respectively, and acquisition rate by 25.5% and 66.0%, respectively. Silicification was intensified more in plants treated with 0.32 g SiO2 kg(-1) soil than in controls. The nonprobing (np) duration increased, and the phloem sap ingestion (N4-b) duration decreased significantly in the WBPHs feeding on high-rate-Si-supplemented plants compared with control plants during both inoculation and acquisition access.
   CONCLUSION This study showed that Si amendment to rice plants decreased the WBPH settling and ovipositional preference and the SRBSDV acquisition and inoculation rates, thereby reducing SRBSDV transmission. The intensified plant silicification and the altered WBPH feeding behaviors (i.e. prolonged np and shortened N4-b) may explain the reduced SRBSDV transmission in Si-amended plants.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a pattern of consecutive declines and regrowth in European countries in 2020. After being partially regressed during the summer, the reappearance of the infection during fall 2020 in many temperate countries strongly suggests that temperature and cold may play a role in influencing the infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. While promoting medicine as an art, Hippocrates interpreted with logical reasoning the occurrence of diseases such as epidemics, as a consequence of environmental factors, in particular climatic variations. During the Renaissance, Sanctorius was one of the first to perform quantitative measurements, and Harvey discovered the circulation of blood by performing experimental procedures in animals. We think that a reasoning mixing various observations, measurements and experiments is fundamental to understand how cold increases infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. By this review, we provide evidence linking cold, angiotensin-II, vasoconstriction, hypoxia and aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to explain how cold affects the epidemiology of COVID-19. Also, a low humidity increases virus transmissibility, while a warm atmosphere, a moderate airway humidity, and the production of vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 by ACE2 are less favorable to the virus entry and/or its development. The meteorological and environmental parameters impacting COVID-19 pandemic should be reintegrated into a whole perspective by taking into account the different factors influencing transmissibility, infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To understand the modern enigma represented by COVID-19, an interdisciplinary approach is surely essential. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB  - Escherichia coli F18 (E. coli F18) is the main cause of bacterial diarrhea in piglets. Previous transcriptome reported that ST3GAL1 was associated to E. coli F18 infection. However, its role in mediating the resistance to E. coli F18 remains elusive. Here, we revealed that the downregulation of ST3GAL1 expression contributed to the enhancement of E. coli F18 resistance in IPEC-J2 cells. Bisulfite sequencing identified 26 methylated CpG sites in the ST3GAL1 core promoter. Among these, the ST3GAL1 mRNA levels significantly correlated with methylation levels of the mC-8 site in the specificity protein 1 (SP1) transcription factor (P < 0.01). Interestingly, ST3GAL1 expression may enhances the immune response by activating TLRs signaling, meanwhile decreases the production of the E. coli F18 receptor by inhibiting glycosphingolipid biosynthesis signaling, thereby leading to enhance the resistance to E. coli F18 infection. Besides, low ST3GAL1 expression may increase E. coli resistance by reducing sialylation. Together, these results support the status of ST3GAL1 as a viable target for efforts to modulate E. coli F18 susceptibility, offering a theoretical foundation for the use of this gene as a key biomarker for molecular breeding to improve porcine disease resistance.

AB  - Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause joint inflammation and damage. Leonurine (LE) is an alkaloid found in Leonurus heterophyllus. It has anti-inflammatory effects.
   Hypothesis/Purpose: The molecular mechanisms by which LE acts in RA are unclear and further investigation is required.
   Methods: Mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), and RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) isolated from them were used as in vivo and in vitro models of RA, respectively. The therapeutic effects of LE on CIA-induced joint injury were investigated by micro-computed tomography, and staining with hematoxylin and eosin and Safranin-O/Fast Green. Cell Counting Kit-8, a Transwell (R) chamber, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, RT-qPCR, and western blotting were used to investigate the effects of LE on RA-FLS viability, migratory capacity, inflammation, microRNA-21 (miR-21) levels, the Hippo signaling pathway, and the effects and intrinsic mech-anisms of related proteins. Dual luciferase was used to investigate the binding of miR-21 to YOD1 deubiquitinase (YOD1) and yes-associated protein (YAP). Immunofluorescence was used to investigate the localization of YAP within the nucleus and cytoplasm.
   Results: Treatment with LE significantly inhibited joint swelling, bone damage, synovial inflammation, and proteoglycan loss in the CIA mice. It also reduced the proliferation, cell colonization, migration/invasion, and inflammation levels of RA-FLSs, and promoted miR-21 expression in vitro. The effects of LE on RA-FLSs were enhanced by an miR-21 mimic and reversed by an miR-21 inhibitor. The dual luciferase investigation confirmed that both YOD1 and YAP are direct targets of miR-21. Treatment with LE activated the Hippo signaling pathway, and promoted the downregulation and dephosphorylation of MST1 and LATS1 in RA, while inhibiting the activation of YOD1 and YAP. Regulation of the therapeutic effects of LE by miR-21 was counteracted by YOD1 overexpression, which caused the phosphorylation of YAP and prevented its nuclear ectopic position, thereby reducing LE effect on pro-proliferation-inhibiting apoptosis target genes.
   Conclusion: LE regulates the Hippo signaling pathway through the miR-21/YOD1/YAP axis to reduce joint inflammation and bone destruction in CIA mice, thereby inhibiting the growth and inflammation of RA-FLSs. LE has potential for the treatment of RA.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of the flavonoid-based compound isorhamnetin (ISO) on maturation and developmental competence in oxidative stress-exposed porcine oocytes in vitro. Treatment with 2 mu M ISO (2 ISO) increases the developmental rate of oxidative stress-exposed porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation (IVM). The glutathione level and mRNA expression of antioxidant-related genes (NFE2L2 and SOD2) were increased in the 2 ISO-treated group, whereas the reactive oxygen species level was decreased. Treatment with 2 ISO increased mRNA expression of a cumulus cell expansion-related gene (SHAS2) and improved chromosomal alignment. mRNA expression of maternal genes (CCNB1, MOS, BMP15 and GDF9) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity were increased in the 2 ISO-treated group. The total cell number per blastocyst and percentage of apoptotic cells were increased and decreased in the 2 ISO-treated group, respectively. Treatment with 2 ISO increased mRNA expression of development-related genes (SOX2, NANOG, and POU5F1) and anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2L1 and BIRC5) and decreased that of pro-apoptotic genes (CASP3 and FAS). These results demonstrate that 2 ISO improves the quality of porcine oocytes by protecting them against oxidative stress during IVM and enhances subsequent embryo development in vitro. Therefore, we propose that ISO is a useful supplement for IVM of porcine oocytes.

AB  - After a Telomere Lengthening in juvenile stage, a progressive telomere shortening occurs with age despite higher telomerase level. Telomere Length (TL) may also reflect past physiological state such as a chronic chemical stress. Several studies have revealed a correlation between TL, ageing and/or sex in vertebrates, including teleosts; however, the patterns of telomere dynamics with telomerase mRNA expression, sex, lifespan or chemical stress in teleosts are unclear. The first aim of this study is to verify if telomere length is age and sex-dependent. The second aim is to consider if TL is a useful indicator of stress response in European long-snouted seahorse, Hippocampus guttulatus, an ectothermic and non-model system. We showed that after telomere lengthening during the juvenile stage, a telomeric attrition became significant in sexually mature individuals (p = 0.042). TL decreased in older seahorses despite the presence of somatic telomerase mRNA expression at all life stages studied. There was no difference in TL between males and females, but telomerase mRNA expression was consistently higher in females than males. Exposure to EE2 had no effect on TL in young seahorses, but was correlated with a significant increase in telomerase mRNA expression and various physiological disruptions. Here, a growth retardation of -10 % for body length (p = 0.016) and approximately -45 % for mass (p = 0.001) compared to healthy juvenile seahorses was observed. Our data suggest that telomere dynamics alone should not be used as a marker of EE2 exposure in juvenile seahorses.

AB  - Hyperlipidemia (HLP) is one of the risk factors for memory impairment and cognitive impairment. However, its pathological molecular mechanism remained unclear. 3 & beta;-hydroxysterol & UDelta;24- reductase (DHCR24) is a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and has been reported to decrease in the affected areas in the brain of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, hyperlipidemic mouse model was established to study the effect of high blood lipid on brain. The data obtained from HPLC analysis demonstrated that the cholesterol level in the brain of mice with hyperlipidemia was significantly elevated compared to the control group. While the pathological damages were observed in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus in the brain of hyperlipidemic mice. Furthermore, the protein level of DHCR24 was downregulated accompanied by elevated ubiquitination level in the hyperlipidemic mice brain. The mouse neuroblastoma cells N2a were exposed to the excess cholesterol loading, the cells underwent apoptosis and the mRNA and protein of DHCR24 in cholesterol-loaded N2a cells were significantly reduced. In addition, the expression level of endoplasmic reticulum stress marker protein (Bip and Chop) was markedly increased in response to the cholesterol loading. More importantly, overexpression of DHCR24 in N2a reversed neuronal apoptosis induced by the cholesterol loading. Conclusively, these findings suggested that hyperlipidemia could cause brain tissue injuries via down-regulating DHCR24, and overexpression of DHCR24 may alleviate hyperlipidemia-induced neuronal cells damage by reversing the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis.

AB  - Chloroquine (CQ) could function as a lysosomotropic agent to inhibit the endolysosomal trafficking in the autophagy pathway, and is widely used on malarial, tumor and recently COVID-19. However, the effect of CQ treatment on porcine immature Sertoli cells (iSCs) remains unclear. Here we showed that CQ could reduce iSC viability in a dose-dependent manner. CQ treatment (20 mM) on iSCs for 36h could elevate oxidative stress, damage mitochondrial function and promote apoptosis, which could be partially rescued by melatonin (MT) (10 nM). Transcriptome profiling identified 1611 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (776 up-and 835 down-regulated) (20 mM CQ vs. DMSO), mainly involved in MAPK cascade, cell proliferation/apoptosis, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt and lysosome signaling pathways. In contrast, only 467 (224 up-and 243 down-regulated) DEGs (CQ thorn MT vs. DMSO) could be found after MT (10 nM) addition, enriched in cell cycle, regulation of apoptotic process, lysosome and reproduction pathways. Therefore, the partial rescue effects of MT on CQ treatment were confirmed by multiple assays (cell viability, ROS level, mitochondrial function, apoptosis, and mRNA levels of selected genes). Collectively, CQ treatment could impair porcine iSC viability by deranging the signaling pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which could be partially rescued by MT supplementation.

AB  - The impossibility of using drugs for the health of farm animals leads to the search for alternative strategies with two purposes: to maintain animal health and safeguard human health. In this perspective, tannins have shown great promises. These phytocomplexes obtained from natural matrices with multiple health properties may be used as a feed supplement in chicken farms. In this work, we studied two tannin-based extracts (from Castanea sativa Mill. wood and from Schinopsis balansae Engl. Quebracho Colorado hardwood) with different chemical compositions on the spontaneous contractility on the isolated intestinal tissues of healthy chicken. The results showed that the chemical composition of the two phytocomplexes influenced the spontaneous intestinal contractility in different ways by regulating the tone and consequent progression of the food bolus. The chemical analysis of the two extracts revealed that Castanea sativa Mill. wood mainly contains hydrolysable tannins, while Schinopsis balansae Engl. hardwood mainly contains condensed tannins. The two phytocomplexes showed different effects towards gastrointestinal smooth muscle contractility, with Castanea sativa Mill. wood providing a better activity profile than Schinopsis balansae Engl. hardwood.

AB  - Hypothalamic Adult Neurogenesis (hAN) has been implicated in regulating energy homeostasis. Adult-generated neurons and adult Neural Stem Cells (aNSCs) in the hypothalamus control food intake and body weight. Conversely, diet-induced obesity (DIO) by high fat diets (HFD) exerts adverse influence on hAN. However, the effects of anti-obesity compounds on hAN are not known. To address this, we administered a lipidized analogue of an anti-obesity neuropeptide, Prolactin Releasing Peptide (PrRP), so-called LiPR, to mice. In the HFD context, LiPR rescued the survival of adult-born hypothalamic neurons and increased the number of aNSCs by reducing their activation. LiPR also rescued the reduction of immature hippocampal neurons and modulated calcium dynamics in iPSC-derived human neurons. In addition, some of these neurogenic effects were exerted by another anti-obesity compound, Liraglutide. These results show for the first time that anti-obesity neuropeptides influence adult neurogenesis and suggest that the neurogenic process can serve as a target of anti-obesity pharmacotherapy.
   Anti-obesity compounds promote adult neurogenesis in the hypothalamus. Lipidized Prolactin Releasing Peptide (LiPR) increases the number of neural stem cells and new neurons, establishing adult neurogenesis as a target of anti-obesity pharmacotherapy.High Fat Diet decreases adult neurogenesis in the hypothalamus. LiPR rescues reduced neurogenesis by affecting proliferation of stem cells and increasing the survival of new neurons. LiPR stimulates human immature hypothalamic neurons. Effects of LiPR on cell proliferation are shared by Liraglutide.

AB  - The localization, number, and function of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are crucial for synaptic plasticity, a cellular correlate for learning and memory. The Hippo pathway member WWC1 is an important component of AMPAR-containing protein complexes. However, the availability of WWC1 is constrained by its interaction with the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1 and LATS2 (LATS1/2). Here, we explored the biochemical regulation of this interaction and found that it is pharmacologically targetable in vivo. In primary hippocampal neurons, phosphorylation of LATS1/2 by the upstream kinases MST1 and MST2 (MST1/2) enhanced the interaction between WWC1 and LATS1/2, which sequestered WWC1. Pharmacologically inhibiting MST1/2 in male mice and in human brain-derived organoids promoted the dissociation of WWC1 from LATS1/2, leading to an increase in WWC1 in AMPAR-containing complexes. MST1/2 inhibition enhanced synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampal brain slices and improved cognition in healthy male mice and in male mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and aging. Thus, compounds that disrupt the interaction between WWC1 and LATS1/2 might be explored for development as cognitive enhancers.

AB  - BACKGROUNDVascular plant one-zinc finger (VOZ) transcription factors play a crucial role in plant growth, development, and response to abiotic stresses and pathogen infection. Yet, their roles in resistance to plant herbivores remain largely unknown.RESULTSWe cloned a rice VOZ gene, OsVOZ2, and found that its expression was induced by mechanical wounding; infestation by gravid females of both the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) and the white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera); and treatment with methyl jasmonate. OsVOZ2 is localized to the plant cytoplasm under normal growth conditions and to the nucleus upon treatment with abscisic acid (ABA). Knocking out OsVOZ2 in rice enhanced BPH-induced levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, jasmonic acid, jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine, and abscisic acid. Moreover, knocking out OsVOZ2 promoted the basal level of flavonoids and BPH-induced levels of volatiles, which subsequently enhanced rice defenses against planthoppers in the greenhouse and field. In addition, knocking out OsVOZ2 decreased plant shoot height.CONCLUSIONOur results demonstrate that the wound-induced gene OsVOZ2 regulates plant growth and defense. Knocking out OsVOZ2 can effectively enhance the resistance of rice to planthoppers in the field, providing a potential new approach for controlling rice planthoppers.

AB  - Nod factors among the signaling molecules produced by rhizobia in response to flavonoids to induce root nodule formation in the legumes. It is, however, hypothesized that they might increase the yield and positively impact the growth of non-legumes. To evaluate this statement, rapeseed treated with Nod factor-based biofertilizers were cultivated, their stems was collected, and the metabolic changes were investigated using Raman spectroscopy and MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. Biofertilizer proved to increase the concentration of lignin in the cortex, as well as hemicellulose, pectin, and cellulose in the pith. Moreover, the concentration of quercetin derivatives and kaempferol derivatives increased, while the concentration of isorhamnetin dihexoside decreased. The increase in the concentration of the structural components in the stem might therefore increase the lodging resistance, while the increase in concentration of the flavonoids might increase their resistance to fungal infection and herbivorous insects.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential side-effects of lead acetate (LA), which is toxic to the nerves, blood and muscles, in the rat brain. The neuroprotective effects of pomegranate juice (PJ) against LA exposure were also observed. The experiment involved 28 male Wistar albino rats aged 12 weeks. These were divided into four groups: Control, PJ, LA and LA+PJ. Stereological techniques were employed to determine hippocampal volume in each rat brain. Biochemical investigations and histopathological examinations were also performed. Analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in hippocampal volume in the LA group compared to the control group (p < .05). The stereology results also indicated that PJ has protective effects when compared with the LA and LA+PJ groups. A significant increase was also determined in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in the LA group compared to the control group, in contrast to glutathione (GSH) levels and carboxylesterase (CaE) and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activities. MDA and GST activity decreased significantly in the LA+PJ group compared to the LA group in contrast to GSH levels and CaE and AchE activities. Histopathological examination revealed a number of degenerative changes in the LA group. Exposure to LA adversely affects the hippocampus on the male rat brain. It might also be suggested that PJ may ameliorate these deleterious effects.

AB  - Hydrogel bioadhesives with adequate wet adhesion and swelling resistance are urgently needed in clinic. However, the presence of blood or body fluid usually weakens the interfacial bonding strength, and even leads to adhesion failure. Herein, profiting from the unique coupling structure of carboxylic and phenyl groups in one component (N-acryloyl phenylalanine) for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions, a novel hydrogel adhesive (PAAS) is developed with superior tissue adhesion properties and matrix swelling resistance in challenging wet conditions (adhesion strength of 85 kPa, interfacial toughness of 450 J m-2, burst pressure of 514 mmHg, and swelling ratio of <4%). The PAAS hydrogel can not only realize fast hemostasis of liver, heart, artery rupture, and sealing of pulmonary air-leakage but also accelerate the recovery of stomach and liver defects in rat, rabbit, and pig models. Moreover, PAAS hydrogel can precisely and durably monitor various physiological activities (pulse, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram) even under humid environments (immersion in water for 3 days), and can be employed for the evaluation of in vivo sealing efficiency for artery rupture. The work provides a promising hydrogel adhesive for clinical hemostasis, tissue injury repair, and bioelectronics.

AB  - BACKGROUNDStake surveys and in-ground monitoring stations have been widely used to study field populations of many subterranean termite species, but thus far they have never been intercepted by the invasive Asian subterranean termite, Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann), in southeastern Florida. To investigate the reasons for the inability of C. gestroi to intercept these in-ground monitoring devices, we compared its tunnel geometry with that of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. Two-year-old incipient colonies of both species confined in simulated structural infestations were connected to planar arenas containing four wooden discs. RESULTSCoptotermes formosanus colonies constructed more abundant and more complex tunnel networks and intercepted more wooden discs than C. gestroi. C. formosanus propagated shorter primary tunnels and longer secondary tunnels with more branching frequency than C. gestroi, and probably adopted an area searching strategy to search for food in an area before moving on to other areas. In comparison, C. gestroi used a distance searching strategy by constructing linear and long primary tunnels to search for food at distance. CONCLUSIONSBecause tunnels of C. gestroi were less abundant and they tend to travel straight for some distance, they may have bypassed survey stakes or in-ground monitoring stations that are sparsely distributed in soil. The tunnel geometry of C. gestroi may explain why none of these in-ground monitoring devices has been intercepted by this species in southeastern Florida. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - This comparative analysis evaluated endocrine profiles and gestation length data of captive pregnant black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), and greater one-horned (GOH) rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis). Hormone profiles were collected over three decades as part of pregnancy diagnoses. After the third month of gestation, the luteo-placental shift in progesterone production in pregnant rhinoceroses causes a significant increase in the concentration of faecal progesterone metabolites. We defined a laboratory-specific value of 1000 ng/g faeces as a threshold for incipient feto-placental progesterone production. Using this value allowed a comparison between species and revealed significant individual differences within a species. The mean +/- SEM gestation days for reaching the 1000 ng/g faeces threshold were 89.5 +/- 2.9 (range 56-138 days; n = 39) in black, 96.0 +/- 2.6 (58-138; n = 39) in white, and 117.8 +/- 5.3 (74-173; n = 19) in GOH rhinoceroses. For the calculations of gestation length, we complemented our results from three decades of reproductive monitoring with data from the literature, resulting in about 70 values for each species. Gestation length in the black, the white and the GOH rhinoceros was 460.6 +/- 1.5 (range: 436 - 486), 503.8 +/- 1.3 (range: 480 - 525) and 480.5 +/- 1.1 (range: 453 - 505) days, respectively. Daylight length significantly affected gestation length, while the sex of offspring had no effect. On average, pregnancies with parturitions in spring and summer were one week shorter than those in autumn and winter. Although rhinoceroses are non-seasonal breeders, most parturitions in captivity occur in autumn and winter. We also analysed preconception endocrine profiles in the white rhinoceros. Con-ceptions in this species occurred after oestrous cycles of approximately 35 days (n = 18), 70 days (n = 3), 15 days (n = 1), after periods of ovarian inactivity (n = 5), and during a foal heat within one month after stillbirth parturition (n = 1). In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive overview of gestational parameters in three rhinoceros species.

AB  - Background: Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) seriously affects the health of patients, and the current treatments are invasive and only used for advanced cases. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (BMSC-sEVs) may represent a safer and more effective treatment, but their role in TMJOA has not been elucidated. This study attempted to analyze the cartilage reconstruction effect of BMSC-sEVs on TMJOA and the mechanism underlying this effect.
   Methods: BMSC-sEVs were isolated and purified by microfiltration and ultrafiltration and were subsequently characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, and immunoblotting. TMJOA models were established in vivo and in vitro, and hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, and histological scoring were performed to analyze the histological changes in TMJOA cartilage tissues treated with BMSC-sEVs. The proliferation, migratory capacity, and cell cycle distribution of TMJOA cartilage cells treated with BMSC-sEVs were detected. Furthermore, the related mechanisms were studied by bioinformatic analysis, immunoblotting, and quantitative PCR, and they were further analyzed by knockdown and inhibitor techniques.
   Results: The acquisition and identification of BMSC-sEVs were efficient and satisfactory. Compared with the osteoarthritis (OA) group, the condylar tissue of the OA group treated with BMSC-sEV (OA(sEV)) showed an increase in cartilage lacuna and hypertrophic cartilage cells in the deep area of the bone under the cartilage. Significantly upregulated expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cartilage-forming factors and downregulated expression of cartilage inflammation-related factors in OA(sEV) were observed. In addition, we found higher rates of cell proliferation and migratory activity and alleviated G1 stagnation of the cell cycle of OA(sEV). Autotaxin was found in the BMSC-sEVs, and key factors of the Hippo pathway, Yes-associated protein (YAP), phosphorylated Yes-associated protein (p-YAP), etc. were upregulated in the OA(sEV) group. Treatment with BMSC-sEVs after autotaxin knockdown or inhibition no longer resulted in expression changes in cartilage-forming and inflammation-related factors and key factors of the Hippo pathway.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the autotaxin-YAP signaling axis plays an important role in the mechanism by which BMSC-sEVs promote cartilage reconstruction in TMJOA, which may provide guidance regarding their therapeutic applications as early and minimally invasive therapies for TMJOA, and provide insight into the internal mechanisms of TMJOA.

AB  - Plants release a variety of volatiles and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) after being damaged by herbivorous insects, which play multiple roles in the interactions with other plants and insects. Agasicles hygrophila Selman and Vogt (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a monophagous natural enemy and an effective biocontrol agent for Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb. Here, we reported differences among the volatiles of A. philoxeroides by solid phase microextraction (SPME) using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). We compared the volatile emission of: (1) clean plants (CK); (2) A. philoxeroides plants with mechanical damage treatment (MD); and (3) A. philoxeroides plants infested with A. hygrophila 1st, 2nd, and 3rd larvae and female and male adults. A total of 97 volatiles were recorded, of which 5 occurred consistently in all treatments, while 61 volatiles were only observed in A. philoxeroides infested by A. hygrophila, such as trans-nerolidol, (E)-beta-farnesene, and (3E,7E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (E, E-TMTT), etc. Among the 97 volatile compounds, 37 compounds belong to alkenes, 29 compounds belong to alkanes, and there were 8 esters, 8 alcohols and 6 ketones. Orthogonal partial least squares-discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) showed that the different treatments were separated from each other, especially insect feeding from CK and MD treatments, and 19 volatiles contributed most to the separation among the treatments, with variable importance for the projection (VIP) values > 1. Our findings indicated that the alligatorweed plants could be induced to release volatiles by different stages of A. hygrophila, and the volatile compounds released differ quantitatively and qualitatively. The results from this study laid an important foundation for using volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and HIPVs of alligatorweed to improve the control effect of A. hygrophila on A. philoxeroides.

AB  - Simple Summary
   In New Zealand, hoggets (female lambs aged 4 to 16 months) can be bred at 8 to 9 months of age to produce a lamb. Breeding hoggets may improve farm production and profit but their levels of production are highly variable. This study modelled ewe flocks with combinations of hogget and mature ewe production levels to investigate changes in production and profit with hogget breeding. Firstly, breeding hoggets was profitable even when hogget production levels were as low as 0.26 lambs weaned per hogget. Secondly, improving mature ewe production levels was more beneficial for profit than larger improvements in hogget production levels. Thirdly, the highest profit was achieved when a flock had both very high mature ewe and hogget production levels. Fourthly, there was a mature ewe production level with which profit was the same for a flock without hogget breeding compared with a flock achieving New Zealand industry average hogget and mature ewe production levels. Overall, the relative profit levels achieved by the modelled flocks suggest more farmers should consider breeding hoggets but improving mature ewe production levels should be prioritised.
   Hoggets (ewe lambs aged 4 to 16 months) can be bred from approximately 8 months of age for potentially increased flock production and profit, however most New Zealand hoggets are not presented for breeding and their reproductive success is highly variable. Bio-economic modelling was used to analyse flock productivity and profit in four sets of scenarios for ewe flocks with varying mature ewe (FWR) and hogget (HWR) weaning rate combinations. Firstly, hogget breeding was identified to become profitable when break-even HWRs of 26% and 28% were achieved for flocks with FWRs of 135% and 150%, respectively. Secondly, relatively smaller improvements in FWR were identified to increase profit to the same level as larger improvements in HWR. Thirdly, a high performing flock with FWR and HWR both >= the 90th percentile currently achieved commercially, was the most profitable flock modelled. Fourthly, a FWR was identified with which a farmer not wishing to breed hoggets could have the same profit as a farmer with a flock achieving current industry average FWR and HWR. Overall, the relative profit levels achieved by the modelled flocks suggest that more farmers should consider breeding their hoggets, though improvements in FWRs should be prioritised.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Geniposide (GP) and shanzhiside methyl ester (SM) are the two important bioactive compounds in the classical traditional Chinese herbal medicine Yueju Pill, which is currently used as an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine in China. Yueju has been demonstrated with antidepressant-like effects with the prescriptional dose. As GP and SM both have antidepressant potential, the synergism of them could be crucial to the function of Yueju. Objectives: The neuropeptide pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has been implicated in the onset of antidepressant-like response. Here we investigated the synergism of the chronic treatment with GP and SM, at proportional doses to Yueju, on antidepressant-like effects, and underlying mechanism of PACAPrelated signaling in a neuroinflammation-based depression model. Materials and methods: Depression-related behaviors were tested in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression model. The molecular signaling of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity was investigated using Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling. Results: Chronic treatment of GP and SM (GS) at the dose which is proportional to the prescriptional dose of Yueju synergistically elicited antidepressant-like effects. Chronic treatment of the GS or the conventional antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) showed antidepressant-like effects in LPS-injected mice. In vitro analysis indicated the synergism of GS on PACAP expression. In the hippocampus of LPS-injected mice, both GS and FLX enhanced PACAP expression, downregulated the inflammatory signaling of Iba-1/NF-& kcy;B/IL-1(3 and NLRP3, and upregulated the neuroplasticity signaling of mTOR-BDNF/PSD95. Additionally, both treatments reduced microglia activation indicated by Iba-1 immunofluorescent staining. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, blunted the antidepressant-like effects and the upregulation of BDNF expression induced by chronic GS. Conclusion: The antidepressant-like effects elicited by chronic fluoxetine or by synergistic doses of GS were involved in the upregulation of hippocampal PACAP levels, in association with ameliorated neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity signaling in LPS-injected mice. GS synergism may play a key part in the antidepressant-like effects of the prescriptional dose of Yueju.

AB  - Bathymetry provides instrumental information for studying sedimentary processes, global climate change, and benthic morphologies. The advantages and applicabilities of different techniques for bathymetry detection vary. We propose a framework for bathymetry enhancement from multisource data based on spherical radial basis functions (SRBFs). A case study is conducted over the Paracel Islands in South China Sea (SCS), where Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) measurements, airborne gravimetric observations, echo soundings, and the reference model DTU18BAT are merged. Numerical results suggest that the fusion of ICESat-2 observations dramatically enhances the quality of the computed bathymetry model near the islands, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of which is reduced by 45.35%-67.95% compared to existing models when validated against the satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) with decimeter-level accuracy. By additionally fusing the airborne gravimetric data, bathymetry is further enhanced by similar to 22.49%, particularly over islands with sparse ICESat-2 trajectories. Comparisons with surveyed airborne bathymetric lidar data over the northern Antelope Reef yielded results consistent with those obtained from the SDB, suggesting that SDB is possible to serve as control data in waters devoid of ground truth data. Further analysis reveals that the models constrained by echo soundings performed better than existing models in deep waters, with reductions of 17.79%-44.99% in terms of RMSE. By fusing airborne gravity data, bathymetry is improved by similar to 10%, highlighting the utilization of airborne gravimetry in both shallow and deep waters. The proposed SRBF approach offers an effective way to merge heterogeneous data for high-quality bathymetry determination.

AB  - A high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFD) impairs cognitive functions and increases susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders. Irisin and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) are well known for their role in neuroprotection. The possible neuroprotective effects of fenofibrate on HFFD-induced cognitive dysfunction and the involvement of irisin and HSP70 in these effects were investigated in this study. Rats were divided into normal control, HFFD, dimethylsulfoxide+HFFD, and fenofibrate +HFFD groups. At the end of the experiment, fenofibrate treatment restored hippocampus histological characteristics to almost normal and improved HFFD-induced cognitive deficit. It reduced body weight gain and had hypolipidemic effects by significantly lowering total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as it significantly reduced the hippocampal malondialdehyde, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, while significantly increasing the reduced glutathione level. It prevented HFFD-induced hypoxia by significantly lowering hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha levels. It significantly activated the hippocampal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha)/irisin/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway. It significantly increased hippocampal HSP70 while decreasing the HSP90 levels. It enhanced synaptic plasticity by significantly upregulating the hippocampal relative GluR1 gene expression. Furthermore, hippocampal irisin levels in the HFFD group were found to be positively correlated with cognitive function, hippocampal HSP70, and relative GluR1 gene expression levels, while negatively correlated with hippocampal HSP90 and HIF1 alpha levels. Therefore, fenofibrate may be used as a potential medication to treat HFFD-induced neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND Calcium is an essential macronutrient for plant growth. Although it has been shown that exogenous Ca application can increase plant resistance to abiotic stress, little is known about its potential to enhance plant tolerance to biotic stress. Here, we investigated whether pretreatment of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seeds with calcium chloride (CaCl2) improves plant resistance against wheat aphid (Schizaphis graminum Rondani). The developmental time, population size, feeding behavior of aphids on plants grown from CaCl2- and water-pretreated seeds, and plant defense responses to aphid attack were investigated. RESULTS Seed pretreatment with CaCl2 extended aphid development time and reduced aphid population size and feeding efficiency. In addition, the pretreatment significantly increased the concentration of Ca2+ in wheat leaves, and upregulated expression levels of TaCaM genes and callose synthase genes (TaGSL2, TaGSL8, TaGSL10, TaGSL12, TaGSL19, TaGSL22 and TaGSL23). Callose concentration in the leaves of plants grown from CaCl2-pretreated seeds increased significantly upon aphid attack. Further, callose deposition was observed mainly in the phloem. CONCLUSION These results suggest that seed pretreatment with CaCl2 primes the plant response against wheat aphid attack, leading to modulation of callose deposition in the phloem in response to aphid attack.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by synaptic failure and neuronal loss. Recently, we demonstrated that artemisinins restored the levels of key proteins of inhibitory GABAergic synapses in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, a model of cerebral amyloidosis. In the present study, we analyzed the protein levels and subcellular localization of alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits of GlyRs, indicated as the most abundant receptor subtypes in the mature hippocampus, in early and late stages of AD pathogenesis, and upon treatment with two different doses of artesunate (ARS). Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein levels of both alpha 2 and alpha 3 GlyRs are considerably reduced in the CA1 and the dentate gyrus of 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice when compared to WT mice. Notably, treatment with low-dose ARS affected GlyR expression in a subunit-specific way; the protein levels of alpha 3 GlyR subunits were rescued to about WT levels, whereas that of alpha 2 GlyRs were not affected significantly. Moreover, double labeling with a presynaptic marker indicated that the changes in GlyR alpha 3 expression levels primarily involve extracellular GlyRs. Correspondingly, low concentrations of artesunate (<= 1 mu M) also increased the extrasynaptic GlyR cluster density in hAPPswe-transfected primary hippocampal neurons, whereas the number of GlyR clusters overlapping presynaptic VIAAT immunoreactivities remained unchanged. Thus, here we provide evidence that the protein levels and subcellular localization of alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits of GlyRs show regional and temporal alterations in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice that can be modulated by the application of artesunate.

AB  - alpha-Synuclein (alpha Syn) species can be detected in synaptic boutons, where they play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, the effects of intracellular alpha Syn species on synaptic transmission have not been thoroughly studied. Here, using patch-clamp recordings in hippocampal neurons, we report that alpha Syn oligomers (alpha SynO), intracellularly delivered through the patch electrode, produced a fast and potent effect on synaptic transmission, causing a substantial increase in the frequency, amplitude and transferred charge of spontaneous synaptic currents. We also found an increase in the frequency of miniature synaptic currents, suggesting an effect located at the presynaptic site of the synapsis. Furthermore, our in silico approximation using docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations showed an interaction between a previously described small anti-amyloid beta (A beta) molecule, termed M30 (2-octahydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylethanamine), with a central hydrophobic region of alpha Syn. In line with this finding, our empirical data aimed to obtain oligomerization states with thioflavin T (ThT) and Western blot (WB) indicated that M30 interfered with alpha Syn aggregation and decreased the formation of higher-molecular-weight species. Furthermore, the effect of alpha SynO on synaptic physiology was also antagonized by M30, resulting in a decrease in the frequency, amplitude, and charge transferred of synaptic currents. Overall, the present results show an excitatory effect of intracellular alpha Syn low molecular-weight species, not previously described, that are able to affect synaptic transmission, and the potential of a small neuroactive molecule to interfere with the aggregation process and the synaptic effect of alpha Syn, suggesting that M30 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for synucleinopathies.

AB  - Cattle have emerged as one of the most important domestic animals widely used for meat, milk, and fur. Derivation of bovine pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be applied in drug selecting and human disease modeling and facilitated agriculture-related applications such as production of genetically excellent cattle by gene editing. Extended PSCs (EPSCs), capable of differentiating into embryonic and extraembryonic parts, have been generated in mouse, human, and pig. Whether bovine EPSCs could be generated, and their chimeric competency remains unclear. This study focused on derivation of bovine EPSCs using LCDM medium and exploring the characteristics of EPSCs among different species, including bovine, mouse, and human EPSCs. Here, using LCDM medium (consisting of hLIF, CHIR99021, (S)-(+)-dimethindene maleate, and minocycline hydrochloride) enables the derivation of bovine EPSCs from induced PSCs (iPSCs) and bovine fetal fibroblasts (BFF) with stable morphology, pluripotent marker expression, and in vitro differentiation ability. Notably, bovine EPSCs exhibited interspecies chimeric contribution to embryonic and extraembryonic tissues in pre-implantation blastocysts and postimplantation bovine-mouse chimeras. Transcriptome analysis revealed the unique molecular characteristics of bovine EPSCs compared with iPSCs. The similarities and differences in molecular features across bovine, human, and mouse EPSCs were also described by transcriptome analysis. Taken together, the LCDM culture system containing chemical cocktails can be used for the establishment and long-term passaging of bovine EPSCs with embryonic and extraembryonic potency in bovine-mouse chimeras. Our findings lay the foundation of generating PSCs in domestic animals and open avenues for basic and applied research in biology, medicine, and agriculture.

AB  - SYNGAP1 is a Ras GTPase-activating protein that plays a crucial role during brain development and in synaptic plasticity. Sporadic heterozygous mutations in SYNGAP1 affect social and emotional behaviour observed in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although neurophysiological deficits have been extensively studied, the epigenetic landscape of SYNGAP1 mutation-mediated intellectual disability is unexplored. Here, we have found that the p300/CBP specific acetylation marks of histones are significantly repressed in the hippocampus of adolescent Syngap1+/- mice. Additionally, we observed decreased dendritic branching of newly born DCX+ neurons in these mice, suggesting altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis. To establish the causal relationship of Syngap1+/- phenotype and the altered histone acetylation signature we have treated 2-4 months old Syngap1+/- mice with glucose-derived carbon nanosphere (CSP) conjugated potent small molecule activator (TTK21) of p300/CBP lysine acetyltransferase (CSP-TTK21). The enhancement of the p300/CBP specific acetylation marks of histones by CSP-TTK21 restored synaptic functions, increased dendritic branching of DCX+ neurons, enables the capability to reorganise cortical circuits in response to change in the sensory stimuli, and improves behavioural measures in Syngap1+/- mice that are very closely comparable to wild type littermates. Further, hippocampal RNA-Seq analysis of these mice revealed that the expression of many critical genes such as Adcy1, Ntrk3, Egr1, and Foxj1 which are key regulators of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis and are well associated with ID/ASD reversed upon CSP-TTK21 treatment. This study could be the first demonstration of the reversal of autistic behaviour and neural wiring upon the modulation of altered epigenetic modification(s).

AB  - BACKGROUNDSilicon (Si) fertilization has been well-documented to enhance plant resistance against insect pests by increasing the abrasiveness and toughness of leaf tissues. Additionally, Si also interacts with the jasmonic acid pathway, which modulates antiherbivore induced defenses, including the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that attract natural enemies. In this study, we examined the influence of Si fertilization on the attractiveness of nocturnal HIPVs from maize plants infested with the fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith), to the predatory earwig Doru luteipes (Scudder).RESULTSIn laboratory assays, we found that Si fertilization did not alter the attractiveness of nocturnal constitutive volatiles to the nocturnal predator D. luteipes. However, upon infestation with FAW larvae, Si-fertilized plants emitted a volatile blend that was more attractive to D. luteipes. Although the composition of HIPVs emitted by non-fertilized and Si-fertilized plants was similar, the terpene neryl acetate was exclusively detected in the HIPV blend from Si-fertilized plants. Tests with synthetic neryl acetate demonstrated that the terpene alone was attractive to the earwig at the specific concentration found in the HIPV blend emitted by Si-fertilized plants.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates that Si fertilization primes indirect defenses by specifically increasing the amount of neryl acetate in the HIPV blend, which is responsible for the enhanced attractiveness to the predatory earwig. Thus, Si can act as a priming agent of indirect plant defenses, potentially increasing the recruitment of the predatory earwig once plants are infested by FAW, thereby contributing to suppress insect pest populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rice is one of the most consumed cereals in the world. Productivity losses are caused by different biotic stresses. One of the most common is the phytophagous mite Schizotetranychus oryzae Rossi de Simons (Acari: Tetranychidae), which inhibits plant development and seed production. The identification of plant defense proteins is important for a better understanding of the mite-plant interaction. We previously detected a high expression of Osmotin1 protein in mite-resistant rice cultivars, under infested conditions, suggesting it could be involved in plant defense against mite attack. We therefore aimed to evaluate the responses of three rice lines overexpressing Osmotin1 (OSM1-OE) and three lines lacking the Osmotin1 gene (osm1-ko) to mite attack.RESULTS: The numbers of individuals (adults, immature stages, and eggs) were significantly lower in OSM1-OE lines than those in wild-type (WT) plants. On the other hand, the osm1-ko lines showed larger numbers of mites per leaf than WT plants. When plants reached the full maturity stage, two out of the three infested OSM1-OE lines presented lower plant height than WT, while the three osm1-ko lines (infested or not) presented higher plant height than WT. The reduction in seed number caused by mite infestation was lower in OSM1-OE lines (12-19%) than in WT plants (34%), while osm1-ko lines presented higher reduction (24-54%) in seed number than WT plants (13%).CONCLUSION: These data suggest that Osmotin1 is involved in rice resistance to S. oryzae infestation. This is the first work showing increased plant resistance to herbivory overexpressing an Osmotin gene. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - BACKGROUNDHow parasitoids distinguish hosts from non-hosts remains an unknown question. Chouioia cunea Yang (Eulophidae) is an important fall webworm parasitoid that attacks many forest and agricultural pests. To study the differences in the chemical clues used by C. cunea to distinguish host and non-host plants, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify volatile compounds of two C. cunea hosts (Hyphantria cunea and Helicoverpa armigera) and two non-hosts (Spodoptera exigua and Spodoptera frugiperda). Additionally, we used behavioral assays to compare the attraction of C. cunea to various compounds. RESULTSThe two natural host species were more attractive than the two non-host species, in the following order: Hyphantria cunea > Helicoverpa armigera > S. exigua = S. frugiperda. The pupae of the natural hosts contained 1-dodecene, which was not produced by the two natural non-hosts. When the 'attractants' based on the difference between the species-specific blend emitted by pupae and the optimal blend were sprayed onto the natural non-host pupae, they significantly improved the attraction of C. cunea to the non-host pupae. CONCLUSIONThese results revealed that specific host-produced volatile compounds guide C. cunea to distinguish between natural hosts and non-hosts. Overall, this study provides a foundation for developing a behavior-modifying strategy to re-direct C. cunea attacks to control important non-host pests. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Neural stem cells residing in the hippocampal neurogenic niche sustain lifelong neurogenesis in the adult brain. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is functionally linked to mnemonic and cognitive plasticity in humans and rodents. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the process of generating new neurons at the hippocampal neurogenic niche is impeded, yet the mechanisms involved are unknown. Here we identify miR-132, one of the most consistently downregulated microRNAs in AD, as a potent regulator of AHN, exerting cell-autonomous proneurogenic effects in adult neural stem cells and their progeny. Using distinct AD mouse models, cultured human primary and established neural stem cells, and human patient material, we demonstrate that AHN is directly affected by AD pathology. miR-132 replacement in adult mouse AD hippocampus restores AHN and relevant memory deficits. Our findings corroborate the significance of AHN in mouse models of AD and reveal the possible therapeutic potential of targeting miR-132 in neurodegeneration.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that a 9-hour fast in mice reduces the amount of time spent immobile in the forced swimming test. However, whether 9-hour fasting has therapeutic effects in female mice with depressive symptoms has not been established. Therefore, in this study, we simulated perimenopausal depression via an ovariectomy in mice, and subjected them to a single 9-hour fasting 7 days later. We found that the ovariectomy increased the time spent immobile in the forced swimming test, inhibited expression of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling pathway in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and decreased the density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus. The 9-hour acute fasting alleviated the above-mentioned phenomena. Furthermore, all of the antidepressant-like effects of 9-hour fasting were reversed by an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Electrophysiology data showed a remarkable increase in long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 of the ovariectomized mice subjected to fasting compared with the findings in the ovariectomized mice not subjected to fasting. These findings show that the antidepressant-like effects of 9-hour fasting may be related to the activation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin complex 1 signaling pathway and synaptic plasticity in the mammalian hippocampus. Thus, fasting may be a potential treatment for depression.

AB  - Theoretical-experimental research is presented to address the mechanics and failure mode of the interface between two matrices with brittle behavior, earth and mortar, and pig hair, an organic fiber that is a massive waste from the food industry worldwide. A comprehensive statistical analysis of the pull-out force is presented, accounting for the effect of fiber embedded length, diameter variability, and age of the matrices. Experimental results are contrasted with fracture-mechanics theories to describe its behavior in this matter. Results show that neither fiber length, variability of diameter, nor the age of the matrix influences the pull-out force of both matrices evaluated in this work. Our results show the brittle nature of these interfaces, which was also observed using a high-speed camera. The tensile load of the fibers was compared to the pull-out force, showing that these fibers always work within their elastic regime. This work contributes directly to the sustainable goals 9, 11, and 15 enacted by the United Nations in 2015, by contributing to the understanding of the fracture mechanics of a waste product used as reinforcement of construction matrices.

AB  - Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase 2 (Fbp2) is a gluconeogenic enzyme and multifunctional protein modulating mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity via protein-protein interactions. The ability of Fbp2 to bind to its cellular partners depends on a quaternary arrangement of the protein. NAD(+) and AMP stabilize an inactive T-state of Fbp2 and thus, affect these interactions. However, more subtle structural changes evoked by the binding of catalytic cations may also change the affinity of Fbp2 to its cellular partners. In this report, we demonstrate that Fbp2 interacts with Co2+, a cation which in excessive concentrations, causes pathologies of the central nervous system and which has been shown to provoke the octal-like events in hippocampal slices. We describe for the first time the kinetics of Fbp2 in the presence of Co2+, and we provide a line of evidence that Co2+ blocks the AMP-induced transition of Fbp2 to the canonical T-state triggering instead of a new, non-canonical T-state. In such a state, Fbp2 is still partially active and may interact with its binding partners e.g., Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 alpha (Camk2 alpha). The Fbp2-Camk2 alpha complex seems to be restricted to mitochondria membrane and it facilitates the Camk2 alpha autoactivation and thus, synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Transplantation has substituted dysfunctional organs with healthy organs from donors to significantly lower morbidity and mortality associated with end-stage organ disease. Since the advent of transplantation, the promise of functional replacement has attracted an exponential mismatch between organ supply and demand. Theoretical proposals to counter the increasing needs have either been to create a source through genetic engineering of porcine donors for xenotransplantation (with more potent immunosuppression protocols) or recreate one's organ in a pig using interspecies blastocyst complementation for exogenic organ transplantation (without immunosuppression). Another promising avenue has been organ banking through cryopreservation for transplantation. Although ice free preservation and acceptable early function following rewarming is critical for success in transplantation, the immunological response that predominantly defines short- and long-term graft survival has failed to captivate attention to date. It is well sorted that thermal and metabolic stress incurred at 4 degrees C during recovery and reperfusion of organs for clinical transplantation has varying impact on graft survival. Considering the magnitude of cellular imbalance and injury at sub-zero/ultralow temperatures in addition to the chemical toxicity of cryoprotective agents (CPA), it is essential to assess and address the immunological response associated following transplantation to maximize the success of cryopreservation.

AB  - Neurodegeneration is caused by the progressive loss of the structure and function of neurons, leading to cell death, and it is the main cause of many neurodegenerative diseases. Many molecules, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have been studied for their potential to prevent or treat these diseases. They are widespread in nature and perform an important role in neuritogenesis and neuroprotection. Here we investigated the neuritogenic and neuroprotective role of Phallusia nigra dermatan sulfate (PnD2,6S) and compared it with two distinct structures of chondroitin sulfate (C6S) and dermatan sulfate (D4S). For this study, a neuro 2A murine neuroblastoma cell line was used, and a chemical lesion was induced by the pesticide rotenone (ROT). We observed that PnD2,6S + ROT had a better neuritogenic effect than either C6S + ROT or D4S + ROT at a lower concentration (0.05 & mu;g/mL). When evaluating the mitochondrial membrane potential, PnD2,6S showed a neuroprotective effect at a concentration of 0.4 & mu;g/mL. These data indicate different mechanisms underlying this neuronal potential, in which the sulfation pattern is important for neuritogenic activity, while for neuroprotection all DS/CS structures had similar effects. This finding leads to a better understanding the chemical structures of PnD2,6S, C6S, and D4S and their therapeutic potential.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The stick tea thrips, Dendrothrips minowai Priesner, is one of the most important sucking pests that seriously infest tea plants (Camellia sinensis) in China. Given that D. minowai exhibit aggregation behaviors in tea plantations, this study evaluated the potential of aggregation pheromones for their control. RESULTS: H-tube olfactometer assays showed that D. minowai larvae, adult females and adult males were significantly attracted to larvae rather than adult females and males under laboratory conditions. Subsequent gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of volatiles from larvae, identified two larva-specific components: dodecyl acetate and tetradecyl acetate. Electrophysiological and behavioral experiments confirmed the positive response of females and males to dodecyl acetate, tetradecyl acetate, and their blend (1:1.5). Deployment of these aggregation pheromones on sticky traps resulted in a 1.2- to 3.0-fold increase in the capture of D. minowai adults compared with control traps. In addition, deployment of sticky traps baited with these aggregation pheromones within tea plantations resulted in a noteworthy reduction in the population of adult thrips per 100 leaves, 10 days following trap deployment. The reduction ranged from 29% to 59%, in comparison with the control. CONCLUSION: D. minowai larvae produce aggregation pheromones, dodecyl acetate and tetradecyl acetate, that can be useful for controlling tea thrips. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Sea buckthorn ( Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is a traditional Chinese medicinal and possesses a rich medical history in terms of treating gastric disorders, sputum and cough and liver injuries in oriental medicinal system. By reason of the complicated chemical constituents, the material basis and potential pharmacological mechanism of sea buckthorn acting on Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been clearly elucidated. Aim of the study: To explore the pharmacological efficacy and underlying mechanism of sea buckthorn triterpenoid acid enrichment (STE) in the treatment of NAFLD. Materials and methods: The approaches of Network pharmacology and experiment validation in vitro and in vivo were applied in this study. Firstly, targets of triterpenoid acid compounds and NAFLD were collected from databases. The crucial targets were screened by the construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Furthermore, the potential signaling pathways and targets affected by STE was predicted by GO together with KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, the experiment validation was carried out through high-fat feeding NAFLD mice and lipid accumulation HepG2 cell model. Lipids and liver related biochemical indicators were determined, Oil Red O and H&E &E staining were employed to observe fat accumulation. In addition, the expression levels of proteins of key target and signal pathway anticipated in network pharmacology were detected to elaborated its action mechanism. Results: A total of 180 intersecting potential targets for enhancing NAFLD with STE were eventually identified. 6 key targets including AKT1, TNF, IL6, INS, JUN, STAT3 and TP53 were further identified and the AMPK-SREBP1 pathway was enriched. Animal experiment result showed that STE treatment could significantly reduce the levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, ALT and AST, increase the levels of HDL-C in serum, and improve lipid accumulation of epididymal fat and liver. The results of the lipid accumulation cell model indicated that STE and key compound oleanolic acid could diminish intracellular lipid levels of TG, TC, LDL-C and number of lipid droplets. Western blot results showed that the above beneficial effects could be achieved by regulating the expression of p-AMPK/ AMPK, SREBP1, FAS, ACC, SCD protein. Conclusion: This study confirmed the effect of STE on improving NAFLD and the potential action mechanism was involved in the regulation of the AMPK-SREBP1 pathway.

AB  - In recent years, various biomasses (such as coconut, cotton, wheat straw, basswood, bamboo, etc.) have been utilized to prepare porous carbon materials (PCMs) through carbonization and/or physical/chemical activation. Most of these carbon materials are limited by the electric double-layer capacitance, resulting in a limited specific capacitance. Moreover, the preparation processes are often complicated and the carbon yield is low. Therefore, from the perspective of green and sustainable preparation of PCMs with high carbon yield and high performance, in this study, N-doped porous carbon electrodes were prepared by one-step activation carbonization method using camellia oleifera branches as raw material and NH4Cl as the activator. The N-doped NCW-2 sample has a rational hierarchical porous structure and high N doping amount (3.35 at. %) and exhibited optimal rate per-formance with a specific capacitance of 250 F g-1 at 50 A g-1. The symmetrical device also presented excellent performance with a capacitance retention of 93.7 % after cycling 30,000 times at 20 A g-1 and delivered superior rate performances of 22.3 W h kg- 1@100 W kg- 1 to 11.8 W h kg-1@4800 W kg -1. This work may provide a certain reference for the preparation of N-doped biomass-derived PCMs and widen its practical application in supercapacitor devices.

AB  - Inspired by animal navigation strategies, we introduce a novel computational model to navigate and map a space rooted in biologically inspired principles. Animals exhibit extraordinary navigation prowess, harnessing memory, imagination, and strategic decision-making to traverse complex and aliased environments adeptly. Our model aims to replicate these capabilities by incorporating a dynamically expanding cognitive map over predicted poses within an active inference framework, enhancing our agent's generative model plasticity to novelty and environmental changes. Through structure learning and active inference navigation, our model demonstrates efficient exploration and exploitation, dynamically expanding its model capacity in response to anticipated novel un-visited locations and updating the map given new evidence contradicting previous beliefs. Comparative analyses in mini-grid environments with the clone-structured cognitive graph model (CSCG), which shares similar objectives, highlight our model's ability to rapidly learn environmental structures within a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap. Our model achieves this without prior knowledge of observation and world dimensions, underscoring its robustness and efficacy in navigating intricate environments.

AB  - Simple Summary This study reports an investigation into 19 French farrow-to-finish farms that successfully implemented the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 (PRRSV-1) stabilization protocol between 2007 and 2019. One year before (P1) and one year after (P2) the introduction of this protocol, the antibiotic consumptions (expressed in mg/PCU and ALEA) were compared for each farm. The difference between P1 and P2 was also calculated in percentages. The transition from P1 to P2 revealed that the higher the consumption levels were in P1, the greater the antibiotic reduction in P2. These results emphasize how stability against PRRSV-1 seems to reduce antibiotic usage, particularly in farms with a high level of consumption. Infection with the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 (PRRSV-1) has serious economic consequences for the pig industry. Swine practitioners and other agricultural advisors often describe an increase in antibiotic use when PRRSV-1 is circulating. Our objective was to assess the impact of PRRSV-1 stabilization programs on reducing antibiotic use in 19 French farrow-to-finish farms that successfully implemented such a protocol between 2007 and 2019. For each farm, we compared the global antibiotic consumption, including all physiological stages (expressed in mg/PCU and ALEA) one year before (P1) and one year after (P2) the implementation of the protocol, and the change between P1 and P2 was calculated in percentages. The data were also analyzed by level of consumption. We showed that antibiotic use decreased significantly between P1 and P2 if expressed in mg/PCU and showed a decreased tendency in terms of exposure (ALEA) after PRRSV-1 stabilization. Concerning the change from P1 to P2, depending on the level of consumption in P1, our results showed that the higher the consumption levels were in P1, the greater the antibiotic reduction in P2. This study highlights the ability of a stabilization protocol against PRRSV-1 to reduce antibiotic use, especially on farms that have high consumption rates. These hopeful results show that further investigations about the relationship between PRRSV-1 and antibiotic usage could be beneficial.

AB  - Early pregnancy modulates the maternal immune system, including the spleen and lymph nodes, which participate in maternal innate and adaptive immune responses. Methods: Ovine spleens and lymph nodes were sampled at day 16 of the estrous cycle, and at days 13, 16 and 25 of gestation, and qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to analyze the expression of the I kappa B family, including BCL-3, I kappa B alpha, I kappa B beta, I kappa B epsilon, IKK gamma, I kappa BNS and I kappa B zeta. Early pregnancy induced expression of BCL-3, I kappa B alpha, I kappa B epsilon, IKK gamma and I kappa B zeta, and expression of BCL-3, I kappa B beta and I kappa BNS peaked at day 16 of pregnancy in the spleen. However, early pregnancy suppressed the expression of BCL-3 and I kappa BNS, but stimulated the expression of I kappa B beta and I kappa B zeta, and expression levels of I kappa B alpha, I kappa B beta, I kappa B epsilon and IKK gamma peaked in lymph nodes at days 13 and/or 16 of pregnancy. Early pregnancy changed the expression of the I kappa B family in the maternal spleen and lymph node in a tissue-specific manner, suggesting that the modulation of the I kappa B family may be involved in regulation of maternal functions of the spleen and lymph nodes, which are necessary for the establishment of maternal immune tolerance during early pregnancy in sheep.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Anshen Dingzhi prescription (ADP), documented in "Yi Xue Xin Wu", is a famous prescription for treating panic-related mental disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which ADP intervened in PTSD-like behaviors. Methods: A mouse model of single prolonged stress (SPS) was established to evaluate the ameliorative effects and mechanisms of ADP on PTSD. Behavioral tests were used to assess PTSD-like behaviors in mice; transmission electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the ultrastructure of hippocampal synapses, and western blot, immunofluorescence, and ELISA were used to detect the expression of hippocampal deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and downstream Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) - P21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) signal, as well as levels of synaptic proteins and inflammatory factors. Molecular docking technology simulated the binding of potential brain-penetrating components of ADP to DCC. Results: SPS induced PTSD-like behaviors in mice and increased expression of hippocampal netrin-1 (NT-1) and DCC on the 14th day post-modeling, with concurrent elevation in serum NT-1 levels. Simultaneously, SPS also decreased p-Rac1 level and increased p-PAK1 level, the down-stream molecules of DCC. Lentiviral overexpression of DCC induced or exacerbated PTSD-like behaviors in control and SPS mice, respectively, whereas neutralization antibody against NT-1 reduced DCC activation and ameliorated PTSD-like behaviors in SPS mice. Interestingly, downstream Rac1-PAK1 signal was altered according to DCC expression. Moreover, DCC overexpression down-regulated N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2A (GluN2A) and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), up-regulated NMDA receptor 2B (GluN2B) and increased neuroinflammatory responses. Administration of ADP (36.8 mg/kg) improved PTSD-like behaviors in the SPS mice, suppressed hippocampal DCC, and downstream Rac1-PAK1 signal, upregulated GluN2A and PSD95, downregulated GluN2B, and reduced levels of inflammatory factors NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) and interleukin-6 (IL6). Importantly, DCC overexpression could also reduce the ameliorative effect of ADP on PTSD. Additionally, DCC demonstrated a favorable molecular docking pattern with the potential brain-penetrating components of ADP, further suggesting DCC as a potential target of ADP. Conclusion: Our data indicate that DCC is a key target for the regulation of synaptic function and inflammatory response in the onset of PTSD, and ADP likely reduces DCC to prevent PTSD via modulating downstream Rac1PAK1 pathway. This study provides a novel mechanism for the onset of PTSD and warrants the clinical application of ADP.

AB  - Corticosterone plays an important role in the stress response, physiological regulation, and development of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Although several studies have demonstrated that chronic corticosterone induces anxiety- or depressive-related behaviors in mice, it remains unclear whether chronic corticosterone administration affects gene expression in the brain during the stress response. This study investigated whether chronic corticosterone administration has a significant effect on stress-related gene expression in the brain. Therefore, mice were chronically treated with corticosterone in drinking water and gene expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Moreover, restraint stress was acutely applied as a novel stressor in mice chronically treated with corticosterone in the cortex and hippocampus. We initially found that chronic corticosterone administration altered glucocorticoid signaling-mediated gene expression, such as FK506 binding protein 5 (Fkbp5) and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (Sgk1), in the cortex and hippocampus of mice. Next, we found that restraint stress exposure elevated Fkbp5 expression in the vehicle group; however, chronic corticosterone administration occluded further induction of Fkbp5 expression after restraint stress exposure. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa) and interleukin-1 beta (fl1b) mRNA expression in the cortex and hippocampus were remarkably enhanced by restraint stress in corticosterone-treated mice, but not in the vehicle group. Collectively, our results demonstrated that chronic corticosterone administration modulates glucocorticoid signaling and uncovered the robust induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines after restraint stress exposure in chronically corticosterone-treated mice. These mechanisms may be involved in the molecular basis for the onset of stress-related mental illnesses.

AB  - The protocadherins Fat and Dachsous regulate organ growth, shape, patterning, and planar cell polarity. Although Dachsous and Fat have been described as ligand and receptor, respectively, in a signal transduction pathway, there is also evidence for bidirectional signaling. Here, we assess signaling downstream of Dachsous through analysis of its intracellular domain. Genomic deletions of conserved sequences within dachsous identified regions of the intracellular domain that contribute to Dachsous activity. Deletion of the A motif increased Dachsous protein levels and decreased wing size. Deletion of the D motif decreased Dachsous levels at cell membranes, increased wing size, and disrupted wing, leg and hindgut patterning and planar cell polarity. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments established that the D motif is necessary and sufficient for association of Dachsous with key partners, including Lowfat, Dachs, Spiny-legs, Fat and MyoID. Subdivision of the D motif identified distinct regions that preferentially contribute to different Dachsous activities. Our results identify motifs that are essential for Dachsous function and are consistent with the hypothesis that the key function of Dachsous is regulation of Fat.

AB  - Oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) based on the follicular fluid (FF) environment can exploit untapped resources, however, what FF factors regulate oocyte maturation remains unclear. This work demonstrated that serum and FF significantly promoted oocyte polar body extrusion (PBE) and subsequent embryo development, and FF was especially effective. Fibronectin 1 (FN1) was predicted as one potential candidate to regulate oocyte maturation by proteomics. FN1 transcription obviously decreased, and the protein expression significantly increased and migrated to plasma membrane or even outside during oocyte IVM. Treatment with 10 ng/mL FN1 significantly improved oocyte PBE rate. FN1 significantly upregulated the percentage of regular spindle morphology, downregulated the gamma -H2AX level, decreased the levels of ROS and apoptosis, and increased GSH and mitochondrion contents by ameliorating the expression of corresponding genes. Moreover, FN1 significantly increased the p-PI3K level to enhance the activation of PI3K signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study discovers and confirms that FN1 is one factor in FF that significantly enhances oocyte maturation, and the underlying mechanism is that FN1 ameliorates oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation by promoting the activation of PI3K signaling pathway.

AB  - Uncontrolled hemorrhages pose severe threats to life, especially in the case of deep cavity wounds. To address these challenges, we developed an injectable and super-expandable all-cellulose based sponge by dual-crosslinking of needle-leaf pulp fiber (Pulp) with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) through a double pore generation strategy. When addressing severe hemorrhage, Pulp-CMC sponge with high porosity can rapidly expand to similar to 3900 % of itself in height, applying extra physical pressure to the wounds to stop bleeding, which is highest expansion ratio that ever reported in hemostasis materials. Moreover, the carboxyl groups in CMC can bind with Fe3+ ions in blood, thereby providing a chemical hemostatic effect. In pig femoral artery bleeding and stab wound models, the Pulp-CMC5 sponge reduced bleeding volume by 81 % and 86 %, compared with gauze, respectively. When buried in soil, the sponge can fully degrade within 30 days. The benign strategy retains the biochemical property of biomass to large extent, and the outstanding performance of these sponges provides an alternative "green" hemostasis material for managing uncontrollable bleeding in clinical applications.

AB  - Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), an updated pattern of high -frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, is a potential candidate for improving memory. The hippocampus has been shown to be involved in the memory-enhancing effect induced by iTBS. However, it remains largely unknown whether this effect is achieved by regulating hippocampal theta oscillation and neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, which are strongly related to memory. Thus, we investigated the effect of 14 days of iTBS on hippocampus-dependent memory and further explored the roles of hippocampal theta oscillation and neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate in this effect. We found that compared to sham iTBS, real iTBS enhanced hippocampus-dependent memory measured by hole -board test and object place recognition test. Further, real iTBS increased the density of c -Fos positive neurons and normalized power of theta oscillation in the dorsal hippocampus (dHip) compared to sham iTBS. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in the level of extracellular GABA and an increase in the level of extracellular glutamate in the dHip after real iTBS. Our results suggest that long -term iTBS improved hippocampus-dependent memory, which may be attributed to the enhancement of theta oscillation and altered levels of extracellular GABA and glutamate in the dHip.

AB  - Purpose Despite the extensive efforts to treat the leading cause of neurodegenerative diseases (ND), a little progress has been reported. Red light might affect ND through many specific mechanisms. The purpose of this investigation is to explore the effect of red light on the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LRP-1) and transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA-1) gene in the hippocampus, and the serum melatonin level (SML) of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuro-inflammated rats. Materials and methods Red-light therapy was implemented using a wavelength 630 nm under different light conditions and the passive avoidance (PA) and Y-Maze tests were employed to assess memory performance. To evaluate the LRP-1 and TRPA-1 genes expression, quantitive real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed. To measure the SML, ELISA was performed before and after the red-light radiation. Results LPS caused memory impairment in both behavioral tests. Red-light therapy improved PA memory in all light conditions (p < .001). However, in Y-maze, only the red-light radiation during light and dark cycles, improved memory (p < .01 and p < .001, respectively). In addition, red-light radiation caused significant increase in SML (p < .05). The LRP-1 and TRPA-1 genes expression increased significantly during the dark phase in the red light radiated group compared to non-radiated group (p < .001). Conclusions Taken together, the results suggest that red-light therapy can reduce the complications of memory impairment in rats. This study has found that red-light therapy demonstrates higher effect during the period of dark phase compared to light phase. No doubt, further experimental studies would help us to establish a greater degree of accuracy on this matter.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Inflammatory responses are associated wieh the pathophysiology of depression. Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) exerts antidepressant effect, but the relationship between its activity and inflammation remains unclear. Aim of the study: In this study, the antidepressant-like effect and underlying mechanisms of Rb1 were been investigated. Materials and methods: The neuroinflammatory mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute depression-like behavior was employed to detect the action of Rb1. An integrative strategy combining the identification of prototype (Rb1) and its metabolites in vivo with network pharmacology analysis was used to explore therapeutic mechanisms of these ingredients. The putative targets and signalings were experimentally validated. The antidepressant-like effect of F2, the metabolite of Rb1, was firstly evaluated. Results: Rb1 significantly ameliorated LPS-induced depressive-like behavior. Rb1 and its metabolites (Rd, F2, compound K, Rh2, Rg3, PPD) were identified and then a disease-component-target network was established. Experimental validation showed that Rb1 inhibited peripheral and hippocampal inflammation via MAPK/NF-Kappa B signaling. In inflammatory-mediated depression state, Rb1 improved impaired glucocorticoid receptor, suppressed indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, increased 5-HT level and 5-HT1A receptor expression. Additionally, F2 was firstly discovered to exert antidepressant-like effect, and it existed higher activity than Rb1 against depression. Conclusion: The study highlighted the potential of Rb1 and F2 as healthy supplement or agent for inflammationinduced depression.

AB  - The accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) into Lewy bodies in cortical and subcortical regions has been linked to the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). While there is a strong link between synuclein aggregates and the reduction in dopamine function in the emergence of PD, less is known about the consequences of alpha-Syn accumulation in glutamatergic neurons and how this could be exploited as a therapeutic target. Transgenic h-alpha-synL62 (L62) mice, in which synuclein aggregation is achieved through the expression of full-length human alpha-Syn fused with a signal sequence peptide, were used to characterise glutamatergic transmission using a combination of behavioural, immunoblotting, and histopathological approaches. The protein aggregation inhibitor hydromethylthionine mesylate (HMTM) alone, or in combination with the glutamatergic compounds 3-((2-Methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MTEP) and memantine, was used to target alpha-Syn aggregation. We show that accumulation of alpha-Syn aggregates in glutamatergic synapses affected synaptic protein expression including metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGLUR5) levels and ratio of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits GluN1/GluN2A. The ratio of NMDA receptor subunits and levels of mGLUR5 were both normalised by HMTM in L62 mice. These alterations, however, did not affect glutamate release in synaptosomes derived from L62 mice or behavioural endpoints following pharmacological manipulations of glutamate functions. Our results confirm that HMTM acts in the L62 mouse model of PD as an inhibitor of pathological aggregation of synuclein and show that HMTM treatment normalises both the ratio of NMDA receptor subunits and mGLUR5 levels. These findings support the potential utility of HMTM as a disease-modifying treatment for PD aiming to reduce synuclein aggregation pathology.

AB  - The study aims to understand the seasonal variation in groundwater geochemistry for drinking and irrigation uses in Aundha Nagnath tehsil of Maharashtra, India. Therefore, sixty (60) representative water sampling stations were selected for pre- and post-monsoon seasons of the year 2022. Parameters include pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, calcium, magnesium, total hardness, sodium, potassium, carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, and sulphate are analyzed by analytical methods of the American public health association. As per the Bureau of Indian Standards, all the parameters are within prescribed limits, except pH, total hardness, nitrate, fluoride, and potassium, which surpass drinking aptness. Irrigation suitability is ascertained based on indices like Kelly's index, Sodium Adsorption Ratio, Sodium Percent, Magnesium Ratio, Permeability Index, and Residual Sodium Carbonate. Residual sodium carbonate indicates 1.67% in pre-monsoon permeability index, with 3.34% of samples in post-monsoon and 8.34% of samples having magnesium ratio in both seasons showing unsuitability for irrigation. The results of the United States soil laboratory staff depict low sodium and moderate to high salinity hazards. The spatial variation maps were prepared for drinking and irrigation suitability, which helped to demarcate the polluted zones in the study area. The elevated cationic constituents were found in the central to south-western parts of the study region through high salinity from water-rock interaction and mineralization. The remedial implication is also suggested to enhance the groundwater quality and provide baseline information to water researchers and local governing authorities to develop sustainable and integrated water management strategies personalized to the region's specific needs.

AB  - Social isolation deprives rodents of social interactions that are critical for normal development of brain and behavior. Several studies have indicated that postweaning isolation rearing may affect nitric oxide (NO) production. The aim of this study was to compare selected behavioral and biochemical changes related to NO production in the brain of rats reared in social isolation for different duration. At the age of 21 days, male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups reared in isolation or socially for 10 or 29 weeks. At the end of the rearing, open-field and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests were carried out. Furthermore, in several brain areas we assessed NO synthase (NOS) activity, protein expression of nNOS and iNOS isoforms and the concentration of conjugated dienes (CD), a marker of oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation. Social isolation for 10 weeks resulted in a significant decrease in PPI, which was accompanied by a decrease in NOS activity in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, an increase in iNOS in the hippocampus and an increase in CD concentration in cortex homogenate. On the other hand, a 29 week isolation had an opposite effect on NOS activity, which increased in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum in animals reared in social isolation, accompanied by a decrease in CD concentration. The decrease in NOS activity after 10 weeks of isolation might have been caused by chronic stress induced by social isolation, which has been documented in previous studies. The increased oxidative state might result in the depleted NO bioavailability, as NO reacts with superoxide radical creating peroxynitrite. After 29 weeks of isolation, this loss of NO might be compensated by the subsequent increase in NOS activity.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition in mice have been found to be adversely affected by hypomagnetic field exposure. The effect concurred with a reduction of reactive oxygen species in the absence of the geomagnetic field. A recent theoretical study suggests a mechanistic interpretation of this phenomenon in the framework of the Radical Pair Mechanism. According to this model, a flavin-superoxide radical pair, born in the singlet spin configuration, undergoes magnetic field-dependent spin dynamics such that the pair's recombination is enhanced as the applied magnetic field is reduced. This model has two ostensible weaknesses: a) the assumption of a singlet initial state is irreconcilable with known reaction pathways generating such radical pairs, and b) the model neglects the swift spin relaxation of free superoxide, which abolishes any magnetic sensitivity in geomagnetic/hypomagnetic fields. We here suggest that a model based on a radical triad and the assumption of a secondary radical scavenging reaction can, in principle, explain the phenomenon without unnatural assumptions, thus providing a coherent explanation of hypomagnetic field effects in biology.

AB  - The conformation of mRNA in the region of the human 80S ribosome decoding site was monitored using 11-mer mRNA analogues that bore nitroxide spin labels attached to the terminal nucleotide bases. Intramolecular spin-spin distances were measured by DEER/PELDOR spectroscopy in model complexes mimicking different states of the 80S ribosome during elongation and termination of translation. The measurements revealed that in all studied complexes, mRNA exists in two alternative conformations, whose ratios are different in post-translocation, pre-translocation and termination complexes. We found that the presence of a tRNA molecule at the ribosomal A site decreases the relative share of the more extended mRNA conformation, whereas the binding of eRF1 (alone or in a complex with eRF3) results in the opposite effect. In the termination complexes, the ratios of mRNA conformations are practically the same, indicating that a part of mRNA bound in the ribosome channel does not undergo significant structural alterations in the course of completion of the translation. Our results contribute to the understanding of mRNA molecular dynamics in the mammalian ribosome channel during translation. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The mammalian cranium (skull without lower jaw) is representative of mammalian diversity and is thus of particular interest to mammalian biologists across disciplines. One widely retrieved pattern accompanying mammalian cranial diversification is referred to as 'craniofacial evolutionary allometry' (CREA). This posits that adults of larger species, in a group of closely related mammals, tend to have relatively longer faces and smaller braincases. However, no process has been officially suggested to explain this pattern, there are many apparent exceptions, and its predictions potentially conflict with well-established biomechanical principles. Understanding the mechanisms behind CREA and causes for deviations from the pattern therefore has tremendous potential to explain allometry and diversification of the mammalian cranium. Here, we propose an amended framework to characterise the CREA pattern more clearly, in that 'longer faces' can arise through several kinds of evolutionary change, including elongation of the rostrum, retraction of the jaw muscles, or a more narrow or shallow skull, which all result in a generalised gracilisation of the facial skeleton with increased size. We define a standardised workflow to test for the presence of the pattern, using allometric shape predictions derived from geometric morphometrics analysis, and apply this to 22 mammalian families including marsupials, rabbits, rodents, bats, carnivores, antelopes, and whales. Our results show that increasing facial gracility with size is common, but not necessarily as ubiquitous as previously suggested. To address the mechanistic basis for this variation, we then review cranial adaptations for harder biting. These dictate that a more gracile cranium in larger species must represent a structural sacrifice in the ability to produce or withstand harder bites, relative to size. This leads us to propose that facial gracilisation in larger species is often a product of bite force allometry and phylogenetic niche conservatism, where more closely related species tend to exhibit more similar feeding ecology and biting behaviours and, therefore, absolute (size-independent) bite force requirements. Since larger species can produce the same absolute bite forces as smaller species with less effort, we propose that relaxed bite force demands can permit facial gracility in response to bone optimisation and alternative selection pressures. Thus, mammalian facial scaling represents an adaptive by-product of the shifting importance of selective pressures occurring with increased size. A reverse pattern of facial 'shortening' can accordingly also be found, and is retrieved in several cases here, where larger species incorporate novel feeding behaviours involving greater bite forces. We discuss multiple exceptions to a bite force-mediated influence on facial proportions across mammals which lead us to argue that ecomorphological specialisation of the cranium is likely to be the primary driver of facial scaling patterns, with some developmental constraints as possible secondary factors. A potential for larger species to have a wider range of cranial functions when less constrained by bite force demands might also explain why selection for larger sizes seems to be prevalent in some mammalian clades. The interplay between adaptation and constraint across size ranges thus presents an interesting consideration for a mechanistically grounded investigation of mammalian cranial allometry.

AB  - Ziziphus mucronata is a commonly used plant in South Africa for treatment of infections and diseases. The study aimed at determining the antimicrobial activities and the pharmacologically active chemical compounds present in the acetone extract of this plant. The pharmacologically active chemical compounds in this extract were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Their antibacterial activity was assayed in vitro by agar well diffusion and macrobroth dilution techniques against different bacterial isolates. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to determine the functional groups of the chemical compounds in the plant extract. The GC-MS result showed 52 chemical compounds with 29 compounds having reported pharmacological activities (while 23 compounds have not been reported), with1,1,6-trimethyl-3-methylene-2-(3,6,9,13-tetramethyl-6-ethenye-10,14-dimethylene-pentadec-4-enyl)cyclo-hexane, 2,6-(3-17-(3-Trihydroxy-6-alpha-pentyl-2,3-seco-5-alpha- androstan-3-oic acid-gamma-lactone, 2,3,4,5-tetrahexyl-dimethyl ester Hexanedioic acid, i-Propyl 9-tetradecenoate, (3-(3-22E)-Ergosta-7,22-dien-3-ol, Ergosta-4,22-dien-3-one, 3,4-dimethoxy-methylmonoacetalBenzaldehyde, 6-(acetyloxy)-4-methyl-4-Hexenoic acid and O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-alpha-D-Glucopyranoside being compounds amounting for >= 1%. The FTIR spectrograph indicated that the identified compounds are amines, amides, alkanes, aldehydes, diketones, nitrosamine, esters, alkyl amine, secondary and primary alcohols and sulfoxide groups which are present in the plant extract. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) ranged between 0.31 mg/mL and 5.5 mg/mL against the test bacterial isolates. This study shows the biological activities of Ziziphus mucronata extract depend greatly on the varied concentrations of the chemical compounds identified in the acetone extract and indicated the potential importance of this plant as a significant source of novel compounds for the treatment of diseases over synthetic antibiotics.

AB  - Carbon dot inhibitors (UTCDs, HSCDs) are successfully prepared for the first time by ultrasonic treatment and hydrothermal synthesis from Camellia oleifera shells (COS), respectively. The fluorescence properties and structures of UTCDs and HSCDs, as well as their corrosion inhibition and adsorption mechanisms on cold rolled steel (CRS) in trichloroacetic acid (Cl3CCOOH) solution, are investigated in depth. It is found that HSCDs exhibit stronger fluorescence and higher corrosion inhibition performance than UTCDs at a lower dose (300 mg L-1, 91.6 %). They possess amorphous carbon matrix, crystalline regions, surface functional groups, and active compounds. HSCDs have multiple protective mechanisms, including forming physical barriers, reducing oxides, and depleting C and O atoms in the corrosive medium. The enhancement of synthesis methods enables the mass production of HSCDs that effectively prevent corrosion.

AB  - Gelatin, widely employed in hydrogel dressings, faces limitations when used in high fluid environments, hindering effective material adhesion to wound sites and subsequently reducing treatment efficacy. The rapid degradation of conventional hydrogels often results in breakdown before complete wound healing. Thus, there is a pressing need for the development of durable adhesive wound dressings. In this study, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) was utilized as a coupling agent to create gelatin-silica hybrid (G-H) dressings through the sol-gel method. The coupling reaction established covalent bonds between gelatin and silica networks, enhancing structural stability. Dopamine (DP) was introduced to this hybrid (G-H-D) dressing to further boost adhesiveness. The efficacy of the dressings for wound management was assessed through in-vitro and in-vivo tests, along with ex-vivo bioadhesion testing on pig skin. Tensile bioadhesion tests demonstrated that the G-H-D material exhibited approximately 2.5 times greater adhesion to soft tissue in wet conditions compared to pure gelatin. Moreover, invitro and in-vivo wound healing experiments revealed a significant increase in wound healing rates. Consequently, this material shows promise as a viable option for use as a moist wound dressing.

AB  - Background: Ginsenosides have beneficial effects on several airway inflammatory disorders primarily through glucocorticosteroid-like anti-inflammatory activity. Among inflammatory cells, eosinophils play a major pathogenic role in conferring a risk of severe refractory diseases including chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). However, the role of ginsenosides in reducing eosinophilic inflammation and CRS pathogenesis is unexplored.
   Methods: We investigated the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanism of ginsenoside F1 (G-F1) in comparison with those of dexamethasone, a representative glucocorticosteroid, in a murine model of CRS. The effects of G-F1 or dexamethasone on sinonasal abnormalities and infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells were evaluated by histological analyses. The changes in inflammatory cytokine levels in sinonasal tissues, macrophages, and NK cells were assessed by qPCR, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry.
   Results: We found that G-F1 significantly attenuated eosinophilic inflammation, mast cell infiltration, epithelial hyperplasia, and mucosal thickening in the sinonasal mucosa of CRS mice. Moreover, G-F1 reduced the expression of IL-4 and IL-13, as well as hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase required for prostaglandin D-2 production. This therapeutic efficacy was associated with increased NK cell function, without suppression of macrophage inflammatory responses. In comparison, dexamethasone potently suppressed macrophage activation. NK cell depletion nullified the therapeutic effects of G-F1, but not dexamethasone, in CRS mice, supporting a causal link between G-F1 and NK cell activity.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that potentiating NK cell activity, for example with G-F1, is a promising strategy for resolving eosinophilic inflammation in CRS. (C) 2021 The Korean Society of Ginseng. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEN) is an important secondary metabolite of Fusarium fungi, exposure to which can cause reproductive disorders through its effects on ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) in many mammals, especially in pigs. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) on the ZEN-induced negative effects in porcine GCs (pGCs). The pGCs were treated with 30 mu M ZEN and/or 20 mu M C3G for 24 h; they were divided into a control (Ctrl) group, ZEN group, ZEN+C3G (Z+C) group, and a C3G group. Bioinformatics analysis was used to systematically screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the rescue process. Results showed that C3G could effectively rescue ZEN-induced apoptosis in pGCs, and notably increase cell viability and proliferation. Furthermore, 116 DEGs were identified, and the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway was the center of attention, of which five genes and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and/or Western blot (WB). As analyzed, ZEN inhibited mRNA and protein levels of integrin subunit alpha-7 (ITGA7), and promoted the expression of cell cycle inhibition kinase cyclin-D3 (CCND3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN1A). After the knock-down of ITGA7 by siRNA, the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was significantly inhibited. Meanwhile, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression decreased, and apoptosis rates and pro-apoptotic proteins increased. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that C3G exhibited significant protective effects on the ZEN-induced inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis via the ITGA7-PI3K-AKT pathway.

AB  - The perinatal period is crucial for fetal neurological development, relying on omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for essential processes. Omega-3 PUFA, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are precursors to a novel class of bioactive metabolites called specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which have been suggested to have a dual purpose in mitigating neuroinflammation while simultaneously supporting cognitive outcomes, implicating a role in offspring neurodevelopment. DHA is evidenced for its role in early brain development, but the underlying mechanism it exerts its cognitive benefits remain unclear. Pregnant sows were fed a control diet (CON; n = 6) or a diet with DHA (n = 6, 75 mg DHA/kg BW/day) from gestation through lactation. At weaning, piglets (n = 2/sow) underwent resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to assess brain functional activation. Subsequently, brain tissue from prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus were collected from piglets. Tissue DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-derived SPMs were quantified using LC-MS. Levels of SPMs were higher in the brains of piglets from DHA-fed sows, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, compared to control piglets. Additionally, a distinct association of several prefrontal SPMs with activation of the cerebellar functional network was marked in the piglet offspring. The findings highlight a potential for SPMs to function as mediators for neurodevelopmental programming, through contributing to inflammation resolution and neuronal connectivity. This work underscores the importance of maternal nutrition in shaping offspring brain health and lays the groundwork for targeted interventions leveraging the benefits of DHA and its bioactive metabolites.

AB  - Simple Summary: The long-tailed goral (Naemorhedus caudatus Milne-Edwards) is a critically endangered herbivore in South Korea. From March to June in 2010, 24 animals were found to have died due to heavy snowfall in the Wangpi Stream basin. In this study, we hypothesized that gorals that died due to snowfall are low-status individuals that lived in the sub-optimal or non-suitable areas. The results suggested that the sites where dead gorals were found were highly related to typical goral habitats. The optimal goral habitats could become uninhabitable following heavy snowfall. Most of the dead animals were pregnant females or were young, implying that they could not escape their primary habitats due to lower mobility. Thus, when there is a climate catastrophe, the optimal goral habitats should be considered for rescue and artificial feeding.
   The long-tailed goral (Naemorhedus caudatus) is a critically endangered herbivore in South Korea. Despite government efforts to recover the population through reintroduction programs, the animal remains vulnerable to heavy snowfall. From March to June 2010, 24 animals were found dead due to heavy snowfall in the Wangpi Stream basin. In this study, we hypothesized that gorals that died due to snowfall are low-status individuals that lived in the sub-optimal or non-suitable areas. Using the occurrence data from extensive field surveys from 2008 to 2010 in the Wangpi Stream and the carcass location data, we (1) defined the goral habitat characteristics and (2) compared the habitat characteristics between dead and living gorals using ensemble species distribution modeling. The results suggested that the sites where dead gorals were found were highly related to typical goral habitats. These results implied that the optimal goral habitats could become uninhabitable following heavy snowfall. Most of the dead animals were pregnant females or were young, implying that they could not escape their primary habitats due to lower mobility. Thus, when there is a climate catastrophe, the optimal goral habitats should be considered for rescue and artificial feeding.

AB  - Polymer-mediated cell surface engineering can be a powerful tool to modify the cell's biological behavior, but a simple ligation strategy must be identified. This manuscript assessed the use of transglutamination as a versatile and adaptable approach for cell surface engineering in various cellular models relevant to biomedical applications. This enzymatic approach was evaluated for its feasibility and potential for conjugating polymers to diverse cell surfaces and its biological effects. Transglutaminase-mediated ligation was successfully performed at temperatures ranging from 4 to 37 degrees C in as quickly as 30 min, while maintaining biocompatibility and preserving cell viability. This approach was successfully applied to nine different cell surfaces (including adherent cells and suspension cells) by optimizing the enzyme source (guinea pig liver vs microbial), buffer compositions, and incubation conditions. Finally, polymer-mediated cell surface engineering using transglutaminase exhibited immunocamouflage abilities for endothelial cells, T cells, and red blood cells by preventing the recognition of cell surface proteins by antibodies. Employing transglutaminase in polymer-mediated cell surface engineering is a promising approach to maximize its application in cell therapy and other biomedical applications.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures that affects over 70 million people worldwide. Although many antiepileptic drugs that block seizures are available, they have little effect on preventing and curing epilepsy, and their side effects sometimes lead to serious morbidity. Therefore, prophylactic agents with anticonvulsant properties and no adverse effects need to be identified. Recent studies on probiotic administration have reported a variety of beneficial effects on the central nervous system via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In this study, we investigated the effects of the oral administration of Bifidobacterium breve strain A1 [MCC1274] (B. breve A1) on tonic-clonic seizure in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling mouse (KD mouse) model. We found that the oral administration of B. breve A1 every other day for 15 days significantly reduced the seizure score, which gradually increased with repetitive injections of PTZ in KD mice. The administration of B. breve A1, but not saline, to KD mice significantly increased the level of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation (p-Akt) in the hippocampus; this increase was maintained for a minimum of 24 h after PTZ administration. Treatment of B. breve A1-administered KD mice with the selective inhibitor of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) Cpd22 significantly increased the seizure score and blocked the antiepileptic effect of B. breve A1. Moreover, Cpd22 blocked the B. breve A1-induced increase in hippocampal p-Akt levels. These results suggest that the ILK-induced phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 in the hippocampus might be involved in the antiepileptic effect of B. breve A1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The excitotoxic molecule, domoic acid (DA), is a marine algal toxin known to induce overt hippocampal neurotoxicity. Recent experimental and epidemiological studies suggest adverse neurological effects at exposure levels near the current regulatory limit (20 ppm, similar to 0.075-0.1mg/ke). At these levels, cognitive effects occur in the absence of acute symptoms or evidence of neuronal death.
   OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify adverse effects on the nervous system from prolonged, dietary DA exposure in adult, female Mac ea fascicularis monkeys.
   METHODS: Monkeys were orally exposed to 0, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg per day for an average of 14 months. Clinical blood counts, chemistry, and cytokine levels were analyzed in the blood. In-life magnetic resonance (MR) imaging assessed volumetric and tractography differences in and between the hippocampus and thalamus. Histology of neurons and glia in the fornix, fimbria, internal capsule, thalamus, and hippocampus was evaluated. Hippocampal RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Enrichment of gene networks for neuronal health, excitotoxicity, inflammation/glia, and myelin were assessed with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
   RESULTS: Clinical Hood counts, chemistry, and cytokine levels were not altered with DA exposure in nonhuman primates. Transcriptome analysis of the hippocampus yielded 748 differentially expressed genes (fold change >= 1.5; p <= 0.05), reflecting differences in a broad molecular profile of intermediate early genes (e.g., FOS, EGR) and genes related to myelin networks in DA animals. Between exposed and control animals, MR imaging showed comparable connectivity of the hippocampus and thalamus and histology showed no evidence of hypomyelination. Histological examination of the thalamus showed a larger microglia soma size and an extension of cell processes, but suggestions of a GEAP astrocyte response showed no indication of astrocyte hypertrophy.
   DISCUSSION: In the absence of overt hippocampal excitotoxicity, chronic exposure of Maeoccf fascicularis monkeys to environmentally relevant levels of DA suggested a subtle shift in the molecular profile of the hippocampus and the microglia phenotype in the thalamus that was possibly reflective of an adaptive response due to prolonged DA exposure.

TI  - CAF-derived exosomal WEE2-AS1 facilitates colorectal cancer progression via promoting degradation of MOB1A to inhibit the Hippo pathway
T2  - CELL DEATH & DISEASE
LA  - English
AB  - Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant stromal components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and closely involved in tumor progression. However, the precise biological functions and molecular mechanisms of CAFs in the TME have yet to be understood. Here, we demonstrate that WEE2-AS1 is highly expressed in the CAF-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Moreover, WEE2-AS1 is markedly higher in plasma sEVs of CRC patients than in healthy subjects and its high level predicts advanced pathological staging and poor survival. Then, we conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Elevated expression of WEE2-AS1 in sEVs increases CRC cell proliferation in vitro. Importantly, aberrant CAF-sEVs(WEE2-AS1) leads to tumor formation and progression in BALB/c nude mice and promotes AOM/DSS-induced tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, WEE2-AS1 functions as a modular scaffold for the MOB1A and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase praja2 complexes, leading to MOB1A degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The Hippo pathway is then inhibited and more YAP are transported into the nucleus, where they activate downstream gene transcription. Together, our data reveal that CAF-sEVs(WEE2-AS1) interacts with MOB1A, promotes degradation of MOB1A, inhibits the Hippo pathway, and facilitates the growth of CRC cells. Hence, exosomal WEE2-AS1 may be a promising therapeutic target and circulating biomarker for CRC diagnosis and prognosis.

AB  - Simple Summary Cryptosporidiosis is a global, zoonotic disease of concern. Cryptosporidium spp. can infect susceptible hosts via a main fecal-oral route due to cross-contamination of raw food and surface water from reservoir animals in the neighborhood, farms, or slaughter houses, besides some mechanical vectors, such as cockroaches and flies. Cryptosporidium parvum alleles are the most common species infecting children, and its potential reservoir is cattle. Hence, understanding the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium spp. in preweaned calves, along with the diagnosis of the predominant species and subtypes infecting them, can play a role in preventing Cryptosporidium spp. spread in the environment. In this study, Cryptosporidium parvum subtype IIaA15G2R1 was the most dominant Cryptosporidium spp. detected in preweaned calves in Kuwait. This subtype was recorded previously in Kuwaiti children suffering from diarrhea. Maintaining good personal hygiene in humans and reducing, controlling, or eliminating the causal risk factors in preweaned calves is a superb strategy for preventing and narrowing the spread of this disease. Cryptosporidium is a worldwide enteric protozoan parasite that causes gastrointestinal infection in animals, including humans. The most notable species is Cryptosporidium parvum because of its zoonotic importance; it is also the leading cause of cryptosporidiosis in preweaned calves. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection, investigate the potential risk factors, and use molecular diagnosis to identify the predominant Cryptosporidium spp. in preweaned calves in Kuwait. Of 175 preweaned calves, Cryptosporidium antigens were detected in 58 (33.1%) using rapid lateral immunochromatography assay (IC). Calves less than one month of age (OR = 4.32, p = 0.0001) and poor hygiene (OR = 2.85, p = 0.0075) were identified as significant risk factors associated with Cryptosporidium infection. Molecular identification revealed that C. parvum (62.8%) was the dominant species infecting preweaned calves in Kuwait. In contrast, C. bovis and C. andersoni were recorded at 5.7% and 2.9%, respectively. All C. parvum gp60 nucleotide sequences were subtype IIaA15G2R1. Calves could be a source of C. parvum infection due to the similarity of the subtypes recorded previously in Kuwaiti children and preweaned calves in this study. Therefore, more research is needed to understand the Cryptosporidium transmission cycle in Kuwait.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Helminthosis (worm infection) is a disease of grazing livestock, with significant economic implications. Increasing resistance to existing synthetic anthelmintics used to control helminthosis and the unwanted presence of residues of the anthelmintics reported in meat and dairy products present a serious global health challenge. These challenges have necessitated the development of novel anthelmintics that could combat drug resistance and exhibit better safety profiles. Spondias mombin L. (Anacardiaceae) is a plant that has been used traditionally as a worm expeller.
   Aim of study: The aim of the work reported herein was to isolate and characterise anthelmintic compound(s) from S. mombin leaf, establishing their bioactivity and safety profile.
   Materials and methods: Adult Haemonchus placei motility assay was used to assess anthelmintic bioactivity. Bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation of acetone extract of S. mombin leaf was carried out on a silica gel stationary phase. The structure of the compound was elucidated using spectroscopy (H-1 and C-13 NMR) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). Screening to exclude potential cytotoxicity against mammalian cells (H460, Caco-2, MC3T3-E1) was done using alamar blue (AB) and CellTitreGlo (CTG) viability reagents.
   Results: The acetone extract yielded an active fraction 8 (Ethyl acetate: methanol 90:10; anthelmintic LC50: 3.97 mg/mL), which yielded an active sub-fraction (Ethyl acetate: Methanol 95:5; anthelmintic LC50: 53.8 mu g/mL), from which active compound 1 was isolated and identified as phaeophorbide-a (LC50: 23.0 mu g/mL or 38.8 mu M). The compound was not toxic below 200 mu M but weakly cytotoxic at 200 mu M.
   Conclusions: Phaeophorbide-a (1) isolated from S. mombin leaf extract and reported in the plant for the first time in this species demonstrated anthelmintic activity. No significant toxicity to mammalian cells was observed. It therefore represents a novel anthelmintic pharmacophore as a potential lead for the development of novel anthelmintics.

AB  - CD47 is a ligand of SIRPa, an inhibitory receptor expressed by macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, and, therefore, transgenic overexpression of CD47 is considered an effective approach to inhibiting transplant rejection. However, the detrimental effect of CD47 signaling is overlooked when exploring this approach. Here, we construct a mutant CD47 by replacing the transmembrane and intracellular domains with a membrane anchor (CD47-IgV). In both human and mouse cells, CD47-IgV is efficiently expressed on the cell surface and protects against phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo but does not induce cell death or inhibit angiogenesis. Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cells expressing transgenic CD47-IgV show no detectable alterations in engraftment or differentiation. This study provides a potentially effective means of achieving transgenic CD47 expression that may help to produce gene -edited pigs for xenotransplantation and hypoimmunogenic pluripotent stem cells for regenerative medicine.

AB  - The reconstruction of large segmental defects still represents a critical issue in the orthopedic field. The use of functionalized scaffolds able to create a magnetic environment is a fascinating option to guide the onset of regenerative processes. In the present study, a porous hydroxyapatite scaffold, incorporating superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNPs), was implanted in a critical bone defect realized in sheep metatarsus. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with hyperbranched poly(epsilon-Lysine) peptides and physically complexed with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) where injected in situ to penetrate the magnetic scaffold. The scaffold was fixed with cylindrical permanent NdFeB magnets implanted proximally, and the magnetic forces generated by the magnets enabled the capture of the injected nanoparticles forming a VEGF gradient in its porosity. After 16 weeks, histomorphometric measurements were performed to quantify bone growth and bone-to-implant contact, while the mechanical properties of regenerated bone via an atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis were investigated. The results showed increased bone regeneration at the magnetized interface; this regeneration was higher in the VEGF-MNP-treated group, while the nanomechanical behavior of the tissue was similar to the pattern of the magnetic field distribution. This new approach provides insights into the ability of magnetic technologies to stimulate bone formation, improving bone/scaffold interaction.

AB  - Distant metastasis is a primary factor contributing to the low survival rate of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are increasingly recognized for their roles in cancer initiation and progression. However, the mechanisms underlying the abnormal expression and biological function of circRNA in NPC remain unclear. In this study, we identified a new circRNA, circINADL, which was upregulated in NPC tissues and positively correlated with the clinical stage of NPC. We found that the FUS RNA binding protein (FUS) promoted the transcription of circINADL in NPC cells. Elevated circINADL levels were shown to enhance NPC cells metastasis. Mechanistically, circINADL attenuated the interaction between human antigen R (HuR) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase beta-TrCP, thereby inhibited the ubiquitination and degradation of HuR. Consequently, CircINADL enhanced the stability of the HuR target gene Yes1-associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1), leading to the dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study reveals the function of circINADL in promoting NPC metastasis and highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for NPC treatment.

AB  - As an edible medicinal resource and a by-product of the sheep meat industry abomasum is a valuable origin of bioactive proteinaceous compounds. To obtain glycoprotein-rich native-sourced bioactive compounds, six different extraction methods were conducted. The extracts were compared on yield, protein and carbohydrate content, and antioxidant activity, while also analyzing their physicochemical properties. The glycoprotein-rich compound marked as M4 extracted with a yield of 22.3 +/- 1.45 % contains 24.9 +/- 0.53 % protein and 13.85 % carbohydrate. M4 showed antioxidant activity against DPPH center dot, ABTS+center dot, and center dot OH, with IC50 of 82.1 +/- 9.8 mu g/mL, 261.3 +/- 5.7 mu g/mL, and 347.3 +/- 9.8 mu g/mL, respectively. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis with glycoprotein visualization by periodic acid-Schiff staining showed glycoprotein bands in the range of 6.6 similar to 66 kDa. Antitumor activity study on HT-29 human colon cancer cells showed an EC50 327.5 +/- 39 mu g/mL and revealed no cytotoxicity on L02 human normal liver cells. Results confirm the abomasum is a reliable source of antioxidant and antitumor glycoprotein, and has the potential for scientific study and utilization.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Danhong injection (DHI) is a renowned traditional Chinese medicine often used clinically to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Studies have shown that DHI can significantly alter microRNA (miRNA) expression in the brain tissue. Therefore, exploring specific miRNAs' regulatory mechanisms during treatment with DHI is essential.
   Aim of the study: To investigate DHI's regulatory mechanism on cerebral autophagy in rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI).
   Material and methods: Rats were randomly divided into the sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, and DHI-treatment groups. The extent of brain damage was evaluated using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Hippocampal cell autophagy was observed using transmission electron microscopy. Autophagy-related proteins were analyzed using western blotting. Differentially expressed miRNAs were screened using high-throughput and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The relationship between miR-132-3p and ATG12 was confirmed using a dual-luciferase assay. The miR-132-3p mimics and inhibitors were transfected into PC12 cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro and MCAO model rats in vivo.
   Results: DHI significantly altered the miRNA expression profile in rat brain tissues. The pathological changes in the brain tissues were improved, and the autophagic hippocampal cell vehicles were significantly reduced after DHI treatment. miRNA-132-3p, one of the miRNAs with a significantly different expression, was screened. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signal pathway analysis showed that its target genes were closely related to autophagy. Western blotting revealed that the p-PI3K, p-AKT, and mTOR expression increased significantly; AMPK, ULK1, ATG12, ATG16L1, and LC3II/I were downregulated in the DHI group. Dual-luciferase reporter gene experiments showed that miRNA-132-3p could target the ATG12 3'-UTR region directly. In vitro, miRNA-132-3p had a protective effect on OGD/R-induced oxidative stress injury in PC12 cells, improving cell viability, and affecting the expression of autophagy pathway-related proteins. In vivo transfection experiments showed that miR-132-3p could regulate ATG12 expression in CIRI rats' lateral brain tissue, affecting the autophagy signaling pathway. miR-132-3p overexpression reduces CIRI-induced autophagy and protects neurons.
   Conclusion: This study showed that DHI inhibits neuronal autophagy after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. This may have resulted from miR-132-3p targeting ATG12 and regulating the autophagy signaling pathway protein expression.

AB  - A major challenge in managing depression is that antidepressant drugs take a long time to exert their therapeutic effects. For the development of faster-acting treatments, it is crucial to get an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant mode of action. Here, we used a novel mass spectrometry-based workflow to investigate how antidepressant treatment affects brain protein turnover at single-cell and subcellular resolution. We combined stable isotope metabolic labeling, quantitative Tandem Mass Spectrometry (qTMS) and Multi-isotope Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) to simultaneously quantify and image protein synthesis and turnover in hippocampi of mice treated with the antidepressant paroxetine. We identified changes in turnover of individual hippocampal proteins that reveal altered metabolism-mitochondrial processes and report on subregion-specific turnover patterns upon paroxetine treatment. This workflow can be used to investigate brain protein turnover changes in vivo upon pharmacological interventions at a resolution and precision that has not been possible with other methods to date. Our results reveal acute paroxetine effects on brain protein turnover and shed light on antidepressant mode of action.

AB  - Development of the olfactory system begins early in embryogenesis and is important for the survival of new-borns in postnatal life. Olfactory malfunction in early life disrupts development of behavioural patterns while with ageing manifests development of neurodegenerative disorders. Previously, we have shown that prenatal hypoxia in rats leads to impaired olfaction in the offspring and correlates with reduced expression of a neuropeptidase neprilysin (NEP) in the brain structures involved in processing of the olfactory stimuli. Prenatal hypoxia also resulted in an increased activity of caspases in rat brain and its inhibition restored NEP content in the brain tissue and improved rat memory. In this study, we have analysed effects of intraventricular administration of a caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO on NEP mRNA expression, the number of dendritic spines and olfactory function of rats subjected to prenatal hypoxia on E14. The data obtained demonstrated that a single injection of the inhibitor on P20 restored NEP mRNA levels and number of dendritic spines in the entorhinal and parietal cortices, hippocampus and rescued rat olfactory function in food search and odour preference tests. The data obtained suggest that caspase activation caused by prenatal hypoxia contributes to the olfactory dysfunction in developing animals and that caspase inhibition restores the olfactory deficit via upregulating NEP expression and neuronal networking. Because NEP is a major amyloid-degrading enzyme, any decrease in its expression and activity not only impairs brain functions but also predisposes to accumulation of the amyloid-beta peptide and development of neurodegeneration characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Plants activate defense machinery when infested by herbivorous insects but avoid such costs in the absence of herbivory. However, the key signaling pathway regulators underlying such flexibility and the mechanisms that insects exploit these components to disarm plant defense systems remain elusive. Here, it is reported that immune repressor 14-3-3e in rice Oryza sativa (OsGF14e) regulates immune homeostasis. Infestation with brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens decreased OsGF14e expression; however, the level of downregulation is limited both by the short duration and the specific feeding location. OsGF14e interacts with Enhanced Disease Resistance 1-like (OsEDR1l), a Raf-like MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), and repressed jasmonic acid, jasmonic acid-isoleucine, and H2O2 accumulation by enhancing OsEDR1l abundance and signaling ability. OsGF14e and OsEDR1l overexpression renders rice susceptible to BPH, whereas their knockout increases plant resistance but compromises rice growth and grain yield. Intriguingly, BPH 14-3-3e protein (Nl14) that shares high sequence homology and structural similarity with OsGF14e is identified from BPH saliva and egg-associated secretions. Mediated through BPH feeding and oviposition, Nl14, similar to OsGF14e, interacts with OsEDR1l and triggers the OsEDR1l signaling, thereby suppressing plant defenses and facilitating BPH infestation. Apparently, structural and functional mimicry makes it possible for this newly discovered BPH effector to exploit rice OsGF14e-EDR1l immune suppression module. The results reveal a novel mechanism deployed by herbivorous insects, in a manner similar to certain pathogen effectors, to evade host plant defenses by mimicking host immune regulators.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily characterized by cognitive impairments. With the intensification of population aging, AD has become a major health concern affecting the elderly. Kaixinsan, a classical traditional Chinese formula, consists of Ginseng Panax et Rhizoma, Polygalae Radix, Poria and Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, and is commonly used in clinical for treating memory decline. However, its mechanism remains unclear, which hinders its popularization and application. Method: Morris water maze (MWM) was performed to evaluate the effect of Kaixinsan on improving learning and memory ability in SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8, an AD model mice) mice. Nissl staining, TdTmediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) and western blotting (Bax and Bcl-2) were used to confirm the effect of Kaixinsan on the neuronal structure and apoptosis of SAMP8 mice. Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was performed to identify the distribution components in brain tissue after administration of Kaixinsan extraction. Based on the identified brain distribution components, the mechanism of Kaixinsan improving the cognitive function was predicted by network pharmacology. Then, using HSP60 as a mitochondrial marker and RBFOX3 as a neuronal marker, immunofluorescence co-localization was used to confirm the effect of Kaixinsan on neuronal mitochondria quantity in SAMP8 mice. Western blotting was employed to access the expression of predicted proteins (AMPK, CaMKK(3, PGC-1 alpha and HSP90) implicated in mitochondrial homeostasis. To further confirm the mechanism of Kaixinsan, SH-SY5Y cell injury model induced by amyloid (3 - protein fragment 25-35 (A(325-35) was replicated and the effect of Kaixinsan - containing serum on apoptosis in injured SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by flow cytometer. The expression level of apoptosis-associated proteins (Bax and Bcl-2) and mitochondrial homeostasis related proteins (AMPK, CaMKK(3, PGC-1 alpha and HSP90) in the presence or absence of CaMKK(3 inhibitor (STO609) were compared. Results: The results indicate that Kaixinsan can improve the cognitive function of SAMP8 mice, alleviate the hippocampal tissue lesions and inhibit neuron apoptosis. Seventeen brain distribution components of Kaixinsan were identified. Based on the brain distribution components of Kaixinsan, the results of network pharmacology suggest that Kaixinsan may regulate mitochondrial homeostasis through the CaMKK(3-AMPK-PGC-1 alpha signaling axis. In vivo experiments indicated that Kaixinsan could reverse neuronal mitochondrial loss in SAMP8 mice by upregulating CaMKK(3, AMPK, HSP90 and PGC-1 alpha to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and increase the number of neuronal mitochondria. Additionally, the in vitro experiments demonstrated that Kaixinsan can inhibit apoptosis of A(325-35 injured SH-SY5Y cells and upregulate mitochondrial homeostasis-related proteins CaMKK(3, AMPK and PGC-1 alpha. However, in addition to CaMKK(3 inhibitors, the neuroprotective effect disappeared. Conclusion: The results indicate that Kaixinsan can improve the cognitive function of SAMP8 mice by regulating CaMKK(3-AMPK-PGC-1 alpha signaling axis to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and inhibit neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder of the brain characterized by periodic and unpredictable occurrence of a transient behavior alteration due to the rhythmic, synchronous and disordered firing of brain neuron. Worldwide, approximately 50 million people currently live with epilepsy and close to 80% of people with epilepsy live in poor countries. However, it was noticed in many countries worldwide that people with epilepsy and their families suffer from stigma and discrimination and that situation exposes them to high psychological conditions such as depression and anxiety as well as more physical problems including bruising and fractures from injuries related to seizures. However, several plants-based products used for epilepsy and anxiety treatments in different system of folk medicine have exhibited a significant anti-epileptic and antianxiety activities using animal models with fewer side effects.Aim of the study: The study aimed at evaluating the antiepileptic, status post-epilepticus and anxiolytic effects of Cymbopogon giganteus decoction in rat model induced by pilocarpine.Materials and methods: A total of 90 rats were partitioned into 7 groups and treated as follow: animals of groups I (normal control) and II (considered the negative control) received distilled water (10 mL/kg); while groups III, IV, V, and VI were treated with the C. giganteus extract at 34, 85, 170 and 340 mg/kg p.o, respectively; and the group VII (considered positive control) received sodium valproate at 300 mg/kg, i.p. After 40 min posttreatment, a single dose of n-methyl-scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p) was administered to animals of groups (II, III, IV, V, VI, VII) followed by pilocarpine (360 mg/kg, i.p). Animal of group I (normal group) received distilled water. Rats were further observed for 6 h to evaluate the severity and the duration of the acute seizures of epilepsy according to Racine scale. Anxious behavior status post-epilepticus was also assessed in the same rats used above in the Elevated Plus Maze and number of entries into the open or closed arms and the time spent on either open or closed arms of the platform were recorded. Animals were also evaluated on Open Field Test and the number of rearing, crossing, grooming, defecation and center time were registered. Results: C. giganteus decoction significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the animal mortality, the number and duration of convulsions and effectively increased the latency of convulsions. The plant extract significantly (P < 0.05) improved GSH level and SOD activity, reduced MDA and CAT activity, increased GABA level and decreased GABA-t activity in hippocampus. The anxiety induced by pilocarpine was also significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited by the extract of the plant.Conclusions: Thus, C. giganteus has demonstrated its antiepileptic and anxiolytic activities in rat model and may be used as preventive measure for patients suffering from epilepsy seizures and anxiety.

AB  - The importance of Muscovy ducks in industrial poultry production is growing; however, little is known about the physiology of their reproductive cycles. This study investigated the influence of male biostimulation on female ducks before the commencement of the laying phase. A total of 30 muscovy ducks, hatched in the same year at 289-341 days of age, were divided into two groups of 15 birds each and kept with and without contact with a male duck until the day of first egg-laying-319 +/- 14 and 335 +/- 13, respectively. Before reaching egg-laying maturity, the cloacae of 29 adult ducks were subjected to daily clinical assessments. The evaluations yielded four unique categories of outcomes, determined by assessing factors such as the degree of redness and protrusion of the mucous membrane, the moisture level, and swelling of the cloacal sphincter muscle. The results of this study on biostimulation revealed that, on average, female ducks that had contact with males laid their first egg 16 days earlier, weighing 78.7 +/- 3.0 g, compared to the isolated female ducks, weighing 79.1 +/- 7.0 g. Furthermore, there was no significant difference observed in the mean initial egg weight between the groups (p = 0.841). The cloacal morphology indicated significant morphological changes 25-26 days before laying. Efforts to improve Muscovy production and develop biotechnological techniques to modify these ducks' reproductive cycle will benefit from these advancements.

AB  - While most studies assessed the acute toxicity of saxitoxin (STX), fewer studies focus on the long-term degenerative effects of STX on the central nervous system. We investigated the cognitive impairment and hippocampal damages of 6 months' exposure of low-dose STX to C57BL/6NJ mice with behavioral tests, H&E staining, and Western blots, and the possible mechanism (Ppp1C, YAP1, tau-phosphorylation) underlies the pathological changes. Furthermore, we discussed the specific localization of YAP1 in N2a cells induced by STX and the effect of inactivated Ppp1C on its downstream protein YAP1 in the Hippo signal pathway. We found STX intoxicated mice showed declined cognitive performance in both NOR test and MWM test, degenerations in the CA1 area of hippocampi. STX induced up-regulation expression of Ppp1C and YAP1 in hippocampus and N2a cells. Meanwhile, STX treatment induced cell apoptosis and Tau protein hyperphosphorylation. In addition, STX treatment promoted YAP1 cytoplasmic retention that indicates the activation of Hippo pathway, while depletion of Ppp1C inactivate YAP1 during the treatment of STX. Our results highlight the role of Ppp1C and YAP1 cytoplasmic retention in chronic low-dose STX intoxication.

AB  - Although toxicogenic moulds have been identified in municipal waste and composting facilities, only a few reports exist on the occurrence of mycotoxins in compost. Those reports mostly concern sewage sludge as a substrate, tested only a limited range of mycotoxins, and did not monitor the production of mycotoxins during the composting process. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether mycotoxins are produced during composting of selectively collected kitchen and garden waste. The study was carried out at pilot scale (550 L reactor with passive aeration). Kitchen waste (59.0% w/w), garden leaves (28.2%), and wood chips (12.8%) were used as a substrate, which was sampled every five days to determine its basic physicochemical characteristics (temperature, moisture, size-fraction content, loss on ignition) and respirometric activity (AT4). The substrate and leachate samples were also tested for the content of eight mycotoxins by HPLC-MS/MS. To screen the local compost market, commercial organic-compost samples were analysed for mycotoxin contamination. The substrate was successfully stabilized after 45 days (thermophilic peak of 62.6 degrees C, 40.4% mass reduction, 26.9% loss of organic matter, increase in the share of particles in the smallest size fraction, AT4 of 9.82 g O2/kg). Although the substrate was colonised by moulds at an early stage, only trace amounts of mycotoxins were detected in a few samples. Similarly, little or no mycotoxins were found in the commercial compost. Our results suggest a low risk of mycotoxin contamination in biowaste compost produced under appropriate technological conditions. Future research should focus on screening compost produced at smaller scales (e.g., in agricultural/residential compost piles) and on identifying factors associated with the risk of mycotoxin contamination in compost.

AB  - Despite the increased social and financial burden associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), no particular treatment for this illness has been identified. A detailed examination of prior trials conducted to treat autism revealed that nutrition intervention was commonly utilised as an additional method of therapy. Indeed, the early detection of nutritional deficiencies and metabolic problems, together with appropriate therapeutic measures, can be a cornerstone for enhancing the metabolic and behavioural abilities of individuals with autism. In this work, a propionic acid (PPA)-induced rodent model of ASD was fed Spangled emperor (Lethrinus nebuloses), Dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), and Parrot Fish (Scaridae), which are locally named Hammour, Shour, and Hareed, respectively, in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary intervention with three kinds of whole fish (Lethrinus nebuloses, Epinephelus marginatus, and Scaridae), as a rich source of & omega;-3 fatty acids, on selected biochemical markers (reduced glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), dopamine) together with a histopathological examination of the cerebellum and hippocampus as neurotoxic features of propionic acid in a rodent model of autism. Briefly, our findings give preliminary evidence in favour of employing fish as a rich supply of omega-3 fatty acids to reduce the neurotoxic effect of a PPA-induced ASD in a rat model. It may be beneficial to provide an extra marine omega-3-rich diet for improving certain metabolic autistic features related to oxidative stress, energy metabolism, and brain neurotransmitters.

AB  - Despite the wide application of cobalt nanoparticles (CoNPs), its neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, CoNPs-induced toxic effect was examined in both C57BL/6J mice and microglial BV2 cells. CoNPs-induced brain weight loss and the reduction of Nissl bodies, assuring neural damage. Moreover, both total unphosphorylated Tau and phosphorylated Tau (pTau; T231 and S262) expressions in the hippocampus and cortex were upregulated, unveiling Tau phosphorylation. Besides, the increase in inflammation-related proteins NLRP3 and IL-1 beta were found in mice brain. Corroborating that, microglial marker Iba-1 expression was also increased, suggesting microglia-involved inflammation. Among the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family proteins tested, only NOX2 was activated by CoNPs in hippocampus. Therefore, BV2 cells were employed to further investigate the role of NOX2. In BV2 cells, NOX2 expression was upregulated, corresponding to the production of ROS. Moreover, similar induction in Tau phosphorylation and inflammation-related protein expressions were observed in CoNPs-exposed BV2 cells. Treatment of apocynin, a NOX2 inhibitor, reduced ROS generation and reversed Tau phosphorylation and inflammation caused by CoNPs. Thus, CoNPs induced ROS production, Tau phosphorylation and inflammation specially via NOX2 activation.

AB  - Nutrient content fluctuation in dairy production slurry is highly influenced by the various treatment processes applied in the Chinese dairy sector. The dynamic measurement of these contents is critical for the practical and efficient field application of slurry subjected to various processes. In the study, a total of 715 slurry samples were collected from 24 intensive dairy farms in Tianjin subjected to three typical treatment processes. Descriptive statistical analysis, principal component analysis, and partial least square regression were used to investigate the variation in total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) contents, spectral characteristics, and the performance of the prediction model of the slurry under the processes, respectively. Results revealed significant differences in both TN and TP contents along with the spectra for the slurry subjected to different treatment processes. All the inter-process models showed poor performance, and the results were worse compared to the intra-process models. Among the intra-process models for TN, the optimally performing models were the Pac fusion model (R2pred = 0.82; RPD = 2.38) and the single model Pa (R2pred = 0.83; RPD = 2.31). Among the intra-process models for TP, the optimum results were seen for Pab (R2pred = 0.77; RPD = 2.07) and Pa (R2pred = 0.79; RPD = 2.30). Taking different treatment processes into consideration is essential to establish flexible models that can be adaptive for diversified scenarios. This would be helpful to improve the tracking monitor measures, efficiently guide the land application of slurry, and support the sustainable development of animal farming and environmental conversation.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a vertically transmitted reproductive disorder that is typically characterized by miscarriage, premature birth, and stillbirth in pregnant sows after infection. Such characteristics indicate that PRRSV can infect and penetrate the porcine placental barrier to infect fetus piglets. The porcine trophoblast is an important component of the placental barrier, and secretes various hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, to maintain normal pregnancy and embryonic development during pregnancy. It is conceivable that the pathogenic effects of PRRSV infection on porcine trophoblast cells may lead to reproductive failure; however, the underlying detailed mechanism of the interaction between porcine trophoblast (PTR2) cells and PRRSV is unknown. Therefore, we conducted genome-wide mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) analysis profiling in PRRSV-infected PTR2. The results showed that 672 mRNAs and 476 lncRNAs were significantly different from the control group after viral infection. Target genes of the co-expression and co-location of differential mRNAs and lncRNAs were enriched by GO (gene ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis, revealing that most of the pathways were involved in cell nutrient metabolism, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Specifically, the estrogen signaling pathway, the PI3K (PhosphoInositide-3 Kinase)-Akt (serine/threonine kinase) signaling pathway, and the insulin secretion related to embryonic development were selected for analysis. Further research found that PRRSV inhibits the expression of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1), thereby reducing estrogen-induced phosphorylation of AKT and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The reduction in the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR blocks the activation of the GPER1- PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, consequently restraining insulin secretion, impacting PTR2 cell proliferation, differentiation, and nutrient metabolism. We also found that PRRSV triggered trophoblast cell apoptosis, interrupting the integrity of the placental villus barrier. Furthermore, the interaction network diagram of lncRNA, regulating GPER1 and apoptosis-related genes, was constructed, providing a reference for enriching the functions of these lncRNA in the future. In summary, this article elucidated the differential expression of mRNA and lncRNA in trophoblast cells infected with PRRSV. This infection could inhibit the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and trigger apoptosis, providing insight into the mechanism of the vertical transmission of PRRSV and the manifestation of reproductive failure.

AB  - Very few diencephalic structures project directly to the pronounced direct projections to the hippocampus, are the nucleus reuniens (RE) of the midline thalamus and the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) of the caudal hypothalamus. As reviewed herein, RE and SuM distribute to separate sites in the hippocampus and accordingly largely exert distinct effects on the hippocampus. Specifically, RE is a major interface between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and thus mainly serves functions associated with the hippocampal formation and the mPFC, namely, working memory, executive functions, and affective behaviors, primarily fear. By comparison, the SUM projects prominently to the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, the major recipient zone of afferents from the entorhinal cortex (EC), and accordingly the SuM serves to enhance the activity of DG cells rendering them more responsive to inputs from the EC. This serves to promote the transfer, encoding, and storage of information from the EC to the DG - supporting learning and memory processes of the hippocampus. In sum, the RE and SuM exert a powerful influence on the hippocampus in the modulation/control of numerous affective, cognitive, and mnemonic functions.

AB  - Evaluation of gene co-regulation is a powerful approach for revealing regulatory associations between genes and predicting biological function, especially in genetically diverse samples. Here, we applied this strategy to identify transcripts that are co-regulated with unfolded protein response (UPR) genes in cultured fibroblasts from outbred deer mice. Our analyses showed that the transcriptome associated with RASSF1, a tumor suppressor involved in cell cycle regulation and not previously linked to UPR, is highly correlated with the transcriptome of several UPR-related genes, such as BiP/GRP78, DNAJB9, GRP94, ATF4, DNAJC3, and CHOP/DDIT3. Conversely, gene ontology analyses for genes co-regulated with RASSF1 predicted a previously unreported involvement in UPR-associated apoptosis. Bioinformatic analyses indicated the presence of ATF4-binding sites in the RASSF1 promoter, which were shown to be operational using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Reporter assays revealed that the RASSF1 promoter is responsive to ATF4, while ablation of RASSF1 mitigated the expression of the ATF4 effector BBC3 and abrogated tunicamycin-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these results implicate RASSF1 in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis downstream of ATF4. They also illustrate the power of gene coordination analysis in predicting biological functions and revealing regulatory associations between genes.

AB  - In the presence of stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity can be enhanced to promote the secretion of a large amount of glucocorticoids (GCs), which play an important role in the anabolism and catabolism of skeletal muscle. When the endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids are deficient or excessive, the body will produce stress-related resistance and change the protein metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effect of GC receptor GR alpha on protein breakdown and synthesis in porcine skeletal muscle cells (PSCs). Overexpression of GR alpha was shown to increase the expression of protein degradation-related genes, while knockdown of GR alpha decreased the expression of these genes. Additionally, we found a relationship between GR alpha and solute carrier family 2 member 4 (SLC2A4), SLC2A4 expression level increases when stress occurs, suggesting that increasing SLC2A4 expression can partially alleviate stress-induced damage, and we found that there is a combination between them via luciferase reporter assays, which still needs to be confirmed in further studies.

AB  - Background. We investigated the occluded essential vessel tributaries, both arterial and venous, occluded superior mesenteric vein and artery in rats, consequent noxious syndrome, peripherally and centrally. As therapy, we hypothesized the rapidly activated alternative bypassing pathways, arterial and venous, and the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 since it rapidly alleviated venous occlusion syndromes. Methods. Assessments were performed for 30 min (gross recording, venography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry, and oxidative stress), including portal hypertension, caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, and centrally, the superior sagittal sinus hypertension; systemic arterial and venous thrombosis, ECG disturbances, MDA-tissue increase, the multiple organs lesions, heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, including brain (swelling, and cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus lesions). Rats received BPC 157 medication (10 mu g/kg, 10 ng/kg) intraperitoneally at 1 min ligation-time. Results. BPC 157 rapidly activated collateral pathways. These collateral loops were the superior mesenteric vein-inferior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein-superior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein-pyloric vein-portal vein pathway, an alternative pathway toward inferior caval vein via the united middle colic vein and inferior mesenteric vein through the left colic vein, and the inferior anterior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior mesenteric artery. Consequently, BPC 157 counteracted the superior sagittal sinus, portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, progressing venous and arterial thrombosis peripherally and centrally, ECG disturbances attenuated. Markedly, the multiple organs lesions, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, as well as brain lesions, and oxidative stress in tissues were attenuated. Conclusions. BPC 157 therapy rapidly recovered rats, which have complete occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein and artery.

AB  - Objective The hippocampus is thought to be a vulnerable target of microwave exposure. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) acted as a fate regulator of adult rat hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs). Furthermore, we investigated if 20E attenuated high power microwave (HMP) radiation-induced learning and memory deficits. Methods Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal controls, radiation treated, and radiation+20E treated. Rats in the radiation and radiation+20E treatment groups were exposed to HPM radiation from a microwave emission system. The learning and memory abilities of the rats were assessed using the Morris water maze test. Primary adult rat hippocampal NSCs were isolated in vitro and cultured to evaluate their proliferation and differentiation. In addition, hematoxylin & eosin staining, western blotting, and immunofluorescence were used to detect changes in the rat brain and the proliferation and differentiation of the adult rat hippocampal NSCs after HPM radiation exposure. Results The results showed that 20E induced neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal NSCs from HPM radiation-exposed rats via the Wnt3a/??-catenin signaling pathway in vitro. Furthermore, 20E facilitated neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the rat brain following HPM radiation exposure. Administration of 20E attenuated learning and memory deficits in HPM radiation-exposed rats and frizzled-related protein (FRZB) reduced the 20E-induced nuclear translocation of ??-catenin, while FRZB treatment also reversed 20E-induced neuronal differentiation of NSCs in vitro. Conclusion These results suggested that 20E was a fate regulator of adult rat hippocampal NSCs, where it played a role in attenuating HPM radiation-induced learning and memory deficits.

AB  - Simple Summary The extended storage of feed ingredients has been suggested as a method to mitigate the risk of viral transmission through contaminated ingredients. To validate the approach of extended storage of complete swine feed for inactivation of swine viruses, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the ability of extended storage to inactivate the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and Senecavirus A (SVA) when stored for 58 d at 23.9 degrees C using a self-contained intermodal shipping container. Minimal detrimental impacts were observed when storing feed for 58 d on feed quality measurements including mycotoxin detection, identification and quantification of bacteria, and stability of vitamins and phytase. No infectivity was observed for PRRSV, PEDV, or SVA following 58 d storage at 23.9 degrees C with the exception of a documented biocontainment breach for PRRSV. The results indicate that the extended storage of complete swine feed can be a method to reduce risks associated with pathogen transmission through feed while having minimal effects on measures of nutritional quality.Abstract The extended storage of feed ingredients has been suggested as a method to mitigate the risk of pathogen transmission through contaminated ingredients. To validate the approach of extended storage of complete swine feed for the inactivation of swine viruses, an experiment was conducted wherein swine feed was inoculated with 10 mL of 1 x 105 TCID50/mL of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and Senecavirus A (SVA) and stored for 58 d at 23.9 degrees C. Measures of feed quality were also evaluated at the initiation and conclusion of the storage period including screening for mycotoxins, characterization of select microbiological measures, and stability of phytase and dietary vitamins. Storing feed for 58 d under either ambient or anaerobic and temperature-controlled storage conditions did not result in substantial concerns related to microbiological profiles. Upon exposure to the feed following 58 d of storage in a swine bioassay, previously confirmed naive pigs showed no signs of PEDV or SVA replication as detected by the PCR screening of oral fluids and serum antibody screening. Infection with SVA was documented in the positive control room through diagnostic testing through the State of Minnesota. For PRRSV, the positive control room demonstrated infection. For rooms consuming inoculated feed stored for 58 d, there was no evidence of PRRSV infection with the exception of unintentional aerosol transmission via a documented biocontainment breach. In summary, storing feed for 58 d at anaerobic and temperature-controlled environmental conditions of 23.9 degrees C validates that the extended storage of complete swine feed can be a method to reduce risks associated with pathogen transmission through feed while having minimal effects on measures of nutritional quality.

AB  - The World Health Organization, in response to the growing burden of fungal disease, established a process to develop a fungal priority pathogens list (FPPL). This systematic review aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and impact of invasive fungal disease due to Mucorales. PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify studies published between January 1, 2011 and February 23, 2021. Studies reporting on mortality, inpatient care, complications and sequelae, antifungal susceptibility, risk factors, preventability, annual incidence, global distribution, and emergence during the study time frames were selected. Overall, 24 studies were included. Mortality rates of up to 80% were reported. Antifungal susceptibility varied across agents and species, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations lowest for amphotericin B and posaconazole. Diabetes mellitus was a common risk factor, detected in 65%-85% of patients with mucormycosis, particularly in those with rhino-orbital disease (86.9%). Break-through infection was detected in 13.6%-100% on azole or echinocandin antifungal prophylaxis. The reported prevalence rates were variable, with some studies reporting stable rates in the USA of 0.094-0.117/10 000 discharges between 2011 and 2014, whereas others reported an increase in Iran from 16.8% to 24% between 2011 and 2015. Carefully designed global surveillance studies, linking laboratory and clinical data, are required to develop clinical breakpoints to guide antifungal therapy and determine accurate estimates of complications and sequelae, annual incidence, trends, and global distribution. These data will provide robust estimates of disease burden to refine interventions and better inform future FPPL.

AB  - Cryopreservation of ram semen is helpful for distributing proved spermatozoa for reproductive goals, but cold shock has destructive effects on fertility ability of frozen sperm cells. This study was performed to investigate the effect of the novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant "MitoQ" on ram sperm quality and fertility potential during cryopreservation process. Semen samples were diluted in extenders supplemented with 0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 nM MitoQ and then frozen according to the standard protocol. Motility and velocity characteristics, lipid peroxidation, acrosome integrity, membrane functionality, mitochondria active potential, viability, apoptosis status, DNA fragmentation, ROS concentration and reproductive performance were evaluated after thawing. In results, 10 and 100 nM MitoQ presented higher (P < 0.05) total motility, progressive motility, average path velocity, acrosome integrity, membrane functionality, mitochondria active potential and viability as well as lower (P < 0.05) lipid peroxidation, apoptosis status, DNA fragmentation and ROS concentration compared to the control group and the other treatments. Moreover, after fertility trial, 10 and 100 nM MitoQ resulted in higher (P < 0.05) pregnancy, parturition and lambing rates than control group. Therefore, MitoQ is able to preserve quality parameters and fertility potential of post-thawed spermatozoa in sheep and it could be an effective additive for supplementation of ram's semen cryopreservation medium during reproductive programs.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Long considered to fluctuate between pro- and anti-inflammatory states, it has now become evident that microglia occupy a variegated phenotypic landscape with relevance to aging and neurodegeneration. However, whether specific microglial subsets converge in or contribute to both processes that eventually affect brain function is less clear. To investigate this, we analyzed microglial heterogeneity in a tauopathy mouse model (K18-seeded P301L) and an accelerated aging model (Senescence-Accelerated Mouse-Prone 8, SAMP8) using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing. We found that widespread tau pathology in K18-seeded P301L mice caused a significant change in the number and morphology of microglia, but only a mild overrepresentation of disease-associated microglia. At the cell population-level, we observed a marked upregulation of the calprotectin-encoding genes S100a8 and S100a9. In 9-month-old SAMP8 mice, we identified a unique microglial subpopulation that showed partial similarity with the disease-associated microglia phenotype and was additionally characterized by a high expression of the same calprotectin gene set. Immunostaining for S100A8 revealed that this population was enriched in the hippocampus, correlating with the cognitive impairment observed in this model. However, incomplete colocalization between their residence and markers of neuronal loss suggests regional specificity. Importantly, S100A8-positive microglia were also retrieved in brain biopsies of human AD and tauopathy patients as well as in a biopsy of an aged individual without reported pathology. Thus, the emergence of S100A8-positive microglia portrays a conspicuous commonality between accelerated aging and tauopathy progression, which may have relevance for ensuing brain dysfunction.

AB  - The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been implicated in the pathology of substance use disorders (SUDs). In light of the brain's capability to reorganize itself in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, opioid-induced dysbiosis is likely to contribute to addictive behaviour through modulating neuroplasticity. In this study, a faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a saline-donor was performed on morphine-treated rats to evaluate the effects of gut microbiota on morphine-induced metaplasticity and addictive behaviours. Male Wistar rats were treated with subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/kg morphine sulphate every 12 h for 9 days in an effort to induce dependence. The withdrawal syndrome was precipitated by injecting naloxone (1.5 mg/kg, ip) after the final dose of morphine. The tolerance was induced by repeated morphine injections over a period of 7 days (10 mg/kg, once a day, ip). FMT was applied daily through gavage of processed faeces 1 week before and during the morphine treatment. Field potential recordings (i.e., fEPSP) were carried out to assess short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity in the CA1 area of the hippocampus following Schaffer-collateral stimulation. Animals subjected to FMT exhibited significant reductions in naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). Tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine was not affected by FMT (two-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). Following high-frequency stimulation (HFS) to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a greater fEPSP slope was observed in morphine-treated animals (unpaired t test, p < 0.05). FMT from saline-donor rats diminished morphine-induced augmented LTP (unpaired t test, p < 0.05). These results highlighted the alleviating effects of FMT from saline-donors on morphine-induced metaplasticity and dependence potentially by modulating the dysbiosis of gut microbiota.

AB  - Introduction China's Hunan Province, known for its extensive lake and marshland areas, continues to face considerable challenges in eliminating schistosomiasis. This study aims to examine the epidemiological characteristics of schistosomiasis in the province, focusing on seropositive rates across various demographic groups, spatial distribution, and identifying key associated factors to inform targeted control measures. Methods From 2020 to 2022, the number of people screened each year using the indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) was 1,053,973, 682,921, and 729,782, respectively. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend and chi-square test were employed to assess differences in seropositive rates among different times, age groups, genders, educational levels, and occupations. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted to identify clusters of seropositive rates at the village level. A multiple logistic model was used to identify associated factors and generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to obtain the parameter estimates. Results From 2020 to 2022, the seropositive rate of schistosomiasis in Hunan Province were 1.53% (95% CI: 1.51-1.55), 2.22% (95% CI: 2.19-2.26), and 2.06% (95% CI: 2.03-2.10), respectively. The seropositive rate in Hunan Province was spatially clustered in each year, with high-high clustering areas mainly distributed around the southern Dongting Lake region, the tributary areas of Dongting Lake, as well as along the Yangtze River. The seropositive rate increased with age, with individuals aged 60-69 showing the highest seropositive rate (adjusted odds ratio [OR] when compared to < 10 years old: 47.94; 95% CI: 30.04-76.52). Males had higher seropositive rate compared to females (adjusted OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.69-1.76). Compared to farmers, fishermen (adjusted OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 2.40-2.70) and business/service staff (adjusted OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.52-1.74) had higher seropositive rate. The seropositive rate decreased with increasing educational level. Individuals using tap water and sanitary toilets had lower seropositive rate compared to those who did not use (tap water: adjusted OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.64-0.68; sanitary toilets: adjusted OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93-0.97). Additionally, those who raised sheep had a higher seropositive rate compared to those who did not (adjusted OR: 4.67; 95% CI: 4.04-5.39). Conclusions Schistosomiasis remains a significant public health issue in Hunan Province, with the seropositive rate remaining clustered in certain regions and high-risk populations. Achieving schistosomiasis elimination requires sustained targeted interventions, improved sanitation infrastructure, enhanced health education, and long-term monitoring and comprehensive control measures for high-risk areas and vulnerable populations to reduce transmission risk and ensure sustainable disease elimination.

AB  - In this study, a neutral oil-incorporated liposomal system (lipo-oil-some, LOS) was designed to improve the skin absorption of ascorbic acid (Vit C), and the effects of an edge activator and neutral oil on the skin absorption of Vit C were evaluated. As components of the LOS system, sodium deoxycholate, polysorbate 80, and cholesterol were screened as edge activators, and camellia oil, tricaprylin, and grapeseed oil were employed as neutral oils. The LOS systems prepared by the ethanol injection method were spherical in shape, 130-350 nm in size, and had 4-27% Vit C loading efficiency (%). In a skin absorption study using a Franz diffusion cell mounted with porcine skin, the LOS system prepared with sodium deoxycholate (10 w/w% of phospholipid) exhibited 1.2-and 2.9-fold higher absorption than those prepared with polysorbate 80 and cholesterol, respectively. Moreover, the type of neutral oil had a marked effect on the absorption of Vit C; the liposomal system containing camellia oil provided 1.3 to 1.8 times higher flux (45.4 mu g/cm(2)center dot h) than vesicles with tricaprylin or grapeseed oil, respectively. The optimized lipid nanocarrier is expected to be a promising tool for promoting the skin absorption of Vit C and improving its dermatological functions.

AB  - Objectives The scientific research community devotes stupendous efforts to control the arguable counterbalance between the undesirable effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and post-menopausal syndrome. The recent emergence of 3(rd) generation selective estrogen receptor modulators and phytoestrogens has provided a promising alternative to HRT. Hence, we assessed the potential effects of combined Bazedoxifene and Genistein on hippocampal neuro-alterations induced by experimental ovariectomy. Methods For this purpose, we utilized forty-eight healthy sexually mature female Wistar rats assorted to control, ovariectomy (OVX), Genistein-treated ovariectomized (OVX+GEN) and Bazedoxifene and Genistein-treated ovariectomized (OVX+BZA+GEN) groups. Hippocampi samples from various groups were examined by H&E, silver stains and immunohistochemical examination for calbindin-D28k, GFAP, and BAX proteins. We also assessed hippocampal mRNA expression of ERK, CREB, BDNF and TrkB. Results Our histopathological results confirmed that combined BZA+GEN induced restoration of hippocampal neuronal architecture, significant reduction of GFAP and BAX mean area % and significant upregulation of calbindin-D28k immunoexpression. Furthermore, we observed significant upregulation of ERK, CREB, BDNF and TrkB mRNA expression in the BZA+GEN group compared to the OVX group. Conclusion Taken together, our findings have provided a comprehensive assessment of histological, immunohistochemical and cyto-molecular basis of combined Genistein and Bazedoxifene ameliorative impacts on hippocampal neuro-alterations of OVX rats via upregulation of Calbindin, CERB, BDNF, Trk-B and ERK neuronal expression.

AB  - Ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death process driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, plays an important role in tumor suppression. Although previous study showed that intracellular Merlin-Hippo signaling suppresses ferroptosis of epithelial tumor cells through the inactivation of YAP signaling, it remains elusive if the proto-oncogenic transcriptional co-activator YAP could serve as a potential biomarker to predict cancer cell response to ferroptosis-inducing therapies. In this study, we show that both total YAP staining and nuclear YAP staining were more prevalent in HCC tissues than in nontumorous regions. Compared to low-density HCC cells, high-density cells showed decreased nuclear localization of YAP and conferred significant resistance to ferroptosis. Oncogenic activation of YAP signaling by overexpression of YAP(S127A) mutant sensitized ferroptosis of HCC cells cultured in confluent density or in the 3D tumor spheroid model. Furthermore, we validated the lipoxygenase ALOXE3 as a YAP-TEAD target gene that contributed to YAP-promoted ferroptosis. Overexpression of ALOXE3 effectively increased the vulnerability of HCC cells to ferroptotic cell death. In an orthotopic mouse model of HCC, genetic activation of YAP rendered HCC cells more susceptible to ferroptosis. Finally, an overall survival assay further revealed that both a high expression of YAP and a low expression of GPX4 were correlated with increased survival of HCC patients with sorafenib treatment, which had been proven to be an inducer for ferroptosis by inhibition of the xc-amino acid antiporter. Together, this study unveils the critical role of intracellular YAP signaling in dictating ferroptotic cell death; it also suggests that pathogenic alterations of YAP signaling can serve as biomarkers to predict cancer cell responsiveness to future ferroptosis-inducing therapies.

AB  - There is mounting evidence of circadian rhythm disruption in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the cause-and-effect relationship between them is not understood. Chronic constant light exposure effectively disrupts circadian rhythm in rats. On the basis of previous publications, we hypothesized that chronic constant light exposure might contribute significantly to development of AD-like-phenotype in rats and that fluoxetine (Flx) treatment might protect the brain against it. Adult male rats were exposed to normal light-dark cycles, constant light (LL), constant dark, and LL+Flx (5 mg/kg/day, ZT5) for four months. The expression of molecular markers of circadian rhythm: Per2 transcripts; and protein expression of peroxiredoxin-1 (PRX1) and hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (PRX-SO2/3) were significantly dysregulated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of LL rats, which was prevented with concomitant fluoxetine administration. The levels of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid were dysregulated, and oxidative damage was observed in the SCN and hippocampi of LL rats. Fluoxetine treatment conferred protection against oxidative damage in LL rats. Constant light exposure also impaired rats' performance on Y-maze, Morris maze, and novel object recognition test, which was prevented with fluoxetine administration. A significant elevation in soluble A beta(1-42) levels, which strongly correlated with upregulation of Bace1 and Mgat3 transcripts was observed in the hippocampus of LL rats. Further, the expression of antiaging gene Sirt1 was downregulated, and neuronal damage indicator Prokr2 was upregulated in hippocampus. Fluoxetine rescued A beta(1-42) upregulation and AD-related genes' dysregulation. Our findings show that circadian disruption by exposure to chronic constant light may contribute to progression of AD, which can be prevented with fluoxetine treatment.

AB  - The structural plasticity of dendritic spines serves as the adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system to various stimuli. Among these stimuli, cerebral ischemia induces dynamic alterations in neuronal network activity. Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad), a regulator of dendritic spine density, is strongly induced by activating stimuli to the neurons. However, the detailed distribution of Acad in normal and ischemic adult brains remains unclear. We comprehensively described Acad expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. We found that intact adult brains expressed Acad in the piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, hippocampal CA3, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Acad expression was dramatically upregulated in the piriform cortex, olfactory area, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, amygdala, and septohippocampal nucleus 4 h after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia induced widespread neuronal activation, which was required for Acad upregulation. Our data suggested the involvement of Acad in the adaptive plasticity and remodeling of the neuronal network in the limbic and paralimbic systems.

AB  - Oxidative stress in the small intestine can lead to inflammation and barrier malfunction. The present study describes the effect of quercetin (Q), 3-o-methylquercetin (QM), and rhamnazin (R) on cell viability, paracellular permeability, production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) after challenging jejunal cells (IPEC-J2) with different types (Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O111:B4, and E. coli O127:B8) of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) applied in 10 mu g/mL concentration. The intracellular ROS level increased after all LPS treatments, which could be decreased by all tested flavonoid compounds in 50 mu M concentration. Extracellular H2O2 production significantly increased after Q and R treatment (50 mu M). S. Typhimurium LPS could significantly increase IL-6 production of enterocytes, which could be alleviated by Q, QM, and R (50 mu M) as well. Using fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FD4) tracer dye, we could demonstrate that S. Typhimurium LPS significantly increased the permeability of the cell layer. The simultaneous treatments of S. Typhimurium LPS and the flavonoid compounds showed no alteration in FD4 penetration compared to untreated cells. These results highlight that Q, QM, and R are promising substances that can be used to protect intestinal epithelial cells from the deteriorating effects of oxidative stress.

AB  - With technological advancements in 6G and Internet of Things (IoT), the incorporation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and cellular networks has become a hot research topic. At present, the proficient evo-lution of 6G networks allows the UAVs to offer cost-effective and timely solutions for real-time applications such as medicine, tracking, surveillance, etc. Energy efficiency, data collection, and route planning are crucial processes to improve the network communication. These processes are highly difficult owing to high mobility, presence of non-stationary links, dynamic topology, and energy-restricted UAVs. With this motivation, the current research paper presents a novel Energy Aware Data Collection with Routing Planning for 6G-enabled UAV communication (EADCRP-6G) technique. The goal of the proposed EADCRP-6G technique is to conduct energy-efficient cluster-based data collection and optimal route planning for 6G-enabled UAV networks. EADCRP-6G technique deploys Improved Red Deer Algorithm-based Clus-tering (IRDAC) technique to elect an optimal set of Cluster Heads (CH) and organize these clusters. Besides, Artificial Fish Swarm-based Route Planning (AFSRP) technique is applied to choose an optimum set of routes for UAV communication in 6G networks. In order to validated whether the proposed EADCRP-6G technique enhances the performance, a series of simulations was performed and the outcomes were investigated under different dimensions. The experimental results showcase that the proposed model outperformed all other existing models under different evaluation parameters.

AB  - Simple Summary There is evidence that the genetic progress in paternal rabbit lines is lower than expected due to animal- and environmental-related factors, as well as founding factors intrinsically linked to the effectiveness of the selection process. In response to this question, we conducted a trial to evaluate the response after 18 generations of selection for increased growth rate within a paternal line on rabbit performance. Our results indicate that there were no differences in the key indicators in selection for growth rate (average daily gain and feed conversion ratio) between both populations differing in the generation of selection. These findings indicate a lack of effectiveness in the genetic progress of paternal rabbit lines based on different works carried out with these same genetic lines and generations.Abstract A total of 338 weaned rabbits (from the R line, selected for post-weaning growth rate) were used to evaluate the response to 18 generations of selection for increased growth rate on rabbit performance. Animals were obtained from two vitrified populations of the R line: R19V, belonging to the 18th generation (n = 165), and R37V, belonging to the 36th generation (n = 173), were allocated in individual and collective pens (178 and 160, respectively). A fattening trial was conducted from weaning (28 d of age until 63 d of age). During the trial, the body weight (BW), daily feed intake (DFI), average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were weekly monitored. Additionally, mortality and morbidity were daily registered. On days 49 to 53, an apparent faecal digestibility trial was also performed (12 animals per generation). Our results indicate that the generation of selection for growth rate did not affect mortality and morbidity. There were no differences in the diet digestibility according to the generation of selection. Regarding performance traits, R37V animals showed higher global BW (+6.7%; p = 0.0011) than R19V animals. R37V animals showed the same BW at weaning; however, R37V animals showed higher BW values in the last three weeks compared with R19V animals. Animals from the R37V generation also showed a higher DFI from 56 to 63 d of age (+12%; p = 0.0152) than R19V animals. However, there were no differences in global ADG and FCR between generations. These results indicate that the selection for growth rate in growing rabbits has slowed down, suggesting a lack of effectiveness in the genetic progress.

AB  - Background: Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) can lead to the development of SIV encephalitis (SIVE), which is closely related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced dementia.Methods: This was done by analyzing SIV and SIVE encephalitis in infected M. mulatta hippocampus samples from two microarray data sets, identifying two groups of common differentially expressed genes and predicting associated protein interactions.Results: We found that eight genes-MX1, B2M, IFIT1, TYMP, STAT1, IFI44, ISG15, and IFI27-affected the negative regulation of biological processes, hepatitis C and Epstein-Barr viral infection, and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, which mediate the development of encephalitis after SIV infection. In particular, STAT1 played a central role in the process by regulating biopathological changes during the development of SIVE.Conclusion: These findings provide a new theoretical basis for the treatment of encephalopathy after HIV infection by targeting STAT1.

AB  - Ethnic pharmacological relevance: Due to the rapid pace of modern society, chronic insomnia has become universal phenomenon. In China, Banxia Shumi Decoction (BXSMD) has been used in treating chronic insomnia for thousands of years, but its chemical composition and action mechanism are still unknown. Aim of the study: This study aims to explore the chemical composition of BXSMD and its effects on Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and Estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) in mice with chronic sleep deprivation (CSD). Materials and methods: UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS/MS was applied in determining the chemical composition of BXSMD. After 21day sleep deprivation (SD) in platform water environment, CSD mice model was prepared. By conducting open field test, 24-h autonomic diurnal and nocturnal activity of mice in each group was detected. ELISA was employed to measure the contents of 5-HT, DA, NE, GABA, Glu, and MT. With RT-PCR, Western blot (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC), mRNA and protein expressions of ESR1 and ESR2 in the hypothalamus and hippocampus were tested. Results: BXSMD included ferulic acid, kaverol, daidzein, apigenin, berberine, adenosine, aesculin, vanillin, naringin, and glycine, which might constitute the material basis forthe improvement of chronic insomnia. With BXSMD, the total moving distance and the rest time in dark period of CSD mice were shortened, while its rest time in light period was increased. Besides, BXSMD enhanced the contents of 5-HT, GABA, and MT in CSD mice, and decreased the contents of Glu, NE, and DA. BXSMD elevated the mRNA of Esr1 and Esr2, and elevated the protein expressions of ESR1 and ESR2 in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of CSD mice. Conclusions: BXSMD contains various chemical components for sleep-wake regulation, with the mechanism of stimulating estrogen signaling pathway by regulating the expressions of ESR1 and ESR2, ultimately realizing the regulation to sleepwake disorder caused by CSD.

AB  - Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has widened the field of structure-based drug discovery by allowing for routine determination of membrane protein structures previously intractable. Despite representing one of the largest classes of therapeutic targets, most inactive-state G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have remained inaccessible for cryo-EM because their small size and membrane-embedded nature impedes projection alignment for high-resolution map reconstructions. Here we demonstrate that the same single-chain camelid antibody (nanobody) recognizing a grafted intracellular loop can be used to obtain cryo-EM structures of inactive-state GPCRs at resolutions comparable or better than those obtained by X-ray crystallography. Using this approach, we obtained structures of neurotensin 1 receptor bound to antagonist SR48692, mu-opioid receptor bound to alvimopan, apo somatostatin receptor 2 and histamine receptor 2 bound to famotidine. We expect this rapid, straightforward approach to facilitate the broad exploration of GPCR inactive states without the need for extensive engineering and crystallization.
   Cryo-EM has facilitated structural studies of membrane proteins, but inactive GPCRs have remained inaccessible due to their small size. Robertson et al. demonstrate a common nanobody-based approach to streamline the determination of such structures.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Radix Astragali, a versatile traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has a rich history dating back to "Sheng Nong's herbal classic". It has been employed in clinical practice to address various ailments, including depression. One of its primary active components, total flavonoids from Astragalus (TFA), remains unexplored in terms of its potential antidepressant properties. This study delves into the antidepressant effects of TFA using a mouse model subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Aims of the study: The study aimed to scrutinize how TFA influenced depressive behaviors, corticosterone and glutamate levels in the hippocampus, as well as myelin-related protein expression in CUMS mice. Additionally, it sought to explore the involvement of the Wnt/I3-catenin/Olig2/Sox10 signaling axis as a potential antidepressant mechanism of TFA. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to CUMS to induce depressive behaviors. TFA were orally administered at two different doses (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg). A battery of behavioral tests, biochemical analyses, immunohistochemistry, UPLC-MS/MS, real -time PCR, and Western blotting were employed to evaluate the antidepressant potential of TFA. The role of the Wnt/I3-catenin/Olig2/Sox10 signaling axis in the antidepressant mechanism of TFA was validated through MO3.13 cells. Results: TFA administration significantly alleviated depressive behaviors in CUMS mice, as evidenced by improved sucrose preference, reduced immobility in tail suspension and forced swimming tests, and increased locomotor activity in the open field test. Moreover, TFA effectively reduced hippocampal corticosterone and glutamate levels and promoted myelin formation in the hippocampus of CUMS mice. Then, TFA increased Olig2 and Sox10 expression while inhibiting the Wnt/I3-catenin pathway in the hippocampus of CUMS mice. Finally, we further confirmed the role of TFA in promoting myelin regeneration through the Wnt/I3-catenin/Olig2/Sox10 signaling axis in MO3.13 cells. Conclusions: TFA exhibited promising antidepressant effects in the CUMS mouse model, facilitated by the restoration of myelin sheaths and regulation of corticosterone, glutamate, Olig2, Sox10, and the Wnt/I3-catenin pathway. This research provides valuable insights into the potential therapeutic application of TFA in treating depression, although further investigations are required to fully elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and clinical relevance.

AB  - Influence of a new protein-peptide complex on promoting skin wound healing in male BALB/c mice was studied. Protein-peptide complex, extracted from Sus scrofa immune organs, was percutaneously administered using two methods: by lecithin gel-like liquid crystals and by liquid microemulsion. On the fifth day, wound closure in mice with a linear wound model become faster in group (less 2 days comparison to other ones), which was treated with lecithin liquid crystals carrying the protein-peptide complex. This promoting healing can be caused by resorption of bioactive high-molecular compounds the animal skin. In mice with the linear wound model, the tensile strength of the scars were respectively higher both in mice, treated using lecithin liquid crystals with protein-peptide complex, and in mice, treated using microemulsion containing protein-peptide complex, by 215.4% and 161.5% relative to the animals, which did not receive bioactive substances for wound treatment. It was associated with the regeneratory effects of tissue- and species-specific protein-peptide complexes, including a-thymosin Sus scrofa (C3VVV8_PIG, m/z 3802.8) and other factors, which were described as parts of the new extracted complex. This reveals that percutaneous administration of the complex reliably activates local regenerative processes in animals. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Disruption of receptor-mediated mitophagy contributes to neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chuanxiong-Danggui herb pair (CDHP) is classic herbal pair applied to treating neurodegenerative diseases including AD, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease. Though studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of CDHP, the underlying mechanisms by which CDHP attenuates neuronal impairment of AD remains to be elucidated. Aim of the study: The objective of this work was to investigate the anti-AD mechanism of CDHP in APP/PS1 mice. Materials and methods: Behavioral assessments were conducted on C57BL/6J and APP/PS1 mice following CDHP treatment, alongside an evaluation of neuronal morphology in the hippocampal region. In vitro, HT-22 cells were induced by A beta 25-35 before being treated with CDHP. The mechanisms of CDHP were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, Golgi staining, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis. Results: Results from the passive avoidance test and the Morris water maze (MWM) indicated that CDHP significantly mitigated cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice, accompanied by a reduction of pathological damage in the CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampus. Further testing found that a significant reduction in dendritic spines density was rescued by CDHP. Synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) were elevated in the CDHP group, while beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques deposition was significantly reduced. Simultaneously, CDHP markedly inhibited neuronal apoptosis through a decrease of the levels of Cleaved Caspase-12 and enhanced expression of Bcl-2/Bax, both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, CDHP improved mitochondrial morphology and function in the AD model by decreasing abnormal mitochondria and increasing the expression of COXIV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that clear mitophagy-autophagosomes were nearly absent in APP/PS1 mice, while the expression of p62 and LC3B were elevated following CDHP treatment. Furthermore, CDHP increased the expression of the FUNDC1 and PGAM5 in APP/PS1 mice and AD-like cell models. Conclusion: These findings suggest that CDHP mitigated cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice by enhancing mitophagy to reduce neuronal injury.

AB  - An industry listed as one of the largest globally is the cosmetic industry.In recent years, this industry has shown growing interest in the application of natural ingredients providing advanced properties to cosmetic creams such as moisturizing, antioxidant, sun-protecting and antimicrobial effects. In this context, the present study concerns the production of cosmetic emulsions containing hippophae oil obtained via the methods of extraction, hydro-distillation and maceration using sunflower oil as the carrier oil. Firstly, an IR-ATR analysis was performed showing that the oils prepared were close to those commercially obtained. Then, the stability of the emulsions was tested over a time period of four months through measuring their pH and viscosity values with positive outcomes, and their antioxidant ability was also measured using the DPPH method. The latter one showed that hippophae oil greatly improves the antioxidant capacity. Moreover, based on the fact that sea buckthorn contains carotenoids, the SPF value of the emulsions was determined. The results showed that the addition of hippophae oil to the emulsions gave higher absorption in UV-Vis, thus higher SPF values. Py-GC/MS analysis was used to identify decomposition compounds in the produced oils. Among those, valuable compounds such as Omega-6, Omega-7 and Omega-9 fatty acids and many aldehydes were found by the decomposition of the oils.

AB  - We investigate biomass-herbivore-carnivore (top predator) interactions in terms of a tritrophic dynamical systems model. The harvesting rates of the herbivores and the top predators are described by means of a sigmoidal function of the herbivores density and the top predator density, respectively. The main focus in this study is on the dynamics as a function of the natural mortality and the maximal harvesting rate of the top predators. We identify parameter regimes for which we have non-existence of equilibrium points as well as necessary conditions for the existence of such states of the modelling framework. The system does not possess any finite equilibrium states in the regime of high herbivore mortality. In the regime of a high consumption rate of the herbivores and low mortality rates of the top predator, an asymptotically stable finite equilibrium state exists. For this positive equilibrium to exist the mortality of the top predator should not exceed a certain threshold level. We also detect regimes producing coexistence of equilibrium states and their respective stability properties. In the regime of negligible harvesting of the top predator level, we observe a finite window of the natural top predator mortality rates for which oscillations in the top predator-, the herbivore- and the biomass level take place. The lower and upper bound of this window correspond to two Hopf bifurcation points. We also identify a bifurcation diagram using the top predator harvesting rate as a control variable. Using this diagram we detect several saddle node- and Hopf bifurcation points as well as regimes for which we have coexistence of interior equilibrium states, bistability and relaxation type of oscillations.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after the pandemic has emerged as a major neuropsychiatric component of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, yet the current pharmacotherapy for PTSD is limited. The use of adrenergic drugs to treat PTSD has been suggested; however, it is hindered by conflicting clinical results and a lack of mechanistic understanding of drug actions. Our studies, using both genetically modified mice and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, reveal a novel alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor (alpha(2A)AR)-spinophilin-cofilin axis in the hippocampus that is critical for regulation of contextual fear memory reconsolidation. In addition, we have found that two alpha(2) ligands, clonidine and guanfacine, exhibit differential abilities in activating this signaling axis to disrupt fear memory reconsolidation. Stimulation of alpha(2A)AR with clonidine, but not guanfacine, promotes the interaction of the actin binding protein cofilin with the receptor and with the dendritic spine scaffolding protein spinophilin to induce cofilin activation at the synapse. Spinophilin-dependent regulation of cofilin is required for clonidine-induced disruption of contextual fear memory reconsolidation. Our results inform the interpretation of differential clinical observations of these two drugs on PTSD and suggest that clonidine could provide immediate treatment for PTSD symptoms related to the current pandemic. Furthermore, our study indicates that modulation of dendritic spine morphology may represent an effective strategy for the development of new pharmacotherapies for PTSD.

AB  - We show the complex syndrome of the occluded superior sagittal sinus, brain swelling and lesions and multiple peripheral organs lesions in rat. Recovery goes centrally and peripherally, with the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, which alleviated peripheral vascular occlusion disturbances, rapidly activating alternative bypassing pathways. Assessments were gross recording, venography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry. The increased pressure in the superior sagittal sinus, portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, arterial and venous thrombosis, severe brain swelling and lesions (cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus), particular veins (azygos, superior mesenteric, inferior caval) dysfunction, heart dysfunction, lung congestion as acute respiratory distress syndrome, kidney disturbances, liver failure, and hemorrhagic lesions in gastrointestinal tract were all assessed. Rats received BPC 157 medication (10 mu g/kg, 10 ng/kg) intraperitoneally, intragastrically, or topically to the swollen brain at 1 min ligation-time, or at 15 min, 24 h and 48 h ligation-time. BPC 157 therapy rapidly attenuates the brain swelling, rapidly eliminates the increased pressure in the ligated superior sagittal sinus and the severe portal and caval hypertension and aortal hypotension, and rapidly recruits collateral vessels, centrally ((para)sagittal venous collateral circulation) and peripherally (left superior caval vein azygos vein-inferior caval vein). In conclusion, as shown by all assessments, BPC 157 acts against the permanent occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus and syndrome (i.e., brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal lesions, thrombosis), given at 1 min, 15 min, 24 h or 48 h ligation-time. BPC 157 therapy rapidly overwhelms the permanent occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus in rat.

AB  - Introduction: Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach in healthcare, outperforming traditional statistical techniques. However, to establish ML as a reliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices in data handling, and modeling design and assessment is crucial. In this work, we summarize and strictly adhere to such practices to ensure reproducible and reliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection, a challenging problem in healthcare. Additionally, we investigate the impact of modeling choices, including different data augmentation techniques and model complexity, on overall performance. Methods: We utilize Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from the ADNI corpus to address a binary classification problem using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Data processing and modeling are specifically tailored to address data scarcity and minimize computational overhead. Within this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three different data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures with varying convolutional layers counts. The augmentation strategies involve affine transformations, such as zoom, shift, and rotation, applied either concurrently or separately. Results: The combined effect of data augmentation and model complexity results in up to 10% variation in prediction accuracy. Notably, when affine transformation are applied separately, the model achieves higher accuracy, regardless the chosen architecture. Across all strategies, the model accuracy exhibits a concave behavior as the number of convolutional layers increases, peaking at an intermediate value. The best model reaches excellent performance both on the internal and additional external testing set. Discussions: Our work underscores the critical importance of adhering to rigorous experimental practices in the field of ML applied to healthcare. The results clearly demonstrate how data augmentation and model depth-often overlooked factors- can dramatically impact final performance if not thoroughly investigated. This highlights both the necessity of exploring neglected modeling aspects and the need to comprehensively report all modeling choices to ensure reproducibility and facilitate meaningful comparisons across studies.

AB  - Global rise in methamphetamine (MA) abuse during pregnancy has placed a large number of children at risk for the adverse consequences of prenatal methamphetamine exposure (PME). While behavioral and neurocognitive deficits of PME have been extensively studied in humans and adult rodents, far less is known regarding the sex- and dose-dependent effects of PME as well as the underlying mechanisms. Adolescence in nonhuman primates is also a less explored territory. In the present study, PME was inducted by oral treatment to pregnant rats on gestational days 15-19 with either low dose (0.1 mg/ml) or high dose (0.6 mg/ml) of MA. The cognitive effects of PME were then evaluated in two adolescence age-intervals: early adolescent (started on postnatal day [PND] 21) and mid-adolescent (started on PND 33), among male and female rat offspring using Morris water maze (MWM) test. Alterations in hippocampal synaptic plasticity in Schaffer collaterals-CA1 pathway were also measured in vitro. Results of behavioral test showed that PME led to serious deficits of learning and memory abilities in both male and female rat offspring. PME also depressed LTP in most of the PME subgroups. Moreover, 21-day-old rats were more sensitive to PME-induced cognitive impairment in MWM tasks, but not in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, than 33-day-old rats. No sex-dependent effects of PME were found on the cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. These findings confirmed that PME impacted negatively on cognitive performance in prepubertal male and female rats, and the impairment of hippocampal synaptic functions might partly play a significant role in these effects.

AB  - Specific salts effect is intensively studied from the prospective of modification of different physico-chemical properties of biomacromolecules. Limited knowledge of the specific salts effect on enzymes led us to address the influence of five sodium anions: sulfate, phosphate, chloride, bromide, and perchlorate, on catalytic and conformational properties of human rhinovirus-14 (HRV) 3C protease. The enzyme conformation was monitored by circular dichroism spectrum (CD) and by tyrosines fluorescence. Stability and flexibility of the enzyme have been analyzed by CD in the far-UV region, differential scanning calorimetry and molecular dynamics simulations, respectively. We showed significant influence of the anions on the enzyme properties in accordance with the Hofmeister effect. The HRV 3C protease in the presence of kosmotropic anions, in contrast with chaotropic anions, exhibits increased stability, rigidity. Correlations of stabilization effect of anions on the enzyme with their charge density and the rate constant of the enzyme with the viscosity B-coefficients of anions suggest direct interaction of the anions with HRV 3C protease. The role of stabilization and decreased fluctuation of the polypeptide chain of HRV 3C protease on its activation in the presence of kosmotropic anions is discussed within the frame of the macromolecular rate theory.

AB  - Simple Summary Our study investigates a specific genetic loss and duplication in elephants by comparing genomic data from 12 different mammalian species. We created a synteny map and phylogenetic tree of the selected species, which suggested that elephant CYP1-4 genes have undergone independent duplication, particularly in the CYP2A, CYP2C, and CYP3A genes, a unique cluster found only in elephants. In contrast, CYP2E and CYP4A might have decayed to a state of genetic dysfunction (pseudogene). These results suggest the need for further investigations into elephant genomics to evaluate the species' metabolic mechanisms. Cytochrome P450 is an important enzyme that metabolizes a variety of chemicals, including exogenous substances, such as drugs and environmental chemicals, and endogenous substances, such as steroids, fatty acids, and cholesterol. Some CYPs show interspecific differences in terms of genetic variation. As little is known about the mechanisms of elephant metabolism, we carried out a comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of CYP in elephants. Our results suggest that elephant CYP genes have undergone independent duplication, particularly in the CYP2A, CYP2C, and CYP3A genes, a unique cluster specific to elephant species. However, while CYP2E and CYP4A were conserved in other Afrotheria taxa, their decay in elephants resulted in genetic dysfunction (pseudogene). These findings outline several remarkable characteristics of elephant CYP1-4 genes and provide new insights into elephant xenobiotic metabolism. Further functional investigations are necessary to characterize elephant CYP, including expression patterns and interactions with drugs and sensitivities to other chemicals.

AB  - A range of cross-linkable latex copolymers with biobased content of up to 90% was synthesized from isobornyl methacrylate combined with acrylic monomers based on high-oleic soybean oil (HO-SBM) or camelina oil (CMM) through miniemulsion polymerization. By varying the HO-SBM and CMM macromolecular fractions, the cross-linking density of the resulting materials can be altered due to differences in the fatty acid profiles of the plant-oil-based monomers. The glass transition temperature of the synthesized copolymers correlates very well with the calculated Flory-Fox values. A higher cross-linking density of the biobased copolymer films leads to a notable growth in the modulus of the materials, while the elongation at break decreases due to more restricted macromolecular mobility. Remarkably, the copolymer with the highest unsaturation degree in the investigated range (based on CMM) shows an increase in both the modulus and elongation at break, due perhaps to extended entanglements of fatty-acid-based side chains. The adhesion performance of the cross-linked biobased copolymers was evaluated by performing shear and peel strength measurements on steel and polypropylene. Based on the obtained results, the unsaturation degree of CMM and HO-SBM (determined by plant oil composition) can be applied as a criterion for adjusting adhesion by choosing plant-oil-based monomers (or their mixtures) with different unsaturation degrees to achieve properties and performance required for specific applications.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) are both important global pathogenic viruses which have a significant impact on the swine industry. In this study, a duplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (duplex LAMP) method was developed in combination with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) for simultaneous detection of PEDV and PCV2 using specific sets of primers and probes designed based on the conserved regions of a spike gene (KF272920) and an ORF gene (EF493839), respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) values of the duplex LAMP-LFD for the detection of PEDV and PCV2 were 0.1 ng/mu L and 0.246 ng/mu L, respectively. The LOD of duplex LAMP-LFD was 10-times more sensitive than conventional PCR and RT-PCR-agarose gel-electrophoresis (PCR-AGE and RT-PCR-AGE). No cross-reaction to each other and to other pathogenic viruses that can infect pigs were observed according to analytical specificity tests. The duplex LAMP-LFD method for the simultaneous detection of PEDV and PCV2 co-infection could be completed within approximately 1.5 h, and only a simple heating block was required for isothermal amplification. The preliminary validation using 50 swine clinical samples with positive and negative PEDV and/or PCV2 revealed that the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of duplex LAMP-LFD were all 100% in comparison to conventional PCR and RT-PCR. Hence, this study suggests that duplex LAMP-LFD is a promising tool for the early detection and initial screening of PEDV and PCV2, which could be beneficial for prevention, planning, and epidemiological surveys of these diseases.

AB  - Amyloid diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are characterized by amyloid aggregates. Insulin is released from the pancreas, and it is known that insulin downstream signaling molecules are located majorly in the regions of cortex and hippocampus. Therefore, insulin plays crucial roles not only in the pancreas, but also in the brain. Recent studies have focused on the role of insulin in amyloid diseases. This review demonstrates the recent studies in which insulin affects amyloid aggregation. Specifically, molecular modeling studies provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of the effects of insulin in amyloid aggregates. Still, experimental studies are required to provide insights into the kinetics effects. This review opens new avenues for future studies on insulin molecules and amyloid aggregation.

AB  - Strong mechanical performance, appropriate adhesion capacity, and excellent biocompatibility of conductive hydrogel-based sensors are of great significance for their application. However, conventional conductive hydrogels usually exhibit insufficient mechanical strength and adhesion. In addition, they will lose flexibility and conductivity under subzero temperature and a dry environment owing to inevitable freezing and evaporation of water. In this study, a tough, flexible, self-adhesive, long-term moisturizing, and antifreezing organohydrogel was prepared, which was composed of gelatin, zwitterionic poly [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) (PSBMA), MXene nanosheets, and glycerol. Natural gelatin was incorporated to enhance mechanical performance via the entanglement of a physical cross-linked network and a PSBMA network, which was also used as a stabilizer to disperse MXene into the organohydrogel. Zwitterionic PSBMA endowed the organohydrogel with good adhesion and self-healing properties. Long-term moisturizing properties and antifreeze tolerance could be achieved owing to the synergistic water retention capacity of PSBMA and glycerol. The resulting PSBMA-gelatin-MXene-glycerol (PGMG) organohydrogel exhibited high mechanical fracture strength (0.65 MPa) and stretchability (over 1000%), excellent toughness (3.87 MJ/m(3)), strong and repeated adhesion to diverse substrates (e.g., paper, glass, silicon rubber, iron, and pig skin), good fatigue resistance (under the cyclic stretching-releasing process), and rapid recovery capacity. Moreover, the PGMG organohydrogel showed good stability under -40 degrees C. The sensor based on PGMG organohydrogel could tightly attach to the human skin and real-time-monitor the motions of joints (e.g., bending of the finger, wrist, elbow, and knee) and the change in mood such as smiling and frowning. Therefore, PGMG organohydrogels have a huge potential for wearable sensors under room temperature or extreme environments.

AB  - Diving patterns of air-breathing predators were monitored from three moored subsurface upward-looking echosounders. Complete and partial dive profiles were visible on active acoustic records as echoes that started and/or returned to the surface. Dive metrics: maximum dive depths, durations, and wiggle count were measured and angles, distances, and velocities, were calculated at each site. Dive shapes 'U', 'V' and 'W' were derived using the number of wiggles and the percentage of dive bottom time. Dive profiles were classified into four types with type 1 dives being short in total duration and distance, low velocities, small angles, shallow, and linked to 'U' and 'W' shapes. Type 2 dives were short in distance, had low velocities, shallow depths, and were linked to 'V' dives. Dive types 3 and 4 had higher velocities, larger angles, longer total durations, and were deeper than types 1 and 2. Observed dive types could correspond to travelling, exploring, and foraging predator behaviors. Significant predator-prey overlaps occurred with predator dive profile counts correlated with krill aggregation thickness, density, and depth. This study demonstrates the utility of using stationary active acoustics to identify predator dive profiles with a simultaneous characterization of the potential prey field.

AB  - Balantidium coli (B. coli) is a prevalent intestinal parasite in monkeys, significantly impacting their health. Previous studies have demonstrated that B. coli infection in pigs leads to severe dysregulation of the gut microbiota. However, there has been no report on the alterations in fecal microbiota and metabolites in rhesus monkeys infected with B. coli. In order to investigate the differences in gut microbiota and metabolites between healthy rhesus monkeys and those infected with B. coli, we conducted gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of fecal samples from 6 healthy rhesus monkeys and 5 rhesus monkeys infected with B. coli. The results revealed significant differences in the composition of gut microbiota between rhesus monkeys infected with B. coli and healthy ones (p < 0.01). The abundance of Campylobacterota was significantly increased (p < 0.01), while the abundance of Bacteroidota was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Prevotella 9 was the dominant genus in both groups, showing a significant increase in the infected group (p < 0.05). At the species level, Brachyspira hampsonii was significantly increased in the infected group (p < 0.01), whereas Prevotella copri, which was the dominant species in both groups, showed a significant decrease in the infected group (p < 0.05). Metabolomics studies indicated a significant decrease in levels of metabolites such as dihydrolipoamide, 9(Z),11(E)-Conjugated Linoleic Acid, and 8,9-DiHETrE within fecal samples from rhesus monkeys infected with B. coli (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis of the microbiome and metabolome suggested a close relationship between differential microbiota and metabolites. In conclusion, this study suggests that the colonization of B. coli is associated with dysbiosis of the monkey gut microbiota. This study provides a new insight that using intestinal microbes instead of antibiotics to treat balantidiosis can also serve as a reference for further research on the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolomics in host infections by other protozoa.

AB  - Background Osteosarcomas (OS) are frequent primary sarcomas of the bone in children and adolescents. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can affect the progression of many cancers by their sense transcripts. The present study was designed to probe the role of ZMIZ1-AS1 and the downstream pathway in OS progression.
   Methods Cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were detected by colony formation, transwell, and wound healing assays. The binding of SOX2 or MYC protein with ZMIZ1-AS1 promoter was explored by ChIP assay and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Interaction between PTBP1 protein and ZMIZ1-AS1 (or ZMIZ1 mRNA) was detected by RIP assay.
   Results SOX2 and MYC are the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway and transcriptionally activated ZMIZ1-AS1. Compared to the controls, OS tissues and cells contained higher ZMIZ1-AS1 expression. Silencing of ZMIZ1-AS1 repressed OS cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our findings further showed that ZMIZ1-AS1 recruits RNA-binding protein PTBP1 to stabilize ZMIZ1 mRNA. PTBP1 or ZMIZ1 overexpression rescues the suppressive effects of silenced ZMIZ1-AS1 on OS cellular processes. Importantly, ZMIZ1-AS1 promotes OS growth in vivo by stabilization of ZMIZ1.
   Conclusions Long non-coding RNA ZMIZ1-AS1 promotes OS progression by stabilization of ZMIZ1.

AB  - Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) provides unique opportunities to image cellular components at high resolution in their native state and environment. While many different cell types were investigated by cryo-ET, here we review application to neurons. We show that neurons are a versatile system that can be used to investigate general cellular components such as the cytoskeleton and membrane-bound organelles, in addition to neuron specific processes such as synaptic transmission. Furthermore, the synapse provides a rich environment for the development of cryo-ET image processing tools suitable to elucidate the functional and spatial organization of compositionally and morphologically heterogeneous macromolecular complexes involved in biochemical signaling cascades, within their native, crowded cellular environments.

AB  - Our previous studies have identified phoenixin-14 (PNX-14) and its receptor GPR173 in the porcine corpus luteum (CL) during the estrous cycle and their role in the endocrine function. This study explored PNX-14's impact on luteal angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis. Luteal cells were cultured with PNX-14 at doses 1-1000 nM for 24-72 h. Then, the transcript level and secretion of angiogenic factors (VEGFA, bFGF2, ANG-1) and protein expression of their receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2) were analysed. Cell proliferation was assessed using the alamarBlue assay, whereas DNA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 activity through Cell Death Detection ELISA and CaspaseGlo 3/7 assay, respectively. We also examined mRNA and protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclins, and apoptotic factors. Using pharmacological inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase B (AKT), 5 ' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and silencing of GPR173 by siRNA we checked their involvement in PNX-14 action in CL. The results showed that PNX-14 increased levels of bFGF2 and ANG-1, and protein expression of VEGFR2, FGFR1, and TIE2, while it decreased FGFR2. It enhanced luteal cell proliferation and PCNA expression, with variable effects on transcript and protein levels of cyclins. Moreover, PNX-14 decreased DNA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 activity, expression of caspases 3, 8, 9, and BAX, and increased BCL2. Additionally, GPR173 receptor and ERK1/2, AKT, and AMPK are involved in PNX-14 action on luteal function. In conclusion, PNX-14 acts as a luteotropic factor in the porcine CL by promoting angiogenesis, proliferation, and protection against apoptosis.

AB  - Herbivorous insects utilize intricate olfactory mechanisms to locate food plants. The chemical communication of insect-plant in primitive lineage offers insights into evolutionary milestones of divergent olfactory modalities. Here, we focus on a system endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to unravel the chemical and molecular basis of food preference in ancestral Lepidoptera. We conducted volatile profiling, neural electrophysiology, and chemotaxis assays with a panel of host plant organs to identify attractants for Himalaya ghost moth Thitarodes xiaojinensis larvae, the primitive host of medicinal Ophiocordyceps sinensis fungus. Using a DREAM approach based on odorant induced transcriptomes and subsequent deorphanization tests, we elucidated the odorant receptors responsible for coding bioactive volatiles. Contrary to allocation signals in most plant-feeding insects, T. xiaojinensis larvae utilize tricosane from the bulbil as the main attractant for locating native host plant. We deorphanized a TxiaOR17b, an indispensable odorant receptor resulting from tandem duplication of OR17, for transducing olfactory signals in response to tricosane. The discovery of this ligand-receptor pair suggests a survival strategy based on food location via olfaction in ancestral Lepidoptera, which synchronizes both plant asexual reproduction and peak hatch periods of insect larvae.

AB  - The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is targeted by axons from serotonin raphe neurons, where the neurotransmitter modulates adult neurogenesis and antidepressant action, and mediates the neurogenic effect of running. Whether running-induced cell proliferation is directly mediated by serotonin remains unknown. Here, we took advantage of Tph2-ChR2-YFP transgenic mice in which the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is specifically expressed in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2)-expressing neurons. We selectively activated serotonin neurons via optogenetics and determined the effect on cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus. Our data reveal a significant reduction in the number of newly generated cells upon overnight raphe stimulation. The decrease in cell proliferation was absent when serotonin neurons were light-activated for six consecutive nights. However, we observed an interhemispheric difference in BrdU-positive cell numbers. We conclude that acute network dynamics occur between serotonin raphe neurons and the hippocamps, directly affecting precursor cell proliferation.

AB  - The extracts from fruits of Chaenomeles japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. ex Spach (CJE), Cornus mas L. (CME), and Hippopha & iocy; rhamnoides L. (HRE) are known inhibitors of a variety of eukaryotic hydrolases, engaged in the digestion of fats and polysaccharides. However, there are no data on their potential interaction with the bacterial hydrolases participating in the replication of microbial nucleic acids. This analysis predicted the interaction of the most abundant constituents of HRE, CJE, and CME with the bacterial nucleases. The analysis covered the molecular docking of isorhamnetin glycosides, procyanidins C1 and B2, epicatechin, loganic acid, and cornuside with bacterial enzymes (Escherichia coli endonuclease 1, colicin E9, and ribonuclease H; or Staphylococcus aureus thermonuclease and nuclease SbcCD). The suggested complexes have been subjected to molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) calculations. The second aim was the in vitro evaluation of the influence of the CJE, HRE, and CME on the metabolic activity of bacterial biofilm of selected microbial strains, as well as fibroblasts (L929) and adenocarcinoma intestinal cells (Caco-2) toxicity. Among all extracts, CME showed the most relevant effect on the survival of planktonic cells and biofilm of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As a result of in silico studies, most virtual hits were predicted to inhibit the proteins under investigation, except for procyanidin C1.

AB  - Transparency of the human cornea is responsible for clear vision, which is maintained by a monolayer of non-proliferative human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnCs). Dysfunction of these cells can result in irreversible corneal blindness. It is important to identify key factors that limit the proliferation of HCEnCs and thus attempt to reverse them. Extracellular vesicles contain cargo which includes microRNAs (miRNAs) that can modulate a cellular function. In non small cell lung cancer, expression of miR-195-5p has been shown to inhibit proliferation; therefore, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of miR-195-5p in inducing the proliferation of HCEnCs. Human corneal endothelial cell line (HCEC-12) and primary HCEnCs were cultured with miR-195-5p scramble, mimic or inhibitor. Corneal tissues from human cadaveric and FECD donors, and from pigs, mice and rabbits, were used for RT-PCR. miR-195-5p showed an abundance value of 11,363.31 a.u. When normalized against HCEnCs from cadaveric donors, FECD tissues showed a significant upregulation of miR-195-5p (p < 0.05) but was significantly downregulated in pig (p < 0.001), mouse (p < 0.01) and rabbit (p < 0.001) CEnCs, which have known proliferative capacity. Proliferation, cell doubling, and wound healing rates were significantly higher when miR-195-5p was inhibited. Inhibiting miR-195-5p showed a significant improvement in viability (HEC staining), decreased cell apoptosis (TdT-dNTP staining) and expression of ZO-1, NA(+)/K+-ATPase and Ki-67 markers. Expression of miR-195-5p is found in HCEnCs and FECD cells, which restricts the proliferation of these cells. However, inhibiting miR-195-5p can induce the proliferation of HCEnCs, which opens exciting directions for future research in prolonging FECD pathogenesis by increasing the proliferative capacity of HCEnCs using anti-miR therapy in vivo.

AB  - Low temperature is an important factor that affects the growth and reproduction of tea plants [Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze]. In this study, Yunwu Tribute Tea cutting seedlings [Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze var. niaowangensis Q.H. Chen] were subjected to different low-temperature treatments in Guizhou Province, China, and the changes in physiological indicators of the leaves were measured to investigate the physiological response and cold tolerance of this variety. Under cold stress, the peak of antioxidant enzyme activity appeared on the third day of treatment at 1 degrees C, indicating that Yunwu Tribute Tea could improve the resistance to cold stress through an increase in enzyme activity within a low-temperature range. However, after 3 days treatment at 1 degrees C, the tolerance of plant had been exceeded; the ability to resist cold stress disappeared, and enzyme activity decreased. When the temperature or duration of stress exceeded the maximum tolerance of the plant, the synthesis of soluble substances decreased in concert with their protective effects. Under cold conditions, Yunwu Tribute Tea could increase the production of abscisic acid growth inhibitors and reduce those of indoleacetic acid, gibberellin, and other growth promoting substances to manage cold stress by regulating the balance of growth regulators in the plant. Five differential genes were screened as candidate genes from the Yunwu Tribute Tea cold stress transcriptome (DW, 1 degrees C) for fluorescence quantitative analysis. The results showed that the changes in levels of expression of these genes under continuous cold stress significantly positively correlated with the corresponding physiological indicators. Nevertheless, the levels of expression of the Yunwu Tribute Tea polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene and the gibberellin 3 beta-dioxygenase gene (G3O2) were reversely inhibited under cold stress. The result was consistent with the corresponding physiological indicators, and it provides a basis for the study of cold resistance mechanisms in tea plants.

AB  - The cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin (CDH2) is a membrane component of adherens junctions which regulates tissue morphogenesis and architecture. In the follicles of mammalian ovaries, N-cadherin adherens junctions are present between granulosa cells, cumulus cells and at the interface of cumulus cell transzonal projections and the oocyte. We demonstrate a mechanosensory role of N-cadherin integrating tissue structure and hormonal regulation of follicular morphogenic events including expansion of the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) matrix, oocyte maturation and ovulation. Two small molecule N-cadherin antagonists inhibited COC maturation in vitro. Transcriptome profiling revealed that targets of beta-catenin and YAP1 pathways were dysregulated by N-cadherin antagonists. In vivo, N-cadherin antagonist significantly reduced ovulation in mice compared to controls (11 vs 26 oocytes/ovary; p=5.8x10(-6)). Ovarian follicles exhibited structural dysgenesis with granulosa and cumulus cell layers becoming disorganised and the connection between cumulus cells and the oocyte disrupted and the transcriptome again indicated altered mechanical sensing causing dysregulation of the Hippo/YAP and beta-catenin pathways and ECM reorganization. Granulosa specific N-cadherin depletion in Cdh2(Fl/FL);Amhr2-Cre also showed significantly altered mechanosensitive gene expression and reduced ovulation. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for N-cadherin in ovarian follicular development and ovulation, and the potential to inhibit ovulation through targeting this signalling mechanism.

AB  - With their hundreds of millions of visitors worldwide, zoos are important environmental education institutions in our society. Although not every visitor participates in a conservation education program, zoos offer opportunities for all visitors to learn about animals, the environment, and species conservation through signage and informational panels. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether the location of giraffe-themed Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis exhibition panels has an impact on how intensely visitors engage with the signs. In addition, it was investigated which thematic complexes on the signage are looked at longer by the visitors and whether there are group differences in the viewing of the exhibition. The results showed that significantly more people looked at the exhibition panels when they were placed directly in front of the giraffe house, which can potentially be explained by the situational interest triggered. The signs with general information about giraffe biology were viewed significantly longer compared to the signs with information about the habitat or species conservation. It was also found that people who viewed more signs also tended to look at them for significantly longer periods of time. Individuals with children generally had a shorter viewing time. These findings suggest that strategic placement of signage and consideration of content type can enhance visitor engagement. However, further research is needed to explore these factors in different contexts and to develop best practices for educational signage in zoos and similar settings.

AB  - CRISP2 is enriched in the male reproductive system of mammals and plays roles in spermatogenesis, sperm motility, and fertilization. Although extensively investigated in rodents and boars, human CRISP2 (hCRISP2) remains poorly studied, particularly concerning its localization in testicular and epididymal tissues and its molecular features. In this study, we used immunofluorescence to determine the localization of hCRISP2 in testis, epididymis, and ejaculated sperm. While no expression was observed in the epididymal epithelium, hCRISP2 was detected at different stages during spermatogenesis. Specifically, hCRISP2 was found in the nucleus of primary spermatocytes and of both round and early elongated spermatids. In elongated spermatids, it was additionally observed in the cytoplasm, the flagellum, and the equatorial segment of the acrosome (EqS). The presence of aggregated material with hCRISP2 immunoreactivity in the apical pole of Sertoli cells suggests that most of the hCRISP2 involved in spermatogenesis is phagocytized by these cells during spermiation. In ejaculated sperm, hCRISP2 was found in the cytoplasmic droplet, flagellum, and EqS, consistent with its described roles in sperm motility and gamete fusion. Native and denaturing electrophoresis combined with western blot analyses depicted the ability of hCRISP2 to form stable high molecular weight complexes, and mass spectrometry revealed that these complexes likely consist exclusively of hCRISP2. Furthermore, we showed that hCRISP2 undergoes only limited post-translational modifications. These findings shed light into the dynamic localization of hCRISP2 throughout spermatogenesis and in ejaculated sperm, as well as its molecular features, enhancing our understanding of its functional roles and relevance for male fertility.
   Sentence: hCRISP2 is present at different stages of spermatogenesis, absent in epididymal epithelium, and, in mature sperm, localizes in the cytoplasmic droplet, flagellum, and EqS, forming stable homo-oligomers with minimal post-translational modifications.

AB  - Endocannabinoids play a role in adaptation to stress and regulate the release of glucocorticoids in stressed and unstressed conditions. We recently found that basal corticosterone pulsatility may significantly impact the vulnerability for developing post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD), suggesting that the endocannabinoid system may contribute to its development. To examine this, we exposed rats to predator scent stress (PSS). Behavioral reactions were recorded seven days post-PSS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from anesthetized rats shortly after PSS exposure to determine the levels of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA). To correlate between endocannabinoids and corticosterone levels, rats were placed in metabolic cages for urine collection. To assess the levels of endocannabinoids in specific brain regions, rats' brains were harvested one day after behavioral analysis for staining and fluorescence quantification. Moreover, 2-AG was elevated in the CSF of PTSD-phenotype rats as compared with other groups and was inversely correlated with corticosterone urinary secretion. Eight days post-PSS exposure, hippocampal and hypothalamic 2-AG levels and hippocampal AEA levels were significantly more reduced in the PTSD-phenotype group compared to other groups. We posit that maladaptation to stress, which is propagated by an abnormal activation of endocannabinoids, mediates the subsequent stress-induced behavioral disruption, which, later, reduces neuronal the expression of endocannabinoids, contributing to PTSD symptomology.

AB  - A reduction in melatonin function contributes to the acceleration of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and understanding the molecular processes of melatonin-related signaling is critical for intervention in AD progression. Recently, we synthesized a series of melatonin analogues with donepezil fragments and tested them in silico and in vitro. In this study, one of the most potent compounds, 3c, was evaluated in a rat model of pinealectomy (pin) followed by icvA beta(1-42) infusion. Melatonin was used as the reference drug. Treatment with melatonin and 3c (10 mg/kg, i.p. for 14 days) had a beneficial effect on memory decline and the concomitant increase in hippocampal A beta(1-42) and pTAU in the pin+icvA beta(1-42) rats. Melatonin supplementation facilitated non-amyloidogenic signaling via non-receptor (histone deacetylase sirtuin 1, SIRT1) and receptor-related signaling (MT/ERK/CREB). The hybrid 3c analogue up-regulated the MT1A and MT2B receptors, pERK and pCREB. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that melatonin-related analogues may become a promising drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease therapy.

AB  - Systemic inflammation is associated with intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation by imbalancing the gut-brain axis. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. This study explored LIPUS's neuroprotective effects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation through transabdominal stimulation. Male C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (0.75 mg/kg) daily for seven days, and abdominal LIPUS was applied to the abdominal area for 15 min/day during the last six days. One day after the last LIPUS treatment, biological samples were collected for microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis. Histological examination showed that LPS administration leads to tissue damage in the colon and brain. Transabdominal LIPUS stimulation attenuated colonic damage, reducing histological score, colonic muscle thickness, and villi shortening. Furthermore, abdominal LIPUS reduced hippocampal microglial activation (labeled by ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 [Iba-1]) and neuronal cell loss (labeled by microtubule-associated protein 2 [MAP2]). Moreover, abdominal LIPUS attenuated the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus and cortex. Altogether, our results indicate that abdominal LIPUS stimulation attenuates LPS-induced colonic inflammation and neuroinflammation. These findings provide new insights into the treatment strategy for neuroinflammation-related brain disorders and may facilitate method development through the gut-brain axis pathway.

AB  - Dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) is adapted to survive the harsh environments. It has some key adaptation peculiarities in various organs. In this study, we aimed to map the distribution pattern of unique regulatory devices along the course of the pulmonary vessels using histological and histochemical analyses. Arteries with variable wall thickness and spirally oriented course were recorded within the adventitia of the main pulmonary artery. Throttle arteries and glomus bolsters were found within the wall of the lobar pulmonary artery. The bronchial artery was located within the wall of all bronchi reaching the subsegmental branches and it had elastic longitudinal muscular intima bolsters. Arteries with double muscular media were demonstrated in the pulmonary pleura. These bolsters are suggested to play a complicated role that allows for hemodynamic, humeral, and thermoregulatory activities. The lumen of some subsegmental pulmonary veins revealed occasional constrictions arising from the corresponding muscular pad-like protrusions of the tunica media. These veins may possess occlusive or constrictive mechanisms and their obstruction induces engorgement of the associated capillary bed in addition to restricting venous outflow. Collectively, these data strongly recommend a crucial role for the special regulatory devices in preserving the camel pulmonary function in the harsh desert environment.

AB  - Oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) is a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP), whose mutations are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). OPHN1 is enriched at the synapse in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments, where it regulates the RhoA/ROCK/MLC2 signaling pathway, playing a critical role in cytoskeleton remodeling and vesicle recycling. Ophn1 knockout (KO) adult mice display some behavioral deficits in multiple tasks, reminiscent of some symptoms in the human pathology. We also previously reported a reduction in dendritic spine density in the adult hippocampus of KO mice. Yet the nature of the deficits occurring in these mice during postnatal development remains elusive. Here, we show that juvenile KO mice present normal basal synaptic transmission, but altered synaptic plasticity, with a selective impairment in long-term depression, but no change in long-term potentiation. This contrasts with the functional deficits that these mice display at the adult stage, as we found that both basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation are reduced at later stages, due to presynaptic alterations. In addition, the number of excitatory synapses in adult is increased, suggesting some unsuccessful compensation. Altogether, these results suggest that OPHN1 function at synapses is differentially affected during maturation of the brain, which provides some therapeutic opportunities for early intervention.

AB  - Neural injuries disrupt the normal functions of the nervous system, whose complexities limit current treatment options. Because of their enhanced therapeutic effects, neurospheres have the potential to advance the field of regenerative medicine and neural tissue engineering. Methodological steps can pose challenges for implementing neurosphere assemblies; for example, conventional static cultures hinder yield and throughput, while the presence of the necrotic core, time-consuming methodology, and high variability can slow their progression to clinical application. Here we demonstrate the optimization of primary neural cell-derived neurospheres, developed using a high-throughput, stress-free, 3D bioreactor. This process provides a necessary baseline for future studies that could develop co-cultured assemblies of stem cells combined with endothelial cells, and/or biomaterials and nanomaterials for clinical therapeutic use. Neurosphere size and neurite spreading were evaluated under various conditions using Image J software. Primary neural cells obtained from the hippocampi of three-day-old rat pups, when incubated for 24 h in a reactor coated with 2% Pluronic and seeded on Poly-D-Lysine-coated plates establish neurospheres suitable for therapeutic use within five days. Most notably, neurospheres maintained high cell viability of & GE;84% and expressed the neural marker MAP2, neural marker & beta;-Tubulin III, and glial marker GFAP at all time points when evaluated over seven days. Establishing these factors reduces the variability in developing neurospheres, while increasing the ease and output of the culture process and maintaining viable cellular constructs.

AB  - The activation of the endocannabinoid system controls the release of many neurotransmitters involved in the brain reward pathways, including glutamate. Both endocannabinoid and glutamate systems are crucial for alcohol relapse. In the present study, we hypothesize that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors regulate the ability of a priming dose of WIN 55,212-2 to cross-reinstate ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). To test this hypothesis, ethanol-induced (1.0 g/kg, 10% w/v, i.p.) CPP (unbiased method) was established using male adult Wistar rats. After CPP extinction, one group of animals received WIN 55,212-2 (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, i.p.), the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) agonist, or ethanol, and the other group received memantine (3.0 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.), the NMDA antagonist and WIN 55,212-2 on the reinstatement day. Our results showed that a priming injection of WIN 55,212-2 (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) reinstated (cross-reinstated) ethanol-induced CPP with similar efficacy to ethanol. Memantine (3.0 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment blocked this WIN 55,212-2 effect. Furthermore, our experiments indicated that ethanol withdrawal (7 days withdrawal after 10 days ethanol administration) down-regulated the CNR1 (encoding CB1), GRIN1/2A (encoding GluN1 and GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor) genes expression in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum, but up-regulated these in the hippocampus, confirming the involvement of these receptors in ethanol rewarding effects. Thus, our results show that the endocannabinoid system is involved in the motivational properties of ethanol, and glutamate may control cannabinoid induced relapse into ethanol seeking behavior.

AB  - Maternal n-3 PUFA (omega-3) deficiency can affect brain development in utero and postnatally. Despite the evidence, the impacts of n-3 PUFA deficiency on the expression of neurogenesis genes in the postnatal hippocampus remained elusive. Since postnatal brain development requires PUFAs via breast milk, we examined the fatty acid composition of breast milk and hippocampal expression of neurogenesis genes in n-3 PUFA deficient 21d mice. In addition, the expression of fatty acid desaturases, elongases, free fatty acids signaling receptors, insulin and leptin, and glucose transporters were measured. Among the genes involved in neurogenesis, the expression of brain-specific tenascin-R (TNR) was downregulated to a greater extent (-31 fold), followed by adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR), dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression in the n-3 PUFA deficient hippocampus. Increasing dietary LA to ALA (50:1) elevated the ARA to DHA ratio by -8 fold in the n-3 PUFA deficient breast milk, with an overall increase of total n-6/n-3 PUFAs by -15:1 (p<0.05) compared to n-3 PUFA sufficient (LA to ALA: 2:1) diet. The n-3 PUFA deficient mice exhibited upregulation of FADS1, FADS2, ELOVL2, ELOVL5, ELOVL6, GPR40, GPR120, LEPR, IGF1 and downregulation of GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 mRNA expression in hippocampus (p<0.05). Maternal n-3 PUFA deficiency affects the hippocampal expression of key neurogenesis genes in the offspring with concomitant expression of desaturase and elongase genes, suggesting the importance of dietary n-3 PUFA for neurodevelopment.

AB  - Vietnam has diverse and long-established tea plantations but scientific data on the characteristics of Vietnamese teas are still limited. Chemical and biological properties including total polyphenol and flavonoid contents (TPCs and TFCs), antioxidant activities (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC), as well as the contents of caffeine, gallic acid, and major catechins, were evaluated for 28 Vietnamese teas from North and South Vietnam. Higher values of TPCs and TFCs were found for green (non-oxidised) and raw Pu'erh (low-oxidised) teas from wild/ancient tea trees in North Vietnam and green teas from cultivated trees in South Vietnam, as compared to oolong teas (partly oxidised) from South Vietnam and black teas (fully oxidised) from North Vietnam. The caffeine, gallic acid, and major catechin contents depended on the processing, geographical origin, and the tea variety. Several good Pearson's correlations were found (r(2) > 0.9) between TPCs, TFCs, the four antioxidant capacities, and the content of major catechins such as (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate. Results from principal component analysis showed good discriminations with cumulative variances of the first two principal components varying from 85.3% to 93.7% among non-/low-oxidised and partly/fully oxidised teas, and with respect to the tea origin.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the reproductive biology of a species is critical for the development of biobanks and assisted reproductive techniques to aid in the genetic management of isolated populations. Male southern stingray (Hypanus americanus) reproductive examinations were opportunistically conducted in March and June. Semen and plasma were collected to characterize ejaculate parameters and to investigate the effect of plasma total testosterone on semen quality. Semen was used for preliminary sperm cryopreservation studies. Changes in semen quality were observed with changes in plasma testosterone concentrations and body conditions. Southern stingray spermatozoa were highly sensitive to cooling rates with slower rates, producing a higher post-thaw survival.
   This study investigated the reproductive biology and sperm cryopreservation of ex situ southern stingrays (Hypanus americanus) by semen collection and characterization and the development and validation of an enzyme-linked immunoassay for plasma total testosterone. Semen was collected in March and June using a manual massage technique, and the ejaculates were assessed for volume, pH, osmolarity, motility, status (0-5 scale: 0 = no forward progression, 5 = rapid linear progression) and total sperm count. Semen was extended in Hank's elasmobranch ringer solution containing 10% DMSO, 10% glycerol or 5% glycerol with 5% N-methylformamide and cryopreserved using a conventional freezing method (similar to-50 degrees C/min) or a modified slow freezing method (similar to-3 degrees C/min). Body condition was scored from 1-5 and was noted to be low in March (1.93 +/- 0.07) due to feeding practices and increased by June (2.93 +/- 0.05) after dietary corrections were made. A concomitant increase (p < 0.05) in plasma total testosterone concentration and sperm motility was noted between March (8.0 +/- 7.2 ng/mL, 5.71 +/- 2.77%) and June (97.3 +/- 11.3 ng/mL, 51.4 +/- 14.3%). Samples cryopreserved using a modified slow freeze method (similar to-3 degrees C/min) had higher post-thaw motility and plasma membrane integrity than conventionally cryopreserved samples. Data indicate that southern stingray sperm morphometrics adheres to those of other elasmobranch species and that a slow cooling rate may be an avenue of research to improve southern stingray sperm survival during cryopreservation.

AB  - The role of vitamin D-3 has been confirmed in female reproductive organs. This study aimed to examine vitamin D-3 metabolic enzymes, i.e., CYP27B1 and CYP24A1, mRNA transcript and protein abundance, and protein localization in the uterus of pigs on days 2-5, 10-12, 15-16 and 18-20 of the estrous cycle. Additionally, we determined 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 concentration in uterine flushings and the effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 (10, 50 and 100 ng/mL) in vitro on CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 mRNA transcript abundance in endometrial and myometrial slices. In the endometrium, a greater CYP27B1 mRNA transcript abundance was noted on days 10-12 and 18-20 than on days 15-16, whereas encoded protein abundance was greater on days 18-20 when compared to days 15-16. Endometrial CYP24A1 mRNA transcript abundance was greater on days 18-20 than on days 10-12 and 15-16. In the myometrium, CYP27B1 mRNA transcript abundance was greater on days 18-20 than on days 2-5 and 15-16, while protein abundance was larger in slices collected on days 18-20 than on days 15-16. Neither CYP24A1 mRNA transcript nor encoded protein abundance were detected in the myometrium. The highest 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 concentration in uterine flushings was observed on days 18-20. Furthermore, the 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 increased the abundance of the CYP24A1 mRNA transcript in endometrial slices. Overall, our results suggest that porcine uterus is an extra-renal site of vitamin D-3 metabolism. Both the endometrium and the myometrium possess the ability to synthesize vitamin D-3, while only the endometrium contributes to its catabolism.

AB  - The open reading frame encoding interferon alpha (IFN alpha) of the camel liver, Camelus dromedarius was isolated and cloned using reverse transcription-PCR. Sequence analysis of that gene showed a 564 bp encoding a protein of 187 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 21 kDa. Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) sequence analysis revealed that C. dromedarius IFN alpha gene shares high sequence identity with IFN alpha genes of other species, including C. ferus, Vicugna pacos, and Homo sapiens. Expression of C. dromedarius IFN alpha cDNA in Escherichia coli revealed a fusion protein with a weight of 22.5 kDa after induction of expression with IPTG for 5 h. The recombinant IFN alpha was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies that were separated and solubilized in vitro and the protein was refolded using SDS and KCl. The folded protein is then purified using on Ni-NTA Agarose affinity chromatography and the purity was judged by SDS-PAGE. Moreover, the effect of the recombinant IFN alpha of the viability of cancer cell line was assessed by MTT assay. Morphological study showed that C. dromedarius IFN alpha protein inhibited cell survival of MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and severe atrophic enteritis caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that infects pigs and makes huge economic losses to the global swine industry. Previously, researchers have believed that porcine aminopeptidase-N (pAPN) was the primary receptor for PEDV, but it has been found that PEDV can infect pAPN knockout pigs. Currently, the functional receptor for PEDV remains unspecified. In the present study, we performed virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA), found that ATP1A1 was the highest scoring protein in the mass spectrometry results, and confirmed that the CT structural domain of ATP1A1 interacts with PEDV S1. First, we investigated the effect of ATP1A1 on PEDV replication. Inhibition of hosts ATP1A1 protein expression using small interfering RNA (siRNAs) significantly reduced the cells susceptibility to PEDV. The ATP1A1-specific inhibitors Ouabain (a cardiac steroid) and PST2238 (a digitalis toxin derivative), which specifically bind ATP1A1, could block the ATP1A1 protein internalization and degradation, and consequently reduce the infection rate of host cells by PEDV significantly. Additionally, as expected, overexpression of ATP1A1 notably enhanced PEDV infection. Next, we observed that PEDV infection of target cells resulted in upregulation of ATP1A1 at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we found that the host protein ATP1A1 was involved in PEDV attachment and co-localized with PEDV S1 protein in the early stage of infection. In addition, pretreatment of IPEC-J2 and Vero-E6 cells with ATP1A1 mAb significantly reduced PEDV attachment. Our observations provided a perspective on identifying key factors in PEDV infection, and may provide valuable targets for PEDV infection, PEDV functional receptor, related pathogenesis, and the development of new antiviral drugs.

AB  - Adolescent binge drinking has lasting behavioral consequences by disrupting the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and depleting brain omega-3. The natural accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids in cell membranes is crucial for maintaining the membrane structure, supporting interactions with the ECS, and restoring synaptic plasticity and cognition impaired by prenatal ethanol (EtOH) exposure. However, it remains unclear whether omega-3 supplementation can mitigate the long-term effects on the ECS, endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity, and cognition following adolescent binge drinking. Here, we demonstrated that omega-3 supplementation during EtOH withdrawal increases CB1 receptors in hippocampal presynaptic terminals of male mice, along with the recovery of receptor-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding to G alpha i/o proteins. These changes are associated with long-term potentiation (LTP) at excitatory medial perforant path (MPP) synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG), which depends on anandamide (AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Finally, omega-3 intake following binge drinking reduced the time and number of errors required to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze test. Collectively, these findings suggest that omega-3 supplementation restores Barnes maze performance to levels comparable to those of control mice after adolescent binge drinking. This recovery is likely mediated by modulation of the hippocampal ECS, enhancing endocannabinoid-dependent excitatory synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Background: We previously found that total flavones of Rhododendron (TFR) protected against the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. But the detailed mechanism is not clear. Recent research revealed that reactive astrocytes were divided into A1 and A2 phenotypes for their morphological and functional remodeling and neurotoxic- vs-neuroprotective effect on the injury of the central nervous system (CNS).
   Purpose: The present study was undertaken to explore the role and mechanism of TFR on the phenotypic change of astrocytes following cerebral I/R in vivo and oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro.
   Study design and methods: We tested the expression of astrocytes marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), A1 astrocytes marker C3 protein and A2 astrocytes marker S100a10, as well as the BrdU/GFAP-positive cells, GFAP/ S100a10-positive cells and GFAP/C3-positive cells in mice hippocampal tissues to evaluate the phenotypic change of astrocytes. Besides, we assessed the change of astrocyte phenotypes following OGD/R in vitro.
   Results: We found that mice cerebral I/R promoted the astrocytes proliferation of both A1 and A2 phenotypes in hippocampal tissues. While treatment with TFR could promote the proliferation of A2 astrocytes but inhibit the A1 astrocytes proliferation in mice hippocampal tissues, suggesting that TFR could accelerate the astrocytes transformation into A2 subtype following cerebral I/R. Whereas, in OGD/R model of astrocytes, we found that TFR inhibited the proliferation of both A1 and A2 astrocytes. Besides, we found that TFR could up-regulate the release of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)-produced hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and inhibit RhoA/Rho kinase pathway, and revealed that the inhibitory effect of TFR on astrocytes proliferation could be blocked by aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), an CBS inhibitor. Furthermore, TFR could ameliorate the mice cerebral I/R injury and the OGD/R-induced astrocytic damage.
   Conclusion: These findings suggested that TFR could affect the transformation of astrocytes subtypes following cerebral I/R, which may be related to up-regulation of CBS-produced H2S and subsequent inhibition of RhoA/ ROCK pathway.

AB  - The hippocampus has been proposed to encode environments using a representation that contains predictive information about likely future states, called the successor representation. However, it is not clear how such a representation could be learned in the hippocampal circuit. Here, we propose a plasticity rule that can learn this predictive map of the environment using a spiking neural network. We connect this biologically plausible plasticity rule to reinforcement learning, mathematically and numerically showing that it implements the TD-lambda algorithm. By spanning these different levels, we show how our framework naturally encompasses behavioral activity and replays, smoothly moving from rate to temporal coding, and allows learning over behavioral timescales with a plasticity rule acting on a timescale of milliseconds. We discuss how biological parameters such as dwelling times at states, neuronal firing rates and neuromodulation relate to the delay discounting parameter of the TD algorithm, and how they influence the learned representation. We also find that, in agreement with psychological studies and contrary to reinforcement learning theory, the discount factor decreases hyperbolically with time. Finally, our framework suggests a role for replays, in both aiding learning in novel environments and finding shortcut trajectories that were not experienced during behavior, in agreement with experimental data.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) significantly enhance our ability to identify trait-associated genomic variants by considering the host genome. Moreover, the hologenome refers to the host organism's collective genetic material and its associated microbiome. In this study, we utilized the hologenome framework, called Hologenome-wide association studies (HWAS), to dissect the architecture of complex traits, including milk yield, methane emissions, rumen physiology in cattle, and gut microbial composition in pigs. We employed four statistical models: (1) GWAS, (2) Microbial GWAS (M-GWAS), (3) HWAS-CG (hologenome interaction estimated using COvariance between Random Effects Genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (CORE-GREML)), and (4) HWAS-H (hologenome interaction estimated using the Hadamard product method). We applied Bonferroni correction to interpret the significant associations in the complex traits. The GWAS and M-GWAS detected one and sixteen significant SNPs for milk yield traits, respectively, whereas the HWAS-CG and HWAS-H each identified eight SNPs. Moreover, HWAS-CG revealed four, and the remaining models identified three SNPs each for methane emissions traits. The GWAS and HWAS-CG detected one and three SNPs for rumen physiology traits, respectively. For the pigs' gut microbial composition traits, the GWAS, M-GWAS, HWAS-CG, and HWAS-H identified 14, 16, 13, and 12 SNPs, respectively. We further explored these associations through SNP annotation and by analyzing biological processes and functional pathways. Additionally, we integrated our GWA results with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data using transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and summary-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) methods for a more comprehensive understanding of SNP-trait associations. Our study revealed hologenomic variability in agriculturally important traits, enhancing our understanding of host-microbiome interactions.

AB  - Tea is a highly consumed beverage around the world, and many studies have indicated its health benefits. However, tea products may contain heavy metals that may cause negative health effects due to their toxicity. This study aimed to quantify the levels of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in six different imported black tea brands marketed in Mashhad city, Iran. Twenty samples from each six black tea brands were obtained from the markets of Mashhad city, Iran, in 2012. Overall, the content of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd ranged 6.81-35.21 mg/kg (mean = 15.87 mg/kg), 14.61-164.84 mg/kg (mean = 47.68 mg/kg), 0.038-1.62 mg/kg (mean = 0.72 mg/kg) and 0.006-0.19 (mean = 0.05 mg/kg), respectively. The mean concentration of Zn in brands C, E and F, the mean concentration of Pb in brand B and the mean concentration of Cd in brand E exceeded the Iranian and WHO standard levels. Additionally, the estimation of hazard index (HI) showed that there is no potential adverse health effect due to the consumption of the studied tea samples (HI < 1). In terms of HI, the brands were ordered as B > D > F > E > A > C. However, estimation of excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) for Pb showed that there is a significant lifetime cancer risk as a result of consuming the black tea products. but the estimation of ELCR for Cd showed no potential health risks.

AB  - Memory deterioration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be underpinned by aberrant amyloid beta (A beta) accumulation, which contributes to synaptic plasticity impairment. Avenanthramide-C (Avn-C), a polyphenol compound found predominantly in oats, has a range of biological properties. Herein, we performed methanolic extraction of the Avns-rich fraction (Fr. 2) from germinated oats using column chromatography, and examined the effects of Avn-C on synaptic correlates of memory in a mouse model of AD. Avn-C was identified in Fr. 2 based on H-1-NMR analysis. Electrophysiological recordings were performed to examine the effects of Avn-C on the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in a Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Avn-C from germinated oats restored impaired LTP in Tg2576 mouse hippocampal slices. Furthermore, Avn-C-facilitated LTP was associated with changes in the protein levels of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (p-GSK3 beta-S9) and cleaved caspase 3, which are involved in A beta-induced synaptic impairment. Our findings suggest that the Avn-C extract from germinated oats may be beneficial for AD-related synaptic plasticity impairment and memory decline.</p>

AB  - We present a method of producing bulk cell-cultured fat tissue for food applications. Mass transport limitations (nutrients, oxygen, waste diffusion) of macroscale 3D tissue culture are circumvented by initially culturing murine or porcine adipocytes in 2D, after which bulk fat tissue is produced by mechanically harvesting and aggregating the lipid-filled adipocytes into 3D constructs using alginate or transglutaminase binders. The 3D fat tissues were visually similar to fat tissue harvested from animals, with matching textures based on uniaxial compression tests. The mechanical properties of cultured fat tissues were based on binder choice and concentration, and changes in the fatty acid compositions of cellular triacylglyceride and phospholipids were observed after lipid supplementation (soybean oil) during in vitro culture. This approach of aggregating individual adipocytes into a bulk 3D tissue provides a scalable and versatile strategy to produce cultured fat tissue for food-related applications, thereby addressing a key obstacle in cultivated meat production.

AB  - The emergence of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is alarming and demands in-depth knowledge for timely diagnosis. We performed genome-wide association analysis using 2237 clinical strains of Mtb to identify novel genetic factors that evoke drug resistance. In addition to the known direct targets, we identified for the first time, a strong association between mutations in DNA repair genes and the multidrug-resistant phenotype. To evaluate the impact of variants identified in the clinical samples in the evolution of drug resistance, we utilized knockouts and complemented strains in Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mtb. Results show that variant mutations compromised the functions of MutY and UvrB. MutY variant showed enhanced survival compared with wild-type (Rv) when the Mtb strains were subjected to multiple rounds of ex vivo antibiotic stress. In an in vivo guinea pig infection model, the MutY variant outcompeted the wild-type strain. We show that novel variant mutations in the DNA repair genes collectively compromise their functions and contribute to better survival under antibiotic/host stress conditions.

AB  - In this chapter, we review the cross-sectional evidence in healthy human subjects for physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness to offer neuroprotection and moderate cognitive decline in older age. The role of exercise training on cognition in healthy older adults and those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is also discussed, including the evidence from neuroimaging studies that document changes to brain structure and function after a period of exercise training and improved fitness. Finally, in reference to animal models, the potential neurophysiological mechanisms for physical activity and exercise to impact human brain health are highlighted.

AB  - This study investigated the anaerobic co-digestion of sugarcane vinasse (V) and elephant grass silage (S) to produce methane. Box-Behnken experimental design was applied to verify the statistical effects of the elephant grass ensiling time (40, 80 and 120 days), alkaline pretreatment of elephant grass silage (0.5, 2.25 and 4.00% w/v NaOH) and S:V mixture ratio (25:75, 50:50 and 75:25) on the methane yield. The results showed that the ensiling process resulted in the low degradation of lignocellulosic substances, emphasizing the need for pretreatment using more efficient techniques, such as thermo-alkaline, to improve the breakdown of elephant grass fibres. COD removals varied between 35 and 85%, and carbohydrate consumptions ranged from 63 to 72%, with the higher efficiencies for both parameters occurring in the reactors with lower percentages of silage. Cumulative methane yield ranged from 190.77 mLCH(4)/gVS (in the reactor with S:V of 75:25, 0.50% w/v NaOH and 80 ensiling days) to 1729.80 mLCH(4)/gVS (in the reactor with S:V of 25:75, 2.25% w/v NaOH and 120 ensiling days). According to ANOVA, S:V ratio was the only variable with a significant effect (p < 0.05) on cumulative methane yield. Therefore, the findings indicate that the relative composition of substrates within the mixture exerted the most significant influence on the process, underscoring the critical role of vinasse as a co-substrate in enhancing methane production despite silage pretreatments.

AB  - The Calcium-Sensing Receptor (CASR) is a G protein-coupled receptor of the C family that reportedly promotes maturation of porcine oocytes. However, its role in cumulus expansion of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) is not well known. This study was conducted to determine the role of CASR and potential mechanisms involved during in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine COCs. After culture of COCs in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-supplement maturation medium for 24 h, the time of breakdown of the germinal vesicle (GVBD), indicative of initiation of meiotic maturation, resulted in an increased (p < 0.05) CASR mRNA expression level in cumulus cells. Moreover, IVM of COCs in 10 mu M of the CASR agonist NPS R-568 promoted (p < 0.05) cumulus expansion but only in FSH-containing medium. Conversely, 20 mu M of the CASR inhibitor NPS2390 precluded cumulus expansion. We next tested the effect of the CASR agonist/inhibitor on the expression of cumulus expansion-related genes. The CASR agonist significantly upregulated the expression of hyaluronan acid synthase 2 (HAS2), whereas the CASR inhibitor downregulated the expression of all HAS2, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and tumor necrosis factor a-induced protein 6 (TNFAIP6). Altogether, these results suggest that CASR activity is involved in FSH-stimulated porcine cumulus expansion.

AB  - Simple Summary Equine asthma is a respiratory syndrome sharing several similarities with human asthma and represents the most common cause of chronic coughing in horses. Based on the severity and recurrence of the conditions, it is classified as mild-moderate or severe equine asthma. Although a precise pathogenetic mechanism has not yet been identified, it is generally agreed that environmental allergens behave as triggers of a hypersensitivity response (HR), culminating in asthmatic exacerbations. In human medicine, the skin prick test is considered the gold standard of allergy testing; similarly, in equine medicine, intradermal testing is used to identify hypersensitivities to specific allergens. The present study describes and compares the results of intradermal testing in horses affected by either mild-moderate or severe equine asthma to evaluate the responsiveness of asthmatic horses and to identify the most frequently involved allergens. Type-I HR was shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of severe equine asthma, while type-IV HR seems to be involved mostly in milder forms. Insects represented the antigens inducing the most frequent and strongest reactions among asthmatic horses, followed by Dermatophagoides spp. and dog epithelium; these allergens should therefore be considered for avoidance strategies and the future development of desensitizing allergen-specific immunotherapy. Equine asthma is an inflammatory respiratory disorder, classified as mild-moderate (MEA) and severe (SEA). SEA is characterized by recurrent exacerbations, consisting of dyspnea, coughing and exercise intolerance; MEA causes poor performance, occasional cough and mucus hypersecretion. Although a precise pathogenesis is not completely understood, allergic mechanisms are considered an important pathophysiological feature of equine asthma. In equine medicine, intradermal testing (IDT) is effective in identifying hypersensitivity to specific allergens. However, to date, the studies about IDT in asthmatic horses obtained contradictory results. This study aims to evaluate IDT responses in MEA and SEA horses and to identify the most significant allergens. Thirty-eight asthmatic horses were enrolled and underwent IDT using 50 allergens; reactions were evaluated at 30 min, 4, 24 and 48 h and were assigned a score from 0 to 4. In SEA horses, the most frequent and strongest reactions were observed at 30 min and 4 h, suggesting the involvement of type I hypersensitivity; in MEA horses, also type IV hypersensitivity seemed to play a major role. Insects, Dermatophagoides spp. and dog epithelium induced in MEA and SEA horses the most significant hypersensitivity responses and could therefore be considered as the main allergenic antigens in our geographic area.

AB  - Endometritis and metritis are common reproductive diseases in domestic animals, causing a reduction in reproductive performance and economic losses. A previous study revealed the alterations in the transcriptome of the inflamed porcine endometrium. Data on molecular signatures in the myometrium under inflammatory conditions are limited. The current study analyzed the transcriptomic profile of porcine myometrium after intrauterine Escherichia coli (E. coli) administration. On day 3 of the estrous cycle (Day 0 of the study), 50 ml of either saline (group CON, n = 7) or E. coli suspension (109 9 colony-forming units/ml, group E. coli, n = 5) were injected into each uterine horn. After eight days, the gilts were euthanized, and the uteri were removed for further analysis. In the myometrium of the CON group versus the E. coli group, microarray analysis revealed 167 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 78 up- and 89 down-regulated). After intrauterine E. coli administration, among the DEGs of the inflammatory response set, the highest expressed were mRNA for CXCL6, S100A8, S100A12, SLC11A1, S100A9, , CCL15, CCR1, CD163, THBS1 and SOCS3, while the most suppressed was mRNA expression for FFAR4, KL, SLC7A2 and MOAB. Furthermore, a comparison of the present results on myometrial transcriptome with the authors' earlier published data on the endometrial transcriptome shows the partial differences in mRNA expression between both layers after intrauterine E. coli injections. This study, for the first time, presents changes in the transcriptome of porcine myometrium after intrauterine E. coli administration, which may be important for myometrial homeostasis and functions and, as a result, for the uterine inflammation course. Data provide a valuable resource for further studies on genes and pathways regulating uterine inflammation and functions.

AB  - Bycatch of rays and skates in towed fishing gears represents one of the major threats to these relatively slow growing marine species. The objective of this study was to modify ground gear in a bottom trawl fishery to increase the escape of these species during towing without associated loss of target catch. Sea trials were carried out with a research vessel in Mersin Bay, North-eastern Mediterranean. Experimental ground gear was modified by cutting the rigging twine between the fishing line and the footrope in the central part of the ground gear. Capture of three unwanted bycatch species were estimated. The probability of capture of guitarfish (Rhinobatos sp.) and common stingray (Dasyatis pastinaca) was significantly reduced to 8% and 20% for guitarfish and stingray, respectively compared to standard ground gear. The results for spiny butterfly ray (Gymnura altavela) were inconclusive due to the wide confidence intervals. Further, the catch comparison results for five out of six target species investigated did not show significant reduction in catch efficiency when using experimental gear compared to the standard trawl. Only for common sole (Solea solea) the modified trawl had significantly lower catch efficiency than the standard trawl. We believe that this technical measure for reducing unwanted bycatch in bottom trawls has a potential to be adopted by the fishery due to being an efficient, low-cost measure which does not create additional challenges during handling of the gear.

AB  - Microalgae fractionation was investigated combining supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of lipids and pig-ments and protein extraction from the residues, on Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis oculata. The results indicated that for N. oculata, chlorophyll (a) is extracted rapidly and selectively apart from Chlorophyll (b), representing 34% and 0.41% in 30 min at 450 bar and 50 degrees C and up to 43% and 0.48% at 750 bar at the same time and temperature, respectively. The extraction profile of chlorophyll (a) is similar to of neutral lipids. For C. vulgaris, the results emphasized the importance of adding a co-solvent during the supercritical extraction to achieve 30% of chlorophyll (a), while the extraction of other pigments was lower especially for chlorophyll (b) extraction yield reaching 0.1% of its total content. Then for the second time, the extraction of proteins was studied on N. oculata delipidated cake. The results showed that the higher the level of delipidation, the higher the extraction yield, with an increase from 54% for crude cake to 73% for delipidated cake.

AB  - Fifty percent of male subfertility diagnosis is idiopathic and is usually associated with genetic abnormalities or protein dysfunction, which are not detectable through the conventional spermiogram. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are antioxidant enzymes essential for preserving sperm function and maintaining fertilizing ability. However, while the role of GSTP1 in cell signaling regulation via the inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) has been enlightened in somatic cells, it has never been investigated in mammalian spermatozoa. In this regard, a comprehensive approach through immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, computer-assisted sperm assessment (CASA), and flow cytometry analysis was used to characterize the molecular role of the GSTP1-JNK heterocomplex in sperm physiology, using the pig as a model. Immunological assessments confirmed the presence and localization of GSTP1 in sperm cells. The pharmacological dissociation of the GSTP1-JNK heterocomplex resulted in the activation of JNK, which led to a significant decrease in sperm viability, motility, mitochondrial activity, and plasma membrane stability, as well as to an increase of intracellular superoxides. No effects in intracellular calcium levels and acrosome membrane integrity were observed. In conclusion, the present work has demonstrated, for the first time, the essential role of GSTP1 in deactivating JNK, which is crucial to maintain sperm function and has also set the grounds to understand the relevance of the GSTP1-JNK heterocomplex for the regulation of mammalian sperm physiology.

AB  - Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by numerous long-term complications, in which progressive cognitive decline represents a significant risk factor for dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders. Taohe Chengqi decoction (THCQ) is a common traditional Chinese formula for treating T2DM; however, the neuroprotective effect of THCQ on diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction remains unclear. Hence, the present study investigated the therapeutic effects of THCQ on cognitive impairment associated with T2DM and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. Methods: A stable high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2DM mouse model was established and received intragastrical THCQ administration. Blood and tissue samples were investigated for biochemical parameters and neuropathology, whereas hippocampal tissue underwent transcriptome analyses and the role of neural stem cell (NSC) senescence was detected both in vivo and in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis and subsequent primary NSC experiments were conducted to explore the involvement of the HIF1 alpha signaling pathway in THCQ-mediated hippocampal NSC senescence. Furthermore, a lentivirus vector overexpressing HIF1 alpha was used to verify the THCQ potential therapeutic effects on HIF1 alpha/PDKs metabolic signaling that influenced NSC senescence. Results: THCQ alleviated cognitive dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities in HFD/STZ mice, and relieved hippocampal neurodegeneration. Transcriptome analyses and validation experiments revealed THCQ-induced neuroprotective effects by targeting high glucose-mediated hippocampal neuropathy and NSC senescence. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that HIF1 alpha signaling played a significant role in THCQ therapeutic outcomes; while HIF1 alpha overexpression impaired the effects of THCQ on high glucose-induced metabolic disorders and NSC senescence.

AB  - Scaffold-free cartilage-sheet technology can stably regenerate high-quality cartilage tissue in vivo. However, uncontrolled shape maintenance and mechanical strength greatly hinder its clinical translation. Decalcified bone matrix (DBM) has high porosity, a suitable pore structure, and good biocompatibility, as well as controlled shape and mechanical strength. In this study, cartilage sheet was prepared into engineered cartilage gel (ECG) and combined with DBM to explore the feasibility of regenerating 3D cartilage with controlled shape and mechanical strength. The results indicated that ECG cultured in vitro for 3 days (3 d) and 15 days (15 d) showed good biocompatibility with DBM, and the ECG-DBM constructs successfully regenerated viable 3D cartilage with typical mature cartilage features in both nude mice and autologous goats. Additionally, the regenerated cartilage had comparable mechanical properties to native cartilage and maintained its original shape. To further determine the optimal seeding parameters for ECG, the 3 d ECG regenerated using human chondrocytes was diluted in different concentrations (1:3, 1:2, and 1:1) for seeding and in vivo implantation. The results showed that the regenerated cartilage in the 1:2 group exhibited better shape maintenance and homogeneity than the other groups. The current study established a novel mode of 3D cartilage regeneration based on the design concept of steel (DBM)-reinforced concrete (ECG) and successfully regenerated homogenous and mature 3D cartilage with controlled shape and mechanical strength, which hopefully provides an ideal cartilage graft for the repair of various cartilage defects.

AB  - Repeatability of hormone concentrations is of great interest for studies investigating the evolution of hormonal traits. Particularly the repeatability of glucocorticoids (GCs) in response to a stressor is frequently investigated, but often only point (initial and/or response value), or single measures are used. A new method takes into account the entire individual hormone profile and generates an individual profile repeatability (PR) score. The method was developed for response profiles, but it may also be valuable for baseline values in species with diurnal changes in hormone concentrations. GCs are determined in a variety of matrices, and repeatability can vary considerably depending on the matrix. We investigated the repeatability of baseline GC metabolite (GCM) concentrations measured in urine (uGCM) and faeces (fGCM) of captive eastern rock sengis (Elephantulus myurus) using the more traditional linear mixed model approach and the PR method. GCMs were assessed over 24 h and measurements were repeated twice with two weeks between replicates. A diurnal rhythm in GCM concentrations associated with the activity period of the sengis was found in urine, but not in the faeces. Urinary GCM concentrations exhibited a moderate repeatability, whereas the repeatability of fGCM concentrations was low. Urinary GCM concentrations and their repeatability differed between the sexes; with higher concentrations and lower PR scores in females. No such sex differences were apparent for fGCM concentrations and the PR score was not able to characterise repeatability of fGCM concentrations, which were lacking a distinct profile. The PR score enabled a successful quantification of the repeatability of the diurnal uGCM profiles. Hormone profile, sex and sample matrix can affect hormonal traits considerably and the results may be obscured if these factors are not carefully considered.

AB  - Delayed rectifier K+ current (I-Ks) is a key contributor to repolarization of action potentials. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying the adrenoceptor-induced potentiation of I-Ks in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes (PVC). PVC were isolated from guinea pig pulmonary vein. The action potentials and I-Ks current were recorded using perforated and conventional whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. The expression of I-Ks was examined using immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. KCNQ1, a I-Ks pore-forming protein was detected as a signal band approximately 100 kDa in size, and its immunofluorescence signal was found to be mainly localized on the cell membrane. The I-Ks current in PVC was markedly enhanced by both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation with a negative voltage shift in the current activation, although the potentiation was more effectively induced by beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation than beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation. Both beta-adrenoceptor-mediated increases in I-Ks were attenuated by treatment with the adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor or protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Furthermore, the I-Ks current was increased by alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist but attenuated by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. PVC exhibited action potentials in normal Tyrode solution which was slightly reduced by HMR-1556 a selective I-Ks blocker. However, HMR-1556 markedly reduced the beta-adrenoceptor-potentiated firing rate. The stimulatory effects of beta- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptor on I-Ks in PVC are mediated via the PKA and PKC signal pathways. HMR-1556 effectively reduced the firing rate under beta-adrenoceptor activation, suggesting that the functional role of I-Ks might increase during sympathetic excitation under in vivo conditions.

AB  - The caseinolytic protease (ClpP)-producing strain CHFM, isolated from Algerian goat milk, was identified as Lactiplantibacillus pentosus through 16 S rRNA sequence analysis. The optimal conditions for ClpP expression by Lpb. pentosus CHFM were determined in a modified MRS medium, where peptone was replaced with casein. The most favourable conditions were a pH of 8.0, a temperature between 25 degrees C degrees C and 55 degrees C, degrees C, and an incubation period of 48 h. PCR screening and subsequent cloning and sequencing of the ClpP-encoding gene from the Lpb. pentosus CHFM genome revealed two conservative substitutions: threonine to serine at position 161, and aspartic acid to glutamic acid at position 182. Bioinformatic analysis indicated an instability index value of 40.51 for ClpP CHFM, suggesting stability, with an alpha-helix being the predominant secondary structure element, followed by a random coil. The aliphatic index was 97.60, indicating thermal stability. The GRAVY index was-0.23, suggesting enhanced interaction with water. The molecular weight was found to be 25.5 kDa with an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.78. The structural and docking analysis demonstrated that ClpP CHFM possesses the ability to hydrolyze alpha S1-casein.

AB  - Outstanding properties and advanced functionalities of thermal-regulatory by origami-based architecture materials have been shown at various scales. However, in order to model and manage its programmable mechanical properties by Building Information Modelling (BIM) for use in a covering structure is not a simple task. The aim of this study was to model an element that forms a dynamic shell that prevents or allows the perpendicular incidence of the sun into the infrastructure. Parametric modelling of such complex structures was performed by Grasshopper and Rhinoceros 3D and were rendered by using the V-ray's plugin. The elements followed the principles of origami to readjust its geometry considering the sun position, changing the shadow in real time depending on the momentary interest. The results of the project show that quadrangular was the most suitable Origami shape for facade elements. In addition, a BIM-based automated system capable of modifying facade elements considering the sun position was performed. The significance of this research relies on the first implementation and design of an Origami constructive element using BIM methodology, showing its viability and opening outstanding future research lines in terms of sustainability and energy efficiency.

AB  - Background: Vascular dementia (VaD) is one of the most common clinical syndromes of progressive neuro-cognitive dysfunction with uncertain mechanisms. Modified Erchen decoction (MECD), developed from "Erchen decoction (ECD)" recorded in "Taiping Huimin Heji Jufang", showed a good effect in the treatment of VaD. However, its therapeutic mechanism is still unclear. Purpose: This study aimed to elucidate the multi-target mechanisms of MECD against VaD in vivo and in vitro. Methods: VaD model was established by two-vessel obstruction (2-VO) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Six groups, including the control, 2-VO operation, MECD treatment (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 g kg-1 d-1), donepezil hydrochloride (positive control, 0.45 g kg-1 d-1) were designed in the whole experiment. After oral administration for 4 weeks, the effects of MECD were verified by behavioral experiments, histological observation, and biochemical index analysis. The chemical profiling of MECD was performed by UHPLC-Orbitrap Fusion-HRMS, and a "compound-target-pathway" multivariate network was constructed to validate and elucidate its pharmacological mechanisms. Results: Compared with 2-VO group, MECD treatment significantly alleviated anxiety and improved spatial memory in VaD rats according to the open field test (OFT) and Y-maze test. A significant increase in neuron number was observed from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images in cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) of the hippocampal region after MECD treatment. On the one hand, MECD reduced the plasma levels of triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), malondialdehyde (MDA), and amyloid-beta 42 (A beta 42), and inhibited mRNA expression of interleukin-1 beta (Il-1 beta) and Il-6 in the hippocampus. On the other hand, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were significantly increased after treatment with MECD. Moreover, MECD reduced the mRNA expression and protein expression of janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and BCL2-associated X (BAX) in the brain of 2-VO rats. Furthermore, 71 compounds were identified from the extract of MECD. Among them, liquiritin and isochlorogenic acid C gave inhibiting effects on the mRNA expression of Jnk. In addition, liquiritin and hes-peretin were conformed with the inhibition of Jak2 transcription level in vitro experiments. Conclusion: MECD has demonstrated a significant amelioration effect on cognitive dysfunction in VaD rats via JAK2/STAT3 and JNK/BAX signaling pathways, which represents an innovative insight into the "activate blood and eliminate phlegm" theory.

AB  - Aims: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is of significant global concern and is a major One Health issue. There is evidence to suggest that increased antimicrobial usage (AMU) can be associated with AMR patterns, and therefore, there have been efforts to reduce AMU in anticipation of reducing AMR emergence risk. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there were any associations between AMU and AMR patterns of commensal Escherichia coli isolated from pig herds in Ireland.Methods and Results: Data on AMR from a panel of antimicrobials (AMDs) were gathered as part of national surveillance activities. These data were associated with reported usage of AMDs, on a year-quarter basis, measured in mg/kg at a herd-level using generalized estimating equation regression analysis. Associations were tested with AMR presence or multi-drug resistance (MDR; >= 3 classes) profiles and total AMU during the contemporaneous quarter and previous quarter, respectively. Furthermore, individual and AMD class-based associations were tested. The final dataset contained 218 observations (herd-quarter usage and AMR resistance profile) from 122 herds during 2019-2021. Apparent resistance prevalence varied according to AMD type, with the highest mean prevalence found with tetracycline at 51.57% (95% CI: 45.06%-58.09%). There were significant associations between a herd obtaining a positive AMR result for any AMDs and the overall levels of AMU during the year-quarter. Furthermore, there were significant positive associations between MDR and total AMU. At the compound level, chloramphenicol resistance was significantly associated with increased usage of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine and chlortetracycline, respectively (p < 0.010). Tetracycline resistance was associated with increased use of chlortetracycline (p = 0.008). At the antimicrobial class level, there was a significant positive relationship between the usage of phenicol and the probability of a resistance for chloramphenicol (p = 0.026) and between the usage of tetracycline and tetracycline resistance probability (p = 0.018).Conclusions: Our data provide evidence of associations between overall AMU and AMR or MDR risk at the herd-quarter level. There was also evidence of associations between specific AMDs and patterns of resistance. Associations varied depending on whether time lags in usage were modelled or how usage was modelled (e.g. dichotomized or continuous). Associations with rarely used AMDs (e.g. critically important AMDs) were precluded due to a lack of statistical power. Continued monitoring of both AMU and AMR is crucial to assess the impacts of policy changes aimed at reducing AMU.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determinate the content of some elements in a specific dairy product, mozzarella, in a particular area of western Slovakia and to evaluate the estimation of the risk to the consumers based on the contribution to the provisional tolerable weekly intake. The consumption of mozzarella can contribute to the intake of important elements in the diet, such as calcium and magnesium, along with others. The contents of some toxic and trace elements were low and have not exceeded the permitted limit. In addition, the contribution to PTWI was found to be very low, which means that the consumption of mozzarella possesses no risk to humans. It is concluded that the data obtained in this study can help as a valuable addition to methodological and scientific material in the field of food safety of dairy products and their positive impact on human health.

AB  - The study was conducted to determine the effects of multi-carbohydrase and phytase complex (MCPC) supplementation in standard and commercial diets on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, bone mineralization, blood biochemical parameters and puberty onset in gilts. A total of 144 healthy gilts (Duroc x (Landrace x York)) were assigned randomly to four treatments (n = 36), with 10 replicate pens (6 pens, each containing 4 gilts, and 4 pens, each containing 3 gilts). The trial consisted of two phases (phase 1: 70-100 kg; phase 2: 100-140 kg). The commercial diet (COM) had 33% higher calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) levels than the standard diet (CON) across all phases. The four treatment diets were as follows: CON (phase 1: 0.56 g/kg Ca and 0.49 g/kg P; phase 2: 0.49 g/kg Ca and 0.45 g/kg P), COM (phase 1: 0.75 g/kg Ca and 0.65 g/kg P; phase 2: 0.65 g/kg Ca and 0.60 g/kg P), CON + MCPC and COM + MCPC, where both the CON and COM diets were supplemented with 100 mg/kg of MCPC, respectively. The commercial diet significantly (p < 0.05) increased the total number of follicles and the number of follicles < 4 mm and tended to reduce (p = 0.07) the age at puberty compared to the standard diet. Besides, MCPC supplementation improved the apparent total-tract digestibility (ATTD) of Ca (p < 0.05), P (p < 0.05) and Ash (p = 0.07) in gilts during phase 1, compared to the basal diets without MCPC supplementation. Additionally, MCPC supplementation significantly elevated serum creatinine (CREA, p < 0.05) concentrations and had a tendency to increase serum Ca (p = 0.07) concentrations in gilts. Specifically, COM + MCPC supplementation significantly increased the osteocalcin (OCN) concentration compared with the COM treatment. Moreover, dietary MCPC supplementation significantly improved the bone strength (p < 0.05) compared to the basal diets without MCPC supplementation. In conclusion, dietary MCPC supplementation increased the ATTD of Ca and P in gilts, while also improving bone strength. This improvement not only extends the reproductive lifespan of sows, but it also allows for reduced supplementation levels of Ca and P in the dietary formula.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Environmental factors, including the differences in genotype-based housing (GbH), can act as confounding variables in studies using transgenic mouse models, potentially influencing experimental outcomes and limiting their reproducibility and translational value. Despite the widespread use of transgenic models in preclinical studies, the extent to which housing conditions can affect the behavioral and molecular parameters of interest remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate how different GbH conditions influence visuo-spatial memory and gene expression in the A53T mouse model (JAX006823) of Parkinson's disease (PD) during the pre-motor phase. Methods: A53T+ transgenic male mice and their non-transgenic littermates (A53T-) were housed in either mixed-genotype (MGH) or single-genotype (SGH) environments from postnatal day (PND) 30, with C57BL/6J mice serving as the controls. A behavioral assessment using the Novel Object Recognition and Object Location Tests was conducted at PND 180, followed by a qPCR analysis of Iba1, Gfap alpha, Bdnf, Tnf alpha, Il-1 beta, and Il-6 expression in the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Results: The variations in GbH influenced behavior and mRNA expression differently in the A53T+ and A53T- animals. Specifically, the A53T- mice in SGH environments displayed behavioral and molecular profiles similar to the C57BL/6J controls, while the same was not evident in the MGH environments. In the A53T+ mice, the mRNA expression of Iba1, Gfap alpha, Bdnf, and Tnf alpha was sensitive to variations in GbH, while memory impairment was not. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of considering environmental factors in studies using transgenic animal models. The obtained data suggests that GbH can influence the parameters of interest in preclinical research, implicating the need for the optimization of future study designs.

AB  - In order to increase metabolite coverage in LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics, HILIC- and RPLC-mode separations are often combined. Unfortunately, these two techniques pose opposite requirements on sample composition, necessitating either dual sample preparations, increasing needed sample volume, or manipulation of the samples after the first analysis, potentially leading to loss of analytes. When sample material is precious, the number of analyses that can be performed is limited. To that end, an automated single-injection LC-MS method for sequential analysis of both the hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions of biological samples is described. Early eluting compounds in a HILIC separation are collected on a trap column and subsequently analyzed in the RPLC mode. The instrument configuration, composed of commercially available components, allows easy modulation of the dilution ratio of the collected effluent, with sufficient dilution to obtain peak compression in the RPLC column. Furthermore, the method is validated and shown to be fit for purpose for application in untargeted metabolomics. Repeatability in both retention times and peak areas was excellent across over 140 injections of protein-precipitated blood plasma. Finally, the method has been applied to the analysis of real perilymph samples collected in a guinea pig model. The QC sample injections clustered tightly in the PCA scores plot and showed a high repeatability in both retention times and peak areas for selected compounds.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is closely related to the occurrence and progression of metabolic liver disease. The treatment targeting glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) for liver disease has gotten much attention, but the specific effect of GRP94 on hepatocyte apoptosis is still unclear. So far, all the studies on GRP94 have been conducted in mice or rats, and little study has been reported on pigs, which share more similarities with humans. In this study, we used low-dose (LD) and high-dose (HD) tunicamycin (TM) to establish ERS models on piglet livers and immortalized porcine hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). On the piglet ERS model we found that ERS could significantly (p < 0.01) stimulate the secretion and synthesis of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-1 and IGFBP-3; however, with the increase in ERS degree, the effect of promoting secretion and synthesis significantly (p < 0.01) decreased. In addition, the ubiquitin protein and ubiquitination-related gene were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the LD group compared with the vehicle group. The protein level of Active-caspase 3 was significantly increased (p < 0.01) in the HD group, however, the TUNEL staining showed there was no significant apoptosis in the piglet liver ERS model. To explore the biofunction of ER chaperone GRP94, we used shRNA to knock down the expression of GRP94 in porcine HSCs. Interestingly, on porcine HSCs, the knockdown of GRP94 significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the secretion of IGF-1, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 under ERS, but had no significant effect on these under normal condition, and knockdown GRP94 had a significant (p < 0.01) effect on the UBE2E gene and ubiquitin protein from the analysis of two-way ANOVA. On porcine HSCs apoptosis, the knockdown of GRP94 increased the cell apoptosis in TUNEL staining, and the two-way ANOVA analysis shows that knockdown GRP94 had a significant (p < 0.01) effect on the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Caspase-3. For CCK-8 assay, ERS had a significant inhibitory(p < 0.05) effect on cell proliferation when treated with ERS for 24 h, and both knockdown GRP94 and ERS had a significant inhibitory(p < 0.05) effect on cell proliferation when treated with ERS for 36 h and 48 h. We concluded that GRP94 can protect the cell from ERS-induced apoptosis by promoting the IGF-1 system and ubiquitin. These results provide valuable information on the adaptive mechanisms of the liver under ERS, and could help identify vital functional genes to be applied as possible diagnostic biomarkers and treatments for diseases induced by ERS in the future.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are less efficacious in treating depression in children than in adults. SSRIs block serotonin uptake via the high-affinity, low-capacity serotonin transporter. However, the low-affinity, high-capacity organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) and plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) are emerging as important players in serotonin uptake. We hypothesized that OCT3 and/or PMAT are functionally upregulated in juveniles, thereby buffering SSRIs' ability to enhance serotonergic neurotransmission. Unlike in adult mice, we found the OCT/PMAT blocker, decynium-22, to have standalone antidepressant-like effects in juveniles. Using in vivo high-speed chronoamperometry, we found that juveniles clear serotonin from the CA3 region of the hippocampus similar to 2-fold faster than adult mice. Cell density did not differ between ages, suggesting that faster serotonin clearance in juveniles is unrelated to faster diffusion through the extracellular matrix. Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed that juvenile mice have modestly greater expression of PMAT than adults, whereas OCT3 expression in the CA3 region of the hippocampus was similar between ages. Together, these data suggest that faster serotonin clearance and antidepressant-like effects of decynium-22 in juvenile mice may be due to functionally upregulated PMAT. Faster serotonin clearance via PMAT in juveniles may contribute to reduced therapeutic efficacy of SSRIs in children relative to adults.

AB  - Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are inherited genetic elements derived from exogenous retroviral infections occurring throughout evolution. Accumulating evidence implicates increased expression of HERV type W envelope (HERV-W ENV) in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. To gain more mechanistic insights into the neurobiological disease pathways affected by HERV-W ENV expression, we took advantage of a mouse model that recapitulates the expression of the human-specific HERV-W ENV protein. Behavioral and cognitive phenotyping of transgenic (TG) mice expressing HERV-W ENV and wild-type (WT) controls showed that expression of this retroviral envelope caused deficits in numerous functional domains, including repetitive behavior, social and object recognition memory, and sensorimotor gating. Genome-wide RNA sequencing of hippocampal tissue demonstrated that transgenic expression of HERV-W ENV led to transcriptomic alterations that are highly relevant for psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, cognitive functions, and synaptic development. Differential gene expression in TG mice encompassed a downregulation of several genes associated with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, including Setd1a, Cacna1g, Ank3, and Shank3, as well as a downregulation of histone methyltransferase genes that belong to the Set1-like histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase family (Kmt2a, Kmt2b and Kmt2d). Concomitant to the latter, HERV-W ENV mice displayed increased enzymatic activity of lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1), increased H3K4 mono-methylation, and decreased H3K4 di- and tri-methylation in the hippocampus. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 through oral ORY-1001 treatment normalized abnormal H3K4 methylation and rescued the behavioral and cognitive deficits in HERV-W ENV mice. In conclusion, our study suggests that the expression of HERV-W ENV has the capacity to disrupt various behavioral and cognitive functions and to alter the brain transcriptome in a manner that is highly relevant to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, our study identified epigenetic pathways that may offer avenues for pharmacological interventions against behavioral and cognitive deficits induced by increased HERW-W expression.

AB  - The early transition to Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a period of accelerated brain atrophy that exceeds normal ageing. Identifying the molecular basis of this atrophy could facilitate the discovery of novel drug targets. The precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a well characterized neurotrophin, is increased in the hippocampus of aged rodents, while its mature isoform is relatively stable. This imbalance could increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease by precipitating its pathological hallmarks. However, less is known about how relative levels of these isoforms change in middle-aged mice. In addition, the underlying mechanisms that might cause an imbalance are unknown. The main aim of this study was to determine how precursor brain-derived neurotrophic factor changes relative to its mature isoform with normal brain ageing in wild type mice. A secondary aim was to determine if signaling through the neurotrophin receptor, p75 influences this ratio. An increasing ratio was identified in several brain regions, except the hippocampus, suggesting a neurotrophic imbalance occurs as early as middle age. Some changes in receptors that mediate the isoforms effects were also identified, but these did not correspond with trends in the isoforms. Relative amounts of precursor brain-derived neurotrophic factor were mostly unchanged in mutant p75 mice. The lack of changes suggested that signaling through the receptor had no influence on the ratio.

AB  - Simple Summary Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as an accurate and promising alternative to traditional wet chemistry methods in feed and food science. Its applicability extends to estimating concentrations of compounds such as n-alkanes, based on their chemical properties, in various materials, including feed and feces. Analysis of excreta n-alkane patterns can provide insight into the dietary behavior of laying hens, particularly in scenarios where they have access to free-range areas and potentially consume plants from outside sources. Our study attempts to explore extreme cases, such as hens consuming only commercial feed, which result in lower concentrations of n-alkanes in excreta, thus challenging NIRS as a replacement for wet chemistry. Evaluating the accuracy of NIRS in predicting n-alkanes in excreta is critical because of its potential for substantial time and cost savings. Furthermore, it contributes to a deeper understanding of future nutritional strategies for laying hens, particularly in light of external nutritional contributions.Abstract N-alkanes offer a promising approach for assessing the nutritional contribution of external sources to the diets of laying hens in free-range production systems. However, traditional laboratory methods, involving extraction, purification and gas chromatographic analysis, are both economically burdensome and time-consuming. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is emerging as a viable alternative, with varying degrees of accuracy depending on the chemical nature and concentration of the component of interest. In our research, we focus on the accuracy of NIRS in predicting the concentrations of n-alkanes (C25-C33) in excreta under simulated free-range conditions with two different diets: one containing a commercial feed with minimal n-alkane content and another containing 1% alfalfa on top of the commercial feed. Spectra processing and calibration were tailored for each n-alkane, with NIRS performance influenced by diet type. Notably, plant predictions using NIR-generated data were consistent with laboratory results, despite a slight tendency toward overestimation (3.40% using the NIRS-generated C25-C29-C33 combination versus 2.80% using laboratory analysis). This indicates the potential of NIRS as an efficient tool to assess n-alkanes in excreta of laying hens and, consequently, the nutritional contribution of the free-range environment, providing rapid and cost-effective results.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSV) are responsible for one of the most economically important diseases affecting the global pig industry. On-farm high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration systems can effectively reduce airborne transmission of PRRSV and the incidence of PRRS, but they are costly, and their adoption is limited. Therefore, there is a need for low-cost alternatives, such as antimicrobial filters impregnated with antiviral nanoparticles (AVNP). During the past 10 years, tailored intermetallic/multi-elemental AVNP compositions have demonstrated effective performance against human viruses. In this study, a panel of five AVNP was evaluated for viricidal activity against PRRSV. Three AVNP materials: AVNP2, copper nanoparticles (CuNP), and copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONP), were shown to exert a significant reduction (>99.99%) in virus titers at 1.0% (w/v) concentration. Among the three, CuNP was the most effective at lower concentrations. Further experiments revealed that AVNP generated significant reductions in viral titers within just 1.5 min. For an optimal reduction in viral titers, direct contact between viruses and AVNP was required. This was further explained by the inert nature of these AVNP, where only negligible leaching concentrations of Ag/Cu ions (0.06-4.06 ppm) were detected in AVNP supernatants. Real-time dynamic light scatting (DLS) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analyses suggested that the mono-dispersive hydrodynamic behavior of AVNPs may have enhanced their antiviral activity against PRRSV. Collectively, these data support the further evaluation of these AVNP as candidate nanoparticles for incorporation into antimicrobial air-filtration systems to reduce transmission of PRRSV and other airborne pathogens.

AB  - Most studies related to hemp are focused on Cannabidiol (CBD) and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); however, up to 120 types of phytocannabinoids are present in hemp. Hemp leaves contain large amounts of Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), which are acidic variants of CBD and THC and account for the largest proportion of CBDA. In recent studies, CBDA exhibited anti-hyperalgesia and anti-inflammatory effects. THCA also showed anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects that may be beneficial for treating neurodegenerative diseases. CBDA and THCA can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and affect the central nervous system. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CBDA and THCA ameliorate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like features in vitro and in vivo. The effect of CBDA and THCA was evaluated in the A beta(1-42)-treated mouse model. We observed that A beta(1-42)-treated mice had more hippocampal A beta and p-tau levels, pathological markers of AD, and loss of cognitive function compared with PBS-treated mice. However, CBDA- and THCA-treated mice showed decreased hippocampal A beta and p-tau and superior cognitive function compared with A beta(1-42)-treated mice. In addition, CBDA and THCA lowered A beta and p-tau levels, alleviated calcium dyshomeostasis, and exhibited neuroprotective effects in primary neurons. Our results suggest that CBDA and THCA have anti-AD effects and mitigate memory loss and resilience to increased hippocampal Ca2+, A beta, and p-tau levels. Together, CBDA and THCA may be useful therapeutic agents for treating AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by the slow and progressive loss of brain structure and function, primarily affecting older individuals. Evidence has shown that disruption of zinc homeostasis in the brain contributes to synaptic dysfunction, as well as impairments in learning and memory. In this study, we evaluated the effect of zeolite zinc on memory performance and hippocampal cell death in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by intracerebroventricular administration of A beta(1-42). We employed the Morris water maze, shuttle box, and open field tests to assess spatial memory, passive avoidance memory, and anxiety-like behavior, respectively. P-Tau and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, along with hippocampal cell death, were also evaluated. Both A beta(1-42) and zeolite zinc were injected intracerebroventricularly. The results showed that zeolite zinc partially reversed A beta(1-42)-induced impairments in memory performance and mitigated the effects of A beta(1-42) on locomotor activity, although it did not fully restore baseline levels. In addition, A beta(1-42) increased the expression of APP and P-Tau, as well as the number of dead cells, whereas zeolite zinc reduced these effects. In conclusion, our findings suggest that while zeolite zinc plays a role in modulating the pathophysiology of AD, its therapeutic effects only partially reverse the progression or symptoms of AD, indicating the need for further investigation into optimal dosing or combination therapies.

AB  - Thimerosal (THIM) kills brain neurons via induction of apoptosis and necrosis and induces the pathological features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in rats. THIM also affects the function of glutamatergic receptors. On the other hand, exercise induces both improvement and impairment effects on memory, depending on intensity, type, and duration. Treadmill exercise can also alter the expression of glutamatergic receptors. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of THIM and three protocols of treadmill exercise on social interaction memory and hippocampal expression of GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B in rats. THIM was injected intramuscularly at the dose of 300 mu g/kg. The three-chamber apparatus was used to evaluate social interaction memory, and western blotting was used to assess protein expression. The results showed that THIM impaired social memory. Exercise 1 impaired social affiliation in controls. Social memory was impaired in all exercise groups of controls. Exercise 1 + 2 impaired social affiliation in THIM rats. Social memory was impaired in all groups of THIM rats. Exercises 2 and 1 + 2 decreased the expression of GluN1, and exercise 1 increased the expression of GluN2A and GluN2B in controls. THIM increased the expression of GluN2B, while exercise 1 reversed this effect. All exercise protocols increased the expression of GluN2A, and exercises 2 and 1 + 2 increased the expression of GluN1 in THIM rats. In conclusion, both THIM and exercise impaired social memory. Of note, the results did not show a separate and influential role for glutamatergic subunits in modulating memory processes following THIM injection or exercise.

AB  - The genus Camelina (Brassicaceae) comprises 7-8 diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid species. Of particular agricultural interest is the biofuel crop, C. sativa (gold-of-pleasure or false flax), an allohexaploid domesticated from the widespread weed, C. microcarpa. Recent cytogenetics and genomics work has uncovered the identity of the parental diploid species involved in ancient polyploidization events in Camelina. However, little is known about the maternal subgenome ancestry of contemporary polyploid species. To determine the diploid maternal contributors of polyploid Camelina lineages, we sequenced and assembled 84 Camelina chloroplast genomes for phylogenetic analysis. Divergence time estimation was used to infer the timing of polyploidization events. Chromosome counts were also determined for 82 individuals to assess ploidy and cytotypic variation. Chloroplast genomes showed minimal divergence across the genus, with no observed gene-loss or structural variation. Phylogenetic analyses revealed C. hispida as a maternal diploid parent to the allotetraploid Camelina rumelica, and C. neglecta as the closest extant diploid contributor to the allohexaploids C. microcarpa and C. sativa. The tetraploid C. rumelica appears to have evolved through multiple independent hybridization events. Divergence times for polyploid lineages closely related to C. sativa were all inferred to be very recent, at only similar to 65 thousand years ago. Chromosome counts confirm that there are two distinct cytotypes within C. microcarpa (2n = 38 and 2n = 40). Based on these findings and other recent research, we propose a model of Camelina subgenome relationships representing our current understanding of the hybridization and polyploidization history of this recently-diverged genus.

AB  - Currently, wound dressing is often used to accelerate wound healing, avoid contaminations from the external environment and protect wound from infections, control moisture around the wound, meanwhile being biocompatible and non-toxic. Thin film metallic glass (TFMG) possess amorphous structure that driven to several unique properties such as excellent strength and high surface smoothness. Zr-based (Zr63.5Cu19.9Al11.5Ni5.1 (at%)) and W-based (W65.4Ni30.5B4.1) metallic glasses were selected as the candidate of nanotube array in this study. A layered structure Zr/W/Zr-based TFMGs were deposited on a nanotube array template and then fabricated into MeNTA and applied as a substrate of wound dressing. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and hyaluronic acid/ gold nanoparticles (HA/AuNPs) composite were loaded into the MeNTA under vacuum ambient. Animal test was conducted on live pigs in order to observe the improvement in wound healing and wound biopsy by attaching drug-loaded MeNTA. After loading the drugs into nanotubes array, significant change in diameter and surface appearance of nanotube is observed. In the animal test, both HA and HA/AuNPs loaded MeNTA accelerated wound healing process up to 96.4% and 90.5%, respectively. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Caspase-3 cleaved tau (truncated tau) is a pathological modification in tau protein that contributes to neurofibrillary tangle formation (NFTs) and neurodegeneration in AD. Our previous studies indicate that truncated tau affects mitochondrial health, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive performance. Therefore, we studied the effects of sulforaphane (SFN), a natural compound activator of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway present in vegetables and sprouts, on neurodegeneration and cognitive decline induced by truncated tau expression in vivo. We induced a 2-month hippocampal expression of GFP, full-length (AAV-Syn-GFP-T4) and truncated tau (AAV-Syn-GFP-T4C3) using a stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated-virus-9 (AAV9) linked to GFP and a synapsin neuronal promoter in tau (-/-) mice. Hippocampal tau-expressing mice were treated with SFN, and their cognitive performance (NOR, NOL, and Barnes maze tests) and hippocampal mitochondrial function were analyzed. Interestingly, hippocampal truncated tau expression significantly affected cognitive and memory abilities, accompanied by increased ROS and severe mitochondrial dysfunction (depolarization, ATP loss, dynamics deregulation). Notably, the treatment with SFN (50 mg/kg/day, i.p., two weeks) prevented cognitive impairment and reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics defects induced by hippocampal truncated tau expression. These findings suggest a potential role of SFN in ameliorating cognitive loss and mitochondrial impairment promoted by tau pathology in neurological disorders (NDs).

AB  - Our objective was to determine effects of melatonin or L-arginine on quality of frozen-thawed sperm from heat-stressed (HS) rams. Ten Dorset rams were randomly allocated to either scrotal neck insulation for 3.5 d or whole-body heating (28 degrees C and 30-34% RH for 8 h/d for 4 consecutive days). Semen was collected before HS then once weekly for 1-5 wk, extended (Steridyl CSS One Step (R)), and divided into 5 aliquots: control (no additive) or 0.5- or 1-mM of melatonin or Larginine. For total and progressive motility (CASA), there were effects of group (P = 0.023 and P = 0.008, respectively); for morphological abnormalities (eosin-nigrosin), effects of group (P = 0.01) and a group*week interaction (P = 0.03); and for acrosome integrity (FITC-PSA), effects of group (P = 0.046) and week (P = 0.001). All 4 treatments improved motility (-5-10% points), whereas 1 mM of either compound optimized abnormalities and acrosomal integrity (-7% and 12% points, respectively). For superoxide dismutase and catalase, there were effects of week (P = 0.01 and P = 0.045, respectively), with 1 mM of either additive yielding best results. For DNA fragmentation index (DFI%), there was an effect of week (P = 0.01), and a group*week interaction (P = 0.05), with all 4 treatments reducing DFI%. For total ROS%, there was an effect of week (P = 0.044) and a group*week interaction (P = 0.037), with 1 mM melatonin or L-arginine being best. The hypothesis that melatonin or L-arginine improve quality of frozen-thawed sperm from HS rams was supported; 1 mM of either gave best results, except 0.5 mM minimized DFI%.

AB  - The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial for neural circuit functionality, synaptic plasticity, and learning. While the role of the ECM in excitatory synapses has been extensively studied, its influence on inhibitory synapses, particularly on GABAergic long-term plasticity, remains poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the effects of ECM components on inhibitory synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region. We focus on the roles of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and hyaluronic acid in modulating inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at two distinct inhibitory synapses formed by somatostatin (SST)-positive and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons onto pyramidal cells (PCs). Using optogenetic stimulation in brain slices, we observed that acute degradation of ECM constituents by hyaluronidase or chondroitinase-ABC did not affect basal inhibitory synaptic transmission. However, short-term plasticity, particularly burst-induced depression, was enhanced at PV-*PC synapses following enzymatic treatments. Long-term plasticity experiments demonstrated that CSPGs are essential for NMDA-induced iLTP at SST-*PC synapses, whereas the digestion of hyaluronic acid by hyaluronidase impaired iLTP at PV-*PC synapses. This indicates a synapse-specific role of CSPGs and hyaluronic acid in regulating GABAergic plasticity. Additionally, we report the presence of cryptic GABAergic plasticity at PV-*PC synapses induced by prolonged NMDA application, which became evident after CSPG digestion and was absent under control conditions. Our results underscore the differential impact of ECM degradation on inhibitory synaptic plasticity, highlighting the synapse-specific interplay between ECM components and specific GABAergic synapses. This offers new perspectives in studies on learning and critical period timing.

AB  - Obesity is known to affect various tissues and contribute to conditions such as neuroinflammation. However, the specific mechanisms and time-dependent progression of these effects across different tissues remain unclear. In this study, we monitored gene expression at intervals to examine the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on brain, liver, adipose, and muscle tissues in male C57/BJ mice, with a particular focus on neuroinflammation. Early inflammatory responses exhibit a progression that starts in the liver, extends to adipose tissue, and subsequently involves muscle and brain tissues. Although the brain did not show significant gene expression of inflammatory responses, mechanisms leading to neuroinflammation increased after 24 weeks, possibly through systemic chronic inflammation (SCI). Notably, mitochondrial complex I activity serves as a biomarker to indicate the inflammatory transition from the liver to adipose and other tissues caused by SCI. These similar gene expression dynamics were also observed in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's patients and in an Alzheimer's mouse model treated with a HFD. These results suggest that initially, the brain suppresses inflammatory responses, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), more than other tissues in response to a HFD. However, at the onset of SCI, the brain eventually exhibits inflammatory dynamics similar to those of other tissues. This underscores the significance of our findings, indicating that the early kinetics of chronic IFN-gamma response and mitochondrial complex I activity inhibition serve as crucial biomarkers, emerging early in various conditions, including obesity and aging.

AB  - BackgroundEwing sarcomas (ESs) are aggressive paediatric tumours of bone and soft tissues afflicting children and adolescents. Despite current therapies having improved the 5-year survival rate to 70% in patients with localized disease, 25% of patients relapse and most have metastasis at diagnosis. Resistance to chemotherapy, together with the high propensity to metastasize, remain the main causes of treatment failure. Thus, identifying novel targets for alternative therapeutic approaches is urgently needed.MethodsBiochemical and functional analyses were carried out to elucidate the mechanism of regulation of YAP1 expression by pncRNA_YAP1-1 in ES cells.ResultsHere, we identified a novel promoter-associated noncoding RNA, pncRNA_YAP1-1, transcribed from the YAP1 promoter in ES cells. We found that pncRNA_YAP1-1 level exerts antitumour effects on ES by destabilizing YAP1 protein. The molecular mechanism relies on the interaction of pncRNA_YAP1-1 with the RNA binding protein FUS, which stabilizes the transcript. Furthermore, pncRNA_YAP1-1 binding to TEAD impairs its interaction with YAP1, thus determining YAP1 translocation into the cytoplasm, its phosphorylation and degradation.ConclusionsOverall, our findings reveal a novel layer of regulation of YAP1 protein expression by pncRNA_YAP1-1 in Ewing sarcoma. Considering the role of YAP1 in therapy response and cell propensity to metastasize, our results indicate pncRNA_YAP1-1 as an actionable target that could be exploited to enhance chemotherapy efficacy in Ewing sarcoma.SignificancePncRNA_YAP1-1 counteracts the YAP1 oncogenic transcriptional program in Ewing sarcoma cells by interfering with YAP1-TEAD interaction and impairing YAP1 protein stability. These findings uncover a novel treatment option for Ewing sarcoma.

AB  - Whether it involves human subjects or non-human animals, basic, translational, or clinical sleep research poses significant ethical challenges for researchers and ethical committees alike. Sleep research greatly benefits from using diverse animal models, each offering unique insights into sleep control mechanisms. The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a superior genetic model due to its quick generation period, large progenies, and rich genetic tools. Its well-characterized genome and ability to respond to hypnotics and stimulants make it an effective tool for studying sleep genetics and physiological foundations. The nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) has a simpler neural organization and transparent body, allowing researchers to explore molecular underpinnings of sleep control. Vertebrate models, like zebrafish (Danio rerio), provide insights into circadian rhythm regulation, memory consolidation, and drug effects on sleep. Invertebrate models, like California sea hare (Aplysia californica) and Upside-down jellyfish (Cassiopea xamachana), have simpler nervous systems and behave similarly to humans, allowing for the examination of sleep principles without logistical and ethical challenges. Combining vertebrate and invertebrate animal models offers a comprehensive approach to studying sleep, improving our understanding of sleep regulation and potentially leading to new drug discovery processes for sleep disorders and related illnesses.

AB  - The default mode network (DMN) is activated when constructing and imagining narrative events, with functional brain activity in the medial-prefrontal cortex hypothesized to be modulated during emotional processing by adding value (or pleasure) to the episodic representation. However, since enhanced reactivity during emotional, compared to neutral, content is a more frequent finding in both the brain and body in physiological, neural, and behavioral measures, the current study directly assesses the effects of pleasure and emotion during narrative imagery in the DMN by using a within-subject design to first identify the DMN during resting state and then assess activation during pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant imagery. Replicating previous findings, enhanced functional activity in the medial prefrontal cortex was found when imagining pleasant, compared to unpleasant, events. On the other hand, emotion-related activation was found when imagining either pleasant or unpleasant, compared to neutral, events in other nodes of the DMN including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), angular gyrus, anterior hippocampus, lateral temporal cortex, temporal pole, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC). Pervasive emotional modulation in the DMN is consistent with the view that a primary function of event retrieval and construction is to remember, recreate, and imagine motivationally relevant events important for planning adaptive behavior.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread in the food system is a major threat to public and animal health. We describe AMR trends in zoonotic bacteria and identify risk factors associated with AMR occurrence in animals and derived food in Portugal. Data from the Portuguese AMR surveillance programme on food-producing animals, 2014-2018, were used. AMR frequencies were calculated for Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and Salmonella in broilers, turkeys, pig populations and their derived food products. AMR-associated factors were studied for Salmonella isolates: population, sampling stage (farm, slaughterhouse and processing plant), sample type (environmental, carcase and food), sampler (HACCP, industry, official and official and industry), sample context (control and eradication programmes and monitoring), year (2014-2018) and season. Logistic regression was applied to estimate crude odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The final models were obtained using a backward stepwise method. This study included 2,157 Escherichia coli, 561 Campylobacter and 1,071 Salmonella isolates. The highest prevalence estimates amongst tested antimicrobials for each bacterial species in 2014-2018 had the following ranges: (i) (fluoro)quinolones: E. coli: 84%-93%, Campylobacter: 94%-98%; (ii) tetracyclines: E. coli: 68%-91%, Campylobacter: 87%-91%, Salmonella: 72%; (iii) penicillins: E. coli: 82%-100%; (iv) sulphonamides: E. coli: 68%-82%. Compared with the reference categories for host (broiler), year (2014), season (winter) and sampler (HACCP own checks), resistance to at least one antimicrobial in Salmonella was significantly less likely in laying hens (aOR 0.28; 95% CI: 0.18-0.42), 2016 (aOR 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33-0.93), 2017 (aOR 0.29; 95% CI: 0.17-0.51) and 2018 (aOR 0.35; 95% CI: 0.20-0.61), autumn (aOR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.40-0.97) and more likely to occur in broiler products (aOR 5.14; 95% CI: 2.61-10.54), pork products (aOR 6.84; 95% CI: 3.74-12.98) and official and industry combined sampling (aOR 2.16; 95% CI: 1.06-4.47). This study reveals a high prevalence of Salmonella resistance, especially during the summer and in post-farm stages of the Portuguese food system to nearly all antimicrobials and in the summer in farms to (fluoro)quinolones. Measures to tackle resistance are required.

AB  - Oxidative stress generating DNA damage has been shown to be a key characteristic in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how it affects the pathogenesis of AD is not yet fully understood. Neil3 is a DNA glycosylase initiating repair of oxidative DNA base lesions and with a distinct expression pattern in proliferating cells. In brain, its function has been linked to hippocampal-dependent memory and to induction of neurogenesis after stroke and in prion disease. Here, we generated a novel AD mouse model deficient for Neil3 to study the impact of impaired oxidative base lesion repair on the pathogenesis of AD. Our results demonstrate an age-dependent decrease in amyloid-beta (A beta) plaque deposition in female Neil3-deficient AD mice, whereas no significant difference was observed in male mice. Furthermore, male but not female Neil3-deficient AD mice show reduced neural stem cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus and impaired working memory compared to controls. These effects seem to be independent of DNA repair as both sexes show increased level of oxidative base lesions in the hippocampus upon loss of Neil3. Thus, our findings suggest an age-and sex-dependent role of Neil3 in the progression of AD by altering cerebral A beta accumulation and promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis to maintain cognitive function.

AB  - The origin of 9, 10-anthraquinone (AQ) contamination in tea remains unclear at present. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that AQ could be produced from the precursor anthracene in tea plantations. To test this hy-pothesis, the uptake, translocation, and transformation of anthracene in tea (Camellia sinensis) seedlings using hydro-ponic experimentation was investigated. Anthracene concentrations in tea tissues rose with increased anthracene exposure, which in the roots were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those in aboveground parts at the end of the ex-posure. These results indicated that anthracene tended to be adsorbed into tea seedling via the roots and accumulated largely within roots. The three main pathways of anthracene degradation in tea seedlings were suggested: oxygen was incorporated in the 9th and 10th positions of anthracene resulting in AQ (I) and anthrone (II), and naphthalene was formed by ring fission of anthracene via methylanthracene (III). The principal anthracene metabolites were AQ and anthrone. The concentrations of AQ, like anthrone, were markedly elevated in the roots than those in stems throughout the entire exposure period. Moreover, the translocation factors for anthracene and its primary metabolites AQ and anthrone from roots to stems were persistently lower than 0.1, demonstrating a poor translocation from roots to the aboveground regions. However, tea seedlings could take anthracene up from water and translocate it to the leaves. It was a possible risk for AQ contamination in tea leaves continuously exposed to anthracene for long periods of time because tea plants were perennial crops.

AB  - Childhood exposure to nitrogen oxides (NOx) is considered a risk factor for the onset of asthma. However, associations of this exposure with other atopic diseases and factors that modify this association are less clear. We aimed to study associations between exposure to NOx and the prevalence of atopic diseases in Israeli adolescents using a cross-sectional design. The study population comprised all Israeli-born adolescents whose medical status was evaluated for mandatory military recruitment during 1967-2017 (n = 2,523,745), of whom 5.9% had prevalent asthma. We based the exposure assessments on a land-use regression model and estimated associations using multivariable logistic regression models. Across all periods, mean exposure to NOx from birth to adolescence was associated with prevalent asthma at the examination in a dose-response manner, with an odds ratio for the upper quintile of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.56-1.67), in comparison to the lowest quintile. Associations were stronger in males and in lower socioeconomic strata. We found the strongest associations for asthma with comorbid rhinitis, with an almost twofold increase in the odds of upper versus lower quintile of exposure (odds ratio = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.82-2.11). Rhino-conjunctivitis and allergic atopic dermatitis suggested a possible threshold level with NOx. Capsule Summary: Research indicates that half of the global population will suffer from an allergic condition at some point in life. Childhood exposure to nitrogen oxides is a risk factor for the onset of asthma. The association between exposure and allergic diseases other than asthma is unclear. We demonstrate a strong, dose-response relationship between exposure and a group of allergic outcomes, using data comprising 2.5 million subjects over 50 years. The large health benefits from clean air should motivate governments to prioritize mitigation measures.</p>

AB  - The study was aimed to evaluate the effects of hydro-ethanol extract Zataria multiflora on the brain tissue oxidative damage, and hippocampal interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as learning and memory capacity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - challenged rats. The rats were randomized into five groups as follow: Control group: Rats were treated with saline, LPS group: Rats were treated with LPS 1.00 mg kgt, ZM50, ZM100 and ZM200 groups in which the rats were treated with Z. multiflora extract (50.00, 100 or 200 mg kg(-1) per day, respectively). The treatments including extract or vehicle were administered intraperitoneally and given three days before the behavioral tests and were continued within a6-day behavioral experiment. Injection of LPS was daily done before the behavioral tests. Finally, the brains were collected for biochemical evaluations. Although LPS administration prolonged the latency in Morris water maze and shortened the latency to enter the dark chamber in passive avoidance test, ZM extract restored these changes to approach control group values. Also, LPS increased IL-6, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites levels and lowered thiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels in the brain, however, Z. multiflora extract reduced IL-6, MDA and NO metabolites concentrations, but increased thiol content, SOD, and CAT levels. The results of this study showed that Z. multiflora ameliorated learning and memory dysfunction in LPS - challenged rats by alleviating of inflammatory responses and brain tissue oxidative damage.

AB  - Benzyl nitrile from tea plants attacked by various pests displays a diurnal pattern, which may be closely regulated by the endogenous circadian clock. However, the molecular mechanism by the circadian clock of tea plants that regulates the biosynthesis and release of volatiles remains unclear. In this study, the circadian clock gene CsPCL1 can activate both the expression of the benzyl nitrile biosynthesis-related gene CsCYP79 and the jasmonic acid signaling-related transcription factor CsMYC2 involved in upregulating CsCYP79 gene, thereby resulting in the accumulation and release of benzyl nitrile. Therefore, the anti-insect function of benzyl nitrile was explored in the laboratory. The application of slow-release beads of benzyl nitrile in tea plantations significantly reduced the number of tea geometrids and had positive effects on the yield of fresh tea leaves. These findings reveal the potential utility of herbivore-induced plant volatiles for the green control of pests in tea plantations.

AB  - The function of biomolecular condensates is often restricted by condensate dissolution. Whether conden-sates can be suppressed without condensate dissolution is unclear. Here, we show that upstream regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway form functionally antagonizing condensates, and their coalescence into a common phase provides a mode of counteracting the function of biomolecular condensates without conden-sate dissolution. Specifically, the negative regulator SLMAP forms Hippo-inactivating condensates to facil-itate pathway inhibition by the STRIPAK complex. In response to cell-cell contact or osmotic stress, the positive regulators AMOT and KIBRA form Hippo-activating condensates to facilitate pathway activation. The functionally antagonizing SLMAP and AMOT/KIBRA condensates further coalesce into a common phase to inhibit STRIPAK function. These findings provide a paradigm for restricting the activity of biomolecular condensates without condensate dissolution, shed light on the molecular principles of multiphase organiza-tion, and offer a conceptual framework for understanding upstream regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway.

AB  - Cholesterol-24-hydroxylase (CYP46), a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, is selectively expressed in the brain and is mainly responsible for cholesterol turnover in the central nervous system. Although increased cyp46A1 gene expression has been linked to cognitive alterations in aging and observed in neurodegenerative diseases and after traumatic brain injury, a detailed characterization of the brain regions and cell types in which CYP46 is expressed in old individuals has not been performed. Using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, we investigated the specific regions and cell populations in the brain, in which cyp46A1 is expressed in 24-month-old mice. We found that CYP46 is localized in the same neuronal populations in young and old brains, mainly in the hippocampus, in cortical layers, and in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. No increase in CYP46 levels was found in astrocytes in old mice brains, in primary astrocyte-neuron cocultures aged in vitro, or in primary cultures of senescent astrocytes. However, interleukin-6 treatment strongly induced cyp46A1 expression in reactive astrocytes characterized by high GFAP levels but had no effect in nonactivated astrocytes. Our data suggest that cholesterol-24-hydroxylase expression is triggered in reactive astrocytes in response to proinflammatory signals, probably as part of a response mechanism to injury.

AB  - Current evidence suggests that protein synthesis dysfunction within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the small intestine in animals with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) may be a potential factor contributing to the adverse postnatal outcomes associated with intestinal growth and development. However, little is known about whether the impaired protein-folding capacity of ER triggers the adaptive cellular response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), as well as the subsequent signaling pathways leading to cellular apoptosis in the intestines of IUGR pigs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the structural integrity of the ER and elucidate the potential signaling cascade of the UPR, which may mitigate the effects of ER stress (ERS) within the intestinal mucosa of IUGR neonates. The results showed that the mitochondrial swelling and ER dilation in the intestinal mucosa, resulting from restricted intrauterine development, occur on the neonatal day. The activation of the IRE1 alpha and PERK pathways within the UPR, in response to ERS, was observed in the intestines of IUGR newborn piglets, leading to apoptosis in intestinal cells mediated by the transcription factor CHOP. Understanding this apoptotic mechanism underlying the structural and functional impairment in the guts of animals with IUGR is crucial for identifying potential preventive strategies. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in piglets is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality after birth due to gut dysfunction, and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study selected six pairs of IUGR newborn male piglets and normal birth weight newborn piglets (Large White x Landrace) to investigate differences in intestinal structure and digestive functions, intestinal ERS and apoptosis, intestinal barrier function, and inflammatory response. The results showed that IUGR significantly reduced the jejunal villi height (p < 0.05) and the ratio of villus-height-to-crypt-depth (p = 0.05) in neonatal piglets. Additionally, the microvilli in the jejunum of IUGR neonatal piglets were shorter than those in normal-weight piglets, and swelling of the mitochondria and expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum were observed. IUGR also significantly reduced serum glucose and lactase levels (p < 0.05) while significantly increasing mRNA levels of jejunal IRE1 alpha, EIF2 alpha, CHOP, Bax, Caspase9, Mucin2, Claudin-1, Occludin, ZO-1, Bcl-2, IL-6, and IFN-gamma (p < 0.05), as well as GRP78 protein levels in neonatal piglets (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that IUGR impairs intestinal structure and barrier function in newborn piglets by enhancing intestinal inflammatory responses, activating intestinal ERS and the signaling pathways related to the unfolded protein response, thereby inducing ERS-related apoptosis.

AB  - Mycotoxin contamination of animal feed leads to deleterious effects on the health and performance of animals. Sodium metabisulfite (SMBS) can detoxify the common mycotoxin deoxynivalenol in vivo; however, it degrades in aqueous and acidic conditions like the stomach, leading to further discomfort. Nanofibers are an effective encapsulation method to deliver drugs to various points along the gastrointestinal tract. This study aims to encapsulate SMBS into nanofibrous mats to allow for the targeted delivery of intact SMBS to the small intestine of pigs and evaluate the efficacy of DON detoxification in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) using IPEC-J2 cells in vitro. Coaxial electrospinning of a solution of a pH-sensitive polymer (Eudragit L100-55) produced nanofibrous mats with a peak loading capacity of SMBS reaching 35.8% and loading efficiency reaching 89.4%. In vitro release studies showed 47.5-49.7% of the encapsulated SMBS was released in the simulated gastric fluid (SGF) within 2 h, while the remaining 44.0-50.2% of loaded SMBS was released within 2 h of exposure to SIF. Additionally, DON detoxification via SMBS-containing nanofibers was confirmed in vitro using IPEC-J2 cells, as seen through decreased gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and improved maintenance of cell integrity in cells exposed to DON treated with SMBS-containing nanofibers as opposed to DON alone. For the first time, we demonstrate the successful encapsulation of particulate SMBS within a nano-vehicle (electrospun nanofibers), limited release of SMBS from the nano-vehicle in SGF, and around 50% release in SIF, and effective detoxification of DON by the SMBS-containing nano-vehicle in an IPEC-J2 cell assay.

AB  - Lead (Pb) toxicity, through ingestion of lead ammunition in carcasses, is a threat to scavenging birds worldwide, but has received little attention in Australia. We analyzed lead exposure in the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), the largest raptor species found in mainland Australia and a facultative scavenger. Eagle carcasses were collected opportunistically throughout south-eastern mainland Australia between 1996 and 2022. Lead concentrations were measured in bone samples from 62 animals via portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Lead was detected (concentration >1 ppm) in 84% (n = 52) of the bone samples. The mean lead concentration of birds in which lead was detected was 9.10 ppm (& PLUSMN;SE 1.66). Bone lead concentrations were elevated (10-20 ppm) in 12.9% of samples, and severe (>20 ppm) in 4.8% of samples. These proportions are moderately higher than equivalent data for the same species from the island of Tasmania, and are comparable to data from threatened eagle species from other continents. Lead exposure at these levels is likely to have negative impacts on wedge-tailed eagles at the level of the individual and perhaps at a population level. Our results suggest that studies of lead exposure in other Australian avian scavenger species are warranted.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that F-53B exposure may be neurotoxic to animals, but there is a lack of epidemiological evidence, and its mechanism needs further investigation.Methods: Serum F-53B concentrations and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were evaluated in 314 growing children from Guangzhou, China, and the association between them were analyzed. To study the developmental neurotoxicity of F-53B, experiments on sucking mice exposed via placental transfer and breast milk was performed. Maternal mice were orally exposed to 4, 40, and 400 mu g/L of F-53B from postnatal day 0 (GD0) to postnatal day 21 (PND 21). Several genes and proteins related to neurodevelopment, dopamine anabolism, and synaptic plasticity were examined by qPCR and western blot, respectively, while dopamine contents were detected by ELISA kit in weaning mice.Results: The result showed that F-53B was positively associated with poor WCST performance. For example, with an interquartile range increase in F-53B, the change with 95 % confidence interval (CI) of correct response (CR), and non-perseverative errors (NPE) was -2.47 (95 % CI: -3.89, -1.05, P = 0.001), 2.78 (95 % CI: 0.79, 4.76, P = 0.007), respectively. Compared with the control group, the highest exposure group of weaning mice had a longer escape latency (35.24 s vs. 51.18 s, P = 0.034) and a lesser distance movement (34.81 % vs. 21.02 %, P < 0.001) in the target quadrant, as observed from morris water maze (MWM) test. The protein expression of brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) levels were decreased, as compared to control (0.367-fold, P < 0.001; 0.366-fold, P < 0.001; respectively). We also observed the upregulation of dopamine transporter (DAT) (2.940-fold, P < 0.001) consistent with the trend of dopamine content (1.313-fold, P < 0.001) in the hippocampus.Conclusion: Early life exposure to F-53B is associated with adverse neurobehavioral changes in developing children and weaning mice which may be modulated by dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Cigarette smoke is a harmful air pollutant and nicotine dependence is the essential cause of the tobacco epidemic. Since mitochondrial abnormalities are associated with substance addiction, in this work we used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number as an indicator of mitochondrial function to investigate whether nicotine addicts also exhibit mitochondrial abnormalities. We found significantly lower mtDNA copy number in the peripheral blood of healthy nicotine addicts than in non-smokers, indicating that long-term nicotine exposure through smoking has detrimental effects on mitochondria. We also examined the effects of nicotine on mtDNA levels in a rat conditioned place preference (CPP) model of addiction and in cultured neuron cells, which revealed that the mtDNA copy number was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of CPP rats, in human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells, and in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, suggesting that significantly reduced mtDNA copy number is a potential biomarker of nicotine addiction. In SH-SY5Y cells, nicotine treatment induced several mitochondrial defects, such as increased mtDNA damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (o Psi m), and stimulation of autophagic flux via transcriptional up-regulation of several autophagy-related genes and elevated marker protein accumulation, although genes controlling mtDNA replication were unaffected. In addition, pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 led to accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3b-II (LC3B-II) and counteracted the nicotine induced decrease in mtDNA copy number. These results were recapitulated in PC12 cells, which also showed significant down-regulation of the marker SQSTM1/P62, suggesting that the decrease in mtDNA copy number is mediated by autophagy. This study shows that prolonged nicotine exposure, such as that in nicotine addicts, leads to a decrease of mtDNA copy number in neurons due to enhanced induction of autophagy. Capsule: It was found that smoking or nicotine exposure decreased mtDNA copy number based on population, animal, and cell models, and these effects appear to be mediated by autophagy.

AB  - Successful long-term cryobanking of multicellular tissues and organs at deep subzero temperatures calls for the avoidance of ice cryoinjury by reliance upon ice-free cryopreservation techniques. However, the quality of the cryopreserved material is the direct result of its ability to survive a host of harmful mechanisms, chief among which is overcoming the trifecta effects of ice crystallization, toxicity, and mechanical stress. This study aims at exploring improved conditions to scale-up ice-free cryopreservation by combining DP6 as a base cryoprotective agent (CPA) solution with an array of synthetic ice modulators (SIMs). This study is conducted by integrating cryomacroscopy techniques, thermal modeling, solid mechanics analysis, and viability and contractility investigation to correlate physical effects, thermal outcomes, and cryobiology results. As an extension of previous work, this study aims at scale-up of established baseline blood vessel models, while comparing the relative toxicity and vitreous stability of 4 ml and 10 ml samples of DP6 containing either sucrose as a SIM, or the commercial synthetic ice blockers (X1000 and Z1000). Using that established protocol, the addition and removal of DP6+0.6M sucrose and DP6 + 1% X1000 + 1% Z1000 were both well tolerated in rabbit carotid and pig femoral artery models, when assessed for metabolic recovery and contractility. Using cryomacroscopy, it was demonstrated that DP6 + 0.6M sucrose provided a stable vitrification medium under marginal cooling and warming conditions that resulted in >50% survival rate. By contrast, DP6 + 1% X1000 + 1% Z1000 was subject to visible ice formation during cooling under the same thermal conditions, resulting in a significantly lower recovery of similar to 20%. Thermal modeling is used in this study to verify the actual cooling and rewarming rates in the specimens, while thermomechanics analysis is used to explain why fractures were observed using cryomacroscopy when the specimens were contained in glass vials but not in plastic vials.

AB  - Crack cocaine is a highly addictive and potent stimulant drug. Animal studies have shown that the cholinergic system plays a role in neurotoxicity induced by cocaine or its active metabolites inhalation. Behavioral alterations associated with crack cocaine use include hyperactivity, depressed mood, and decreased seizure threshold. Here we evaluate the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, behavioral profile, and the threshold for epileptic seizures in rats that received intrahippocampal pilocarpine (H-PILO) followed by exposure to crack cocaine (H-PILO + CRACK). Animals exposed to H-PILO + CRACK demonstrated increased severity and frequency of limbic seizures. The AChE activity was reduced in the groups exposed to crack cocaine alone (CRACK) and H-PILO + CRACK, whereas levels of ROS remained unchanged. In addition, crack cocaine exposure increased vertical locomotor activity, without changing water and sucrose intake. Short-term memory consolidation remained unchanged after H-PILO, H-PILO + CRACK, and CRACK administration. Overall, our data suggest that crack cocaine inhalation reduced the threshold for epileptic seizures in rats submitted to low doses of pilocarpine through the inhibition of AChE. Taken together, our findings can be useful in the development of effective strategies for preventing and treating the harmful effects of cocaine and crack cocaine on the central nervous system.

AB  - The current study investigated the concentration of heavy metals (HMs) in human hair associated with fish and rice consumption in Wuhan City, central China. The mean values of As in 8/10 fish species exceeded the food safety standard of 0.015 mg/kg. The mean values (mg/kg) of HMs in rice followed a descending order of Zn (13.7)> Cu (1.9)>Cr (0.51)>As (0.11) >Cd (0.08) >Pb (0.04). The ascending order of HMs for male hair was Cd < As < Cr < Pb < Cu < Zn, while As < Cd < Cr < Pb < Cu < Zn for female. 30% of hair Cr and 22% of hair Zn contents exceeded the recommended values. The middle age (19-44) and adult (45-59) groups were the most vulnerable group, as the concentration for most elements was high in these age groups. A significant correlation was found between fish-eating frequency and hair Zn (r = 0.213; p < 0.05), and As (r = 0.204; p < 0.05). High odd ratios were found in a population with high fish-eating frequency, especially for Pb (7.19), As (3.1), Zn (3.83), and Cd (3.7). A significant non-carcinogenic risk was associated with Cr exposure through consuming herbivores, filter feeders, and omnivorous fish. The cancer risk values of Cd exposure (1.54E-04) via rice con-sumption and As exposure (1.25E-04) via consumption of omnivores fish indicate precautionary measures.

AB  - The concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, and lead in infusion tea bags of Camellia sinensis (tea), Pimpinella anisum (anise), Matricaria recutita (chamomile), Peumus boldus (boldo), and Cymbopogon citratus (lemongrass) were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) for four commercial brands sold in Tacna, Peru, to compare these concentrations with international standards. The moderate level of arsenic obtained for C. sinensis (0.294 mg kg(-1)) exceeded the Codex Alimentarius standard for three of the four analyzed brands, while the level of arsenic in P. boldus (0.220 mg kg(-1) ) exceeded the same standard and the Mercado Comun del Sur (MERCOSUR) parameters for only one brand. The moderate level of cadmium outlined in the Codex Alimentarius and by the World Health Organization (WHO) was exceeded by two infusion tea bag brands of M. recutita (0.210 mg kg(-1)) and one brand of C. citratus (0.134 mg kg(-1)). Finally, based on the MERCOSUR parameters, moderate levels of lead were exceeded by only one brand of C. citratus (0.535 mg kg(-1)). To evaluate possible health risks, we also calculated the hazard index (HI) of the heavy metals in the target herbal tea bags. The values obtained were less than 1, showing negligible noncarcinogenic health risks for consumers. Despite this information and because of the elevated concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, and lead obtained in some of our results, we suggest more detailed studies to obtain more information about the potential toxicity of these products to humans.

AB  - Exposure to opioids can lead to the alteration of several neurotransmitters. Among these neurotransmitters, glutamate is thought to be involved in opioid dependence. Glutamate neurotransmission is mainly regulated by astrocytic glutamate transporters such as glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT). Our laboratory has shown that exposure to lower doses of hydrocodone reduced the expression of xCT in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the hippocampus. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic exposure to hydrocodone, and tested ceftriaxone as a GLT-1 upregulator in mesocorticolimbic brain regions such as the NAc, the amygdala (AMY), and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Eight-week-old male mice were divided into three groups: (1) the saline vehicle control group; (2) the hydrocodone group; and (3) the hydrocodone + ceftriaxone group. Mice were injected with hydrocodone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline for 14 days. On day seven, the hydrocodone/ceftriaxone group was injected with ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg, i.p.) for last seven days. Chronic exposure to hydrocodone reduced the expression of GLT-1, xCT, protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) in NAc, AMY, and dmPFC. However, hydrocodone exposure increased the expression of G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5) in the NAc, AMY, and dmPFC. Importantly, ceftriaxone treatment normalized the expression of mGluR5, GLT-1, and xCT in all these brain regions, except for xCT in the AMY. Importantly, ceftriaxone treatment attenuated hydrocodone-induced downregulation of signaling pathways such as AKT, ERK, and JNK expression in the NAc, AMY, and dmPFC. These findings demonstrate that ceftriaxone has potential therapeutic effects in reversing hydrocodone-induced downregulation of GLT-1 and xCT in selected reward brain regions, and this might be mediated through the downstream kinase signaling pathways such as AKT, ERK, and JNK.

AB  - Multi-objective Urban Green Space (UGS) design is essential for optimizing limited resources amid diverse urban development challenges. This study introduces a new design support tool that overcomes the data- intensive and expert-reliant limitations faced by urban designers. The tool integrates stormwater management analysis within the Rhinoceros + Grasshopper platform, offering three key features: (1) quantifying stormwater volume in the 3D model, (2) estimating the space required for stormwater management in UGS, and (3) providing options for stormwater management facilities for UGS design. Across the five scenarios, the tool effectively demonstrated (1) the identification that dispersed UGS layouts collect more stormwater than aggregated ones with the same total area; (2) the consideration of the impact of weather changes on passive stormwater collection; and (3) the provision of recommendations on facility areas and locations to enhance collaborative urban and landscape design, better addressing stormwater management needs. This design support tool empowers urban designers to create more sustainable and resilient urban landscapes by addressing stormwater management challenges effectively in UGS design.

AB  - Poor tenderness of camel meat has seriously hampered the development of the camel meat industry. This study investigated the effects of muscle fiber composition and ageing time on meat quality, glycolytic potential, and glycolysis-related enzyme activities. Muscle samples of the longissimus thoracis (LT), psoas major (PM), and semitendinosus (ST) were collected from eight 8-10 year old Sonid Bactrian camels (females). Muscle fiber composition was examined by ATPase staining and immunohistochemistry. Meat quality indexes, glycolytic potential, and activities of major glycolytic enzymes were examined at 4 degree celsius aging for 1, 6, 24, 72, and 120 h. The results showed that LT was mainly composed of type IIb muscle fibers, whereas PM and ST were mainly composed of type I muscle fibers. The PCR results of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) were consistent with the ATPase staining results. During aging, the shear force of LT muscle was always greater than that of PM and ST, and its glycolysis was the strongest; type IIa, IIb, and IIx muscle fibers were positively correlated with muscle shear force and glycolysis rate, and type I muscle fibers were significantly and negatively correlated with the activities of the key enzymes of glycolysis within 6 h. The results showed that the muscle fibers of LT muscle had the greatest glycolysis capacity. These results suggest that an excessive type IIb muscle fiber number percentage and area in camel meat accelerated the glycolysis process, but seriously affected the sensory profile of the camel meat. The results of this study provide directions for the camel industry when addressing the poor tenderness of camel meat.

AB  - Studied by electron microscopy and morphometry, Auerbach's ganglia comprise nerve cell bodies that occupy similar to 40% of volume; of the neuropil, little over 30% is neural processes (axons, dendrites) and little less than 30% is glia (cell bodies, processes). The amount of surface membrane of neural elements only marginally exceeds that of glia. Glial cells extend laminar processes radially between axons, reaching the ganglion's surface with specialized membrane domains. Nerve cells and glia are tightly associated, eliminating any free space in ganglia. Glia expands maximally its cell membrane with a minimum of cytoplasm, contacting a maximal number of axons, which, with their near-circular profile, have minimal surface for a given volume. Shape of glia is moulded by the neural elements (predominantly concave the first, predominantly convex the second); the glia extends its processes to maximize contact with neural elements. Yet, a majority of axons is not reached by glia and only few are wrapped by it. Despite the large number of cells, the glia is not sufficiently developed to wrap around or just contact many of the neural elements. Mitochondria are markedly fewer in glia than in neurons, indicating a lower metabolic rate. Compactness of ganglia, their near-circular profile, absence of spaces between elements and ability to withstand extensive deformation suggest strong adhesion between the cellular elements, holding them together and keeping them at a fixed distance. Many axonal varicosities, with vesicles and membrane densities, abut on non-specialized areas of glia, suggesting the possibility of neurotransmitters being released outside synaptic sites.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) intake mainly occurs through food and drinking water and is associated with numerous illnesses; therefore, Al3+ elimination is one of the concerns of governments. Tea is an exceptional plant whose growth is stimulated by Al, particularly in acidic soils. On the other hand, every year after pruning in tea fields a large amount of leaves are burned which brings air and soil pollution in turn. Al3+ binging potential of tea leaves was evaluated in the present research via different chemical analyses and batch study. Polysaccharides carboxyl and phenolics hydroxyl/oxyl groups of cell wall were marked by GC-MS and FT-IR analysis as main sites for Al3+ conjugation. SEM-EDS analysis showed that the complex of Al3+ to tea leaves was highly heterogeneous. The thermodynamic data showed that adsorption process of Al3+ was spontaneous and endothermic. Based on the results of batch adsorption experiments, the average adsorption capacity of tea leaves for Al3+ was 97.77% at pH 7.5. Tea leaves also effectively adsorbed up to 98% of Al ions from drinking water at slightly alkaline pH (7.4-7.8). These findings demonstrated that as an eco-friendly and locally available probe, tea leaves can effectively remove Al3+ from drinking water to standard permissible limit of WHO (0.2 mg/L). Moreover, using wasted tea leaves is an appropriate way to properly waste management in the areas of tea plantation.

AB  - Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and their N-oxides (PANOs) are phytotoxins produced by various plant species and have been emerged as environmental pollutants. The sorption/desorption behaviors of PAs/PANOs in soil are crucial due to the horizontal transfer of these natural products from PA-producing plants to soil and subsequently absorbed by plant roots. This study firstly investigated the sorption/desorption behaviors of PAs/PANOs in tea plantation soils with distinct characteristics. Sorption amounts for seneciphylline (Sp) and seneciphylline-N-oxide (SpNO) in three acidic soils ranged from 2.9 to 5.9 pg/g and 1.7 to 2.8 pg/g, respectively. Desorption percentages for Sp and SpNO were from 22.2% to 30.5% and 36.1% to 43.9%. In the mixed PAs/PANOs systems, stronger sorption of PAs over PANOs was occurred in tested soils. Additionally, the Freundlich models more precisely described the sorption/desorption isotherms. Cation exchange capacity, sand content and total nitrogen were identified as major influencing factors by linear regression models. Overall, the soils exhibiting higher sorption capacities for compounds with greater hydrophobicity. PANOs were more likely to migrate within soils and be absorbed by tea plants. It contributes to the understanding of environmental fate of PAs/PANOs in tea plantations and provides basic data and clues for the development of PAs/PANOs reduction technology.

AB  - Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), essential molecules whose precursors must be dietary supplied, are highly represented in the brain contributing to numerous neuronal processes. Recent findings have demonstrated that LCPUFA are represented in lipid raft microstructures, where they favor molecular interactions of signaling complexes underlying neuronal functionality. During aging, the brain lipid composition changes affecting the lipid rafts' integrity and protein signaling, which may induce memory detriment. We investigated the effect of a n-3 LCPUFA-enriched diet on the cognitive function of 6- and 15-months-old female mice. Likewise, we explored the impact of dietary n-3 LCPUFAs on hippocampal lipid rafts, and their potential correlation with aging-induced neuroinflammation. Our results demonstrate that n-3 LCPUFA supplementation improves spatial and recognition memory and restores the expression of glutamate and estrogen receptors in the hippocampal lipid rafts of aged mice to similar profiles than young ones. Additionally, the n-3 LCPUFA-enriched diet stabilized the lipid composition of the old mice's hippocampal lipid rafts to the levels of young ones and reduced the aged-induced neuroinflammatory markers. Hence, we propose that n-3 LCPUFA supplementation leads to beneficial cognitive performance by "rejuvenating" the lipid raft microenvironment that stabilizes the integrity and interactions of memory protein players embedded in these microdomains.

AB  - Simple Summary Coccidiosis in lambs is a vital problem of livestock management and various solutions have been proposed. Several studies, including findings from our previous work, highlighted the antioxidant and immunomodulatory role of melatonin in ewes and lambs. In this study we applied the use of melatonin implants during pregnancy in sheep as a prophylactic agent against coccidiosis in newborn lambs. The results indicated that animals that received melatonin implants demonstrated a boosted immune response against infection with pathogenic Eimeria spp. Also, lambs born from melatonin-treated ewes showed better humoral and cytokine immune-related response and excreted less oocysts after experimental infection with Eimeria spp.. Our findings indicated that melatonin can be used as an immunomodulatory agent prenatally for lowering the vulnerability of lambs to pathogens such as coccidia, and thus for keeping infection pressure down. In livestock research, there has been a growing interest in the impact of melatonin on both health and disease conditions. The hypothesis of the present study was that melatonin treatment prenatally could support the immune competence and growth of experimentally infected lambs. This is the first study that aimed to investigate the impact of melatonin administration throughout pregnancy on immunity and oocyst excretion of pre-partum ewes and their offspring after experimental infection with Eimeria species. Thirty pregnant ewes were allocated into five equal groups, & UKappa;M, & UKappa;C, CM, CC, and NC, and gave birth to 47 lambs. Ewes of the KM and KC groups were orally challenged with a cocktail of Eimeria-sporulated oocysts (mainly consisting of Eimeria ovinoidalis), on day 120 of pregnancy, as well as all the lambs at the age of 5-9 days apart from those born from the NC group (environmental control). Fecal samples were collected from all ewes before infection and at parturition and from all lambs 14 times (S0-S13), before infection and during the following 8 weeks, for counting oocysts per gram of feces (OPG). Immunoglobulin (IgG) and cytokine (IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-& gamma;) levels were determined in ewes' plasma collected before infection and at parturition, in lambs' plasma at 24 and 72 h after their birth, and in colostrum samples at parturition and 72 h later. Body weight of lambs was recorded five times from birth until the age of 60 days. Accordingly, the leucogram was evaluated in blood samples collected six times within the same period. On average, IgG concentration was higher (p < 0.05) in the blood of KM-ewes compared to KC and CC groups and in colostrum of KM-ewes compared to other groups (p < 0.001). KM-lambs had greater IgG titer and IFN-& gamma; level than the other groups (p < 0.05). The IL-10/ IFN-& gamma; ratio in KM-ewes was lower than the CC group (p = 0.06). Overall, the growth rate of lambs did not differ among groups (p > 0.05). Total oocysts' excretion in KM- and CM-lambs was reduced by 94.9% (p = 0.05) and 92.6% (p = 0.025), respectively, compared to KC-lambs, following the 3-week period after challenge, when E. ovinoidalis predominated in all groups. The dominant type of leucocytes was monocytes in all experimentally infected lambs, but not in NC-lambs, while overall lymphocytes were lower in KC-lambs than in NC-lambs (p < 0.05).
   Considering that almost all young indoor-reared lambs are exposed to coccidia species during their early life, melatonin treatment prenatally could suggest an alternative management tool in alleviating infection pressure.

AB  - In the tropical regions such as Indonesia, the energy yield difference from rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) between facing to and away from the equator may be lesser than that in the non-tropical regions. However, a detailed recommendation on optimum roof orientation for various locations in Indonesia is yet to be found. This study aims to map the potential annual energy yield from rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) in 34 Indonesian cities with respect to various roof pitches and orientations, and to quantify the impact of the design variables, using computational modelling and simulation with Rhinoceros, Grasshopper, and Ladybug plugins. The roof pitches as eight cardinal and inter-cardinal orientations of 20 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees are considered as common roof pitches in Indonesia. Based on simulations of 100 Wp solar PV with 0.748 m2 panel surface area, the greatest annual energy yield across all cities is approximately 208, 199, 183, and 158 kWh/m2. The greatest annual energy yields are found in cities in Bali and Nusa Tenggara islands. The East orientation provides the maximum annual energy yield in most parts of Sumatera, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Papua islands. In almost all parts of Java, Bali, and Nusa Tenggara islands, the best orientation is North. Based on sensitivity analysis with multilinear regression, the roof pitch has a greater influence on the annual energy yield, compared to roof orientation. Selecting the optimum roof pitch is therefore critical in the design and implementation of rooftop solar PV in the Indonesian context.

AB  - To estimate the uptake of radiocesium (137Cs) by tea plant roots, 1-year-old rooted tea cuttings (Camellia sinensis L. cv. Yabukita) at the time of bud opening were cultivated hydroponically for 27 days in pots containing nutrient solutions with or without 137CsCl (600 Bq mL-1). Total 137Cs radioactivity of whole tea plants were 6.1 kBq g-1 dry weight. The plant/solution 137Cs transfer factors of different tissues were in the range of 2.6 (in mature leaves) to 28.2 mL g-1 dry weight (in roots), which were lower than those reported in wheat and spinach. In total, 69% of 137Cs remained in roots and 31% was transported from roots to shoots. The results indicated that 137Cs was preferentially translocated to new shoots, which are used for manufacturing tea, over mature leaves.

AB  - The detection method of Camellia oleifera fruits is not only an essential part of the Camellia oleifera fruit detection and locating process, but also a key foundation of the vision robot harvesting. Due to the occlusions of branches and leaves, as well as the overlap of fruits, it is a daunting task to improve the precision of Camellia oleifera fruit detection in a natural environment. In this paper, we propose a YOLO-COF lightweight multiclass occlusion target detection method for Camellia oleifera fruit, introducing K-means++ clustering algorithm under the framework of YOLOv5s to automatically filter and select the target dataset; incorporating Coordinate Attention to enhance the feature extraction ability of occluded target and improve the generalizability and robustness of the model. The study assesses four categories of datasets: complete fruit occlusion NO, fruit occluded by leaf OL, fruit occluded by branches OB, and fruit occluded by other fruits OF, combining the new detection model and comparing with five Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4-MobileNetV3, YOLOv4-CSPDarknet, YOLOv5s, and YOLOv5x models. The experimental results indicate that the AP values of YOLO-COF for the detection of NO, OL, OB, and OF are 0.97, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.92, respectively. In comparison to other neural network models, YOLO-COF is well-balanced in terms of precision, speed, and size. Its mAP value is 94.10%, its frame rate is 74.8FPS, and its model size is 27.1 MB. The proposed model has the potential to facilitate the operational decision-making of vision robot during the process of Camellia oleifera fruit harvesting.

AB  - Simple Summary In Australia, animal welfare legislation is being reassessed and a number of notable changes have occurred. This article clarifies statements and builds upon a previous article published in 2023, titled "How Well Does Australian Animal Welfare Policy Reflect Scientific Evidence: A Case Study Approach Based on Lamb Marking". In the article, we explore the debate and changes around mandatory pain relief for mulesing of lambs and how this differs between Australian states and territories. The article also looks at how these legislative changes and industry action influence practice and how the interest of the public is represented in animal welfare law. It stresses the need for clear communication, collaboration among stakeholders, and policies based on scientific evidence to improve animal welfare. Abstract This commentary provides an update and clarification on the legislative landscape surrounding mulesing in Australia since the publication of the 2023 study, "How Well Does Australian Animal Welfare Policy Reflect Scientific Evidence: A Case Study Approach Based on Lamb Marking". The article explores legislative changes mandating the use of pain relief for mulesing in various states, emphasising Victoria's original role, and highlighting the fragmented state-based legislative approach to animal welfare. It discusses the impact of these legislative changes on industry practices and animal welfare outcomes. The commentary highlights the complexities of policy development in this area, due in part to the diverse and often conflicting interests of stakeholders and the public. It underscores the importance of transparency, stakeholder collaboration, and scientifically informed policymaking to effectively enhance animal welfare standards.

AB  - Fascial adipocytes are recently identified as a unique population of adipose cells, which have different developmental origins, anatomical locations, cytological and functional characteristics compared with subcutaneous or visceral adipocytes. Superficial fascia in rats (also in pigs but not obviously in mice) contains numbers of lineage committed preadipocytes which possess adipogenic potential in vivo. The present study aimed to investigate the physiological factors that contribute to fascial adipogenesis in rats. We detected that mast cells, adipose progenitor cells, and mature adipocytes distributed in certain fascia areas were closely associated with each other, and numerous heparin-loaded granules released from mast cells were distributed around fascial preadipocytes. The culture supernatants of rat peritoneal mast cells and RBL-2H3 mast cells contained 20-30 mu g/ml of heparin, effectively activated PPAR-responsive luciferase activity, promoted mRNA and protein expressions of key adipogenic genes, and hence increased adipogenic differentiation of fascia- or epididymal adipose-derived stromal cells. Adipogenic effects of mast cell supernatants were mimicked by heparin but not by histamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine, and were antagonized by protamine sulfate. In rats, local administration of heparin-loaded microspheres for 30 days induced adipogenesis in local areas of superficial fascia. This adipogenic effects of heparin might be related by chain length of glucosamine units, because heparin stimulated stronger adipogenesis than dalteparin and enoxaparin with relatively short chains. Our findings suggested that mast cell and its granule heparin could serve as the endogenous physiological factors to initiate and accelerate local adipogenesis in superficial fascia, or in adipose tissue with the fascia naturally embedded inside.

AB  - Patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction are often unable to sense urine volume. Implantable sensors are used to monitor bladder urine volume. Securing sensors to the bladder involves sutures or synthetic adhesives that are invasive to it. Inspired by the safety harness that can be attached to objects by straps, we propose the bladder electronic harness (E-harness) for urine volume monitoring. The E-harness is a non-stick 2-dimensional structure that can be wrapped around the bladder without harming it. It is also soft enough to put no extra pressure on the bladder when it expands. Integrated with soft strain sensors and a wireless system, the E-harness can conform to the bladder, can measure bladder liquid volume with high accuracy (similar to 0.16 mL), and does not fall off for 1 month. The size of the E-harness is easily adjustable and can be used on small animals such as mice and large animals such as pigs.

AB  - Management of variability in germplasm banks is essential for genetic improvement, so that the breeder can estimate the genetic similarity between cultivars, as well as maintain genetic diversity in breeding programs. Elephant grass is a forage crop plant native to Africa of great socio-economic and environmental importance; it can be used for animal feed and for bioenergy production. Understanding the genetic variability of elephant grass is essential for breeding programs. In this context, we examined the genetic divergence of elephant grass accessions using the Gower algorithm. The experiment was conducted under field conditions in the municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes-RJ, Brazil. All 85 elephant grass accessions belonging to the Active Elephant Grass Germplasm Bank of Embrapa Gado de Leite were included. These genotypes are commercial varieties from various countries. They were evaluated for morphoagronomic, morphological and phenological characteristics. The experimental design was randomized blocks with two repetitions. The plots were composed of 5.5-meter rows, with 2.0-meter spacing between the planting rows, totaling 11.0 m(2). The useful area was a sample in the center of the plot. We generated an illustrative dendrogram, obtained by the UPGMA method and the Tocher clustering, based on the Gower algorithm. Data were examined by means of the GENES statistical programs and the R program. According to the dissimilarity matrices based on the Gower algorithm, the genetic distances varied between 0.08 and 0.56, and the mean distance of the 85 evaluated accessions was 0.25, suggesting, consequently, that there is wide genetic variability between the accessions. Of the 85 genotypes, seven presented genetic distances smaller than 0.1, being indicative of duplicates in the germplasm bank, which could be eliminated without risk of loss of genetic variability.

AB  - Some reproductive characteristics after application of carp pituitary and Nerestin in artificial reproduction of common carp, grass carp and silver carp from local populations in Kazakhstan were studied. Application of Nerestin-6 showed relatively low efficacy in all the studied fish species. Fecundity and egg hatchability of common carp, grass carp and silver carp were 73.2% and 32.5%; 72.5% and 43.2%; 75.3% and 41.2%, respectively. Nerestin-1B proved to be the most efficient in herbivorous fish. When used in grass carp and silver carp, egg fecundity and the percentage of hatched prelarvae was 92.5% and 53.0%; 88% and 50.2%, respectively. In common carp, the best results were obtained after the application of pituitary extract. Fecundity and hatchability of the eggs reached 92.5% and 54.5%, respectively.

AB  - Simple Summary We report the in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics, utilizable crude protein, and energy values of four different formulations of concentrate feeds, three contrasting qualities of grass silages, and mixtures thereof (45% concentrate, 55% silage, dry weight basis) using the ANKOM RF wireless gas production system. The concentrates were two pelleted diets (control concentrate for dairy cows and alkaline concentrate with ammoniated barley) and two mash forms (concentrate with ingredients of the alkaline diet prior to alkalization and concentrate with basal ingredients as in the alkaline diet with feed-grade urea). The grass silages were early cut, late cut, and a 1:1 mix thereof. For mixed diets, no interaction effects of the concentrate feeds by silage quality were observed for the tested parameters. For concentrates, the pelleted diets were higher in in vitro dry matter digestibility and molar proportion of propionate. The alkaline pelleted concentrate produced a higher utilizable crude protein value than others. For silages, estimated protein and energy values, total short-chain fatty acids, and molar proportions of propionate and branched-chain fatty acids decreased with increasing stage of maturity. Results for silages and their mixtures with concentrates highlight the importance of silage quality in dietary energy and protein supply for ruminants.Four formulations of concentrate feeds, three contrasting qualities of grass silages, and mixtures of the silages (55%) and concentrates (45%, dry weight) were tested for in vitro fermentation kinetics, in vitro dry matter degradation (IVDMD), utilizable crude protein (uCP), and metabolizable energy (ME) values. The concentrates were pelleted control concentrate for dairy cows (CONT-P); pelleted alkaline concentrate with ammoniated cereal grains (ALKA-P); mash form concentrate with ALKA-P main ingredients but with feed-grade urea and barley replacing ammoniated cereal grain (UREA-M); and mash form of ALKA-P ingredients prior to alkalization (ALKA-M). The grass silages were early cut, late cut, and a mixture (1:1) of early and late cut. The objectives were to test if the feeds differed in the tested parameters within each feed category and assess the modulatory effect of concentrate feeds on the grass silage fermentation characteristics in the mixed diets. No interaction effects of the concentrate feeds by silage quality were observed for the tested parameters in the mixed diets. For concentrates, the pelleted diets were higher (p < 0.05) in IVDMD and molar proportion of propionate but lower in butyrate. The ALKA-P produced the highest estimated uCP (p < 0.01). For silages, uCP, ME, total short-chain fatty acids (VFAs), and molar proportions of propionate and branched-chain VFAs decreased (p < 0.05) with increasing stage of maturity. In conclusion, the ALKA-P could match the CONT-P in uCP and ME values and fermentation characteristics. Results for silages and their mixtures with concentrates highlight the importance of silage quality in dietary energy and protein supply for ruminants.

AB  - This research explores the viability of bamboo as a green replacement for timber in building practices. Bamboo's advantages lie in its renewability, sustainability, and resilience to disasters, despite possessing mechanical properties similar to timber. The study proposes using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations, a potent instrument for designing and analyzing intricate structures under varying loads. The research explicitly employs FEA simulations to examine the application of bamboo in complex rooftop systems, using two commercial 3D CAD software-Rhino7 and Strand7. Rhino7 is responsible for 3D model creation and the member's division into minuscule elements, whereas Strand7 is used to assign material properties, establish boundary conditions, carry out simulations, and analyze the outcomes. This research includes case studies of bamboo grid-shell structures and implements the suggested methodology. The study's objective is to augment the scarce engineering data and to analyze bamboo as a material and the impact it can have on construction. The study's results underscore the potential of eco-friendly, low-carbon materials, such as bamboo, in the construction industry. It also illustrates the effectiveness of FEA simulation in analyzing elaborate structures.

AB  - The present study has investigated per-- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the gill tissues of various fish species inhabiting different trophic levels within Eleyele Lake, a tropical freshwater lake in Nigeria. The mean concentrations of PFAS congeners were determined, and their trends and patterns were analyzed across different trophic species. The results revealed variations in congener abundance and species-specific patterns that was influenced by habitat and niche preferences. Multivariate associations using canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) revealed distinct trends in the relationships between gill concentrations of specific PFAS congeners and different trophic groups. The strongest congener relationships were observed in the pelagic omnivore ( Oreochromic niloticus: : ON) with positive associations for 4:2 FTS, 9CL-PF3ONS, PFTDA, MeFOSA and PFHxS. The differences in congener profiles for the two herbivorous fish ( Sarotherodon melanotheron (SM) and Coptodon galilaeus (CG)) reflect possible divergence in microhabitat and niche preferences. Furthermore, the congener overlaps between the herbivore (CG), and benthic omnivore ( Clarias gariepinus: ClG) indicate a possible niche and microhabitat overlap. Our study provides valuable insights into the congener dynamics of PFAS at Eleyele Lake. However, the dissimilarity and overlapping PFAS congener profile in fish gills reflects the interplay of species niche preference and microhabitat associations. The present study highlights the need for further research to assess ecological risks and develop effective PFAS management strategies.

AB  - Parametric heritage 3D reconstruction using iconographic evidence has the potential to extend modelling data sources and enhance the modelling efficiency. This study presents a novel and preliminary workflow to document, 3D reconstruct and interpret architectural massing typologies in the Song Dynasty of ancient China, integrating iconographic evidence. Multi-source historical images are collected and screened through chronological and appraisal assessments. The extracted massing principles are translated into parametric algorithms using Rhino-Grasshopper, then tested on 3D reconstruction of historical images by student participants. Furthermore, it is applied in an interactive design way through the Biomorpher plugin. The results show that the algorithms successfully enhanced the modelling efficiency, while limitations are also reflected. The interactive design application facilitates scenario comparisons in Song architecture 3D reconstruction and design. This study also sheds light on future applications in architectural conservation, interactive heritage education, and other research aspects in art and architecture.

AB  - Over time, scientists have been fascinated by the complex connections among nutrition, brain development, and behavior. It's been well understood that the brain's peak performance relies on having the right nutrients available. Thus, nutritional insufficiency, where an organism lacks vital nutrients crucial for optimal growth and function, can upset the body's balance, potentially triggering stress responses. However, our grasp of how the brain reacts to insufficient nutrition, particularly in avian species like domestic chickens, has shown inconsistencies in our understanding. Domestic chickens have frequently served as subjects for studying memory and learning, primarily focusing on the hippocampus-a region highly responsive to environmental changes. Yet, another critical brain region, the parahippocampal region, integral to memory and spatial cognition, had received relatively little attention concerning the consequences of inadequate nutrition and hydration. To address this knowledge gap, our study sought to investigate the impact of stress induced by nutritional insufficiency on the neuronal cells within the region parahippocampalis in two distinct age groups of domestic chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus: fifteen and thirty days old. We employed the Golgi-Cox-Impregnation technique to explore whether the structural characteristics of neuronal cells, specifically the dendritic spines, underwent changes under transient stressful conditions during these crucial developmental stages. The results were intriguing. Stress evidently induced observable alterations in the dendritic spines of the parahippocampal neuronal cells, with the extent of these changes being age -dependent. In fifteen -day -old chickens, stress prompted substantial modifications in the dendritic spines of parahippocampal multipolar and pyramidal neurons. In contrast, among thirty -day -old chickens, the response to stress was less comprehensive, with only specific parahippocampal multipolar neurons displaying such alterations. These findings underscored the influential role of stress in reshaping the structure of parahippocampal neurons and emphasized the importance of considering age when studying the impact of stress on the brain. Through this research, we aim to enhance our understanding of the intricate interplay between stress, brain structure, and the critical role of adequate nutrition, especially during pivotal developmental stages. Our future research objectives include a deeper investigation into the intracellular events including cellular and molecular mechanisms precipitating these changes and determining whether these alterations have downstream effects on crucial brain functions like learning and memory.

AB  - The detection of autoantibodies (AAbs) with low-cost and noninvasiveness advantages has emerged as a promising technique for the diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer (LC). However, the specificity and sensitivity are frequently restricted to the characteristics of the antigens and the detection systems such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Here, a highly sensitive and specific gold nanocluster-based capture-detection platform was developed to detect anti-PDL1 AAb as the biomarker of LC, for the diagnosis of early-stage LC. The nano capture-detection platform was composed of streptavidin magnetic beads conjugated PDL1 peptide (MB-peptide), serving as the capture probe, and goat-anti-human-IgG conjugated horseradish peroxidase-coated gold nanoclusters (anti-IgG-HRP-AuNCs) as the detection nanoprobe. Notably, the nanoplatform exhibited strikingly sensitive and specific detection of anti-PDL1 AAb, owing to the integration of the MB-peptide's precision recognition capabilities with the excellent peroxidase activity and profound affinity for IgG displayed by the anti-IgG-HRP-AuNCs. Furthermore, the innovative nanoplatform harnessing optical detection technology significantly boosted detection efficiency and dramatically reduced the analysis time from the traditional 12 h process to a mere 50 min. Additionally, this advanced system demonstrated significantly enhanced sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing early-stage LC, substantiating the tremendous potential of the AuNCs-based capture-detection platform for clinical applications in the early detection of LC in the future.

AB  - Succinate dehydrogenase inhibition with malonate during initial reperfusion reduces myocardial infarct size in both isolated mouse hearts subjected to global ischemia and in in situ pig hearts subjected to transient coronary ligature. However, the long-term effects of acute malonate treatment are unknown. Here, we investigated whether the protective effects of succinate dehydrogenase inhibition extend to a reduction in scar size and adverse left ventricular remodeling 28 days after myocardial infarction. Initially, ten wild-type mice were subjected to 45 min of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion, followed by 24 h of reperfusion, and were infused during the first 15 min of reperfusion with saline with or without disodium malonate (10 mg/kg/min, 120 mu L/kg/min). Malonate-treated mice depicted a significant reduction in infarct size (15.47 +/- 3.40% of area at risk vs. 29.34 +/- 4.44% in control animals, p < 0.05), assessed using triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Additional animals were then subjected to a 45 min LAD ligature, followed by 28 days of reperfusion. Treatment with a single dose of malonate during the first 15 min of reperfusion induced a significant reduction in scar area, measured using Picrosirius Red staining (11.94 +/- 1.70% of left ventricular area (n = 5) vs. 23.25 +/- 2.67% (n = 9), p < 0.05), an effect associated with improved ejection fraction 28 days after infarction, as determined using echocardiography, and an attenuated enhancement in expression of the pro-inflammatory and fibrotic markers NF-kappa B and Smad2/3 in remote myocardium. In conclusion, a reversible inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase with a single dose of malonate at the onset of reperfusion has long-term protective effects in mice subjected to transient coronary occlusion.

AB  - A growing body of evidence has shown that seizure can trigger inflammatory cascades through increasing the expression of several inflammatory cytokines. It has been proved that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects beyond the putative hypoglycemic effects. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory effect of rosiglitazone on the development of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling via affecting the inflammatory pathway. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into vehicle group (0.1% DMSO), PTZ-group and rosiglitazone-PTZ-group. Kindling was induced by the administration of PTZ (40 mg/kg, i.p) every other day and mice were observed for 20 min after each PTZ injection. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, animals were euthanized and hippocampus was isolated. The level of Malondialdehyde (MDA), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), and Catalase (CAT) activity were quantified in hippocampus by biochemical methods. The protein levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, caspase-3, iNOS, PPAR-gamma, Bcl-2, or Bax factors were measured with western blotting. Also, the quantitative real-time PCR were used to evaluate the mRNA expression of those factors. Pretreatment with rosiglitazone significantly prevented the progression of kindling in comparison with control group. The rosiglitazone significantly decreased the MDA level and increased the CAT, and SOD levels in the rosiglitazone treated mice compared to those in the PTZ group (P < 0.01). Using real-time PCR and Western blotting assay, similar results were obtained. The expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, Bax or PPAR-gamma were significantly changed in the brain. The results of this study suggest that effect of rosiglitazone may be crucial in its ability to protect against the neuronal damage caused by PTZ induced seizure.

TI  - Between-subject prediction reveals a shared representational geometry in the rodent hippocampus
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - MEMORY
AB  - The rodent hippocampus constructs statistically independent representations across environments ("global remapping") and assigns individual neuron firing fields to locations within an environment in an apparently random fashion, processes thought to contribute to the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory. This random mapping implies that it should be challenging to predict hippocampal encoding of a given experience in one subject based on the encoding of that same experience in another subject. Contrary to this prediction, we find that by constructing a common representational space across rats in which neural activity is aligned using geometric operations (rotation, reflection, and translation; "hyperalignment"), we can predict data of "right"trials (R) on a T-maze in a target rat based on (1) the "left"trials (L) of the target rat and (2) the relationship between L and R trials from a different source rat. These cross-subject predictions relied on ensemble activity patterns, including both firing rate and field location, and outperformed a number of control mappings, such as those based on permuted data that broke the relationship between L and R activity for individual neurons and those based solely on within-subject prediction. This work constitutes proof of principle for successful cross-subject prediction of ensemble activity patterns in the hippocampus and provides new insights in understanding how different experiences are structured, enabling further work identifying what aspects of experience encoding are shared versus unique to an individual.

AB  - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked molecules are surface-exposed membrane components that influence the infectivity, virulence and transmission of many eukaryotic pathogens. Procyclic (insect midgut) forms of Trypanosoma brucei do not require GPI-anchored proteins for growth in suspension culture. Deletion of TbGPI8, and inactivation of the GPI:protein transamidase complex, is tolerated by cultured procyclic forms. Using a conditional knockout, we show TbGPI8 is required for social motility (SoMo). This collective migration by cultured early procyclic forms has been linked to colonization of the tsetse fly digestive tract. The SoMo-negative phenotype was observed after a lag phase with respect to loss of TbGPI8 and correlated with an unexpectedly slow loss of procyclins, the major GPI-anchored proteins. Procyclins are not essential for SoMo, however, suggesting a requirement for at least one other GPI-anchored protein. Loss of TbGPI8 initiates the transition from early to late procyclic forms; this effect was observed in a subpopulation in suspension culture, and was more pronounced when cells were cultured on SoMo plates. Our results indicate two, potentially interlinked, scenarios that may explain the previously reported failure of TbGPI8 deletion mutants to establish a midgut infection in the tsetse fly: interference with stage-specific gene expression and absence of SoMo.

AB  - Simple Summary:Large ruminant dairy animals (i.e., cattle and buffalo) suffer from several reproductive problems (such as abortion) that reduce ther ability to produce milk and offspring, resulting in huge economic costs to farmers; however, there are few studies in India that estimate such costs. Therefore, an attempt was made to assess the economic cost of five major reproductive problems in two of the poorest Indian states-Assam and Bihar. We estimated the cost by interviewing 534 randomly selected dairy farming households in both the states. Based on this, we found that 32.9% of dairy animals (milking, not-milking and heifer) in Assam and 43.1% dairy animals in Bihar suffered from one or more reproductive problems. The most common reproductive problem was failing to conceive after breeding (23.2% of surveyed dairy animals) followed by retained placenta (6.1%), abortion (4.9%), purulent vaginal discharge (2.9%) and stillbirths (1.0%). It was estimated that the selected reproductive problems caused an annual economic cost of Indian Rupees (INR), 3963.1 million (USD 59.0 million) in Assam, and INR 30,500.0 million (USD 453.9 million) in Bihar. The study concludes that adequate awareness, capacity building, adoption of good reproductive health management practices, proper farm record keeping and improved access to quality veterinary services are essential to address reproductive problems and reduce the cost caused by these reproductive problems.
   Reproductive problems in dairy animals reduce fertility, prevent conception, create problems in the delivery of healthy calves, lead to postpartum complications, increase inter-calving periods, reduce milk yield, and lower overall lifetime productivity. This study aimed at understanding the incidence of reproductive problems and the cost caused by these. The study covered 954 dairy animals in Bihar and 1348 dairy animals in Assam that were selected using a multi-stage random sampling method. The costs were calculated as the sum of income losses and expenditures incurred. The major cost incurred resulted from extended calving intervals (46.1% of the total cost), followed by loss through salvage selling (38.1%), expenditure for treatment of repeat breeders (5.9%), loss of milk production (5.3%) and expenditure for extra inseminations (2.0%). About one fifth of the selected reproductive problems were left untreated. The estimated cost of reproductive problems was Indian Rupees (INR) 2424.9 (USD 36.1) per dairy animal per year (of the total dairy animal population) which represented approximately 4.1% of the mean value loss of dairy animals (INR 58,966/USD 877) per year. Reproductive problems were significantly (p < 0.001) higher among improved (exotic breed or cross-bred) dairy animals than indigenous (native breed or nondescript indigenous) dairy animals. The study suggests that with the increase of improved dairy animal population, the loss may further increase. The study concludes that any economic estimation of reproduction problems based on aetiology without confirmatory diagnoses could be highly misleading because of the complex nature of the problems.

AB  - Theropod dinosaurs underwent some of the most remarkable dietary changes in vertebrate evolutionary history, shifting from ancestral carnivory(1-3) to hypercarnivory(4,5) and omnivory/herbivory,(6-9) with some taxa eventually reverting to carnivory.(10-12) The mandible is an important tool for food acquisition in vertebrates and reflects adaptations to feeding modes and diets.(13,14) The morphofunctional modifications accompanying the dietary changes in theropod dinosaurs are not well understood because most of the previous studies focused solely on the cranium and/or were phylogenetically limited in scope,(12,15-21) while studies that include multiple clades are usually based on linear measurements and/or discrete osteological characters.(8,22) Given the potential relationship between macroevolutionary change and ontogenetic pattern,(23) we explore whether functional morphological patterns observed in theropod mandibular evolution show similarities to the ontogenetic trajectory. Here, we use finite element analysis to study the mandibles of non-avialan coelurosaurian theropods and demonstrate how feeding mechanics vary between dietary groups and major clades. We reveal an overall reduction in feeding-induced stresses along all theropod lineages through time. This is facilitated by a post-dentary expansion and the development of a downturned dentary in herbivores and an upturned dentary in carnivores likely via the "curved bone effect."We also observed the same reduction in feeding-induced stress in an ontogenetic series of jaws of the tyrannosaurids Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus , which is best attributed to bone functional adaptation. This suggests that this common tendency for structural strengthening of the theropod mandible through time, irrespective of diet, is linked to "functional peramorphosis"of bone functional adaptations acquired during ontogeny.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between investor sentiment and stock performance is crucial in dynamic financial markets. Existing researches often focus on financial news and stock prices, while studies on investor sentiment typically rely on traditional machine learning models that require extensive data labeling. Additionally, most researches focus on single stock indices, overlooking the impact of brand popularity. To address these gaps, this study proposes a novel framework to analyze the interaction between investor sentiment and stock performance, using Chinese Baijiu industry stocks as a case example. It further explores how brand popularity influences this relationship, offering insights for informed investment decisions through artificial intelligence technology. In this study, we leverage Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), a state-of-the-art black-box large language model, to process vast volumes of unstructured text data from stock forums. By employing in-context learning with human-labeled examples, GPT-4 generates weak labels that are subsequently used to fine-tune Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), a smaller and more efficient open-source LLM from Meta AI, thereby enabling sentiment-driven decision-making in real-world scenarios. To construct a comprehensive sentiment indicator, we integrate both direct and indirect factors influencing sentiment and use principal component analysis to combine them effectively. To examine interaction between sentiment and stock yield, we apply the Granger causality test and vector autoregression models across stocks with different brand popularity levels. The results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance investor sentiment analysis. Moreover, with brand popularity significantly amplifying the interaction between investor sentiment and stock yield, it leads to bidirectional Granger causality in highly popular brands.

AB  - Optoelectronic devices and techniques are widely, and deeply, involved in natural sciences research, with high achievements in biology, biochemistry, biophysics, medicine, and healthcare. This work deals with particular aspects of optoelectronics and optics as means of healthcare in a particular rheumatic disease - knee osteoarthritis. In the early stages, noninvasive medical aids, e.g., cold laser (low level laser) therapy, drug treatment, and synthetic (hyaluronic acid), or biological (platelet-rich-plasma) intra-articular substances can be used for pain relief. Visible light (650 nm, red) from a 35mW power laser has been used to test the light effect on ex vivo damaged pig cartilage samples as such, and on similar ones, which were injected with hyaluronic acid. Samples of both categories had been first injected with silver nanoparticles to enable image enhancement through a confocal microscope, aimed to evidence changes in the morphology of the structure. The light-plasmon interaction is known for its amplification effect. In this work, it brings a wave of novelty in diagnosis, and monitoring, through microscopy, viewing the combination with hyaluronic acid. Also, a comparative study, ran for evaluation from both a functional, and a symptomatic perspective of hyaluronic acid versus platelet-rich plasma administration in human patients with early-stage osteoarthritis, shows that the latter would provide a long-term solution. Cold laser therapy replaces any anti-inflammatory aid.

AB  - Refreshing beverages, consumed worldwide, commonly take advantage of caffeine's impacts on attention and motor performance. However, excessive long-term caffeine intake might disturb sleep/wake rhythms and exacerbate daily anxiety. Fish-originated collagen peptides (FCP) are of high nutrient value with stimulating, calming or relaxing effects, which could reduce the excitotoxicity of caffeine. This study aims to investigate two facets: (1) the combined effect of caffeine and FCP (namely C&F) on the cognitive function of sleep-deprived mice by different administration strategies with dose dependence (low and high dose) or time dependence (intervention in a day and prevention for a week); (2) the potential "microbiota-gut-brain" mechanism by which C&F improves sleep deprivation (SD)-induced cognitive impairments. Here, C57BL/6 mice were administered caffeine (10 or 20 mg per kg per bw) combined with FCP (100 or 200 mg per kg per bw) and were then subjected to 48 h SD. The open-field and Morris water maze tests were performed to evaluate the cognitive function and spatial learning capacities of mice. Our results indicated that the cognitive impairments of SD mice were significantly relieved to a different degree by treating C&F in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The pathological observation of the hippocampus indicated both intervention (time of a day) and prevention (time of a week) of the C&F protected brain tissue from SD-induced injuries. The accumulated pro-inflammatory neurometabolites and factors were significantly inhibited by C&F via the hypothalamus-hippocampal circuit. Furthermore, 16S rDNA analysis of colonic contents showed that the level of Lactobacillus murinus was significantly upregulated and that of Clostridia_UCG-014 was suppressed in the C&F group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of Lactobacillus murinus indicated a certain diagnostic utility to distinguish C&F intervention (AUC = 0.52) or prevention (AUC = 0.68). Pathways of ko04622 (immune system) and ko00472 (metabolism processes) were significantly regulated by C&F in a time-dependent manner. Based on PICRUSt2 algorithm analysis, C&F might potentially regulate gut microbial functions through several metabolic pathways, including the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and limonene and pinene degradation. In conclusion, C&F plays a key role in brain function and behavior, which could synergistically relieve cognitive impairments via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

AB  - Elevated circulating progesterone (P4) concentrations in the first week after conception have been associated with accelerated post-hatching conceptus elongation. However, the consequences, if any, on the development of the fetus are unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between early circulating P4 and fetal and placental morphometric characteristics at 42 days of gestation. A previously validated model of asynchronous embryo transfer (ET), known to alter uterine exposure to P4, was used in 107 heifers divided in two replicates (replicate 1: n = 51, replicate 2: n = 56). Heifers were randomly assigned to one of the two following groups: those receiving a Day 7 embryo on Day 7 of the cycle (synchronous; ET_D7, n = 49) and those transferred a Day 7 embryo on Day 9 of the cycle (asynchronous; ET_D9, n = 58). The synchronization protocol was started two days earlier for heifers in the ET_D9 group such that ET was done on the same day for both groups. P4 concentrations were determined from Day 3 after estrus to the day of ET. Pregnant heifers were slaughtered at Day 42 of gestation for fetal and placental morphometric measurements. The effects of the group, replicate, fetal sex, and interactions between these variables on fetal and placental characteristics were determined by ANOVA, while Pearson correlation was employed to assess the linear relationship between P4 concen-trations two days before and on the day of ET on the fetal parameters. The uteri of heifers in the ET_D9 group were exposed to higher concentrations (P < 0.0001) of P4 from four days before ET, than heifers in the ET_D7 group. Both group and fetal sex variables impacted on fetal crown-rump length (CRL) (group: P < 0.0001, sex: P = 0.001) and fetal weight (group: P = 0.006, sex: P = 0.003). Fetal sex influenced the amniotic sac area (P = 0.003) and amniotic sac weight (P = 0.004); while the group affected the number of cotyledons (P = 0.0009), and the fetal heart weight (P = 0.018). All these parameters were larger in the ET_D9 group compared with ET_D7, and in males compared with females. There was a positive corre-lation between P4 concentrations two days before ET and fetal weight and CRL, for each sex or considering all fetuses (R-2 similar to 0.4, p < 0.05). In conclusion, bovine embryos transferred into a uterus primed with higher P4 concentrations underwent enhanced development reflected in higher weight and size at the beginning of the fetal period.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is under neural, endocrine and paracrine control. The release (basal and in the presence of either cholinergic and opioid antagonists) of Met-enkephalin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and somatostatin (SRIF) was determined quantitatively in vitro using explants of the crop, proventriculus and duodenum from either day 0 or day 1 chicks. In addition, the effects of cholinergic and opioid antagonists on PENK gene expression were examined. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the roles of cholinergic and opioid receptors in the GI tract in newly hatched chickens. Moreover, the effect of IGF-1 and Met-enkephalin on cell division in duodenal explants in vitro was determined. There was both the release of Met-enkephalin from, and PENK expression in, the explants of the crop, proventriculus and duodenum tissue. This is the first report of any neuropeptide(s) being synthesized in and/or released from the crop. In vitro release of Met-enkephalin, IGF-1 and SRIF from duodenal and proventriculus explants was influenced (p < 0.01) by either cholinergic or opioid antagonists; for instance, in the presence of atropine, decreases (p < 0.001) of 17.8% and 57.7% are seen, respectively, in Met-enkephalin release and PENK expression in crop explants from day 1 chicks. Moreover, in the presence of atropine, there were increases (p < 0.001) of 47.7% and 70.9% in IGF-1 release in proventriculus explants from, respectively, day 0 and day 1 chicks. Met-enkephalin and/or IGF-1 stimulated the cell division of duodenal explants in vitro. This is the first report of Met-enkephalin release and PENK expression in the avian crop and of the effects of cholinergic or opioid antagonists on these factors. It is also the first report of either cholinergic or opioid control of IGF-1 release in the periphery of any species. There were strong relationships (p < 0.05) between the release of Met-enkephalin and that of IGF-1 in the duodenum and between the release of SRIF and that of IGF-1 in the proventriculus. This is the first report of IGF-1 and Met-enkephalin stimulating (p < 0.001) the proliferation of duodenal cells and, together, exerting a synergist effect. It is concluded that the release of Met-enkephalin, IGF-1 and SRIF from foregut regions is under tonic cholinergic and opioid control.

AB  - Despite the neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in late adult life, there is currently no therapy available to prevent the onset or slow down the progression of AD. The progressive cognitive decline in AD correlates with a successive accumulation of cerebral amyloid-beta (A beta) due to impaired clearance mechanisms. A significant percentage is removed by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)-mediated transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the periphery. Circulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor protein family at the cell surface and targets them for lysosomal degradation, which reduces the number of functional receptors. However, the adverse impact of PCSK9 on LRP1-mediated brain A beta clearance remains elusive. By using an established BBB model, we identified reduced LRP1-mediated brain-to-blood A beta clearance due to PCSK9 across different endothelial monolayer in vitro. Consequently, the repetitive application of FDA-approved monoclonal anti-PCSK9 antibodies into 5xFAD mice decreased the cerebral A beta burden across variants and aggregation state, which was not reproducible in brain endothelial-specific LRP1(-/-) 5xFAD mice. The peripheral PCSK9 inhibition reduced A beta pathology in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus-brain areas critically involved in memory processing-and prevented disease-related impairment in hippocampus-dependent memory formation. Our data suggest that peripheral inhibition of PCSK9 by already available therapeutic antibodies may be a novel and easily applicable potential AD treatment.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a representative neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the overaccumulation of amyloid beta (A beta) proteins. Since AD is accompanied by excessive oxidative stress, which aggravates neurological pathologies, the use of antioxidants has been considered to prevent disease development. NXP031, a combination of vitamin C (VitC) and an optimized aptamer that binds to VitC and stabilizes the reactivity of VitC, was designed. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of NXP031 on AD pathology, including A beta accumulation, A beta-induced oxidative stress, neuronal damage, and neuroinflammation. When NXP031 was administered to 5xFAD transgenic mice, NXP031 exerted a strong inhibitory action on A beta accumulation, superior to that of VitC, by inducing an increase in A beta-degrading endopeptidase expression. NXP031 diminished lipid peroxidation levels, activated Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathways, and suppressed overactivated neuroinflammation. An in vitro study using Neuro2a cells revealed that NXP031 protects the cells against oxidative stress by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, the neuroprotective effects of NXP031 were confirmed in a dose-dependent manner when administered to intrahippocampal A beta-injected mice, as NXP031 attenuated memory decline, neuronal apoptosis, synaptic degeneration, and excessive glial activation, and reduced NOX-2 expression in the hippocampus. Taken together, NXP031 reduced the A beta burden by regulating A beta-degeneration and attenuated memory impairment, neuronal death, synaptic degeneration, and neuroinflammation induced by A beta toxicity. These results suggest the potential of NXP031 as a therapeutic agent for AD.

AB  - Increased excitability and contractility of detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) cells are associated with overactive bladder (OAB), which is often induced by obesity. Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels regulate the excitability and contractility of DSM cells. Selective pharmacological activation of SK channels attenuates hyperpolarization and the decreased relaxation effect in DSM cells in obesity-induced OAB. However, additional data are needed to confirm the regulatory effect of SK channels on the function of DSM cells in obesity-related OAB. The tested hypothesis was that activation of SK channels decreases modulation of DSM function in a rat model of obesity-related OAB. Female Sprague Dawley rats were fed a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD), weighed after 12 weeks, and subjected to urodynamic study, patchclamp electrophysiology, and isometric tension recording. The average body weight and incidence of OAB were increased in the HFD group. Patch-clamp studies revealed that pharmacological activation of SK channels with SKA-31 had attenuated hyperpolarization of DSM cells. In addition, isometric tension recordings indicated that SKA-31 decreased relaxation of spontaneous phasic contractions of DSM strips in the HFD group. Attenuated function of SK channels increased the excitability and contractility of DSM cells, which contributed to the occurrence of OAB, suggesting that SK channels are potential therapeutic targets for control of OAB.

AB  - This study analysed data from a commercial swine herd in Thailand equipped with a free-farrowing housing system, comprising 17,196 piglets from 1318 litters, to explore the impact of sow and litter characteristics on the piglet birth weight and the incidence of stillbirth. The piglets were classified into four groups based on the total number of piglets born per litter (TB): <= 9 (n = 1434), 10-12 (n = 3232), 13-15 (n = 6537) and >= 16 (n = 5993). Sows were classified into four groups based on parity number: 1, 2-4, 5-7 and >= 8. The piglets were categorized into quartiles based on their birth order ranking: Q1 (n = 4786), Q2 (n = 4143), Q3 (n = 3808) and Q4 (n = 4456). Piglet birth weight was individually measured before colostrum ingestion. On average, TB, the number of live-born piglets and the incidence of stillbirth were 13.1 +/- 3.7, 11.5 +/- 3.8 and 6.3%, respectively. Among these litters, 26.6% had TB numbers >= 16. The average piglet birth weight was 1.37 +/- 0.36 kg, with 18.3% of piglets weighing <= 1.0 kg at birth. Piglet birth weight was influenced by birth order ranking, as Q4 piglets were found to be heavier than piglets born in Q1-Q3 (p < .001). Moreover, the percentage of piglets with a birth weight of <= 1.0 kg increased from 5.9% in litters with TB of <= 9-25.3% in litters with TB of >= 16 (p < .001). Additionally, primiparous sows had lower piglet birth weights compared to sows with parity numbers 2-4, 5-7 and >= 8 (p < .001). Piglets born in the fourth quartile (Q4) had a higher risk of stillbirth compared to those born in the first (Q1), second (Q2) and third (Q3) quartiles (12.5% vs. 2.2%, 4.1% and 6.6%, respectively, p < .001). The incidence of stillbirth in litters with TB >= 16 was also higher than that in litters with TB <= 9 and 10-12 (p < .05). Furthermore, sows with parity numbers >= 8 had a higher incidence of stillbirth (9.7%) compared to primiparous sows (4.0%, p < .001), sows with 2-4 parity (5.2%, p < .001) and sows with 5-7 parity (7.6%, p = .003). In summary, a high incidence of stillbirth was found in piglets born in the last quartile of litters, in litters with >16 piglets and for sows with parity numbers >= 8. Piglets born in the last quartile of litters were heavier than those born in the first to third quartiles.

AB  - Learning and memory impairment may result from age-related decline in synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus. Therefore, exploration of functional foods capable of ameliorating memory and cognition decline is an interesting endeavor in neuroscience research. We report the effects of Anredera cordifolia (AC) extract on learning and memory deficits in a senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mouse model, which demonstrate age-related memory deficits and related pathological changes in the brain. After 8 weeks of oral administration of AC extract, the mice were trained in the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) task, and after 7 more weeks, in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. Following the completion of behavioral testing, the blood biochemistry parameters, the hippocampal levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), PSD95, and NR2A, and the p-cAMP-response element binding (p-CREB)/CREB ratio were measured. The AC-treated group spent more time exploring the novel objects in the NOR task, and showed faster acquisition and better retention in the MWM task than the negative control (CN) group. In addition, AC enhanced the levels of the aforementioned neuronal plasticity-related proteins, and did not affect the blood biochemistry parameters. Therefore, our data suggest that the AC extract may improve learning and memory without causing any noticeable side effects in the body.

AB  - Aging causes loss of brain synapses and memory, and microglial phagocytosis of synapses may contribute to this loss. Stressed neurons can release the nucleotide UTP, which is rapidly converted into UDP, that in turn activates the P2Y(6) receptor (P2Y(6)R) on the surface of microglia, inducing microglial phagocytosis of neurons. However, whether the activation of P2Y(6)R affects microglial phagocytosis of synapses is unknown. We show here that inactivation of P2Y(6)R decreases microglial phagocytosis of isolated synapses (synaptosomes) and synaptic loss in neuronal-glial co-cultures. In vivo, wild-type mice aged from 4 to 17months exhibited reduced synaptic density in cortical and hippocampal regions, which correlated with increased internalization of synaptic material within microglia. However, this aging-induced synaptic loss and internalization were absent in P2Y(6)R knockout mice, and these mice also lacked any aging-induced memory loss. Thus, P2Y(6)R appears to mediate aging-induced loss of synapses and memory by increasing microglial phagocytosis of synapses. Consequently, blocking P2Y(6)R has the potential to prevent age-associated memory impairment.

AB  - This study investigated whether the activities of the antioxidant components of donkey seminal plasma (SP)-both enzymatic (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase-like (CAT), glutathione peroxidase-like (GPX), and paraoxonase type 1 (PON1)) and non-enzymatic (measured in terms of total thiol, copper-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC))-and oxidative stress index (OSI) are related to sperm cryotolerance. For this purpose, 15 ejaculates from jackasses (one per individual) were collected and split into two aliquots. The first one was used for measuring the activities levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and OSI in SP, whereas the other aliquot was cryopreserved. Before cryopreservation, sperm quality parameters (concentration, motility, and viability) were evaluated. After thawing, sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, lipid disorder, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and calcium intracellular levels were also determined. Based on the percentages of total motility (TM) and of sperm with an intact plasma membrane (SYBR14(+)/PI-) after thawing, samples were classified as good-freezability (GFE) or poor-freezability (PFE) ejaculates through cluster analyses. The SP activity levels of enzymatic (SOD and PON1) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (CUPRAC, FRAP, and TEAC) were higher (p < 0.05) in GFE than in PFE, whereas SP-OSI was higher (p < 0.05) in PFE than in GFE. In addition, the activity levels of SOD, PON1, GPX, CUPRAC, FRAP, and TEAC were positively (p < 0.05) related to post-thaw sperm motility and plasma membrane integrity and negatively to intracellular ROS levels. The SP-OSI was negatively correlated (p < 0.05) to post-thaw sperm quality parameters and positively to intracellular ROS levels. It can thus be concluded that donkey SP antioxidants are related to sperm cryotolerance and that measurements of antioxidants PON1, SOD, CUPRAC, FRAP, and TEAC, as well as SP-OSI, could be used as markers of sperm cryotolerance. Further research addressing the relationship of these antioxidants and SP-OSI with sperm cryotolerance and their potential use as freezing markers is warranted.

AB  - Autophagy is essential for oocyte maturation and preimplantation embryo development. ATG4C, a member of the ATG4 family, plays a crucial role in the autophagy process. The effect of ATG4C on the early embryonic development in pig has not been studied. In this study, the expression patterns of ATG4C were explored using qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Different concentrations of serum were added to in vitro maturation (IVM) medium to investigate its effects on oocyte maturation and embryonic development. Finally, the developmental potential of parthenogenetic embryos was detected by downregulating ATG4C in MII stage oocytes under 0 % serum condition. The results revealed that ATG4C was highly expressed in porcine oocytes matured in vitro and in parthenogenetic embryos. Compared with the 10 % serum group, the cumulus cell expansion, first polar body (PB1) extrusion rate, and subsequent developmental competence of embryos were reduced in the 0 % and 5 % serum groups. The mRNA levels of LC3 , ATG5 , BECLIN1 , TFAM , PGC1 alpha , and PINK1 were significantly increased ( P < 0.05) in the 0 % serum group. ATG4C was significantly upregulated in the embryos at the 1-cell, 2-cell, 8-cell, and 16-cell stages in the 0 % serum group ( P < 0.05). Compared with the negative control group, downregulation of ATG4C significantly decreased the 4-cell, 8-cell, and blastocyst rates ( P < 0.05), and the expression of genes related to autophagy, mitochondria, and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) was significantly decreased ( P < 0.05). The relative fluorescence intensity of LC3 and mitochondrial content in the ATG4C siRNA group was significantly reduced ( P < 0.05). Collectively, the results indicate that ATG4C is highly expressed in porcine oocytes matured in vitro and in early embryos, and inhibition of ATG4C effects embryonic developmental competence by decreasing autophagy, mitochondrial content, and ZGA under serum-free condition.

AB  - Although exogenous D-serine has been applied as a neural regulatory intervention in many studies, the role played by D-serine in hippocampal injuries caused by lead exposure remains poorly understood. Rat models of chronic lead exposure were established through the administration of 0.05% lead acetate for 8 weeks. Simultaneously, rats were administered 30 or 60 mg/kg D-serine, intraperitoneally, twice a day. Our results showed that D-serine treatment shortened the escape latency from the Morris water maze, increased the number of times that mice crossed the original platform location, and alleviated the pathological damage experienced by hippocampal neurons in response to lead exposure. Although D-serine administration did not increase the expression levels of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B) in the hippocampi of lead-exposed rats, 60 mg/kg D-serine treatment restored the expression levels of NR2A, which are reduced by lead exposure. These findings suggested that D-serine can alleviate learning and memory impairments induced by lead exposure and that the underlying mechanism is associated with the increased expression of NR2A in the hippocampus. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of North China University of Science and Technology, China (approval No. LX2018155) on December 21, 2018.

AB  - Animals behave in multisensory environments guided by various modalities of spatial information. Mammalian navigation engages a cognitive map of space in the hippocampus. Yet it is unknown whether and how this map incorporates multiple modalities of spatial information. Here, we establish two behavioral tasks in which mice navigate the same multisensory virtual environment by either pursuing a visual landmark or tracking an odor gradient. These tasks engage different proportions of visuo-spatial and olfacto-spatial mapping CA1 neurons and different population-level representations of each sensory-spatial coordinate. Switching between tasks results in global remapping. In a third task, mice pursue a target of varying sensory modality, and this engages modality-invariant neurons mapping the abstract behaviorally relevant coordinate irrespective of its physical modality. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus does not necessarily map space as one coherent physical variable but as a combination of sensory and abstract reference frames determined by the subject's behavioral goal.

AB  - The prevalence of Alzheimer's disorder (AD) is increasing worldwide, and the co-morbid anxiety is an important, albeit often neglected problem, which might appear early during disease development. Animal models can be used to study this question. Mice, as prey animals, show an innate defensive response against a predator odor, providing a valuable tool for anxiety research. Our aim was to test whether the triple-transgenic mice model of AD shows signs of innate anxiety, with specific focus on the temporal appearance of the symptoms. We compared 3xTg-AD mice bearing human mutations of amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and tau with age-matched controls. First, separate age-groups (between 2 and 18 months) were tested for the avoidance of 2-methyl-2-thiazoline, a fox odor component. To test whether hypolocomotion is a general sign of innate anxiety, open-field behavior was subsequently followed monthly in both sexes. The 3xTg-AD mice showed more immobility, approached the fox odor container less often, and spent more time in the avoidance zone. This effect was detectable already in two-month-old animals irrespective of sex, not visible around six months of age, and was more pronounced in aged females than males. The 3xTg-AD animals moved generally less. They also spent less time in the center of the open-field, which was detectable mainly in females older than five months. In contrast to controls, the aged 3xTg-AD was not able to habituate to the arena during a 30-min observation period irrespective of their sex. Amyloid beta and phospho-Tau accumulated gradually in the hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulb, and piriform cortex. In conclusion, the early appearance of predator odor- and open space-induced innate anxiety detected already in two-month-old 3xTg-AD mice make this genetically predisposed strain a good model for testing anxiety both before the onset of AD-related symptoms as well as during the later phase. Synaptic dysfunction by protein deposits might contribute to these disturbances.

AB  - BackgroundCryptorchidism, characterized by the failure of testicular descent, is a common congenital disorder adversely affecting male reproductive health. Intriguingly, the NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) gene has been implicated in various cellular processes, but its role in cryptorchidism remains underexplored.MethodsTo elucidate NEK2's role, the researchers utilized NEK2 knockout mice, analyzing testes histology with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and assessing sperm morphology by Diff-Quick staining. Immunohistofluorescence evaluated Leydig cell count, while Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyzed 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (HSD3B1), critical for testosterone synthesis. Mouse testosterone levels were quantified by ELISA, and RT-qPCR examined testicular Wnt-beta-catenin and HIPPO pathway expression.ResultsNEK2-deficient mice exhibited significantly increased cryptorchidism incidence, decreased Leydig cell number, reduced testis/body weights, and elevated sperm malformations. Histological analysis revealed pronounced testicular damage. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry showed unchanged nuclear receptor subfamily 5 (NR5A1) and insulin-like protein 3 (INSL3), but decreased HSD3B1 in NEK2-/- mice, leading to lower testosterone levels. Mechanistically, NEK2 knockout suppressed wingless/integrated (Wnt)-beta-catenin and activated HIPPO, causing mammalian sterile 20-like protein kinase 2 (MST2)-large tumor suppressor homolog 2 (LATS2)-mediated downregulation of yes-associated protein (YAP).ConclusionsThese findings highlight NEK2's essential role in regulating testicular descent and spermatogenesis, implicating it as a potential target for cryptorchidism.

AB  - The sustainability of agroecosystems are maintained with agro-chemicals. However, after more than 80 years of intensive use, many pests and pathogens have developed resistance to the currently used chemistries. Thus, we explored the isolation and bioactivity of a chemical compound, Precocene I, isolated from the perennial grass, Desmosstachya bipinnata (L.) Stapf. Fractions produced from chloroform extractions showed suppressive activity on larvae of Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), the Oriental armyworm. Column chromatography analyses identified Precocene I confirmed using FTIR, HPLC and NMR techniques. The bioactivity of the plant-extracted Dp-Precocene I was compared to a commercially produced Precocene I standard. The percentage of mortality observed in insects fed on plant tissue treated with 60 ppm Db-Precocene I was 97, 87 and 81, respectively, for the second, third and fourth instar larvae. The LC50 value of third instars was 23.2 ppm. The percentages of survival, pupation, fecundity and egg hatch were altered at sub-lethal concentrations of Db-Precocene I (2, 4, 6 and 8 ppm, sprays on castor leaves). The observed effects were negatively correlated with concentration, with a decrease in effects as concentrations increased. Distinct changes in feeding activity and damage to gut tissues were observed upon histological examination of S. litura larvae after the ingestion of Db-Precocene I treatments. Comparative analyses of mortality on a non-target organism, the earthworm, Eisenia fetida, at equal concentrations of Precocene I and two chemical pesticides (cypermethrin and monocrotophos) produced mortality only with the chemical pesticide treatments. These results of Db-Precocene I as a highly active bioactive compound support further research to develop production from the grass D. bipinnata as an affordable resource for Precocene-I-based insecticides.

AB  - Hydrogels exhibit potential as embolic agents; however, external stimuli for gelation in vessels are difficult to operate or have poor biocompatibility, and shear-thinning hydrogels are under the risk of being washed away. Herein, a blood-triggering phase transformational hydrogel for endovascular embolization is reported. First, quaternized chitosan (QCS), tannic acid (TA) and iohexol (I) solutions are mixed to prepare a radiopaque and injectable QCS/TA/I (QTI) hydrogel. Upon contacting blood, Na+ in blood can form coordination bonds with gel network to increase cross-linking densities, resulting in phase transformation from a soft and injectable hydrogel to a casted and stiffened QTI-blood hydrogel without any other operation. Moreover, the injection force and complete transformation time of the QTI hydrogels as well as the mechanical properties of their derived hydrogels are adjustable, which is helpful for customizing embolic agents according to different lesions. In animal experiments, QTI hydrogel has demonstrated its efficacy and safety in embolizing renal artery and ruptured femoral artery in rabbits, as well as the renal artery, profunda femoral artery (approximate to 4 mm in diameter), and retia mirabilia with plexiform structure in pigs. This work not only develops a novel liquid embolic agent but also reveals a new strategy for blood-triggering phase transformation.

AB  - Dysregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is linked to major depressive disorder (MDD), with more than 300 million people diagnosed and worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Accumulating evidence for neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin (GAL) interaction was shown in various limbic system regions at molecular-, cellular-, and behavioral-specific levels. The purpose of the current work was to evaluate the proliferating role of GAL2 receptor (GALR2) and Y1R agonists interaction upon intranasal infusion in the ventral hippocampus. We studied their hippocampal proliferating actions using the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) on neuroblasts or stem cells and the expression of the brain-derived neurothrophic factor (BDNF). Moreover, we studied the formation of Y1R-GALR2 heteroreceptor complexes and analyzed morphological changes in hippocampal neuronal cells. Finally, the functional outcome of the NPY and GAL interaction on the ventral hippocampus was evaluated in the forced swimming test. We demonstrated that the intranasal infusion of GALR2 and the Y1R agonists promotes neuroblasts proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the ventral hippocampus and the induction of the neurotrophic factor BDNF. These effects were mediated by the increased formation of Y1R-GALR2 heteroreceptor complexes, which may mediate the neurites outgrowth observed on neuronal hippocampal cells. Importantly, BDNF action was found necessary for the antidepressant-like effects after GALR2 and the Y1R agonists intranasal administration. Our data may suggest the translational development of new heterobivalent agonist pharmacophores acting on Y1R-GALR2 heterocomplexes in the ventral hippocampus for the novel therapy of MDD or depressive-affecting diseases.

AB  - Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) is highly expressed on sensory neurons where it serves as a polymodal receptor for detecting physical and chemical stimuli. However, the role of TRPV1 in bone metabolism remains largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of neuronal TRPV1 in regulating bone defect repair. In vivo experiment verified that TRPV1 activation could trigger dorsal root ganglion (DRG) producing the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in mice. The accelerated bone healing of femoral defect in this process was observed compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Conversely, Trpv1 knockdown led to reduced CGRP expression in DRG and nerves innervating femur bone tissue, following impaired bone formation and osteogenic capability in the defect region (p < 0.05), which could be rescued by local CGRP treatment. In vitro, results revealed that TRPV1 function in DRG neurons contributed essentially to the regulation of osteoblast physiology through affecting the production and secretion of CGRP. The capsaicinactivated neuronal TRPV1-CGRP axis could enhance the proliferation, migration and differentiation of osteoblasts (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that the promoting role of neuronal TRPV1 in osteogenesis was associated with Hippo signaling pathway, reflected by the phosphorylation protein level of large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1), MOB kinase activator 1 (MOB1) and Yes-associated protein (YAP), as well as the subcellular location of YAP. Our study clarified the effects and intrinsic mechanisms of neuronal TRPV1 on bone defect repair, which might offer us a therapeutic implication for bone disorders.

AB  - In colder regions, relatively low temperatures results in low microbial activity and low biogas production in anaerobic digestion. This study investigated if microbial electrosynthesis system (MES) can enhance biogas production from pig manure wastewater under sub-psychrophilic conditions (20 degrees C). Results showed that the applied voltage of MES (0.4 V and 0.8 V) significantly increased the biogas production and COD removal rate. Biogas production and COD removal rate increased most when the voltage reached 0.8 V (34.77 %, 26.67 %), and decreased when the voltage was 1.2 V. Low voltage (<= 0.8 V) did not significantly alter the microbial structure, but higher voltage (1.2 V) resulted in a significant decrease in Clostridium and Methanosarcina. Coenzyme F420, NADH, as indicators for methanogenic efficiency, showed the highest fluorescence intensity at 0.8 V and decreased at 1.2 V. Results indicated that the improvement of gas production was mainly due to the improvement of key enzymes rather than the shift of microbial structure. The information provided will be useful to improve the efficiency of biogas production.

AB  - Hydrogel-based cartilage tissue engineering (HCTE) offers a promising strategy for the regeneration of articular cartilage. However, the effectiveness of current HCTE is hindered by the low efficiency of stem cell transplantation and insufficient chondrogenic differentiation. Here, we develop a mechanically optimized and biochemically sustained biomaterial system that integrates a dynamic hydrazone/covalent dual-crosslinked hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel with kartogenin (KGN)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres to facilitate stem cell chondrogenesis and repair articular cartilage. This composite hydrogel features excellent injectability and self-healing behavior, allowing for minimally invasive implantation while protecting cell viability. The tunable viscoelasticity of the hydrogel enhances focal adhesion formation in bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), promoting their spreading, proliferation, and aggregation. Furthermore, the combined effects of hydrogel viscoelasticity and sustained KGN release markedly promote the expression of cartilage-specific genes and the secretion of extracellular matrix components through the integrin-mediated Hippo signaling pathway and KGN-mediated TGF-beta signaling pathway. This dual-stimuli hydrogel embedded with BMSCs significantly promotes the regeneration of articular cartilage in rabbit models. Overall, the designed KGN composite dynamic HA-based hydrogel enables highly effective transplantation and promotes efficient chondrogenesis of stem cells, providing a promising approach for stem cell therapy and cartilage regeneration.

AB  - Cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 (CHRM3)-mediated focal adhesion kinase/YES-associated protein (YAP) signalling is essential for the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. Here, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms through which CHRM3 overexpression facilitates castration-resistant growth. Small RNA sequencing combined with in silico analyses revealed that CHRM3 was a putative target of miR-15b-5p. Notably, androgen deprivation suppressed miR-15b-5p expression and increased CHRM3 expression. Moreover, miR-15b-5p bound directly to CHRM3 and inhibited YAP activation induced by CHRM3 stimulation. Furthermore, miR-15b-5p abolished the growth of CRPC cells induced by CHRM3 stimulation. We conclude that the miR-15b-5p/CHRM3/YAP signalling axis promotes the castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer.

AB  - Although lipid metabolism in fetal livers under intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) conditions has been widely studied, the implications of maternal undernutrition on fetal hepatic lipid metabolism, lipotoxic injury, and abnormal development remain largely unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of maternal undernutrition on disordered hepatic lipid metabolism, lipotoxic injury, and abnormal development in IUGR sheep fetuses using transcriptome analysis. Seventeen singleton ewes were randomly divided into three groups on day 90 of pregnancy: a control group (CG; 0.63 MJ metabolic energy/body weight (ME/ BW)(0.75) /day, n = 5), maternal undernutrition group 1 (MU1; 0.33 MJ ME/BW0.75/day, n = 6), and maternal undernutrition group 2 (MU2; 0.20 MJ ME/BW0.75 /day, n = 6). The fetuses were euthanized and recovered on day 130 of pregnancy. The levels of free fatty acids (FFA) in maternal blood ( P < 0.01), fetal blood ( P < 0.01), and fetal livers ( P < 0.05) were increased in the MU1 and MU2 groups, but fetal hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels in the MU2 group ( P < 0.01) and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in the MU1 and MU2 groups ( P < 0.01) were decreased compared to the CG. Severe inflammatory cell infiltration and increased non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores were observed in MU1 and MU2 fetuses ( P < 0.01). Progressive deposition of fetal hepatic reticular fibers and collagen fibers in the fetal livers of the MU1 and MU2 groups and significant hepatic fibrosis were observed in the MU2 fetuses ( P < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis showed that genes involved in lipid accumulation and FFA beta oxidation were downregulated in both MU groups compared to those in the controls. The fetal liver mRNA expression of the beta-oxidation regulator, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, and the TCA regulator, isocitrate dehydrogenase were reduced in MU1 ( P < 0.05) and MU2 ( P < 0.01) fetuses, and downregulated mRNA expression of long chain fatty acid CoA ligase 1 ( P < 0.05) and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase ( P < 0.01) was observed in MU2 fetuses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MU1 versus CG (360 DEGs) and MU2 versus CG (746 DEGs) were identified using RNA sequencing. Bioinformatics analyses of the 231 intersecting DEGs between MU1 versus CG and MU2 versus CG indicated that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were induced and played a central role in fetal hepatic injury in IUGR sheep. Increased maternal blood myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels ( P < 0.01), NE (Elane)-positive areas in fetal liver sections ( P < 0.05), and fetal liver MPO protein expression ( P < 0.01) were found in the MU1 and MU2 groups; however, MPO levels were reduced in the fetal membrane ( P < 0.01) and fetal blood ( P < 0.05) in the MU1 group, and in the maternal-fetal placenta and fetal blood in the MU2 group ( P < 0.01). Analysis of gene expression trends in the intersecting DEGs between MU1 versus CG (129 DEGs) and MU2 versus CG (515 DEGs) further revealed that 30 hub genes were essential regulators of the G2/M cell cycle, all of which were associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. G0/G1 phase cells of the fetal liver were reduced in the MU1 ( P < 0.05) and MU2 ( P < 0.01) groups, whereas G2/M phase cells were elevated in the MU1 and MU2 groups ( P < 0.01). The representatives of upregulated hub genes and fetal liver protein expression of maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase and protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 were progressively enhanced in the MU1 and MU2 groups ( P < 0.
   01), and topoisomerase II alpha protein expression in the MU2 group ( P < 0.05), as expected. These results indicate that FFA overload, severe lipotoxic injury, and NETs were induced, and disease-promoting regulators of the G2/M cell cycle were upregulated in the fetal liver of IUGR sheep. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of impaired hepatic lipid metabolism and abnormal development and the molecular origin of post-natal liver disease in IUGR due to maternal undernutrition. This information can support the development of new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common surgical complication that causes additional pain in patients and affects their quality of life. To address this problem, emerging studies have focused on the POCD. Recent studies have shown that aging and anesthetic exposure are the two major risk factors for developing POCD. However, few reports described the exact molecular mechanisms underlying POCD in elderly patients. In the previous studies, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and neuroapoptosis in the hippocampus were associated with inducing POCD; however, no further information on the related signaling pathways could be disclosed. The PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-CHOP pathway is identified as the main regulatory pathway involved in ER stress and cell apoptosis. Therefore, we assume that the occurrence of POCD induced by sevoflurane inhalation may potentially result from ER stress and neuroapoptosis in the hippocampus of aged mice mediated by the PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-CHOP pathway. In our study, we found a relationship between sevoflurane inhalation concentration and memory decline in aged mice, with a 'ceiling effect'. We have confirmed that POCD induced by sevoflurane results from ER stress and neuroapoptosis in the hippocampus of aged mice, which is regulated by the over-expression of PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-CHOP pathway. Furthermore, we also showed that the dephosphorylation inhibitor of eIF2 alpha (salubrinal) could down-regulate PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-CHOP pathway expression to inhibit ER stress and enhance the cognitive function of aged mice. In general, our study has elucidated one of the molecular mechanisms of sevoflurane-related cognitive dysfunction in aged groups and provided new strategies for treating sevoflurane-induced POCD.

AB  - Aims: Brief episodes of sublethal hypoxia reprogram brain response to face possible subsequent lethal stimuli by triggering adaptive and prosurvival events-a phenomenon denominated hypoxic preconditioning (HP). To date, the potential therapeutic implications of HP to forestall sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) pathology remain unexplored. Using a well-established protocol of HP and focusing on hippocampus as a first brain region affected in AD, this study was undertaken to investigate the potential protective effects of HP in a sAD rat model induced by the intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of streptozotocin (STZ) and to uncover the mitochondrial adaptations underlying this nonpharmacological strategy.Results: HP prevented the memory and learning deficits as well as tau pathology in the icvSTZ rat model. HP also attenuated icvSTZ-related reactive astrogliosis, as noted by increased glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity and myo-inositol levels. Notably, HP abrogated the icvSTZ-related impaired energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Particularly, HP averted increased lactate, glutamate, and succinate levels, and decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain function and mitochondrial DNA content. Concerning mitochondrial adaptations underlying HP-triggered tolerance to icvSTZ, preconditioned hippocampal mitochondria displayed an enhanced complex II-energized mitochondrial respiration, which resulted from a coordinated interaction between mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion-fission. Mitochondrial biogenesis was stimulated immediately after HP, whereas in a latter phase mitochondrial fusion-fission events are modulated favoring the generation of elongated mitochondria.Innovation and Conclusion: Overall, these results demonstrate for the first time that HP prevents the sAD-like phenotype, in part, by targeting mitochondria emerging as a preventive strategy in the context of AD.

AB  - Co-fermentation with bacteria and enzymes can reduce sugar content in palm kernel cake (PKC); however, the chemical changes and their effects on cell functionality are unclear. This study investigated the active components in pre-treated PKC extracts and their effects on pig small intestine IPEC-J2 cell proliferation and LPS-induced inflammation. The extracts contained 60.75% sugar, 36.80% mannose, 1.75% polyphenols and 0.59% flavone, as determined by chemical analyses, suggesting that the extracts were palm kernel cake oligosaccharides (PKCOS). Then, we found that 1000 mu g/mL PKCOS counteracted the decrease in cell viability (CCK8 kit) caused by LPS induction by 5 mu g/mL LPS (p < 0.05). Mechanistic studies conducted by RNA-seq and qPCR analyses suggested PKCOS promoted cell proliferation through the upregulation of TNF-alpha, PI3KAP1, MAP3K5 and Fos in the PI3K/MAPK signalling pathway; alleviated inflammation caused by LPS via the downregulation of the target genes Casp3 and TNF-alpha in association with apoptosis; and regulated the expression of the antioxidant genes SOD1, SOD2 and GPX4 to exert positive antioxidant effects (p < 0.05). Furthermore, PKCOS upregulated SLC5A1 (encoding SLGT1), HK and MPI in the glycolytic pathway (p < 0.05), suggesting cell survival. In summary, PKCOS has positive effects on promoting swine intestine cell proliferation against inflammation.

AB  - The aviation sector makes up 11% of all transportation emissions and is considered a "hard to abate" sector since, due to the long distances to be traveled, opportunities for electrification are rather limited. Therefore, since there are no alternatives to fuels, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs), or fuels produced from biomass, have recently been developed to reduce climate-changing emissions in the aviation sector. Using Life Cycle Assessment, this research evaluated the environmental compatibility of different SAF production routes from seven biomasses: four food feedstocks (Soybean, Palm, Rapeseed, and Camelina), one non-food feedstock (Jatropha curcas L.), and two wastes (Waste Cooking Oil, or WCO, and Tallow). The evaluation was carried out using SimaPro 9.5 software. The results showed that the two potentially most favorable options could be Camelina and Palma, as they show minimal environmental impacts in 4 and 7 out of 18 impact categories, respectively. Soybean, on the other hand, appears to be the least sustainable precursor. Considering GWP, SAF production could reduce the values compared to fossil fuel by 2.8-3.6 times (WCO), 1.27-1.66 times (Tallow), 4.6-5.8 times (Palm), 3.4-4.3 times (Jatropha), 1.05-1.32 times (Rapeseed), and 4.36-5.5 times (Camelina), demonstrating the good environmental impact of these pathways. Finally, the sensitivity analysis showed that SAF production from waste could be an environmentally friendly option, with rather low environmental impacts, in the range of 5.13 g CO2 eq/MJ for Tallow and 3.12 g CO2 eq/MJ for WCO. However, some of the energy would have to come from sustainable energy carriers such as biomethane and renewable sources such as photovoltaic energy.

AB  - Pathogens isolated from fish appear to possess considerable antimicrobial resistance and represent a problem for the economy and public health. Natural antimicrobial substitutes to traditional antibiotics represent an essential tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Nanotechnology has shown considerable potential in different research fields, and the antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles are known. Silver has been used for medical purposes since ancient times because of its bactericidal properties, and the highly reactive surfaces of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) indicate that they might have a function in antimicrobial applications. This work aimed to study the antimicrobial properties of biologically produced AgNPs from Origanum vulgare leaves compared to chemically produced AgNPs. Both types were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry, TEM, and dynamic light scattering and tested against three bacterial strains (Streptococcus agalactiae , and Aeromonas hydrophila , both isolated from Nile tilapia and Vibrio alginolyticus , isolated from sea bass) and three fungal strains (Aspergillus flavus , Fusarium moniliforme , and Candida albicans , all isolated from Nile tilapia). Disk diffusion test and evaluation of ultrastructure changes of tested microorganisms treated with AgNPs by transmission electron microscopy were performed. Moreover, the hemolytic properties of AgNPs were studied on chicken and goat red blood cells. The results obtained declare that the green biological production of silver nanoparticles is safer and more effective than the chemical one; moreover, AgNPs have interesting dose-dependent antimicrobial properties, with better results for biologically produced ones; their effectiveness against tested bacterial and fungal strains opens the way to their use to limit fish diseases, increase economy and improve human health.

AB  - (1) Background. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system, which regulates physiological and cognitive processes, presents a promising therapeutic target for treating HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Here we examine whether upregulating eCB tone has potential protective effects against HIV-1 Tat (a key HIV transactivator of transcription) protein-induced alterations in synaptic activity. (2) Methods. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed to assess inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission in prefrontal cortex slices of Tat transgenic male and female mice, in the presence and absence of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme inhibitor PF3845. Western blot and mass spectrometry analyses assessed alterations of cannabinoid receptor and enzyme protein expression as well as endogenous ligands, respectively, to determine the impact of Tat exposure on the eCB system. (3) Results. GABAergic activity was significantly altered upon Tat exposure based on sex, whereas the effectiveness of PF3845 to suppress GABAergic activity in Tat transgenic mice was not altered by Tat or sex and involved CB1R-related mechanisms that depended on calcium signaling. Additionally, our data indicated sex-dependent changes for AEA and related non-eCB lipids based on Tat induction. (4) Conclusion. Results highlight sex- and/or Tat-dependent alterations of GABAergic activity and eCB signaling in the prefrontal cortex of Tat transgenic mice and further increase our understanding about the role of FAAH inhibition in neuroHIV.

AB  - To examine the evolutionary pattern of livestock production activities in China, this paper analyzes the livestock production pattern from 1995 to 2020 using the models of center of gravity shift, spatial agglomeration and binary structure equilibrium index. The results show that: (1) overall, the degree of geographic agglomeration of China's livestock industry shows a weak trend of enhancement, the center of gravity of production moves to the northwest, the main production areas gradually move to the three northern regions, and Inner Mongolia and Liaoning become emerging large livestock production provinces; (2) in terms of classification, there are obvious geographical characteristics in the movement of the center of gravity of production of various livestock products; some livestock product production is highly concentrated in a few provinces and produces (3) "Zhongtiao Mountains-Taihang Mountains" has become an important geographical division of spatial division of labor for livestock products in China, and the North China Plain and Loess Plateau on the left and right sides have become the landing areas of the center of gravity for the production of grain-consuming and herbivorous livestock products, respectively; 2006 was the peak of spatial concentration of livestock industry in China. 2006 is not only the peak inflection year of spatial concentration of livestock industry in China, but also the turning point of balanced development of grain-consuming livestock industry and herbivorous livestock industry. Therefore, following the intrinsic requirements of the new development concept on productivity layout, it is proposed to comprehensively implement the green spatial layout strategy, deeply promote the innovation of grass-livestock balance system, construct the green production mode of animal husbandry, coordinate and promote the "one place, one product" characteristic animal husbandry industrialization project and promote the transformation from a large country of animal husbandry production to a strong country of animal husbandry industry.

AB  - This research aimed to invent a new method for cheese making using Rennin-like enzyme from fungus with high efficiency and reusability. Accordingly, Rhizomucor miehei (CBS: 370.65) showed a promising milk clotting (MCF) activity and the mycotoxin test was negative. The partially purified enzyme was immobilized by entrapment in paraffin wax using different techniques. Wax-enzyme tablets preparation exhibited complete immobilization yield (100%). Ca2+ had a marked stimulating effect on the activities of both the free and immobilized enzyme forms. The immobilized enzyme (MCI) exhibited more than sixteen effective reuses to produce cheese in a batch reactor. The free and the immobilized forms recorded their optimum activities at pH 5.6 and 55 degrees C, respectively. The immobilization process reduced the consumed activation energy (E-a) to 39%. The immobilized enzyme was more stable than the free form. Among all the used substrates, buffalo milk and full cream milk showed the highest immobilized enzyme activity (7142.9 U). km value was unaffected by the immobilization process and was 600 mg reaction(-1), for both. Schematic setup was used as semi-pilot example for a repeated batch of MCI wax tablets. This design solved the clotting problem completely by the refine bundle nominated its agreeability in the cheese-making process.

AB  - Animal models and clinical studies suggest an influence of angiotensin II (AngII) on the pathogenesis of liver diseases via the renin-angiotensin system. AngII application increases portal blood pressure, reduces bile flow, and increases permeability of liver tight junctions. Establishing the subcellular localization of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), the main AngII receptor, helps to understand the effects of AngII on the liver. We localized AT1R in situ in human and porcine liver and porcine gallbladder by immunohistochemistry. In order to do so, we characterized commercial anti-AT1R antibodies regarding their capability to recognize heterologous human AT1R in immunocytochemistry and on western blots, and to detect AT1R using overlap studies and AT1R-specific blocking peptides. In hepatocytes and canals of Hering, AT1R displayed a tram-track-like distribution, while in cholangiocytes AT1R appeared in a honeycomb-like pattern; i.e., in liver epithelia, AT1R showed an equivalent distribution to that in the apical junctional network, which seals bile canaliculi and bile ducts along the blood-bile barrier. In intrahepatic blood vessels, AT1R was most prominent in the tunica media. We confirmed AT1R localization in situ to the plasma membrane domain, particularly between tight and adherens junctions in both human and porcine hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and gallbladder epithelial cells using different anti-AT1R antibodies. Localization of AT1R at the junctional complex could explain previously reported AngII effects and predestines AT1R as a transmitter of tight junction permeability.

AB  - Status Epilepticus (SE) is a distributed network disorder, which involves the hippocampus and extrahippocampal structures. Epileptogenesis in SE is tightly associated with neurogenesis, plastic changes and neural network reorganization facilitating hyper-excitability. On the other hand, dendritic spines are known to be the excitatory synapse in the brain. Therefore, dendritic spine dynamics could play an intricate role in these network alterations. However, the exact reason behind these structural changes in SE are elusive. In the present study, we have investigated the aforementioned hypothesis in the lithium-pilocarpine treated rat model of SE. We have examined cytoarchitectural and morphological changes using hematoxylin-eosin and Golgi-Cox staining in three different brain regions viz. CA1 pyramidal layer of the dorsal hippocampus, layer V pyramidal neurons of anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and frontal neocortex of the same animals. We observed macrostructural and layerwise alteration of the pyramidal layer mainly in the hippocampus and ATL of SE rats, which is associated with sclerosis in the hippocampus. Sholl analysis exhibited partial dendritic plasticity in apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cells as compared to the saline-treated weight-/age-matched control group. These findings indicate that region-specific alterations in dendritogenesis may contribute to the development of independent epileptogenic networks in the hippocampus, ATL, and frontal neocortex of SE rats.

AB  - The hippocampus is broadly impacted by neuromodulations. However, how neuropeptides shape the func-tion of the hippocampus and the related spatial learning and memory remains unclear. Here, we discover the crucial role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in heterosynaptic neuromodulation from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to the hippocampus. Systematic knockout of the CCK gene impairs CA3-CA1 LTP and space-related performance. The MEC provides most of the CCK-positive neurons projecting to the hippocampal region, which potentiates CA3-CA1 long-term plasticity heterosynaptically in a frequency-and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent manner. Selective inhibition of MEC CCKergic neurons or downregulation of their CCK mRNA levels also impairs CA3-CA1 LTP formation and animals' performance in the water maze. This excitatory extrahippocampal projection releases CCK upon high-frequency excitation and is active during animal exploration. Our results reveal the critical role of entorhinal CCKergic projections in bridging intra-and extrahippocampal circuitry at electrophysiological and behavioral levels.

AB  - Arnica tincture is a herbal medicinal preparation with anti-inflammatory activity which is used traditionally for the topical treatment of blunt injuries as well as rheumatic muscle and joint complaints. Its main bioactive constituents are sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) of the helenalin and 11 alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin types. Besides the mentioned activity, the tincture and its isolated STLs have antileishmanial activity. In a recent in vivo study, a treatment with Arnica tincture cured cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) in a golden hamster model. CL is a neglected tropical disease affecting more than two million people every year, for which new treatments are urgently needed. In order to use Arnica tincture on open CL lesions of human patients, it is important to know how the constituents are metabolized. Therefore, in vitro metabolism experiments with liver microsomes of different species (rat, pig and human) were performed with the Arnica STLs helenalin acetate and 11 alpha,13-dihydrohelenalin acetate. Phase I and phase II metabolism experiments were performed, as well as a combination of both. Glutathione conjugation plays a major role in the metabolism of these STLs, as could be expected based on previous reports on their reactivity. Besides glutathione conjugates, several other metabolites were formed, e.g., water conjugates and hydroxides. Our results show for the first time a detailed picture of the metabolism of Arnica STLs. The fast and extensive formation of glutathione conjugates makes it unlikely that low absorbed levels of these compounds, as expected after dermal absorption from Arnica tincture, could be of toxicological concern.

AB  - Arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHCs) are typical arsenolipids found in various marine organisms. They can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, specifically affecting synaptic plasticity and the learning and memory ability of hippocampal neurons. Temporal lobe epilepsy often occurs in the hippocampus. Thus, the possible influence of AsHCs exposure to temporal lobe epilepsy garnered attention. The present study investigated the effects of epileptiform discharges (EDs) signals introduced by low-magnesium ACSF in the hippocampus of infantile male rats in vitro, using electrophysiological techniques with multi-electrode arrays under AsHC 360 exposure. In our study of the effects of AsHC 360 on EDs signals, we found that inter-ictal discharges (IIDs) were not significantly impacted. When AsHC 360 was removed, any minor effects observed were reversed. However, when we examined the impact of AsHC 360 on ictal discharges (IDs), distinct patterns emerged based on the concentration levels. For low-concentration groups (5, 20, 60 mu g As L-1), both the frequency and duration effects on IDs returned to normal post-elimination of AsHC 360. However, this recovery was not evident for concentrations of 100 mu g As L-1 or higher. IDs were only observed in EDs signals during exposures to AsHC 360 concentrations up to 60 mu g As L-1. In these conditions, ID frequencies significantly enhanced with the increased of AsHC 360 concentration. At high concentrations of AsHC 360 (>= 100 mu g As L-1), the transition from IIDs or pre-ictal discharges (PIDs) to IDs was notably inhibited. Additional study on co-exposure of AsHC 360 (100 mu g As L-1) and agonist (10 nM (S)-(-)-Bay-K-8644) indicated that the regulation of EDs signals under AsHC 360 exposure could be due to directly interference with the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) expression which influences the binding of excitatory glutamate neurotransmitter to AMPAR. The results suggest that EDs activities in the hippocampus of infantile Sprague Dawley rats are concentration-dependent on AsHC 360 exposure. Thus, it provides a basis for the seafood intake with AsHCs for epileptic patients and those with potential seizures.

AB  - Two-thirds of people with dementia suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and there is a need to develop treatments with fewer side effects. Cholinergic and glutamate-induced brain damage occurs in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, so substances that suppress these symptoms may be potential candidates for the treatment. Ethanol extracts of 40 kinds of oriental medicine plants were examined whether they have acetylcholine esterase (Ache) inhibitory properties. We next investigated whether the ethanol extracts of six oriental medicine plants showing Ache inhibitory activity could inhibit glutamate-induced HT22 cell death. The ethanol extract of Styrax japonica (EESJ) was found to be relatively superior in both inhibitory activities. MTT and annexin V/PI staining assays confirmed that EESJ inhibited glutamate-induced apoptosis in the HT22 mouse hippocampal cells. EESJ also suppressed glutamate-mediated ROS production and attenuated the phosphorylation levels of MAPK members including ERK, JNK, and p38 kinases. Therefore, EESJ is a suitable candidate for developing a substance of Alzheimer's disease treatment.

AB  - Alcohol consumption is believed to affect Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but the contributing mechanisms are not well understood. A potential mediator of the proposed alcohol-AD connection is autophagy, a degradation pathway that maintains organelle and protein homeostasis. Autophagy is regulated through the activity of Transcription factor EB (TFEB), which promotes lysosome and autophagy-related gene expression. The purpose of this study is to explore whether chronic alcohol consumption worsens the age-related decline in TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis in the brain and exacerbates cognitive decline associated with aging. To explore the effect of alcohol on brain TFEB and autophagy, we exposed young (3-month-old) and aged (23-month-old) mice to two alcohol-feeding paradigms and assessed biochemical, transcriptome, histology, and behavioral endpoints. In young mice, alcohol decreased hippocampal nuclear TFEB staining but increased SQSTM1/p62, LC3-II, ubiquitinated proteins, and phosphorylated Tau. Hippocampal TFEB activity was lower in aged mice than it was in young mice, and Gao-binge alcohol feeding did not worsen the age-related reduction in TFEB activity. Morris Water and Barnes Maze spatial memory tasks were used to characterize the effects of aging and chronic alcohol exposure (mice fed alcohol for 4 weeks). The aged mice showed worse spatial memory acquisition in both tests. Alcohol feeding slightly impaired spatial memory in the young mice, but had little effect or even slightly improved spatial memory acquisition in the aged mice. In conclusion, aging produces greater reductions in brain autophagy flux and impairment of spatial memory than alcohol consumption.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Uncaria rhynchophylla ([Mi] Jack) (gouteng) exerts antidepressive effects. Rhynchophylline (RH), a major component of U. rhynchophylla, exerts similar pharmacological effects to those of gouteng. Thus, RH may have antidepressive effects.Aim of the study: To investigate the anti-depressive effects of RH in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)induced depressive mice. The anti-depressive mechanism of RH determined by measuring the 5-HT levels, the expressions of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in cortex and hippocampus.Materials and methods: The behaviors of CUMS-induced depressive mice were measured using an open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST). 5-HT levels were measured using an ELISA kits. The expressions of BDNF and CREB were determined using western blot test.Results: RH increased the frequency of rearing and grooming in the OFT and decreased the immobility time in the FST and TST. RH effectively increased the 5-HT level and BDNF and CREB expressions in the cortex and hippocampus.Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the antidepressive mechanism of RH is related to increased levels of 5-HT from regulating CREB and BDNF expressions in cortex and hippocampus.

AB  - The pseudostem weevil (Odoiporus longicollis) is an important insect pest of banana which causes significant reduction in yields in many countries across the world. This study evaluated the transcriptome profile of O. longicollis infested resistant banana cultivar Musa paradisiaca cv. "Kachkal' for the first time and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) modulated during the host-pest interaction. RNA sequencing of the transcriptome of O. longicollis infested banana cultivar with respect to control revealed 2429 and 118 significantly upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. The genes upregulated during the O. longicollis-M. paradisiaca interaction were classified into 83 Gene Ontology (GO) classes of biological processes (BP), 47 classes of molecular function (MF), and 10 classes of cellular component (CC), while the downregulated genes were classified into 10 classes of BP, 6 classes of MF, and 2 classes of CC. Further, the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed 36 pathways associated with upregulated genes and 6 pathways with downregulated genes. Several defense-related genes significantly and highly upregulated in "Kachkal' in response to pseudostem weevil infestation, were found to have functions related to linoleic acid metabolism (lipoxygenase), response to biotic stress (PR4, PR1 like, mannose/glucose-specific lectins), amino and nucleotide sugar metabolism (phospholipase, chitinase 6, chitinase 10, endo-chitinase), peptidase inhibitor activity (Bowman-Birk type proteinase inhibitor-like), catalytic activity (terpene synthase, allene oxide synthase 2-like), protein kinase pathway (MAPK), biosynthesis of secondary metabolite (jasmonate), metabolic pathways (alpha amylase), sequence-specific DNA binding (WRKY), and molecular transcription (EtRP). Ten defense response-related genes, significantly upregulated in the banana cultivar upon O. longicollis infestation, were selected as important candidates for qRT-PCR validation. The expression patterns of the selected genes successfully validated the RNA sequencing results and at the same time established the potentiality of the genes in conferring defense or tolerance to herbivory by the insect pest. The study has generated substantial data in relation to defense-associated reprogramming of the M. paradisiaca cv. Kachkal transcriptome in response to attack by O. longicollis.

AB  - A single intratympanic application of the small-molecule drug AC102 was previously shown to promote significant recovery of hearing thresholds in a noise-induced hearing loss model in guinea pigs. Here, we report the effects of AC102 to revert synaptopathy of inner hair cells (IHCs) and behavioral signs of tinnitus in Mongolian gerbils following mild noise trauma. This experimental protocol led to minor hearing threshold shifts with no loss of auditory hair cells (HCs) but induced synaptopathy and a sustained and significant tinnitus percept. Treatment by intratympanic application of AC102 was evaluated in two protocols: 1. three weekly injections or 2. a single application. We evaluated hearing threshold changes using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and the development of a tinnitus percept using the gap prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (GPIAS) behavioral response. The number of IHC ribbon synapses along the cochlear frequency map were counted by immunostaining for the synaptic ribbon protein carboxy-terminal binding protein 2 (CTBP2). AC102 strongly and significantly reduced behavioral signs of tinnitus, as reflected by altered GPIAS. Noise-induced loss of IHC ribbon synapses was significantly reduced by AC102 compared to vehicle-treated ears. These results demonstrate that a single application of AC102 restores ribbon synapses following mild noise trauma thereby promoting recovery from tinnitus-related behavioral responses in vivo.

AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) is a notorious pest that threatens maize production worldwide. Current control measures involve the use of chemical insecticides and transgenic maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins. Although additional transgenes have confirmed insecticidal activity, limited research has been conducted in maize, at least partially due to the technical difficulty of maize transformation. Here, we describe implementation of a sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) vector for rapidly testing the efficacy of both endogenous maize genes and heterologous genes from other organisms for the control of S. frugiperda in maize. Four categories of proteins were tested using the SCMV vector: (i) maize defence signalling proteins: peptide elicitors (Pep1 and Pep3) and jasmonate acid conjugating enzymes (JAR1a and JAR1b); (ii) maize defensive proteins: the previously identified ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP2) and maize proteinase inhibitor (MPI), and two proteins with predicted but unconfirmed anti-insect activities, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and a lectin (JAC1); (iii) lectins from other plant species: Allium cepa agglutinin (ACA) and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA); and (iv) scorpion and spider toxins: peptides from Urodacus yaschenkoi (UyCT3 and UyCT5) and Hadronyche versuta (Hvt). In most cases, S. frugiperda larval growth was reduced by transient SCMV-mediated overexpression of genes encoding these proteins. Additionally, experiments with a subset of the SCMV-expressed genes showed effectiveness against two aphid species, Rhopalosiphum maidis (corn leaf aphid) and Myzus persicae (green peach aphid). Together, these results demonstrate that SCMV vectors are a rapid screening method for testing the efficacy and insecticidal activity of candidate genes in maize.

AB  - Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have been demonstrated to be linked with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we examined the protective effects of DL0410 in aging rats and explored the underlying mechanism against oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, which was then validated in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. We firstly investigated the improvement effects of DL0410 on learning and memory abilities and explored the potential mechanisms in D-gal-induced aging rats. An 8-week treatment with DL0410 significantly improved the learning and cognitive function of D-gal-stimulated Alzheimer's-like rats in the Morris water maze test, step-down test, and novel object recognition test, and the therapeutic effect of DL0410 at 10 mg/kg was even better than that of donepezil. What is more, the results showed that DL0410 alleviated neuron injury, increased the number of synapses, and improved the level of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in the hippocampus and cortex. Next, we examined the protective effects of DL0410 against oxidative damage and neuroinflammation. Our observations indicated that DL0410 reduced the production of harmful oxidation products and promoted the antioxidative system, decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10. Moreover, DL0410 inhibited the activation of astrocytes and microglia and suppressed the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. The anti-inflammation effect of DL0410 was further confirmed in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, and the results showed that DL0410 reduced the level of inflammatory factors and inhibited the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in BV2 microglia. Molecular docking results indicated that DL0410 occupied the LPS recognition site in the TLR4/MD2 complex. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of claudin-1, claudin-5, occludin, CX43, and ZO-1 indicated that DL0410 protected the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Together, these results suggest that DL0410 exerts neuroprotective effects against hippocampus and cortex injury induced by D-galactose, and the possible mechanisms include antioxidative stress, antineuroinflammation, improving synaptic plasticity, and maintaining BBB integrity, which is mediated by the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway inhibition. We suggest that DL0410 is a promising candidate for AD treatment.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to anesthetics has raised increasing attention about the neuronal development in offspring. Animal models are usually used for investigation. As a new drug, esketamine is the s-isoform of ketamine and is twice as potent as the racemic ketamine with less reported adverse effects. Esketamine is currently being used and become more favorable in clinical anesthesia work, including surgeries during pregnancy, yet the effect on the offspring is unknown. The present study aimed to elucidate the effects of gestational administration of esketamine on neuronal development in offspring, using a rat model. Gestational day 14.5 pregnant rats received intravenous injections of esketamine. The postnatal day 0 (P0) hippocampus was digested and cultured in vitro to display the neuronal growth morphology. On Day 4 the in vitro experiments revealed a shorter axon length and fewer dendrite branches in the esketamine group. The results from the EdU- imaging kit showed decreased proliferative capacity in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) in both P0 and P30 offspring brains in the esketamine group. Moreover, neurogenesis, neuron maturity and spine density were impaired, resulting in attenuated long-term potentiation (LTP). Compromised hippocampal function accounted for the deficits in neuronal cognition, memory and emotion. The evidence obtained suggests that the neurobehavioral deficit due to prenatal exposure to esketamine may be related to the decrease phosphorylation of CREB and abnormalities in N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor subunits. Taken together, these results demonstrate the negative effect of prenatal esketamine exposure on neuronal development in offspring rats.

AB  - Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a relevant animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation play a major role in the pathogenesis of MS and EAE. Melatonin, a neurohormone, has potent anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of our study was to assess the therapeutic properties of melatonin alone or in combination with interferon beta-1b (IFN beta-1b) or glatiramer acetate (GA) on EAE. EAE was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats with an intraperitoneal injection of a homogenate of spinal cord and pig brain. At day 10 post immunization, rats were euthanized, and their brains were immediately excised and processed to measure oxidative stress markers and membrane fluidity. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines were quantified in plasma. Melatonin alone or in combination with GA and IFN beta-1b inhibited the disease process of EAE and the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, caused a significant decrement in oxidative stress markers, and preserved the membrane fluidity in the motor cortex, midbrain, and spinal cord. The cumulative index score was significantly reduced in EAE rats treated with melatonin alone or in combination with GA and IFN beta-1b. In conclusion, our findings provide preclinical evidence for the use of melatonin as an adjuvant therapeutic treatment for MS.

AB  - Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, is a neurodegenerative illness characterized by the progressive impairment of cognitive functions, posing a significant global health threat. Physical exercise is widely recognized for its preventive role, providing benefits for both the body composition and brain health. This study aimed to explore the relationship between physical exercise, the body composition, and the progression of dementia. The analysis used clinical and neuroradiology data from 42 patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our study mainly focused on crucial parameters such as the body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle index (SMI), and MRI biomarkers, including the hippocampal volume and white matter integrity. We grouped the participants according to the similarities of their body compositions through clustering techniques. Then, atrophy-related changes in the brain structures were computed using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our findings suggest that a higher BMI and greater muscle mass may slow down brain atrophy, suggesting a protective effect on the brain. Based on these results, preserving muscle mass and metabolic health through resistance and aerobic exercise appears crucial in reducing the risk of dementia. Body composition interventions may slow neurodegenerative changes and promote brain health. This is an essential piece of information about prevention strategies, especially for individuals at risk of dementia who may benefit from following structured physical activity strategies.

AB  - Accumulating studies have unraveled that dexmedetomidine (DEX) is neuroprotective against brain damage. However, it remains largely unknown about the mechanism involved in the neuroprotective effect of DEX. Therefore, this study explored whether DEX could affect mitophagy and pyroptosis in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. We established a hippocampal neuron model of oxygen glucose-deprivation (OGD) and a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which were then intervened with DEX and the autophagy inhibitor (3-MA). It was found that DEX intervention significantly increased neuron viability and mitophagy. Additionally, DEX intervention reversed increased oxidative stress and pyroptosis caused by OGD. DEX intervention further maintained the activation of the PINK1/Parkin pathway, while 3-MA treatment partly counteracted the protective effect of DEX on OGD-induced hippocampal neurons, suggesting that the inhibition of the PINK1/Parkin pathway reversed the function of DEX to increase cell viability and mitophagy and inhibit oxidative stress, pyroptosis, and apoptosis. Animal experiments also revealed that DEX intervention induced PINK1/Parkin pathway activation, reduced cerebral infarction and mitochondrial damage, promoted mitophagy, and inhibited pyroptosis, which was nullified by 3-MA treatment. Conclusively, DEX protects against pyroptosis and activates mitophagy in OGD/R-induced brain damage by activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway.

TI  - Decoding the genetic basis of secretory tissues in plants

LA  - English
AB  - Although plant secretory tissues play important roles in host defense against herbivores and pathogens and the attraction of insect pollinators, their genetic control remains elusive. Here, it is focused that current progress has been made in the genetic regulatory mechanisms underpinning secretory tissue development in land plants. C1HDZ transcription factors (TFs) are found to play crucial roles in the regulation of internal secretory tissues in liverworts and Citrus as well as external secretory tissues in peach. C1HDZ TFs regulate secretory tissue development via synergistic interaction with AP2/ERF and MYC TFs. Thus, a set of genes are speculated to be recruited convergently for the formation of secretory tissues in land plants.

AB  - In bacteria, archaea, protists, and plants, the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) by inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) can, under stress conditions, substitute for ATP-driven proton flux to generate a proton gradient and induce luminal acidification. However, this strategy is considered to be lost in eukaryotes. Here, we report that LHPP, a poorly understood PPase that exhibits activity at acidic pH, is primarily expressed in astrocytes and partly localized on lysosomal membranes. Under stress conditions, LHPP is recruited to vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and facilitates V-ATPase-dependent proton transport and lysosomal acidification by hydrolyzing PPi. LHPP knockout (KO) mice have no discernable phenotype but are resilient to chronic-stress induced depression-like behaviors. Mechanistically, LHPP deficiency prevents lysosome-dependent degradation of C/EBPb and induces the expression of a group of chemokines that promote adult neurogenesis. Together, these findings suggest that LHPP is likely to be a therapeutic target for stress-related brain disease.

AB  - To maximise the black soldier fly (BSF) bioconversion capacity, a waste that is not suitable for use as it is, can have a positive effect if combined with others in a formulation. In this perspective, a total of 3600 of 6-day-old larvae were inoculated on 6 iso-proteic, iso-lipidic and iso-energetic diets (named from D1 to D6; 100 larvae/replicate; 6 replicates/treatment) formulated with 21 by-products. To evaluate growth performance, 30 larvae per replicate were randomly sampled every 4 days until the 40% reached the prepupae phase, in which survival rate (SR), larva-prepupae time duration and bioconversion indexes were calculated. When a pupa was identified, it was moved in the emergence box (23 pupae/treatment) to evaluate the adult parameters: pupa-fly duration time, fly live weight, weight reduction, fly lifespan, puparium weight and emergence rate (ER). Considering SR (>92%) and ER (>94.6%), all diets were suitable for the BSF breeding. The D1 and D5 (composed by brewers spent grain, vegetable and fruit waste) groups overall performed the best larvae growth and development time, while D2 (composed by glaze waste and buffalo milk whey) displayed the worst (p < 0.05). The D5 maintained good weight in prepupae, pupae and adult stages and also D2 reached the same outcome. The bioconversion indexes followed the trend of the larvae performance. In conclusion, the results herein obtained allowed to discriminate the protein, fat and energy variables on the BSF life history traits and observe other factors of influence, such as the ash content, which will need to be evaluated with future research.

AB  - Dendritic spines are actin-rich protrusions that receive a signal from the axon at the synapse. Remodeling of cytoskeletal actin is tightly connected to dendritic spine morphology-mediated synaptic plasticity of the neuron. Remodeling of cytoskeletal actin is required for the formation, development, maturation, and reorganization of dendritic spines. Actin filaments are highly dynamic structures with slow-growing/pointed and fast-growing/barbed ends. Very few studies have been conducted on the role of pointed-end binding proteins in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology. In this study, we evaluated the role played by tropomodulin 2 (Tmod2)-a brain-specific isoform, on the dendritic spine re-organization. Tmod2 regulates actin nucleation and polymerization by binding to the pointed end via actin and tropomyosin (Tpm) binding sites. We studied the effects of Tmod2 overexpression in primary hippocampal neurons on spine morphology using confocal microscopy and image analysis. Tmod2 overexpression decreased the spine number and increased spine length. Destroying Tpm-binding ability increased the number of shaft synapses and thin spine motility. Eliminating the actin-binding abilities of Tmod2 increased the number of mushroom spines. Tpm-mediated pointed-end binding decreased F-actin depolymerization, which may positively affect spine stabilization; the nucleation ability of Tmod2 appeared to increase shaft synapses.

AB  - Tolerance to chemical insecticides can be driven by the necessity of herbivorous insects to defend against host plant-produced phytochemicals. However, how the phytochemicals are sensed and further transduced into a defense response associated with insecticide tolerance is poorly understood. Herein, we show that pre-exposure to flavone, a flavonoid phytochemical, effectively enhanced larval tolerance to multiple synthetic insecticides and elevated detoxification enzyme activities in Spodoptera litura. RNASeq analysis revealed that flavone induced a spectrum of genes spanning phase I and II detoxification enzyme families, as well as two transcription factors Cap "n" collar isoform C (CncC) and its partner small muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis (MafK). Knocking down of CncC by RNA interference suppressed flavone-induced detoxification gene expression and rendered the larvae more sensitive to the insecticides. Flavone exposure elicited a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, while scavenging of ROS inhibited CncC-mediated detoxification gene expression and suppressed flavone-induced detoxification enzyme activation. Metabolome analysis showed that the ingested flavone was mainly converted into three flavonoid metabolites, and only 3-hydroxyflavone was found to affect the ROS/CncC pathway-mediated metabolic detoxification. These results indicate that the ROS/CncC pathway is an important route driving detoxification gene expression responsible for insecticide tolerance after exposure to the phytochemical flavone.

AB  - In Thailand, wild yam, or Dioscorea hispida Dennst., is a starchy crop that is usually underutilized in industry. The purpose of this study was to isolate the starch and extract the phytochemical from D. hispida and use them in cosmetics. Starch was used instead of talcum, which can cause pulmonary talcosis in dusting powder formulas (DP 1-5). GC-MS was used to identify the bioactive components present in the ethanolic extract of D. hispida. The main compounds were identified as 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)- (6.51%), stigmasta-5,22-dien-3-ol, (3.beta.,22E)- (6.41%), linoleic acid ethyl ester (5.72%), (Z,Z)-9,12-octadeca-dienoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxy-propyl (3.89%), and campesterol (3.40%). Then, the extract was used as an ingredient in facial sleeping mask gel formulas (SM 1-SM 5). Stability tests, physical characteristics, enzyme inhibitions, and sensitization dermal toxicity tests were used to evaluate the DP and SM formulations. The results showed that the fresh tubers of D. hispida showed a 12.5% w/w starch content. The findings demonstrated that starch powder had a restricted size distribution, ranging from 2 to 4 mu m, and a smooth surface that was polygonal. Following stability testing, the color, odor, size, and flowability of all DP formulations did not significantly differ. The SEM investigation revealed that DP particles were homogenous. For the sensitization dermal toxicity test, DP denoted no erythema or skin irritation in the guinea pigs. After stability testing, the colors of the SM formulas were deeper, and their viscosity slightly increased. The pH did not significantly change. After the stability test, SM formulas that contained Glycyrrhiza glabra and D. hispida extracts exhibited stable tyrosinase and elastase inhibitory activities, respectively. In the sensitization dermal toxicity test, guinea pigs showed skin irritation at level 2 (not severe) from SM, indicating that redness developed. All of these findings indicate that D. hispida is a plant that has potential for use in the cosmetics industry. Furthermore, D. hispida starch can be made into a beauty dusting powder, and more research should be conducted to develop an effective remedy for patients or those with skin problems.

AB  - Maternal high fat diet (HFD) affects the neurodevelopment of offspring and has long-term consequences on cognitive behavior. This study investigated changes occurring in GRP78 and PERK, important markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) signaling, in the hippocampus of female adult rats exposed to maternal HFD, and in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, with its important role in the regulation of cognitive behavior, and the potential neuroprotective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against these changes. A maternal obesity model was created with HFD (60% kcal). NAC (150 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically to both the NAC and HFD + NAC groups. The animals were mated at 12 weeks of age. The same diet was maintained throughout pregnancy and lactation. All female rat pups were subjected to the water maze test at eight weeks of age. Hippocampal GRP78 and PERK expressions increased in the HFD rats. However, maternal HFD suppressed hippocampal BDNF levels and reduced hippocampal neuronal volume. NAC supplementation reduced GRP78 and PERK expressions and increased BDNF and hippocampal volume values in the HFD + NAC group. At behavioral assessments, rats in the HFD group exhibited decreased memory and learning ability, but the HFD + NAC group exhibited stronger responses than the HFD group. Our findings suggest that the decrease in BDNF expression, which plays a role in memory and learning, after maternal HFD exposure may be due to ERS associated with increased GRP78 and PERK expressions. Furthermore, NAC supplementation may ameliorate the impairment in memory and spatial learning ability by attenuating hippocampal ERS in HFD rats.

AB  - The advantages of Magnetic Coupling Resonant Wireless Power Transfer (MCR-WPT) technology include long transmission distance, high efficiency, and high power. Therefore, it shows great potential in the field of smart home. This study aims to explore the specific impacts on the cognitive functions and neuronal excitation of mice exposed to the electromagnetic fields (EMF) emitted by the MCR-WPT platform, thereby providing biological solid experimental evidence for developing Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. The research employed a frequency of 90 kHz, which is suitable for wireless charging of household appliances. Mice were exposed to EMF emitted by the WPT biosafety experimental platform for various durations. And they were divided into four groups (control group, 2-week exposure group, 4-week exposure group, and 8-week exposure group). Upon completion of the exposure period, the study employed the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test to evaluate the learning and memory capabilities of the animals. Following this, whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were conducted to record the action potentials (AP) and potassium currents. It was revealed by our observations that, in comparison to mice without electromagnetic exposure, long-term exposure to WPT-emitted EMF resulted in accelerated release of action potentials, inhibited the activation of Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels (VGKCs) current, accelerated the deactivation of K+ channel current, and thus significantly improved the excitability of neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of mice, but did not significantly affect cognitive function.

AB  - Genetically-modified crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins have been widely cultivated, permitting an effective non-chemical control of major agricultural pests. While their establishment can enable an area-wide suppression of polyphagous herbivores, no information is available on the impact of Bt crop abandonment in entire landscape matrices. Here, we detail a resurgence of the cosmopolitan bollworm Helicoverpa armigera following a contraction of Bt cotton area in dynamic agro-landscapes over 2007-2019 in North China Plain. An 80% reduction in Bt cotton was mirrored in a 1.9-fold increase of ambient H. armigera population levels, culminating in 1.5-2.1-fold higher yield loss and a 2.0-4.4-fold increase in pesticide use frequency in non-Bt crops (i.e. maize, peanut, soybean). Our work unveils the fate of herbivorous insect populations following a progressive dis-use of insecticidal crop cultivars, and hints at how tactically deployed Bt crops could be paired with agro-ecological measures to mitigate the environmental footprint of crop production.

AB  - BackgroundsExisting methods for fluoride (F-) determination in plant material require expensive equipment and specialized reagents. This study aimed to develop a simple and cost-effective method for fluoride analysis in plant samples.ResultsUsing an orthogonal assay design with certified reference material, this study optimized a sodium hydroxide extraction method (5 mol<middle dot>L-1) with heating at 120 degrees C for 0.5 h, followed by the addition of potassium acetate, ionic strength adjustment, and measurement via an ion-selective electrode. The method achieved a limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.41 and 4.71 mg<middle dot>kg(-)(1), respectively. Recovery rates ranged from 84.74 to 89.34% in Arabidopsis thaliana (intraday relative standard deviation [RSD] <= 2.31%, inter-day RSD <= 4.17%) and from 83.53 to 91.55% in Camellia sinensis (intraday RSD <= 3.11%, inter-day RSD <= 4.98%). In A. thaliana cultivated in NaF-dosed (500 mu M) nutrient solution, the fluoride concentration in the shoot was 16.00 mg<middle dot>kg-1; In C. sinensis grown under 250 mu M NaF treatment, the shoot fluoride concentration was 292.71 mg<middle dot>kg-1. Moreover, the fluoride concentration in Tea products purchased from local supermarkets ranged from 16.28 to 61.78 mg kg-1.ConclusionThis study presents a simple, reliable, and cost-effective method for fluoride analysis in plant materials, which can be further validated through inter-laboratory testing to establish a standardized approach.

AB  - CRISPR-based genome-editing tools have emerged as an efficient tool for functional genomics studies. Online tools and databases have been developed to facilitate the design and selection of CRISPR single guide RNA (sgRNA) for gene modifications. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these tools or database are designated to cell surface proteins. In a previous study, we described the development and application of surfaceome CRISPR libraries targeting to cell surface proteins on human cells. Here, we present the design and construction of an online tool and database (https://crispr-surfaceome.si ais. shanghaitech.edu.cn/home), named CRISPR-Surfaceome, for the design of highly efficient sgRNA targeting to the surface proteins on human cells. To show case and validate the efficiencies of sgRNAs designed by this online tool, we chose ICAM-1 gene for knockout studies and found that all the 10 designed ICAM-1 sgRNAs could efficiently generate knockout cells, with more than 80% gene disruption rates. These ICAM-1 knockout cells were found to be resistant to the infection of rhinovirus (RV), which utilizes ICAM-1 as the receptor. Therefore, CRISPR-Surfaceome can serve the research community for the func-tional genomics studies on cell surface proteins, such as identification of pathogen receptors and discov-ery of drug targets.

AB  - The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway plays a vital role in mediating plant resistance to herbivores. The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most important woody cash crops in the world. Due to the lack of genetic transformation systems for tea plants, how the JA signaling pathway works in tea plants has not yet been determined. Now, with the development of cross-disciplines, chemical biology provides new means for analyzing the JA signaling pathway. In the present study, the structure of the small-molecule isoquinoline compound ZINC71820901 (lyn3) was obtained from the ZINC molecular library through virtual screening based on the structure of the crystal COI1-JAZ1 co-receptor and was found to act as an inhibitor of the JA signaling pathway in both Arabidopsis and tea plants. Our results revealed that lyn3 repressed tea plant resistance to Ectropis grisescens mainly by decreasing the accumulation of (-)-epicatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin via repression of the JA signaling pathway, which functioned in a modulation manner different from that of the already known inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM). As a novel inhibitor of the JA signaling pathway, lyn3 provides a specific option for further research on the JA pathway.

AB  - The creatine precursor Guanidinoacetic Acid (GAA) accumulates in the genetic deficiency of the GuanidinoAcetate Methyl Transferase (GAMT) enzyme and it is believed to cause the seizures that often occur in this condition. However, evidence that it is indeed epileptogenic is scarce and we previously found that it does not cause neuronal hyperexcitation in in vitro brain slices. Here, we used Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) to further investigate the electrophysiological effects of its acute and chronic administration in the networks of cultured neurons, either neocortical or hippocampal. We found that: (1) GAA at the 1 mu M concentration, comparable to its concentration in normal cerebrospinal fluid, does not modify any of the parameters we investigated in either neuronal type; (2) at the 10 mu M concentration, very similar to that found in the GAMT deficiency, it did not affect any of the parameters we tested except the bursting rate of neocortical networks and the burst duration of hippocampal networks, both of which were decreased, a change pointing in a direction opposite to epileptogenesis; (3) at the very high and unphysiological 100 mu M concentration, it caused a decrease in all parameters, a change that again goes in the direction opposite to epileptogenesis. Our results confirm that GAA is not epileptogenic.

AB  - Episodic memory relies on the entorhinal cortex (EC), a crucial hub connecting the hippocampus and sensory processing regions. This study investigates the role of the lateral EC (LEC) in episodic-like memory in mice. Here, we employ the object-place-context-recognition task (OPCRT), a behavioral test used to study episodic-like memory in rodents. Electrophysiology in brain slices reveals that OPCRT specifically induces a shift in the threshold for the induction of synaptic plasticity in LEC superficial layer II. Additionally, a dual viral system is used to express chemogenetic receptors coupled to the c-Fos promoter in neurons recruited during the learning. We demonstrate that the inhibition of LEC neurons impairs the performance of the mice in the memory task, while their stimulation significantly facilitates memory recall. Our findings provide evidence for an episodic-like memory engram in the LEC and emphasize its role in memory processing within the broader network of episodic memory.

AB  - Odorant receptors (ORs) of ladybird Hippodamia variegata play vital chemosensory roles in searching and locating preys. In the current study, 37 ORs were initially identified from the antennal transcriptome of H. variegata. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that several HvarORs including HvarOR25 were specific or enriched in ladybird antennae. In two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, recombinant HvarOR25 was narrowly tuned to six chemical ligands including aphid-induced, aphid-derived, and plant-derived volatiles. In electroantennogram assays, all six volatiles elicited electrophysiological responses. Among the six volatiles, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, hexyl butyrate, hexyl hexanoate, and 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol were attractive for both sexes of H. variegata. Additionally, molecular docking indicated that HvarOR25 was bound to all ligands with high binding affinities. Taken together, HvarOR25 facilitates perception of preys by recognizing relevant allelochemicals from hosts and habitat. Our findings provide valuable insights into understanding biological functions of HvarORs and help to develop a novel biocontrol strategy based on olfactory-active compounds.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is common and is associated with poor outcome. Neural circuit involvement in POCD is unknown. Lateral habenula (LHb) that regulates coping and depression-like behaviors after aversive stimuli is activated by surgery in the previous study. Here, surgery activated LHb and ventral tegmental area (VTA) are presented. VTA is known to receive projections from LHb and project to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Direct chemogenetic inhibition of LHb or damaging LHb attenuates surgery-induced learning and memory impairment, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammatory responses and cell injury in the VTA, and activation of rostromedial tegmental nucleus, an intermediate station to connect LHb with VTA. LHb inhibition preserves dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Retrograde inhibition of LHb via its projections to VTA attenuated surgery-induced learning and memory dysfunction is observed. Retrograde activation of LHb induced learning and memory dysfunction is observed. Inhibition of NMDA receptors, dopamine synthesis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the VTA reduced surgery-induced learning and memory impairment, inflammatory responses, and cell injury are observed. These results suggest that surgery activates the LHb-VTA neural circuit, which contributes to POCD and neuropathological changes in the brain. These novel findings represent initial evidence for neural circuit involvement in surgery effects.

AB  - Purpose Silicon (Si) accumulation is an important strategy for plant defense against biotic and abiotic stress. Solid amorphous silica (ASi) deposits have been found to protect plants against different stressors (e.g., drought stress, ultraviolet radiation, herbivory, and pests). Most research on ASi deposits and their subsequent function is conducted under lab conditions. However, it is still unclear at which stage in ontogeny ASi deposits are developed to fulfill their function in plant protection under field conditions. Methods We combined SEM-EDX, NMR spectroscopy, and Si extractions to analyze silicification patterns in wheat leaves (blades and sheaths) in relation to ontogeny and soil Si availability. Results Silicification patterns in wheat leaves varied strongly in intensity between four different growth stages (tillering, stem extension, heading, and grain filling) and ASi deposition did not just continuously increase over the growing season. Newly formed leaf tissues showed relatively low Si concentrations, which increased over time. A high condensation state of the silica bodies and trichomes was found at all growth stages, referring to a high rigidity of the silica bodies. Conclusions Our results indicate that development of ASi deposits in wheat leaves depends on growth stage and Si availability. Detailed knowledge on solid ASi deposition in wheat during ontogeny and its consequences for stress mitigation is crucial for farmers worldwide.

AB  - (1) Background: This study aims to evaluate how different irrigation settings and the use of ureteral access sheaths (UASs) of varying sizes impact intrarenal pressure (IRP) during flexible ureteroscopy (fURS) procedures in pigs. (2) Methods: This study utilized three anesthetized female pigs. A novel flexible ureteroscope with the ability to continuously record live intrarenal pressure was used to perform ureteroscopy in different settings. Ureteroscopy was performed without UAS and with the use of 11/13 and 12/14 UAS at the ureteropelvic junction. Two different irrigation methods were employed for each parameter: one using gravity flow and the other using manual pumping with a commercial pump. IRP was also recorded with the presence of a laser fiber or lithotripsy basket. (3) Results: The recorded mean IRP during flexible URS without UAS was 28.25 (+/- 11.2) under gravity irrigation; 35.46 (+/- 10.08) under manual pumping; 22.5 (+/- 3.05) and 30.75 (+/- 5.79) with a laser fiber under gravity irrigation and manual pumping, respectively; and 16.45 (+/- 1.27) and 17.27 (+/- 3.69) with a lithotripsy basket under gravity irrigation and manual pumping, respectively. With an 11/13 UAS, the mean IRP was 15.41 (+/- 8.57) and 19.33 (+/- 4.26) under gravity and manual pumping irrigation, respectively; 14.56 (+/- 2.50) and 18.64 (+/- 5.13) with a laser in each irrigation setting, respectively; and 13.10 (+/- 3.39) and 13.86 (+/- 4.63) with a lithotripsy basket, respectively. With a 12/14 UAS, the mean IRP was 7.64 (+/- 3.08) and 9.25 (+/- 1.42) under gravity and manual pumping irrigation, respectively; 9.50 (+/- 6.04) and 10.28 (3.46), respectively, in each setting when the laser fiber was used; and 5.32 (+/- 1.57) and 6.26 (+/- 1.79), respectively, when the lithotripsy basket was inserted. (4) Conclusion: Novel flexible ureteroscopes with integrated pressure sensors are both a feasible and reliable tool during fURS, giving the surgeon the ability to live-track the IRP. The results of the IRP measurements with and without UAS are in accordance with the current literature and exhibit a consistent pattern with previous studies.

AB  - Rice is a staple food crop worldwide, and its production is severely threatened by phloem-feeding insect herbivores, particularly the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), and destructive pathogens. Despite the identification of many BPH resistance genes, the molecular basis of rice resistance to BPH remains largely unclear. Here, we report that the plant elicitor peptide (Pep) signalling confers rice resistance to BPH. Both rice PEP RECEPTORs (PEPRs) and PRECURSORs of PEP (PROPEPs), particularly OsPROPEP3, were transcriptionally induced in leaf sheaths upon BPH infestation. Knockout of OsPEPRs impaired rice resistance to BPH, whereas exogenous application of OsPep3 improved the resistance. Hormone measurement and co-profiling of transcriptomics and metabolomics in OsPep3-treated rice leaf sheaths suggested potential contributions of jasmonic acid biosynthesis, lipid metabolism and phenylpropanoid metabolism to OsPep3-induced rice immunity. Moreover, OsPep3 elicitation also strengthened rice resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and bacterial pathogen Xanthamonas oryzae pv. oryzae and provoked immune responses in wheat. Collectively, this work demonstrates a previously unappreciated importance of the Pep signalling in plants for combating piercing-sucking insect herbivores and promises exogenous application of OsPep3 as an eco-friendly immune stimulator in agriculture for crop protection against a broad spectrum of insect pests and pathogens.

AB  - The hippocampus is a central modulator of the HPA-axis, impacting the regulation of stress on brain structure, function, and behavior. The current study assessed whether three different types of 3 months mental Training Modules geared towards nurturing (a) attention-based mindfulness, (b) socio-affective, or (c) socio-cognitive skills may impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress. We evaluated mental training-induced changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity, by combining longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in 332 healthy adults. We related these changes to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. We observed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume (CA1-3) following the 3 months compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills (Affect module), as compared to socio-cognitive skills (Perspective module) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention. Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective as compared to socio-cognitive skills. Furthermore, training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Notably, using a multivariate approach, we found that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. Overall, we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioural intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults.

AB  - Nitrate (NO3-), a key form of inorganic nitrogen (N) in soils, is typically lost in tea gardens through leaching. However, NO3- utilization efficiency (NiUE) and its characteristic mechanism in tea plants remain unclear. This study screened contrastive genotypes of NiUE using leaf chlorate sensitivity and explored the potential genes that regulate this process. Fresh branches of 10 cultivars were hydroponically cultivated and subjected to potassium nitrate (KNO3) and potassium chlorate (KClO3) treatments, with the former as the control group. The sensitive cultivar, Zhenong 117 (ZN117), showed a decrease in SPAD and Fv/Fm values following KClO3 treatment, while the tolerant cultivar, Teiguanyin (TGY), exhibited minimal significant changes. After 5 days of cultivation, the 15N concentration and proportion in new shoots of ZN117 were significantly higher than those in TGY. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of genes responsible for NO3- transport, including the nitrate transporters NRT2.4, NPF4.6, NPF6.1, NPF1.10, and NPF1.11, significantly increased in ZN117 after NO3- supply. Genes involved in NO3- reduction, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis were progressively induced. Coexpression network analysis indicated that the squamosa promoter-binding protein activated the onset of NO3- signaling, while basic helix-loop-helix transcripts were triggered to higher levels during NO3- supply. This study proposes a rapid characterization method of NiUE in woody plants and a speculative molecular regulatory mechanism for the NO3- transfer and remobilization of tea plants. A set of specific genes involved in NO3- transport, reduction, and mobilization were identified and proposed as marker genes for NiUE in tea plants.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes lifelong neurologic disability. Despite the use of therapeutic hypothermia, memory deficits and executive functions remain severely affected. Cholinergic neurotransmission from the basal forebrain to neocortex and hippocampus is central to higher cortical functions. We examined the basal forebrain by light microscopy and reported loss of choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT)+ neurons, at postnatal day (P) 40, in the ipsilateral medial septal nucleus (MSN) after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in mice. There was no loss of ChAT+ neurons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and striatum. Ipsilateral striatal and nbM ChAT+ neurons were abnormal with altered immunoreactivity for ChAT, shrunken and crenated somas, and dysmorphic appearing dendrites. Using confocal images with 3D reconstruction, nbM ChAT+ dendrites in HI mice were shorter than sham (p = .0001). Loss of ChAT+ neurons in the MSN directly correlated with loss of ipsilateral hippocampal area. In the nbM and striatum, percentage of abnormal ChAT+ neurons correlated with loss of ipsilateral cerebral cortical and striatal area, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity increased in adjacent ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the increase was linearly related to loss of cortical and hippocampal area. Numbers and size of cathepsin D+ lysosomes increased in large neurons in the ipsilateral nbM. After neonatal HI, abnormalities were found throughout the major cholinergic systems in relationship to amount of forebrain area loss. There was also an upregulation of cathepsin D+ particles within the nbM. Cholinergic neuropathology may underlie the permanent dysfunction in learning, memory, and executive function after neonatal brain injury.

AB  - Background: Thymus quinquecostatus Celak. has been widely used as a spice and a folk medicine for relieving exterior syndrome and alleviating pain in China.
   Purpose: To explore the protective effects and the underlying mechanism against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) of the T. quinquecostatus combining with its chemical composition.
   Study design and methods: High-polar extract (HPE) was extracted from T. quinquecostatus and polyphenols in HPE were enriched to obtain polyphenol-rich fraction (PRF) using Macroporous resin. The free radicals and zebrafish embryos were used to compare the antioxidant activities of HPE and PRF in vitro and in vivo. Then, the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model was established in rats. Neurological deficit score, infarction rate, morphology and apoptosis of neurons were examined to investigate the protective effects of PRF on CIRI. The mRNA and protein levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the activities of downstream antioxidant enzymes in ischemia tissues were determined to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Also, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in zebrafish embryos were detected after incubation with PRF for a short time (2 h) to investigate whether PRF could directly eliminate free radicals. Finally, chemical composition of PRF were analyzed to investigate the material basis for antioxidant activity and anti-CIRI effect.
   Results: Compared with HPE, PRF showed stronger antioxidant activities. PRF exhibited obvious protective effects including ameliorating neurological deficit, lowering infarction rate, and improving the cellular morphology in hippocampus CA1 and cortex after tMCAO. TUNEL staining suggested PRF dose-dependently improved the apoptosis of the neurons in ischemic cortex. RT-qPCR and Western Blot results suggested that PRF regulated oxidative stress (OS) via activating the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Also, PRF could directly scavenge excessive ROS in zebrafish embryos after a short-time PRF incubation. The anti-CIRI effect might be primarily attributed to the abundant polyphenols in PRF, including flavonoids, polymethoxylated flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, and phenolic acids.
   Conclusion: T. quinquecostatus contains abundant polyphenols and exhibited a good protective effect against CIRI via dual antioxidant mechanisms, providing a reference for further research and application for this plant.

AB  - This study investigates the catechin composition and protective effect of green tea extract on senescence-mediated redox imbalance in the livers and kidneys of aged mice. The results showed that the seven catechins in the green tea extract analyzed in this study could be completely separated within 30 min and the main components of catechins in green tea extract were EGCG, EGC and ECG. In terms of the anti-senescence effects of green tea extract, green tea extract supplementation at doses of 125, 625 and 1250 mg/kg for 4 weeks significantly alleviated the senescence-mediated redox imbalance, as exhibited from significantly (p < 0.05) reduced thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyls levels in the serum, and increased glutathione (GSH) and total thiols contents in the plasma. Additionally, hepatic and renal protein carbonyls levels were significantly diminished (p < 0.05) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GSH-Rd) in the liver and kidney were remarkably elevated (p < 0.05). Overall, these results clearly show that green tea extract exhibits extremely potent protective effects against senescence-mediated redox imbalance in the livers and kidneys of mice by inhibiting oxidative damage of lipids and proteins and increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes in organs.

AB  - Highly virulent Streptococcus suis (S. suis) infections can cause Streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (STSLS) in pigs and humans, in which an excessive inflammatory response causes severe damage. Hemolysin (SLY) is a major virulence factor of S. suis serotype 2 that produces pores in the target cell membrane, leading to cytoplasmic K+ efflux and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, ultimately causing STSLS. The critical aspect of hemolysin in the pathogenesis of S. suis type 2 makes it an attractive target for the development of innovative anti-virulence drugs. Here, we use the S. suis toxin protein (SLY) as a target for virtual screening. A compound called canagliflozin, a hypoglycemic agent, was identified through screening. Canagliflozin significantly inhibits the hemolytic activity of hemolysin. The results combined with molecular dynamics simulation, surface plasmon resonance, and nano differential scanning fluorimetry show that canagliflozin inhibits the hemolytic activity of SLY by binding to SLY. In addition, canagliflozin markedly reduced the release of SC19-induced inflammatory factors at the cellular level and in mice. Importantly, the combination of canagliflozin and ampicillin had a 90% success rate in mice, significantly greater than the therapeutic effect of ampicillin. The findings suggest that canagliflozin may be a promising new drug candidate for S. suis infections.

AB  - The activity of Hippo signaling is commonly dysregulated in various human malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). YAP, the key effector of Hippo pathway, is regulated through several posttranslational modifications. However, the mechanism by which YAP is regulated by arginine methylation remains unknown. In this study, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify the arginine methylation site of YAP in HCC cells. The transcriptional activity of YAP and TEAD were further characterized by real-time qPCR and immunofluorescence assay, and a subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor mouse model was used to assess the effect of PRMT1-knockdown on HCC tumor growth. The result of mass spectrometry analysis identified that YAP was methylated at arginine 124. Moreover, we found that arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 interacted with YAP to mediate its arginine methylation, thus inhibited YAP phosphorylation and promoted YAP activity in the nucleus. PRMT1 was up-regulated in HCC tissues and positively associated with the expressions of YAP target genes. Silencing PRMT1 in HCC cells inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth, while PRMT1-overexpression promoted HCC growth through YAP methylation. Our study reveals that PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation at R124 is mutually exclusive with YAP S127 phosphorylation, thereby facilitating YAP activity in the nucleus and promoting tumorigenesis in HCC.

AB  - Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to test the anti-rheumatic effects of A. jaluense tubers in acute and chronic arthritis rats, and to assign its ingredients through UHPLC-TOF/MS.
   Materials and methods: Subcutaneous injection of carrageenan for acute arthritis and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) for chronic arthritis was carried out in the hind paw of SD rats. The paw volume was measured by a plethysmometer thermal hyperalgesia was tested using a thermal plantar tester, and mechanical hyperalgesia was evaluated by ankle flexion evoked vocalizations. The expression of c-Fos in the brain hippocampus was measured with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. The ingredients were assigned by UHPLC-TOF/MS, chromatography was performed by UHPLC system with DAD detector and BEH C-18 column, and spectroscopy was conducted by ESI-MS system.
   Results and discussion: The 80% ethanoic extract of A. jaluense tubers showed an acute anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing the edema volume in the hind paw of carrageenan-stimulated rats. In addition, A. jaluense tubers exerted an anti-rheumatic activity by reducing the secondary swelling volume from an immunological reaction in the left hind paw of CFA-induced chronic arthritis rats. Additionally, oral treatment with the 80% ethanoic extract -showed potent analgesic effects in the arthritis rats by recovering the paw withdrawal latency stimulated by the thermal hyperalgesia and by reducing the vocalization scores evoked by ankle flexion on both hind paws. Moreover, its treatment also indicated an anti-psychiatric effect by controlling the c-Fos protein expression of the brain hippocampus in CFA-stimulated arthritis rats. These results suggested that these therapeutic effects were exhibited by less toxic mono-esterified diterpenoid alkaloids (MDAs), and nontoxic non-esterified diterpenoid alkaloids (NDAs).
   Conclusion: A. jaluense tubers may act as viable therapeutic or preventive candidates for acute and chronic arthritis, particularly, for immune-inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis to suppress the pain and psychiatric condition.

AB  - Parental socioeconomic position (SEP) is a known determinant of a child's health. We aimed to investigate whether a low parental education, as proxy of SEP, has a direct effect on physician-diagnosed asthma, current asthma and current allergic rhinitis in children, or whether associations are mediated by exposure to other personal or environmental risk factors. This study was a secondary data analysis of two cross-sectional studies conducted in Italy in 2006. Data from 2687 adolescents (10-14 years) were analyzed by a path analysis model using generalized structural equation modelling. Significant direct effects were found between parental education and family characteristics (number of children (coefficient = 0.6229, p < 0.001) and crowding index (1.1263, p < 0.001)) as well as with exposure to passive smoke: during pregnancy (maternal: 0.4697, p < 0.001; paternal: 0.4854, p < 0.001), during the first two years of children's life (0.5897, p < 0.001) and currently (0.6998, p < 0.001). An indirect effect of parental education was found on physician-diagnosed asthma in children mediated by maternal smoking during pregnancy (0.2350, p < 0.05) and on current allergic rhinitis mediated by early environmental tobacco smoke (0.2002; p < 0.05). These results suggest the importance of promotion of ad-hoc health policies for promoting smoking cessation, especially during pregnancy.

AB  - Hypoxia is a predominant risk factor at high altitudes, and evidence suggests that high-altitude hypoxia alters the gut microbiota, which plays an essential regulatory role in memory function. However, the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and memory impairment under hypoxic conditions remains unclear. In this study, we employed a high-altitude hypoxia model combined with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) approach in mice to explore the effects of the gut microbiota on memory impairment in a hypoxic environment. We observed that high-altitude hypoxia exposure reduced short- and long-term memory and hippocampus-dependent fear memory abilities, along with decreased relative abundance of Ligilactobacillus and Muribaculum. Moreover, hypoxic conditions increased intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability. FMT from hypoxia-exposed mice into na & iuml;ve antibiotic-treated mice resulted in similar memory impairments, Ligilactobacillus and Muribaculum abundance changes, and increased intestinal/blood-brain barrier permeability. Correlation analysis showed a robust positive association between Ligilactobacillus and Muribaculum with hippocampus-dependent contextual fear memory. Likewise, Ligilactobacillus was positively correlated with short-term memory. Therefore, Ligilactobacillus and Muribaculum may be key microbes in reducing memory ability in hypoxia, with the intestinal and blood-brain barriers as primary pathways. Our findings provide further evidence for the potential regulatory mechanism by which gut microbiota dysbiosis may contribute to memory impairment in a high-altitude environment.

AB  - Phosphorylation of tau at sites associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) likely plays a role in the disease progression. Mitochondrial impairment, correlating with increased presence of phosphorylated tau, has been identified as a contributing factor to neurodegenerative processes in AD. However, how tau phosphorylated at specific sites impacts mitochondrial function has not been fully defined. We examined how AD-relevant phosphomimetics of tau impact selected aspects of mitochondrial biology. To mimic phosphorylation at AD-associated sites, the serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) sites in wild-type green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tau (T4) were converted to glutamic acid (E) to make pseudo-phosphorylated GFP-tagged Ser-396/404 (2EC) and GFP-tagged Thr-231/Ser-235 (2EM) constructs. These constructs were expressed in immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell lines, and their impact on specific mitochondrial functions and responses to stressors were measured. Phosphomimetic tau altered mitochondrial distribution. Specifically, mitochondria accumulated in the soma of cells expressing either 2EC or 2EM and neurite-like extensions in 2EC cells were shorter. Additionally, adenosine triphosphate levels were reduced in both 2EC- and 2EM-expressing cells, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increased in 2EC cells during oxidation of succinate when compared to T4-expressing cells. Thapsigargin reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ROS production in both 2EC and 2EM cells relative to T4 cells, with no significant difference in the effects of rotenone. These results show that tau phosphorylation at specific AD-relevant epitopes negatively affects mitochondria, with the extent of dysfunction and stress response varying according to the sites of phosphorylation. Altogether, these findings show that phosphorylated tau increases mitochondrial susceptibility to stressors and extend our understanding of potential mechanisms whereby phosphorylated tau promotes mitochondria dysfunction in tauopathies, including AD.

AB  - Episodic memory research in schizophrenia has a long history already which has clearly established significant impairments and strong associations with brain measures and functional outcome. The purpose of this chapter is not to make an exhaustive review of the recent literature but to highlight some relatively recent developments in the cognitive neuroscience field of episodic memory and schizophrenia. Hence, we present a contemporary view focusing specifically of relational memory which represents a form of episodic memory that refers to associations or binding among items or elements presented together. We describe the major tasks used and illustrate how their combination with brain imaging has: (1) favored the use of experimental memory tasks to isolate specific processes with specific neural correlates, (2) led to a distributed view of the neural correlates of memory impairments in schizophrenia where multiple regions are contributing, and (3) made possible the identification of fMRI biomarkers specific to episodic memory. We then briefly propose what we see as the next steps for memory research in schizophrenia so that the impact of this work can be maximized.

AB  - (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-(3-O-methyl) gallate 1, EGCG3 '' Me), an antiallergic O-methylated catechin, is present in high quantities in the green tea cultivar "Benifuuki" (Camellia sinensis L.). Previous studies have shown that EGCG3 '' Me inhibited basophil degranulation mediated through the cell-surface 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR), but the mechanisms are not fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of EGCG3 '' Me on IgE/antigen (Ag)-mediated degranulation and the combined effect of EGCG3 '' Me with eriodictyol (2), a bioactive flavanone. EGCG3 '' Me inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release from the rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL-2H3 stimulated by IgE/Ag and induced acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity. This induction was inhibited by anti-67LR antibody treatment. The ASM-specific inhibitor desipramine inhibited EGCG3 '' Me-induced suppression of degranulation. The soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor NS2028 weakened the potency of EGCG3 '' Me, and the sGC activator BAY41-2272 suppressed degranulation. The ability of EGCG3 '' Me to induce ASM activity and inhibit degranulation was amplified by eriodictyol. Furthermore, oral administration of the lemon-peel-derived eriodyctiol-7-O-glucoside (3) potentiated the suppressive effect of EGCG3 '' Me-rich "Benifuuki" green tea on the IgE/Ag-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction in BALB/c mice. These results suggest that EGCG3 '' Me inhibits IgE/Ag-mediated degranulation by inducing the 67LR/sGC/ASM signaling pathway, and eriodictyol amplifies this signaling.

AB  - Simple Summary Oocyte quality is acquired during ovarian folliculogenesis including oocyte growth and maturation, and plays a key role in subsequent embryo development. However, oocytes matured in vitro do not fully support the ability to develop into the blastocyst stage due to inadequate in vitro maturation (IVM) systems which do not sufficiently mimic the in vivo microenvironment. The sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway is important for ovarian folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation. Furthermore, our previous study demonstrated that low-quality porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) exhibit low developmental competence with a weak SHH signaling pathway. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to clarify the restorative effects of SHH protein supplementation during IVM on the developmental competence of low-quality porcine COCs, as assessed by brilliant cresyl blue staining. The results showed that the low developmental competence of low-quality porcine COCs can be improved by supplementation with the SHH protein. This indicates that an active SHH signaling pathway is required for the acquisition of developmental competence in porcine COCs. The sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is an important signaling pathway for mammalian ovarian folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation. A previous study demonstrated that low-quality porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) have low developmental competence, with lower SHH signaling protein expression before and after in vitro maturation (IVM) than high-quality COCs. However, there is no reported evidence on the restorative effects of SHH protein supplementation during the IVM of low-quality porcine COCs. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of SHH protein supplementation on the IVM of low-quality porcine COCs, as assessed by brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) staining. To examine this, we designed four groups: (i) BCB- (low-quality), (ii) BCB- + SHH, (iii) BCB+ (high-quality), and (iv) BCB+ + SHH. While the supplementation of SHH protein with high-quality COCs had no effect, supplementation with low-quality COCs significantly improved cumulus cell expansion, metaphase II rate, and subsequent embryo development following parthenogenetic activation. Our results provide the first evidence that the low developmental competence of low-quality porcine COCs can be improved by supplementation with the SHH protein. These results indicate that an active SHH signaling pathway is required for the acquisition of developmental competence in porcine COCs.

AB  - In multiple sclerosis (MS), mitochondrial alterations appear to contribute to disease progression. The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator siponimod is approved for treating secondary progressive MS. Its preceding compound fingolimod was shown to prevent oxidative stress-induced alterations in mitochondrial morphology. Here, we assessed the effects of siponimod, compared to fingolimod, on neuronal mitochondria in oxidatively stressed hippocampal slices. We have also advanced the model of chronic organotypic hippocampal slices for live imaging, enabling semi-automated monitoring of mitochondrial alterations. The slices were prepared from B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-CFP/COX8A)S2Lich/J mice that display fluorescent neuronal mitochondria. They were treated with hydrogen peroxide (oxidative stress paradigm) +/- 1 nM siponimod or fingolimod for 24 h. Afterwards, mitochondrial dynamics were investigated. Under oxidative stress, the fraction of motile mitochondria decreased and mitochondria were shorter, smaller, and covered smaller distances. Siponimod partly prevented oxidatively induced alterations in mitochondrial morphology; for fingolimod, a similar trend was observed. Siponimod reduced the decrease in mitochondrial track displacement, while both compounds significantly increased track speed and preserved motility. The novel established imaging and analysis tools are suitable for assessing the dynamics of neuronal mitochondria ex vivo. Using these approaches, we showed that siponimod at 1 nM partially prevented oxidatively induced mitochondrial alterations in chronic brain slices.

AB  - L-asparaginases are used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The aim of this work was to compare the antiproliferative potential and proapoptotic properties of novel L-asparaginases from different structural classes, viz. EcAIII and KpAIII (class 2), as well as ReAIV and ReAV (class 3). The EcAII (class 1) enzyme served as a reference. The proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects were tested using four human leukemia cell models: MOLT-4, RAJI, THP-1, and HL-60. The antiproliferative assay with the MOLT-4 cell line indicated the inhibitory properties of all tested L-asparaginases. The results from the THP-1 cell models showed a similar antiproliferative effect in the presence of EcAII, EcAIII, and KpAIII. In the case of HL-60 cells, the inhibition of proliferation was observed in the presence of EcAII and KpAIII, whereas the proliferation of RAJI cells was inhibited only by EcAII. The results of the proapoptotic assays showed individual effects of the enzymes toward specific cell lines, suggesting a selective (time-dependent and dose-dependent) action of the tested L-asparaginases. We have, thus, demonstrated that novel L-asparaginases, with a lower substrate affinity than EcAII, also exhibit significant antileukemic properties in vitro, which makes them interesting new drug candidates for the treatment of hematological malignancies. For all enzymes, the kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) and thermal stability (Tm) were determined. Structural and catalytic properties of L-asparaginases from different classes are also summarized.

AB  - The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate shapes learning and memory, but the underlying epigenetic mechanism of glutamate regulation in neuron remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that lysine demethylase KDM6B was expressed in excitatory neurons and declined in hippocampus with age. Conditional knockout of KDM6B in excitatory neurons reduced spine density, synaptic vesicle number and synaptic activity, and impaired learning and memory without obvious effect on brain morphology in mice. Mechanistically, KDM6B upregulated vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and 2 (VGLUT1/2) in neurons through demethylating H3K27me3 at their promoters. Tau interacted and recruited KDM6B to the promoters of Slc17a7 and Slc17a6, leading to a decrease in local H3K27me3 levels and induction of VGLUT1/2 expression in neurons, which could be prevented by loss of Tau. Ectopic expression of KDM6B, VGLUT1, or VGLUT2 restored spine density and synaptic activity in KDM6B-deficient cortical neurons. Collectively, these findings unravel a fundamental mechanism underlying epigenetic regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognition.

AB  - Norrin is a crucial regulator of the Wnt/(3-catenin signaling pathway, playing a key role in retinal vascular development, blood-brain barrier maintenance, and neuroprotection. In this study, a Norrin fusion protein (Norrin-Fc) was successfully expressed and purified using an insect cell expression system. Camels were immunized with purified Norrin-Fc to generate nanobodies, which consist solely of the heavy chain variable domains of heavy chain antibodies (VHH) with a molecular weight of approximately 15 kDa. Two nanobody strains, Nb 1C4 and Nb 2B10, were identified for their specific binding to Norrin-Fc, and their binding affinities were further characterized. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that Nb 1C4 and Nb 2B10 specifically bound to the Norrin-FZD4 fusion protein. Luciferase reporter assay results demonstrated that both nanobodies effectively disrupted LGR4-induced Wnt/(3-catenin signaling upon Norrin stimulation. This study represents the first successful development of nanobodies targeting Norrin, providing a strong foundation for the advancement of Norrin-related diagnostic tools and antibody therapeutics.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which spans several years from preclinical manifestations to dementia. In recent years, interest in the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to personalized medicine has grown considerably, and a major challenge that such models face is the transferability from the research settings to clinical practice. The objective of this work was to demonstrate the transferability of the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) model from well-characterized research data set, employed as training set, to independent less-structured and heterogeneous test sets representative of the clinical setting. The training set was composed of MRI data of 1043 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the test set was composed of data from 767 subjects from OASIS, Pharma-Cog, and ViTA clinical datasets. Both sets included subjects covering the entire spectrum of AD, and for both sets volumes of relevant brain regions were derived from T1-3D MRI scans processed with Freesurfer v5.3 cross-sectional stream. In order to assess the predictive value of the model, subpopulations of subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and MCIs that progressed to AD dementia (pMCI) were identified in both sets. SuStaIn identified three disease subtypes, of which the most prevalent corresponded to the typical atrophy pattern of AD. The other SuStaIn subtypes exhibited similarities with the previously defined hippocampal sparing and limbic predominant atrophy patterns of AD. Subject subtyping proved to be consistent in time for all cohorts and the staging provided by the model was correlated with cognitive performance. Classification of subjects on the basis of a combination of SuStaIn subtype and stage, mini mental state examination and amyloid-beta(1-42) cerebrospinal fluid concentration was proven to predict conversion from MCI to AD dementia on par with other novel statistical algorithms, with ROC curves that were not statistically different for the training and test sets and with area under curve respectively equal to 0.77 and 0.76.

AB  - The primary cilium, an immotile protrusion of vertebrate cells, detects chemical and mechanical stimuli in the extracellular milieu and transduces them into the cell body, thereby contributing to cellular development and homeostasis. In the mammalian brain, serotonin receptor type 6 (Htr6) and other specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) localize preferentially to primary cilia and function in ciliary chemical detection; however, the molecular mechanism by which a subset of GPCRs is transported to primary cilia has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that a region in the fourth intracellular domain of Htr6 (Htr6 i4) is sufficient for ciliary localization. In yeast, the interaction of this region with the C-terminal region of gamma 1-Adaptin, a subunit of adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), was identified. The interaction between Htr6 and gamma 1-Adaptin was confirmed by immunoprecipitation analysis using HEK293T cells. The preference for ciliary localization of Htr6 and Htr6 i4 was significantly decreased by ablation of gamma 1-Adaptin in hTERT RPE-1 cells, which was rescued by exogenous expression of gamma 1-Adaptin. Furthermore, Htr6 and Htr6 i4 showed reduced localization to primary cilia in gamma 1-Adaptin-depleted cultured hippocampal neurons compared with control neurons. These results indicate that the ciliary localization of Htr6 is facilitated by AP-1-mediated membrane trafficking.

AB  - An accessory gene regulator (agr) in the quorum sensing (QS) system in Staphylococcus aureus contributes to host infection, virulence factor production, and resistance to oxidative damage. Artificially maintaining the inactive state of agr QS impedes the host infection strategy of S. aureus and inhibits toxin production. The QS system performs intercellular signal transduction, which is activated by the mature autoinducer peptide (AIP). It is released from cells after AgrD peptide processing as an intercellular signal associated with increased bacterial cell density. This study evaluated the effectiveness of inhibiting agr QS wherein AIP trap carriers were made to coexist when culturing Staphylococcus aureus. Immersing a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane in Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600 culture inhibited QS -dependent alpha-hemolysin production, which significantly reduced the hemolysis ratio of sheep red blood cells by the culture supernatant. A quartz crystal microbalance analysis supported AIP adsorption onto the NC membrane. Adding the NC membrane during culture was found to maintain the expression levels of the agr QS gene agrA and alpha-hemolysin gene hla lower than that when it was not added. Eliminating extracellular AIP signals allowed agr QS to remain inactive and prevented QS -dependent alpha-hemolysin expression. Isolating intercellular signals secreted outside the cell is an effective strategy to suppress gene expression in bacterial cells that collaborate via intercellular signaling.

AB  - Commercial formulations of beneficial microbes have been used to enrich the rhizosphere microbiome of tomato plants grown in pots located in a glasshouse. These plants have been subjected to attacks by soil-borne parasites, such as root-knot nematodes (RKNs), and herbivores, such as the miner insect Tuta absoluta. The development of both parasites and the symptoms of their parasitism were restricted in these plants with respect to plants left untreated. A mixture, named in the text as Myco, containing plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), opportunistic biocontrol fungi (BCF), and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was more effective in limiting pest damage than a formulation containing the sole AMF (Ozor). Therefore, Myco-treated plants inoculated with RKNs were taken as a model for further studies. The PGPR contained in Myco were not able to reduce nematode infection; rather, they worsened symptoms in plants compared with those observed in untreated plants. Therefore, it was argued that both BCF and AMF were the microorganisms that colonized roots and stimulated the plant immune system against RKNs. Beneficial fungi colonized the roots by lowering the activities of the defense supporting enzymes endochitinases and beta-1,3-glucanase. However, as early as three days after nematode inoculation, these enzyme activities and the expression of the encoding pathogenesis-related genes (PR-2, PR-3) were found to be enhanced in roots with respect to non-inoculated plants, thus indicating that plants had been primed against RKNs. The addition of paclobutrazol, which reduces salicylic acid (SA) levels in cells, and diphenyliodonium chloride, which inhibits superoxide generation, completely abolished the repressive effect of Myco on nematode infection. Inhibitors of copper enzymes and the alternative cyanide-resistant respiration did not significantly alter resistance induction by Myco. When Myco-treated plants were subjected to moderate water stress and inoculated with nematodes, they retained numbers of developed individuals in the roots similar to those present in regularly watered plants, in contrast to what occurred in roots of untreated stressed plants that hosted very few individuals because of poor nutrient availability.

AB  - Tauopathy is a group of neurodegenerative diseases associated with abnormal phosphorylation and aggregation of microtubule-associated tau protein. There are currently no disease-modifying therapies for the treatment of tauopathies, however, substantial evidence has shown that there is a major role of neuroinflammation in the disease progression. According to the literature, ionizing radiation (IR) may serve as an effective tool for managing neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigated effects of the combined IR (gamma-rays and carbon-12 nuclei) on locomotor abilities and microglial activation markers in the brain of Tau P301S mice, a transgenic model for tauopathy. Irradiation resulted in the improvement of behavioral symptoms in mice: increased endurance and locomotor activity in the early symptomatic and terminal stages of the disease, respectively. At the same time, irradiation led to increase in the levels of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebellum and, to a lesser extent, in the hippocampus of the irradiated animals. The obtained data indicate a significant modulatory effect of IR on the innate immune system, highlighting high potential of radiotherapy as a new strategy for neurodegenerative disease treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary Paratuberculosis is a bacterial infection occurring globally in ruminants. Although it has a known impact on animal health and welfare, diagnosis is complicated by high animal densities, the chronic nature of the disease, the variable course of infection, and the immune response. The aim of the current study was to confirm whether Mycobacterium avium sp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infections occur in zoo animals in Poland. Faeces samples (n = 131) were collected for analysis from different species of animals from eight zoos in Poland. Our study provides the first confirmation of MAP in bongo antelope and confirms that MAP is present in Polish zoological gardens and requires monitoring, which can be easier now due to new legislation. Mycobacterial infections are significant issues in zoo animals, influencing animal welfare, conservation efforts, and the zoonotic potential of pathogens. Although tuberculosis is recognised to be highly dangerous, paratuberculosis can also lead to animal losses and is potentially dangerous for humans. The aim of the current study was to confirm whether Mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infections are currently present in zoos in Poland. Faeces samples (n = 131) were collected from different animal species from eight zoos in Poland. The faeces were decontaminated and inoculated into Herrold's Egg Yolk Media. The species was determined using commercial DNA testing. The IS900 was checked using RT-PCR. The culture was positive in seven samples: five with M. avium, one with Mycobacterium fortiatum, and one without any identified Mycobacterium species. RT-PCR confirmed MAP genetic material in nine animals. Our findings represent the first confirmation of MAP in bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus), indicating that it is present in Polish zoological gardens. Fortunately, the disease can be monitored more easily due to recent legislation (the Animal Health Law).

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional functionality of the xylanolytic complex produced from Aspergillus japonicus var. aculeatus UFMS 48.136 isolated from the Cerrado/Pantanal biome in Mato Grosso do Sul, compared to commercial xylanase, in swine diets. Sixteen barrows were used, with an initial weight of 64.23 +/- 10.5 kg, distributed in a randomized block experimental design, with four diets: control, formulated according to nutritional recommendations; negative control, formulated with a reduction of 100 Kcal / kg of metabolizable energy (ME); negative control + xylanase Cerrado / Pantanal; negative control + commercial xylanase; with four repetitions each. The xylanase supplementation provided higher (P<0.05) values of digestible energy (DE), ME, and higher (P<0.05) digestibility of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in relation to the negative control diet, but without differing (P>0.05) from the control diet. The inclusion of xylanases increased (P<0.05) in the coefficients of digestibility (CD) and metabolism of crude energy (CE), DM, OM, CP, EE, NDF, and ADF. There was no difference (P>0.05) in digestibility and CD values between Cerrado/Pantanal and commercial xylanase. The inclusion of xylanases made it possible to reduce 100 Kcal of ME per kilogram of diet. Cerrado/Pantanal xylanases therefore have the same nutritional efficiency as commercial xylanases.

AB  - Twenty-two lambs were used to determine their locomotor activity during lactation, and its circadian rhythm, based on data collected by actigraphy; the relationships among lambs were also measured calculating their proximity and distance. Lambs were fitted with Bluetooth-enabled (BT) accelerometers during weeks 1 and 4 of age, and data were downloaded as activity counts at 1-min intervals (Vector Magnitude, VM). Sensors were programmed as receivers and as beacons of the BT signal to calculate proximity (min/h) and distance (m) to another lamb. For each week, mean daily VM was calculated at hourly intervals. Circadian rhythms in VM were graphed by fitting the time-series measurements of each lamb to the cosine curve of a 24-h activity rhythm. Week of lactation and lamb sex had a significant (P < .05) effect on VM. Lambs had a higher (P < .05) VM (counts/min +/- S.E.) in week 1 (154 +/- 13) than in week 4 (117 +/- 4), and female (113 +/- 10) were more active (P < .01) than male lambs (113 +/- 10). Twin lambs spent more time (P < .001) close to its sibling than to another lambs. Lamb activity followed a 24-h rhythm in week 4, only. In conclusion, actigraphy demonstrated that circadian rhythms in activity were not present in the first week of life, and twin-born lambs had stronger associations with their littermates than did singletons with other lambs, which reflected the strong bond that is established between twin lambs.

AB  - Plant uridine diphosphate-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) play a key role in plant growth and metabolism. Here, we examined the evolutionary landscape among UGTs in 28 fully sequenced species from early algae to angiosperms. Our findings revealed a distinctive expansion and contraction of UGTs in the G and H groups in tea (Camellia sinensis), respectively. Whole-genome duplication and tandem duplication events jointly drove the massive expansion of UGTs, and the interplay of natural and artificial selection has resulted in marked functional divergence within the G group of the sinensis-type tea population. In Cluster II of group G, differences in substrate selection (e.g. abscisic acid) of the enzymes encoded by UGT genes led to their functional diversification, and these genes influence tolerance to abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought via different modes of positive and negative regulation, respectively. UGTs in Cluster III of the G group have diverse aroma substrate preferences, which contribute a diverse aroma spectrum of the sinensis-type tea population. All Cluster III genes respond to low-temperature stress, whereas UGTs within Cluster III-1, shaped by artificial selection, are unresponsive to drought. This suggests that artificial selection of tea plants focused on improving quality and cold tolerance as primary targets.
   Duplication events have increased the number of uridine diphosphate-dependent glycosyltransferase genes in tea plants, while natural and artificial selection have promoted their functional divergence.

AB  - Evolutionary theory is foundational to the life sciences because it unifies complex ecological principles and explains variation observed between and within species. Students at the secondary level often lack deep conceptual understanding of evolutionary theory, which is crucial to grasp topics related to primary drivers within populations such as inter- and intra-specific competition, predation, and reproductive success. Nonetheless, evolution remains a contentious topic in the United States. The prevalence of pseudoscientific belief among the U.S. populace warrants a calculated approach to deconstructing student misconceptions. This article puts forth an action-research-supported instructional strategy through which educators can identify and address core student misconceptions regarding evolutionary theory and other complex scientific phenomena, utilizing real-world and student-generated models to drive instruction.

AB  - Drug-coated balloons (DCBs), serving as a superior alternative to stents, are at the cutting edge of clinical innovations in atherosclerosis management. Nevertheless, the prevalent high flow rates in arterial vascular result in short drug residence times, significantly compromising DCBs' therapeutic effectiveness. Drawing inspiration from the mechanisms of vascular calcification, a rapamycin-loaded calcium phosphate nanoparticle (CaP@Rapa) coating for balloons is pioneered. This coating functions as a potent drug anchor in arteries, facilitating the adhesion of rapamycin to plaques and thereby enhancing the local concentration of the rapamycin. To evaluate its therapeutic efficacy in vivo, the rabbit iliac artery atherosclerosis model is innovatively developed, which authentically mirrors the pathological progression of atherosclerosis in humans. The enhanced localized rapamycin retention, along with its pH-sensitive sustained release characteristics, culminate in substantial reductions in plaque volume, a decrease in intimal hyperplasia, and mitigation of local inflammation in model rabbits. To further substantiate the translational potential of CaP@Rapa balloons, the research on the pig coronary atherosclerosis model is expanded, which yielded results solidifying the clinical promise of CaP@Rapa balloons. In summary, this research not only offers a more effective and reliable alternative to traditional DCB but also paves the way for further clinical trials.
   This paper introduces a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing rapamycin-loaded calcium phosphate (CaP@Rapa) coated balloons for atherosclerosis treatment. The CaP@Rapa coating acts as a potent drug anchor, enhancing the targeted delivery of drug to arterial plaques. Using rabbit and porcine models, it confirms the coating's safety and efficacy, suggesting its potential as an advanced cardiovascular intervention. image

AB  - Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is one of the brominated flame retardants (BFRs) widely used in industry, which has a broad toxic effect on organisms. However, there is still limited research on the neurotoxic mechanism of TBBPA. Using mouse hippocampal neurons (HT22) cells, the toxicity of TBBPA was evaluated, especially focusing on its alteration on the key molecules in FAM171A2-GRN-NF-kappa B signaling pathway. The results showed that TBBPA exposure could lead to an increase in the production of inflammation-related genes IL-6, iNOS, TGF beta 1, COX2, and TNF-alpha in both HT22 cells and HT22-AD-model, intensifying the inflammatory response; it inhibits the mRNA expression of antioxidative enzymes genes Sod1, Cat, Gpx1, and Gsta1, resulting in reduced antioxidant enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px/GPX. Mechanistically, TBBPA caused the upregulation of FAM171A2 expression level, alongside increased GRN, I kappa B alpha and p65 levels; whereas the expression of GRN, I kappa B alpha and p65 was decreased after FAM171A2 knockdown, demonstrating TBBPA-induced upregulation of FAM171A2 should be responsible for the increased GRN, I kappa B alpha and p65 expression. Therefore, for the first time, our data indicate that TBBPA-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response is closely related to the FAM171A2GRN-NF-kappa B pathway.

AB  - Recognition memory can rely on three components: "what", "where" and "when". Recently we demonstrated that the anterior retrosplenial cortex (aRSC), like the perirhinal cortex (PRH) and unlike the hippocampus (HP), is required for consolidation of the "what" component. Here, we aimed at studying which brain structures interact with the aRSC to process object recognition (OR) memory in rats. We studied the interaction of six brain structures that are connected to the aRSC during OR memory processing: PRH, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anteromedial thalamic nuclei (AM), medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsal HP (dHP). We previously described the role of the PRH and dHP, so we first studied the participation of the mPFC, AM, MEC and ACC in OR memory consolidation by bilateral microinfusions of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol. We observed an impairment in OR long-term memory (LTM) when inactivating the mPFC, the AM and the MEC, but not the ACC. Then, we studied the functional connections by unilateral inactivation of the aRSC and each one of the six structures in the same (ipsilateral) or the opposite (contralateral) hemisphere. Our results showed an amnesic LTM effect in rats with ipsilateral inactivations of aRSC-PRH, aRSC-mPFC, aRSC-AM, or aRSC-MEC. On the other hand, we observed memory impairment when aRSC-ACC were inactivated in opposite hemispheres, and no effect when the aRSC-dHP connection was inactivated. Thus, our ipsilateral inactivation findings reveal that the aRSC and, at least one brain region required in OR LTM processing are essential to consolidate OR memory. In conclusion, our results show that several cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic pathways are important for OR memory consolidation.

AB  - Theanine is a core secondary metabolite responsible for the sensory qualities and health benefits of tea. Theanine levels are high in new tea plant (Camellia sinensis) shoots that arise during early spring, but then significantly decrease in late spring, causing a rapid decline in the quality of green tea processed from the late-spring harvest. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this seasonal decrease in theanine levels remain unknown. In a previous genetic screen, we identified the YFR045W yeast mutant that displayed a hypersensitivity to theanine feeding due to enhanced theanine accumulation. YFR045W encodes a putative mitochondrial carrier and was designated Theanine Hypersensitive 1 (THS1). Expression of CsTHS1, the functional homolog of THS1 in tea plants, rescued this yeast mutant phenotype. Importantly, CsTHS1 expression is induced in late-spring new shoots, and CsTHS1 exhibits a high affinity for theanine. Yeast mitochondria expressing CsTHS1 demonstrate increased theanine transport activity, and recombinant CsTHS1 proteo-liposomes can also transport theanine. Additionally, CsTHS1 overexpression or repression in new tea shoots significantly decreased or increased theanine accumulation, respectively. Our findings establish a relationship between CsTHS1-mediated theanine transport into mitochondria and the observed reduction in theanine accumulation in the late-spring new tea shoots. Our study supports a mechanism whereby CsTHS1 mediates theanine entry into mitochondria for degradation by the mitochondria-localized gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (CsGGT2).
   The mitochondrial carrier CsTHS1 mediates theanine transport into mitochondria, promotes its degradation, and negatively regulates theanine accumulation in late-spring new shoots of tea plants.

AB  - Background: Torsade de pointes is a potentially lethal polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia that can occur in the setting of long QT syndrome (LQTS). LQTS is multi-hit in nature and multiple factors combine their effects leading to increased arrhythmic risk. While hypokalemia and multiple medications are accounted for in LQTS, the arrhythmogenic role of systemic inflammation is increasingly recognized but often overlooked. We tested the hypothesis that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin(IL)-6 will significantly increase the incidence of arrhythmia when combined with other pro-arrhythmic conditions (hypokalemia and the psychotropic medication, quetiapine).
   Methods: Guinea pigs were injected intraperitoneally with IL-6/soluble IL-6 receptor and QT changes were measured in vivo. Subsequently, hearts were cannulated via Langendorff perfusion for ex vivo optical mapping measurements of action potential duration (APD(90)) and arrhythmia inducibility. Computer simulations (MATLAB) were performed to investigate I-Kr inhibition at varying IL-6 and quetiapine concentrations.
   Results: IL-6 prolonged QTc in vivo guinea pigs from 306.74 +/- 7.19 ms to 332.60 +/- 8.75 ms (n = 8, p =.0021). Optical mapping on isolated hearts demonstrated APD prolongation in IL-6- vs saline groups (3Hz APD(90):179.67 +/- 2.47 ms vs 153.5 +/- 7.86 ms, p =.0357). When hypokalemia was introduced, the APD(90) increased to 195.8 +/- 5.02 ms[IL-6] and 174.57 +/- 10.7 ms[saline] (p =.2797), and when quetiapine was added to hypokalemia to 207.67 +/- 3.03 ms[IL-6] and 191.37 +/- 9.49 ms[saline] (p =.2449). After the addition of hypokalemia +/- quetiapine, arrhythmia was induced in 75% of IL-6-treated hearts (n = 8), while in none of the control hearts (n = 6). Computer simulations demonstrated spontaneous depolarizations at similar to 83% aggregate I-Kr inhibition.
   Conclusions: Our experimental observations strongly suggest that controlling inflammation, specifically IL-6, could be a viable and important route for reducing QT prolongation and arrhythmia incidence in the clinical setting.

AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is regarded as a significant risk factor for gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. However, the increasing resistance of H. pylori strains has resulted in low eradication rates and ineffective treatments. Herein, we report on identification of a new quipazine derivative-compound <bold>9c</bold> (N-(3-chlorobenzyl)-2-(piperazin-1-yl)quinolin-4-amine), which displayed antibacterial properties (MIC range 2-4 mu g/mL) against H. pylori CagA-positive reference strains associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, including metronidazole-resistant ATCC 43504, clarithromycin-resistant ATCC 700684 and susceptible J99 strain, as well as clinical, multidrug-resistant isolate (3CML, resistant to clarithromycin, metronidazole and levofloxacin). Compound <bold>9c</bold> showed bacteriostatic activity (MBC/MIC ratio > 4), demonstrated antibiofilm-forming properties and prevented auto-aggregation of microbial cells. It also displayed an additive effect in 1/2 MIC (2 mu g/mL) when administered with clarithromycin and/or metronidazole. Compound <bold>9c</bold> had no impact on gut microbiota reference strains of S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis and L. paracasei as well as no hemolytic activity against sheep erythrocytes. Finally, by reducing the viability of the SNU-1 human gastric cancer cell line (IC50 = 3.28 mu g/mL), compound <bold>9c</bold> might offer important implications regarding the oncogenic characteristics of cagA+ H. pylori strains.

AB  - Epidemiological data suggest that moderate hyperoxemia may be associated with an improved outcome after traumatic brain injury. In a prospective, randomized investigation of long-term, resuscitated acute subdural hematoma plus hemorrhagic shock (ASDH + HS) in 14 adult, human-sized pigs, targeted hyperoxemia (200 < PaO2 < 250 mmHg vs. normoxemia 80 < PaO2 < 120 mmHg) coincided with improved neurological function. Since brain perfusion, oxygenation and metabolism did not differ, this post hoc study analyzed the available material for the effects of targeted hyperoxemia on cerebral tissue markers of oxidative/nitrosative stress (nitrotyrosine expression), blood-brain barrier integrity (extravascular albumin accumulation) and fluid homeostasis (oxytocin, its receptor and the H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine-beta-synthase and cystathionine-gamma-lyase). After 2 h of ASDH + HS (0.1 mL/kgBW autologous blood injected into the subdural space and passive removal of 30% of the blood volume), animals were resuscitated for up to 53 h by re-transfusion of shed blood, noradrenaline infusion to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure at baseline levels and hyper-/normoxemia during the first 24 h. Immediate postmortem, bi-hemispheric (i.e., blood-injected and contra-lateral) prefrontal cortex specimens from the base of the sulci underwent immunohistochemistry (% positive tissue staining) analysis of oxidative/nitrosative stress, blood-brain barrier integrity and fluid homeostasis. None of these tissue markers explained any differences in hyperoxemia-related neurological function. Likewise, hyperoxemia exerted no deleterious effects.

AB  - Cardiotonic steroids (CTSs) are specific inhibitors of Na,K-ATPase (NKA). They induce diverse physiological effects and were investigated as potential drugs in heart diseases, hypertension, neuroinflammation, antiviral and cancer therapy. Here, we compared the inhibition mode and binding of CTSs, such as ouabain, digoxin and marinobufagenin to NKA from pig and rat kidneys, containing CTSs-sensitive (alpha 1S) and -resistant (alpha 1R) alpha 1-subunit, respectively. Marinobufagenin in contrast to ouabain and digoxin interacted with alpha 1S-NKA reversibly, and its binding constant was reduced due to the decrease in the deepening in the CTSs-binding site and a lower number of contacts between the site and the inhibitor. The formation of a hydrogen bond between Arg111 and Asp122 in alpha 1R-NKA induced the reduction in CTSs' steroid core deepening that led to the reversible inhibition of alpha 1R-NKA by ouabain and digoxin and the absence of marinobufagenin's effect on alpha 1R-NKA activity. Our results elucidate that the difference in signaling, and cytotoxic effects of CTSs may be due to the distinction in the deepening of CTSs into the binding side that, in turn, is a result of a bent-in inhibitor steroid core (marinobufagenin in alpha 1S-NKA) or the change of the width of CTSs-binding cavity (all CTSs in alpha 1R-NKA).

AB  - Cre transgene-based fate mapping in mice reveals that most septal neurons originate from progenitor domains in the septum and identifies Bsx as an embryonic marker and essential regulator of glutamatergic neuron development and locomotion behaviour.
   The septum is a key structure at the core of the forebrain that integrates inputs and relays information to other brain areas to support cognition and behaviours such as feeding and locomotion. Underlying these functions is a rich diversity of neuronal types and an intricate complexity of wiring across and within the septal region. We currently have very little understanding of how septal neuronal diversity emerges during development. Using transgenic mice expressing Cre in different subsets of telencephalic precursors we explored the origins of the three main neuronal types of the septal complex: GABAergic, cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons. We find that septal neurons originate from distinct neuroepithelial domains of the developing septum and are born at different embryonic time points. An exception to this is the GABAergic medial septal Parvalbumin-expressing population which is generated outside the septum from surrounding germinal zones. We identify the transcription factor BSX as being expressed in the developing glutamatergic neuron population. Embryonic elimination of BSX in the septum results in a reduction of septal glutamatergic cell numbers and a consequent deficit in locomotion. Further refinement of septal neuron diversity is needed to understand the multiple roles of septal neurons and their contribution to distinct behaviours.

AB  - NADPH oxidase (NOX) is a primary mediator of superoxides, which promote oxidative stress, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation after diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) intoxication. Although orally administered mitoapocynin (MPO, 10 mg/kg), a mitochondrial-targeted NOX inhibitor, reduced oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines in the periphery, its efficacy in the brain regions of DFP-exposed rats was limited. In this study, we encapsulated MPO in polyanhydride nanoparticles (NPs) based on 1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy) hexane (CPH) and sebacic anhydride (SA) for enhanced drug delivery to the brain and compared with a high oral dose of MPO (30 mg/kg). NOX2 (GP91(phox)) regulation and microglial (IBA1) morphology were analyzed to determine the efficacy of MPO-NP vs. MPO-oral in an 8-day study in the rat DFP model. Compared to the control, DFP-exposed animals exhibited significant upregulation of NOX2 and a reduced length and number of microglial processes, indicative of reactive microglia. Neither MPO treatment attenuated the DFP effect. Neurodegeneration (FJB+NeuN) was significantly greater in DFP-exposed groups regardless of treatment. Interestingly, neuronal loss in DFP+MPO-treated animals was not significantly different from the control. MPO-oral rescued inhibitory neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Notably, MPO-NP and MPO-oral significantly reduced astrogliosis (absolute GFAP counts) and reactive gliosis (C3+GFAP). An analysis of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (K(ir)4.1) in astroglia revealed a significant reduction in the brain regions of the DFP+VEH group, but MPO had no effect. Overall, both NP-encapsulated and orally administered MPO had similar effects. Our findings demonstrate that MPO effectively mitigates DFP-induced reactive astrogliosis in several key brain regions and protects neurons in CA1, which may have long-term beneficial effects on spontaneous seizures and behavioral comorbidities. Long-term telemetry and behavioral studies and a different dosing regimen of MPO are required to understand its therapeutic potential.

AB  - This study investigated the principal leaf protein (rubisco) solubilization and in vitro ruminal enzyme activity in relation to the molecular structure of proanthocyanidins extracted from leaves of Anogeissus pendula and Eugenia jambolana. Six proanthocyanidin fractions were extracted by 50% (v/v) methanol-water followed by 70% (v/v) acetone-water and then distilled water from leaves of A. pendula (AP) and E. jambolana (EJ) to yield EJ-70, EJ-50, EJ-DW, AP-70, AP-50 and AP-DW. Fractions were examined for their molecular structure and their effects on sheep ruminal enzymes and solubilization of rubisco in vitro. All fractions significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the activity of ruminal glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase. The fractions AP-50 and EJ-50 significantly inhibited the activity of the R-cellulase enzyme. Most of the fractions inhibited R-glutamate dehydrogenase activity (p < 0.05) by increasing its concentration, while protease activity decreased by up to 58% with increasing incubation time and concentration. The solubilization of rubisco was observed to be comparatively higher in A. pendula (16.60 +/- 1.97%) and E. jambolana (15.03 +/- 1.06%) than that of wheat straw (8.95 +/- 0.95%) and berseem hay (3.04 +/- 0.08%). A significant (p < 0.05) increase in protein solubilization was observed when wheat straw and berseem hay were supplemented with A. pendula and E. jambolana leaves at different proportions. The efficiency of microbial protein was significantly (p < 0.05) greater with the supplementation of leaves of A. pendula in comparison to E. jambolana. The overall conclusion is that the proanthocyanidins obtained from E. jambolana exhibited greater inhibitory activities on rumen enzymes, whereas A. pendula recorded higher protein solubilization. Thus, PAs from A. pendula and E. jambolana appear to have the potential to manipulate rumen enzyme activities for efficient utilization of protein and fiber in ruminants.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance: Sceletium tortuosum, also known as kanna, or kougoed, has long been an integral part of the traditional medicinal practices of the San and Khoikhoi peoples of Southern Africa. Among the various Sceletium species, S. tortuosum is used for its mood-enhancing properties, attributed to the structurally related mesembrine-type alkaloids found therein. While significant research has focused on mesembrine and mesembrenone, the therapeutic potential of extracts from plants that produce more of the so-called "minor alkaloids", remains unexplored. Aim of the study: To assess the CNS modulatory effects of two chemotypes of S. tortuosum, wild-collected from two different geographic locations in South Africa (Touwsrivier and De Rust), each featuring different alkaloid profiles and with elevated minor alkaloid concentrations. Materials and methods: Extracts from these chemotypes, as well as a vehicle control and a commercial extract, were administered to four groups of mice for 35 days. Mice were then euthanised, and their frontal cortices, striata and hippocampi dissected. Serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations were analysed using LC-MS. Results: Both chemotypes, compared to both control and commercial extract exposure, robustly increased noradrenaline and decreased GABA concentrations in all regions of the mouse brain analysed. Conclusion: This finding may support a mood-enhancing effect of S. tortuosum and indicates its potential to modulate anxiety and stress processing, attention, and alertness. Alkaloid profiling further suggests that the mesembrine alcohols and sceletium A4 may be important contributors in driving these neurochemical changes.

AB  - Efflux of antibacterial compounds is a major mechanism for developing antimicrobial resistance. In the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, QacA, a 14 transmembrane helix containing major facilitator superfamily antiporter, mediates proton-coupled efflux of mono and divalent cationic antibacterial compounds. In this study, we report the cryo-EM structure of QacA, with a single mutation D411N that improves homogeneity and retains efflux activity against divalent cationic compounds like dequalinium and chlorhexidine. The structure of substrate-free QacA, complexed to two single-domain camelid antibodies, was elucidated to a resolution of 3.6 & ANGS;. The structure displays an outward-open conformation with an extracellular helical hairpin loop (EL7) between transmembrane helices 13 and 14, which is conserved in a subset of DHA2 transporters. Removal of the EL7 hairpin loop or disrupting the interface formed between EL7 and EL1 compromises efflux activity. Chimeric constructs of QacA with a helical hairpin and EL1 grafted from other DHA2 members, LfrA and SmvA, restore activity in the EL7 deleted QacA revealing the allosteric and vital role of EL7 hairpin in antibacterial efflux in QacA and related members.

AB  - The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is at the core of numerous psychiatric conditions, including fear and anxiety-related disorders. Whereas an abundance of evidence suggests a crucial role of the mPFC in regulating fear behaviour, the precise role of the mPFC in this process is not yet entirely clear. While studies at the single-cell level have demonstrated the involvement of this area in various aspects of fear processing, such as the encoding of threat-related cues and fear expression, an increasingly prevalent idea in the systems neuroscience field is that populations of neurons are, in fact, the essential unit of computation in many integrative brain regions such as prefrontal areas. What mPFC neuronal populations represent when we face threats? To address this question, we performed electrophysiological single-unit population recordings in the dorsal mPFC while mice faced threat-predicting cues eliciting defensive behaviours, and performed pharmacological and optogenetic inactivations of this area and the amygdala. Our data indicated that the presence of threat-predicting cues induces a stable coding dynamics of internally driven representations in the dorsal mPFC, necessary to drive learned defensive behaviours. Moreover, these neural population representations primary reflect learned associations rather than specific defensive behaviours, and the construct of such representations relies on the functional integrity of the amygdala.

AB  - Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality as well as a high rate of relapse. The molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of the disorder or the relapses are largely unknown. Patients with AN have been shown to have increased oxidative stress, but its involvement in the development in the disease is unknown. We have previously shown that adolescent female rats undergoing the activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm also show signs of oxidative stress. Due to their role in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondria are of high interest in diseases exhibiting oxidative stress. In this study, the impact of ABA on brain mitochondrial dynamics was examined. We found transient changes in the medial prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus following 25% weight loss and changes in the amygdala at a 10-day weight recovery timepoint. These changes point towards damage in the mitochondria contributing to the oxidative stress.

AB  - Alzheimers disease is a growing general health concern with huge implications for individuals and society. Beta boswellic acid, a major compound of the Boswellia serrata plant, has long been used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. The exact mechanism of beta boswellic acid action in Alzheimers disease pathogenesis remains unclear. In the current study, the protective effect of beta boswellic acid on streptozotocin-induced sporadic Alzheimers disease was surveyed. Alzheimers disease model was induced using streptozotocin followed by an assessment of the treatment effects of beta boswellic acid in the presence of streptozotocin. The prevention effect of beta boswellic acid on Alzheimers disease induction by streptozotocin was evaluated. Behavioral activities in the treated rats were evaluated. Histological analysis was performed. Phosphorylation of tau protein at residues Ser396 and Ser404 and the expression of reelin protein were determined. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunofluorescence staining was applied in the hippocampus regions. Our findings indicated that beta boswellic acid decreased traveled distance and escape latency in the prevention (beta boswellic acid + streptozotocin) and treatment (streptozotocin + beta boswellic acid) groups compared to control during the acquisition test. It increased "time spent" (%) in the target quadrant. Reelin level was enhanced in rats treated with beta boswellic acid. Tau hyperphosphorylation (p-tau404) and glial fibrillary acidic protein were decreased in the prevention group while the expression of reelin protein in both groups was increased. We could suggest that the anti-inflammatory property of beta boswellic acid is one of the main factors involving in the improvement of learning and memory in rats. Therefore the antineurodegenerative effect of beta boswellic acid may be due to its ability to reactivate reelin protein.

AB  - Uncontrolled bleeding and wound infections following severe trauma pose significant challenges for existing tissue adhesives, primarily due to their weak wet adhesion, slow adhesion formation, cytotoxicity concerns, and lack of antibacterial properties. Herein, an injectable hydrogel (denoted as ES gel) with rapid, robust adhesive sealing and inherent antibacterial activity based on epsilon-polylysine and a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative is developed. The engineered hydrogel exhibits rapid gelation behavior, high mechanical strength, strong adhesion to various tissues, and can sustain an ultrahigh burst pressure of 450 mmHg. It also presents excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, antibacterial properties, and on-demand removability. Significantly improved hemostatic efficacy of ES gel compared to fibrin glue is demonstrated using various injury models in rats and rabbits. Remarkably, the adhesive hydrogel can effectively halt lethal non-compressible hemorrhages in visceral organs (liver, spleen, and heart) and femoral artery injury models in fully anticoagulated pigs. Furthermore, the hydrogel outperforms commercial products in sutureless wound closure and repair in the rat liver defect, skin incision, and infected full-thickness skin wound models. Overall, this study highlights the promising clinical applications of ES gel for managing uncontrolled hemorrhage, sutureless wound closure, and infected wound repair.
   An injectable hydrogel with excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, inherent antibacterial activity, and on-demand removability is developed using epsilon-polylysine and tetra-armed poly(ethylene glycol) succinimidyl succinate. The optimized hydrogel gelatinizes rapidly, sustains ultrahigh burst pressure, and effectively stops lethal hemorrhage in anticoagulated large animals. Furthermore, it facilitates sutureless repair of liver defects, skin incisions, and infected full-thickness skin wounds in rat models. image

AB  - Decades of psychosis research highlight the prevalence and the clinical significance of negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety. Translational evidence demonstrates the pivotal role of the amygdala in fear and anxiety. However, most of these approaches have used hypothesis-driven analyses with predefined regions of interest. A data-driven analysis may provide a complimentary, unbiased approach to identifying brain correlates of fear and anxiety. The aim of the current study was to identify the brain basis of fear and anxiety in early psychosis and controls using a data-driven approach. We analyzed data from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis, a multi-site study of 125 people with psychosis and 58 controls with resting-state fMRI and clinical characterization. Multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data was used to identify shared and psychosis-specific brain correlates of fear and anxiety using the NIH Toolbox Fear-Affect and Fear-Somatic Arousal scales. We then examined clinical correlations of Fear-Affect scores and connectivity patterns. Individuals with psychosis had higher levels of Fear-Affect scores than controls (p < 0.05). The data-driven analysis identified a cluster encompassing the amygdala and hippocampus where connectivity was correlated with Fear-Affect score (p < 0.005) in the entire sample. The strongest correlate of Fear-Affect was between this cluster and the anterior insula and stronger connectivity was associated with higher Fear-Affect scores (r = 0.31, p = 0.0003). The multivariate pattern analysis also identified a psychosis-specific correlate of Fear-Affect score between the amygdala/hippocampus cluster and a cluster in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Higher Fear-Affect scores were correlated with stronger amygdala/hippocampal-VMPFC connectivity in the early psychosis group (r = 0.33, p = 0.002), but not in controls (r = -0.15, p = 0.28). The current study provides evidence for the transdiagnostic role of the amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior insula in the neural basis of fear and anxiety and suggests a psychosis-specific relationship between fear and anxiety symptoms and amygdala/hippocampal-VMPFC connectivity. Our novel data-driven approach identifies novel, psychosis-specific treatment targets for fear and anxiety symptoms and provides complimentary evidence to decades of hypothesis-driven approaches examining the brain basis of threat processing.

AB  - Anxiety occurs in the early stage of cognitive disorders, which can exacerbate cognitive impairment. However, the pathogenesis of this kind of anxiety remains unclear. In this study, we investigated anxiety-like behaviors in young adult presenilin 1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a model of progressive cognitive impairment, using behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings. Disrupted excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance was observed in pyramidal neurons (PNs) of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) CA1 (vCA1) region of PS cDKO mice. Meanwhile, PV + interneurons showed hypoexcitability, associated with increased outward K+ currents due to elevated Kv1.1 potassium channel levels. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Kv1.1 restored PV + interneuron activity and reduced anxiety-like behaviors. These findings highlight a role of Kv1.1 in controlling PV + interneuron excitability, suggesting that targeting Kv1.1 in vCA1 PV + interneurons could mitigate anxiety in early-stage cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - BackgroundBehavior consists of the interaction between an organism and its environment, and is controlled by the brain. Brain activity varies at sub-second time scales, but behavioral measures are usually coarse (often consisting of only binary trial outcomes).ResultsTo overcome this mismatch, we developed the Rat Interactive Foraging Facility (RIFF): a programmable interactive arena for freely moving rats with multiple feeding areas, multiple sound sources, high-resolution behavioral tracking, and simultaneous electrophysiological recordings. The paper provides detailed information about the construction of the RIFF and the software used to control it. To illustrate the flexibility of the RIFF, we describe two complex tasks implemented in the RIFF, a foraging task and a sound localization task. Rats quickly learned to obtain rewards in both tasks. Neurons in the auditory cortex as well as neurons in the auditory field in the posterior insula had sound-driven activity during behavior. Remarkably, neurons in both structures also showed sensitivity to non-auditory parameters such as location in the arena and head-to-body angle.ConclusionsThe RIFF provides insights into the cognitive capabilities and learning mechanisms of rats and opens the way to a better understanding of how brains control behavior. The ability to do so depends crucially on the combination of wireless electrophysiology and detailed behavioral documentation available in the RIFF.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a key role in plant communication with other organisms in the natural environment. However, the regulatory role of the phytohormone ethylene in volatile production in plants remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that the application of an ethylene precursor and amplification of ethylene signaling make rice plants more attractive to brown planthopper (BPH) females for feeding and oviposition. A combination of transcriptome and VOCs analyses indicated that overexpression of OsEIL1, a master transcription factor in the ethylene pathway, influences the transcript levels of several terpene synthase genes as well as the production of volatile terpenes. Further investigation revealed that the expression of the limonene synthase gene, OsTPS19, was down-regulated in OsEIL1-overexpressing rice plants, leading to a decrease in limonene production and release. Genetic analysis confirmed the essential role of limonene in the OsEIL1-mediated attractiveness of rice plants to BPH. Our findings provide new perspectives for understanding the role of ethylene signaling in volatile-mediated plant-insect interactions.

AB  - The study was conducted to explore the relationship between arabinoxylan (AX) structure and microbial fermentation characteristics, and reveal molecular mechanism of AX on regulating immune function of the host. Results indicated that the group of wheat bran AX showed greater activity of feruloyl esterase, production of short chain fatty acids and ferulic acid compared with the blank group (P < 0.05). The AX increased sIgA concentration and protein expression of protein expression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B (p65), but decreased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the ileum of weaned pig model, leading to the reduced diarrhea (P < 0.05). The AX increased an abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, production of butyric acid and ferulic acid in the ileal digesta of pigs (P < 0.05). In a LPS-treated mouse model, butyric acid and ferulic acid combination increased IL-10 concentration and abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, but reduced mRNA expression of IL-6 and gene expression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B (p65) in the jejunum. In summary, AX is fermented by gut microbiota to produce ferulic acid, as well as butyric acid, which improved host immunity by promoting relative abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and suppressing activation of TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling.

AB  - Simple Summary Sprouted barley has recently been used in animal feed, but studies on its nutritional and digestibility values for growing lambs are very limited, especially when compared with traditional forages. However, the aim of the current research is to determine the practical level and nutritional properties of sprouted barley as a replacement for the traditional feed for growing lambs by ascertaining its efficacy of performance, nutritional value, digestibility, and fermentation characteristics in vivo and in vitro. The current research helps both workers and researchers to determine the level and the most effective way to utilize sprouted barley as an alternative strategy to traditional feeding systems. In conclusion, sprouted barley with traditional feed improves digestibility and fermentation characteristics. Further studies are needed to increase nutrient requirements for optimal lamb growth performance. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of freshly sprouted barley on the growth of lambs, in addition to its nutritional value and digestibility. In addition, sprouted barley digestibility and rumen fermentation were studied in vitro on a dry matter (DM) basis. A total of 45 three-month-old Awassi lambs were randomly assigned to five treatments of sprouted barley (0, 25, 50, 75, 100%) diets. Bodyweight, weight gain, feed intake and feed efficiency were recorded every two weeks. Nutrient analyses were performed on feed, faecal, and urine samples. DM and non-fibrous carbohydrates were measured. Digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF), as well as gas production, pH value, ammonia-N, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), were determined in vitro using continuous culture. The results showed that final bodyweight was lower (p < 0.05), while feed intake and the feed-to-gain ratio were increased (p < 0.05) in sprouted barley treatments. Nutrient analysis indicators of sprouted barley treatments (25 to100%) were lower (p < 0.05) for DM, crude protein, acid detergent fiber, lignin and ash, and higher for total digestible nutrients, NDF, fat, phosphorus, zinc, copper, and net energy than the traditional diet. In the in vivo study, the digestibility of nutrients in sprouted barley treatments was improved (p < 0.05), while the diet (sprouted barley 100%) had the lowest digestibility of DM, OM, and NDF compared with the other treatments in the in vitro study. In conclusion, the addition of sprouted barley improved digestibility, and fermentation characteristics, while having a negative effect on growth. Further studies are recommended for optimal growth performance.

AB  - Due to a lack of evidence-based standards for cage-change intervals for antelope ground squirrels (AGS, Ammospermophilus leucurus ), we evaluated cage ammonia accumulation in our colony of adult, wild-caught AGS and identified factors that influenced ammonia levels. Intracage ammonia was measured daily in singly housed AGS in static caging that contained a running wheel and 1/2, 3/4, 1, or 2 quart (qt) of corncob bedding. Cages were changed when ammonia levels reached greater than 50 ppm, our upper acceptable limit for ammonia based on mouse studies of ammonia aversion and toxicity. We also measured average daily water consumption over 2 wk to examine any correlation between water use and ammonia accumulation. We hypothesized that the desert-dwelling AGS would not reach intracage ammonia levels of greater than 50 ppm in a 2-wk interval at any bedding volume. Our data showed that intracage ammonia was highly variable among individuals and was significantly associated with water consumption and bedding volumes. Seventeen percent of AGS on 1/2 qt of bedding and 18% on 3/4 qt of bedding reached greater than 50 ppm ammonia before 7 d. All AGS on 1 and 2 qt of bedding remained below 50 ppm ammonia for 1 wk. Even when maintained on 2 qt of bedding, not all AGS remained below 50 ppm ammonia for 2 wk. Therefore, we concluded that the most appropriate option was weekly cage change for singly housed AGS on 1 qt of bedding in static caging.

AB  - Background Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevalent primary bone malignancy affecting adolescents, yet the emergence of chemoradiotherapeutic resistance has limited efforts to cure affected patients to date. Pyropheophorbide-alpha methyl ester-mediated photodynamic therapy (MPPa-PDT) is a recently developed, minimally invasive treatment for OS that is similarly constrained by such therapeutic resistance. This study sought to explore the mechanistic basis for RhoA-activated YAP1 (YAP)-mediated resistance in OS. Methods The relationship between YAP expression levels and patient prognosis was analyzed, and YAP levels in OS cell lines were quantified. Immunofluorescent staining was used to assess YAP nuclear translocation. OS cell lines (HOS and MG63) in which RhoA and YAP were knocked down or overexpressed were generated using lentiviral vectors. CCK-8 assays were used to examine OS cell viability, while the apoptotic death of these cells was monitored via Hoechst staining, Western blotting, and flow cytometry. Tumor-bearing nude mice were additionally used to assess the relationship between lentivirus-mediated alterations in RhoA expression and MPPa-PDT treatment outcomes. TUNEL and immunohistochemical staining approaches were leveraged to assess apoptotic cell death in tissue samples. Results OS patients exhibited higher levels of YAP expression, and these were correlated with a poor prognosis. MPPa-PDT induced apoptosis in OS cells, and such MPPa-PDT-induced apoptosis was enhanced following YAP knockdown whereas it was suppressed by YAP overexpression. RhoA and YAP expression levels were positively correlated in OS patients, and both active and total RhoA protein levels rose in OS cells following MPPa-PDT treatment. When RhoA was knocked down, levels of unphosphorylated YAP and downstream target genes were significantly reduced, while RhoA/ROCK2/LIMK2 pathway phosphorylation was suppressed, whereas RhoA overexpression resulted in the opposite phenotype. MPPa-PDT treatment was linked to an increase in HMGCR protein levels, and the inhibition of RhoA or HMGCR was sufficient to suppress RhoA activity and to decrease the protein levels of YAP and its downstream targets. Mevalonate administration partially reversed these reductions in the expression of YAP and YAP target genes. RhoA knockdown significantly enhanced the apoptotic death of OS cells in vitro and in vivo following MPPa-PDT treatment, whereas RhoA overexpression had the opposite effect. Conclusions These results suggest that the mevalonate pathway activates RhoA, which in turn activates YAP and promotes OS cell resistance to MPPa-PDT therapy. Targeting the RhoA/ROCK2/LIMK2/YAP pathway can significantly improve the efficacy of MPPa-PDT treatment for OS.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) has been widely restricted, leading to a significant increase in the production of bisphenol AF (BPAF), one of the most common bisphenol analogs use as a substitute for BPA. However, there is limit evidence on the neurotoxicity of BPAF, especially the potential effects of maternal exposed to BPAF on offspring. A maternal BPAF exposure model was used to evaluate its effects on long-term neurobehaviors in offspring. We found that maternal BPAF exposure resulted in immune disorders, characterized by abnormal CD4+T cell subsets, and their offspring exhibited anxiety-and depression-like behaviors, as well as impairments in learning-memory, sociability and social novelty. Further, brain bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and hippocampus single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of offspring showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in pathways related to synaptic and neurodevelopment. Synaptic ultra-structure of offspring was damaged after maternal BPAF exposure. In conclusion, maternal BPAF exposure induced behavior abnormality in adult offspring, together with synaptic and neurodevelopment defects, which might be related to maternal immune dysfunction. Our results provide a comprehensive insight into the neurotoxicity mechanism of maternal BPAF exposure during gestation. Given the increasing and ubiquitous exposure to BPAF, especially during sensitive periods of growth and development, the safety of BPAF requires urgent attention.

AB  - Major affective disorders are highly prevalent, however, current treatments are limited in their effectiveness due to a lack of understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent studies have shown that reduced activity of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a downstream target of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), is linked to anxiety-like behavior in both humans and rodents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between S6K1 and anxiety-like behavior following chronic mild stress (CMS) and drug-induced inhibition of S6K1. Following CMS, anxiety-like behavior was evaluated using an open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) in adult male C57/Bl6 mice. After behavior analysis, samples of the hippocampus were harvested for quantification of S6K1, S6 ribosomal protein, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta), and beta tubulin via western blot. Our results demonstrate that CMS mice exhibit anxiety-like behavior in the OF and EPM and reduced activity of S6K1 in the hippocampus (HPC). We measured phosphorylation levels of GSK3 beta and found that GSK3 beta phosphorylation was also reduced following CMS compared to control mice. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of S6K1 with PF-4708671 in male mice was sufficient to produce anxiety-like behavior in the OF and EPM. These results further support the significant role of S6K1 in the pathogenesis of anxiety and affective disorders.

AB  - Interaction of oscillatory rhythms at different frequencies is considered to provide a neuronal mechanism for information processing and transmission. These interactions have been suggested to have a vital role in cognitive functions such as working memory and decision-making. Here, we investigated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is known to have a critical role in successful execution of spatial working memory tasks. We recorded local field potential oscillations from mPFC while rats performed a delayed-non-match-to-place (DNMTP) task. In the DNMTP task, the rat needed to decide actively about the pathway based on the infor-mation remembered in the first phase of each trial. Our analysis revealed a dynamic phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and high frequency oscillations (HFOs). This dynamic coupling emerged near the turning point and diminished afterward. Further, theta activity during the delay period, which is thought of as the maintenance phase, in the absence of the coupling, can predict task completion time. We previously reported diminished rat performance in the DNMTP task in response to electromagnetic radiation. Here, we report an increase in the theta rhythm during delay activity besides diminishing the coupling after electromagnetic ra-diation. These findings suggest that the different roles of the mPFC in working memory could be supported by separate mechanisms: Theta activity during the delay period for information maintenance and theta-HFOs phase -amplitude coupling relating to the decision-making procedure.

AB  - Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is an environmental mycotoxin produced mainly by fungi of the genus Fusarium. Exposure to FB1 can lead to pulmonary edema in pigs, likely caused by damage to vascular endothelial cells, but the mechanism of FB1-induced damage was unknown. Here, we found that FB1 damages vascular endothelial cells through ferroptosis, marked by iron-dependent membrane lipid peroxidation, and through mitophagy, a selective autophagy that targets mitochondria. FB1 exposure reduced barrier-related gene expression and increased proinflammatory factors. Ferroptosis was evidenced by elevated iron, ROS, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptotic markers (TFR, ACSL4), alongside decreased GSH, SLC7A11, and GPX-4 levels in vascular endothelial cells. Importantly, the ferroptosis inhibitor, Ferrostatin-1, reversed the vascular endothelial cells' barrier damage, inflammation, and ferroptosis caused by FB1. FB1-induced mitophagy was demonstrated by detecting decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased levels of mitophagy-related proteins. Surprisingly, silencing PINK1 using siRNA not only diminished mitophagy, cellular damage, and inflammatory responses induced by FB1, but also mitigated FB1-induced ferroptosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FB1 causes vascular endothelial cell damage by ferroptosis in a mitophagy-dependent manner. This study thus lays a mechanistic foundation for the study of FB1 causing pulmonary edema in pigs and for exploring options for therapeutic intervention in conditions caused by this mycotoxin, which causes substantial harm to both human and animal health.

AB  - Background Metastatic colonization is one of the critical steps in tumor metastasis. A pre-metastatic niche is required for metastatic colonization and is determined by tumor-stroma interactions, yet the mechanistic underpinnings remain incompletely understood.Methods PCR-based miRNome profiling, qPCR, immunofluorescent analyses evaluated the expression of exosomal miR-141 and cell-to-cell communication. LC-MS/MS proteomic profiling and Dual-Luciferase analyses identified YAP1 as the direct target of miR-141. Human cytokine profiling, ChIP, luciferase reporter assays, and subcellular fractionation analyses confirmed YAP1 in modulating GRO alpha production. A series of in vitro tumorigenic assays, an ex vivo model and Yap1 stromal conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model demonstrated the roles of miR-141/YAP1/GRO alpha/CXCR1/2 signaling cascade. RNAi, CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPRi systems were used for gene silencing. Blood sera, OvCa tumor tissue samples, and tissue array were included for clinical correlations.Results Hsa-miR-141-3p (miR-141), an exosomal miRNA, is highly secreted by ovarian cancer cells and reprograms stromal fibroblasts into proinflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), facilitating metastatic colonization. A mechanistic study showed that miR-141 targeted YAP1, a critical effector of the Hippo pathway, reducing the nuclear YAP1/TAZ ratio and enhancing GRO alpha production from stromal fibroblasts. Stromal-specific knockout (cKO) of Yap1 in murine models shaped the GRO alpha-enriched microenvironment, facilitating in vivo tumor colonization, but this effect was reversed after Cxcr1/2 depletion in OvCa cells. The YAP1/GRO alpha correlation was demonstrated in clinical samples, highlighting the clinical relevance of this research and providing a potential therapeutic intervention for impeding premetastatic niche formation and metastatic progression of ovarian cancers.Conclusions This study uncovers miR-141 as an OvCa-derived exosomal microRNA mediating the tumor-stroma interactions and the formation of tumor-promoting stromal niche through activating YAP1/GRO alpha/CXCRs signaling cascade, providing new insight into therapy for OvCa patients with peritoneal metastases.

AB  - Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide that modulates social-related behavior and cognition in the central nervous system of mammals. In the CA1 area of the hippocampus, the indirect effects of the OT on the pyramidal neurons and their role in information processing have been elucidated. However, limited data are available concerning the direct modulation exerted by OT on the CA1 interneurons (INs) expressing the oxytocin receptor (OTR). Here, we demonstrated that TGOT (Thr4,Gly7-oxytocin), a selective OTR agonist, affects not only the membrane potential and the firing frequency but also the neuronal excitability and the shape of the action potentials (APs) of these INs in mice. Furthermore, we constructed linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to unravel the dependencies between the AP parameters and the firing frequency, also considering how TGOT can interact with them to strengthen or weaken these influences. Our analyses indicate that OT regulates the functionality of the CA1 GABAergic INs through different and independent mechanisms. Specifically, the increase in neuronal firing rate can be attributed to the depolarizing effect on the membrane potential and the related enhancement in cellular excitability by the peptide. In contrast, the significant changes in the AP shape are directly linked to oxytocinergic modulation. Importantly, these alterations in AP shape are not associated with the TGOT-induced increase in neuronal firing rate, being themselves critical for signal processing.

AB  - Background: The increasing prevalence of acute noise exposure poses a significant threat to mental health. Identifying the intensity of noise that impair health is crucial for developing effective interventions. The study aimed to determine the acute noise intensity thresholds that elicit anxiety-like behaviors and brain damage in female rats, and then to elucidate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Methods: Female rats were subjected to acute noise exposure at levels of 105, 115, 125, and 135 dB to determine the intensity thresholds that elicit anxiety-like behaviors and brain damage were assessed at the 3th day and 1 month post-exposure. Results: We found that acute noise exposure at 135 dB induced significant anxiety-like behaviors and hippocampal neuron apoptosis on the third day, with these effects persisting up to one month after exposure. KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed alterations in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, as confirmed by Western blot analysis. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that acute noise exposure at 135 dB elicits anxiety-like behaviors in female rats on the third day post-exposure, with these effects persisting up to one month. This sustained anxiety is attributed to the inhibition of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and the subsequent activation of the apoptotic Caspase-3/ BCL-2/BAX pathway, culminating in hippocampal neuron apoptosis.

AB  - Overweight and obesity have become international public health problems, so there is an urgent need to implement effective interventions that prevent these concerning health issues. Designing personalized (tailored) dietary communications has become one of the most effective tools in reducing unhealthy eating behavior, when compared with one-size-fits-all messages (untailored). However, more research is required to gain a complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which tailored nutritional messages elicit reductions in unhealthy dietary behavior. To the best of our knowledge, our study may be the first to use neuroimaging, namely functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), aiming to evaluate the neural basis of tailored and untailored nutritional messages and assess how these neural responses predict unhealthy food intake reduction after a month receiving tailored nutritional messages. To that goal, 30 participants were scanned while reading tailored and untailored nutritional messages. Subsequently, for a month, they received tailored interventions encouraging healthy food intake. The neural findings reveal that when compared to untailored communications, tailored messages elicit brain networks associated with self-relevance, such as the precuneus, the middle temporal gyrus, the hippocampus, the inferior orbitofrontal cortex (OBC), the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC), and the angular gyrus. Interestingly, among these self-related brain areas, the dMPFC, OFC, angular gyrus, and hippo campus forecast reductions in unhealthy food intake after a one-month tailored intervention for the cessation of unhealthy eating. These results may offer implications for clinicians, practitioners, and/or policymakers who should implement substantial efforts in creating individualized campaigns focused on their target's perceived needs, goals, and drivers in relation to eating healthy to reduce overweight issues. This research therefore constitutes a step forward in showing a direct association between the neural responses to tailored nutritional messages and changes in real-life healthy eating behavior.

AB  - Alpha2-adrenoreceptor (alpha(2)-AR) is a noradrenergic receptor that is frequently studied for modulation of seizure activity. However, the precise role of this receptor agonists in regulating seizure activity is still unclear. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of alpha(2)-AR agonist dexmedetomidine (DEX) and atipamezole (alpha(2)-AR antagonist, ATI) on seziures in rats. In the study, 32 adult male Wistar Albino rats (weighing 220-260 g) were used. To induce seizures in rats, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 35 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) and seizure stages were determined according to the Racine scale. After induction of seizures, DEX (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and ATI (1 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered to rats and their effects determined on seizures. GABA levels of the brain hippocampal tissue sample were measured using an ELISA kit and c-Fos positive cells of the dentate gyrus and hippocampal regions were quantitatively analyzed with Image J software. The results showed that DEX decreased the seizure stages according to the Racine scale, significantly prolonged the onset time of first myoclonic jerk (FMJ) and reduced the number of spikes and percentage seizure duration (p < 0.05). In contrast, ATI increased the seizure stage, the number of spikes and percentage seizure duration. The hippocampal GABA level was significantly decreased in rats with only PTZ injection (p < 0.05). In addition, DEX reduced the number of c-Fos positive cells in dentate gyrus and the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. In conclusion, our findings showed that alpha 2-AR agonist DEX had a reducing activity on PTZ-induced seizure, while alpha 2-AR antagonist ATI facilitated seizure formation.

AB  - Telomere length (TL) is an important cellular marker of biological aging impacting the brain and heart. However, how it is related to the brain (e.g., cognitive function and neuroanatomic architecture), and how these relationships may vary by sex and reproductive status, is not well established. Here we assessed the association between leukocyte TL and memory circuitry regional brain volumes and memory performance in early midlife, in relation to sex and reproductive status. Participants (N = 198; 95 females, 103 males; ages 45-55) underwent structural MRI and neuropsychological assessments of verbal, associative, and working memory. Overall, shorter TL was associated with smaller white matter volume in the parahippocampal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In males, shorter TL was associated with worse working memory performance and corresponding smaller white matter volumes in the parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In females, the impact of cellular aging was revealed over the menopausal transition. In postmenopausal females, shorter TL was associated with poor associative memory performance and smaller grey matter volume in the right hippocampus. In contrast, TL was not related to memory performance or grey and white matter volumes in any memory circuitry region in pre/perimenopausal females. Results demonstrated that shorter TL is associated with worse memory function and smaller volume in memory circuitry regions in early midlife, an association that differs by sex and reproductive status. Taken together, TL may serve as an early indicator of sexdependent brain abnormalities in early midlife.

AB  - The genetic etiology and underlying mechanism of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain elusive. SHANK family genes (SHANK1/2/3) are well known ASD-related genes. However, little is known about how SHANK missense mutations contribute to ASD. Here, we aimed to clarify the molecular mechanism of and the multilevel neuropathological features induced by Shank1 mutations in knock-in (KI) mice. In this study, by sequencing the SHANK1 gene in a cohort of 615 ASD patients and 503 controls, we identified an ASD-specific recurrent missense mutation, c.2621 G > A (p.R874H). This mutation demonstrated strong pathogenic potential in in vitro experiments, and we generated the corresponding Shank1 R882H-KI mice. Shank1 R882H-KI mice displayed core symptoms of ASD, namely, social disability and repetitive behaviors, without confounding comorbidities of abnormal motor function and heightened anxiety. Brain structural changes in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex were observed in Shank1 R882H-KI mice via structural magnetic resonance imaging. These key brain regions also showed severe and consistent downregulation of mGluR1-IP3R1-calcium signaling, which subsequently affected the release of intracellular calcium. Corresponding cellular structural and functional changes were present in Shank1 R882H-KI mice, including decreased spine size, reduced spine density, abnormal morphology of postsynaptic densities, and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and basal excitatory transmission. These findings demonstrate the causative role of SHANK1 in ASD and elucidate the underlying biological mechanism of core symptoms of ASD. We also provide a reliable model of ASD with core symptoms for future studies, such as biomarker identification and therapeutic intervention studies.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to memory loss and is often accompanied by increased anxiety. Although AD is a heterogeneous disease, dysregulation of inflammatory pathways is a consistent event. Interestingly, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is the source of the amyloid peptide A beta, is also necessary for the efficient regulation of the innate immune response. Here, we hypothesize that loss of APP function in mice would lead to cognitive loss and anxiety behavior, both of which are typically present in AD, as well as changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators. To test this hypothesis, we performed open field, Y-maze and novel object recognition tests on 12-18-week-old male and female wildtype and App(KO) mice to measure thigmotaxis, short-term spatial memory and long-term recognition memory. We then performed a quantitative multiplexed immunoassay to measure levels of 32 cytokines/chemokines associated with AD and anxiety. Our results showed that App(KO) mice, compared to wildtype controls, experienced increased thigmotactic behavior but no memory impairments, and this phenotype correlated with increased IP-10 and IL-13 levels. Future studies will determine whether dysregulation of these inflammatory mediators contributes to pathogenesis in AD.

AB  - Amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus L.) is the most consumed leaf vegetable in Benin. A study carried out in south Benin have shown that the production of this vegetable is severely limited by insect pest pressure. The present study aimed to identify the major constraint limiting amaranth production in Se ' gbana municipality, located in the north of Benin and proposed sustainable agroecological solutions to farmers. Thus, a survey was conducted among 150 farmers in three villages of Se ' gbana (Lougou, Sokotindji and Piami) through well-structured ques-tionnaires to know the major constraint limiting amaranth production. Agroecological methods for managing pests of this vegetable were offered to farmers through an experimental trial consisting of a Fisher block with four treatments and five replications conducted in Sokoundji village. The control treatment (To) consisted of amaranth in pure culture; the treatment (T1), amaranth plants surrounded by basil plants; (T2) rows of amaranth alternated with basil rows and (T3), amaranth plants alternated with basil plants in all directions. Every 5 days, 5 plants were randomly selected per treatment and the numbers of S. recurvalis and P. basalis were counted. Pest damage and yield per treatment were also assessed. Almost all farmers surveyed (100%) reported pest attacks as the major constraint limiting amaranth production. The results obtained on the abundance and the herbivory rate showed powerful negative effects (Df = 3; P < 0.0001) of the different treatments. Moreover, the treatment T2 (amaranth plants alternated with basil rows) gave the highest yield (1.25 t/ha of fresh leaves) and differed significantly from the other treatments (Df = 3; p = 0.039). The association basil - amaranth reduced the abundance of P. basalis and S. recurvalis and also improved the amaranth productivity with LER = 1.16. The association basil - amaranth is more beneficial than pure cultures because it hosts less of the insect pests studied, provides higher yields and makes rational use of the growing space.

AB  - Although the dentate gyrus (DG) as a component of the hippocampal formation has been well known for its role in memory, various studies showed a diverse population of unique cell types and various inputs and outputs in this region. Besides, brain dopamine is known for its roles in reward, motivation, pleasure, and being involved in the pain process. Further, previous studies demonstrated the participation of DG dopaminergic receptors in antinociception induced by lateral hypothalamus stimulation. This study aimed to investigate the role of DG dopaminergic receptors (D1- and D2-like dopamine receptors) in stress-induced analgesia (SIA) using the formalin test as a persistent inflammatory pain model. One hundred two male Wistar rats were unilaterally implanted with a cannula into the DG. Animals received an intra-DG infusion of SCH23390 (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g/ rat), or Sulpiride (0.25, 1, and 4 mu g/rat) as D1- and D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively, five min before exposure to forced swim stress (FSS). Ten minutes after FSS termination, 2.5% formalin solution as an inflammatory agent was subcutaneously injected into the plantar surface of the hind paw, and the pain score was quantified for one hour. The findings revealed that exposure to FSS produced SIA, though this FSS-induced analgesia was attenuated in the early and late phase of the formalin test by intra-DG microinjection of SCH23390 or Sulpiride. These results suggested that both D1- and D2-like dopamine receptors in the DG have a considerable role in analgesia induced by FSS.

AB  - Large-volume bone defect regeneration is complex and demands time to complete. Several regeneration phases with unique characteristics, including immune responses, follow, overlap, and interdepend on each other and, if successful, lead to the regeneration of the organ bone's form and function. However, during traumatic, infectious, or neoplastic clinical cases, the intrinsic bone regeneration capacity may exceed, and surgical intervention is indicated. Scaffold-guided bone regeneration (SGBR) has recently shown efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies. To investigate different SGBR strategies over periods of up to three years, we have established a well-characterized ovine large segmental tibial bone defect model, for which we have developed and optimized immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocols. We present an overview of the immunohistochemical characterization of different experimental groups, in which all ovine segmental defects were treated with a bone grafting technique combined with an additively manufactured medical-grade polycaprolactone/tricalcium phosphate (mPCL-TCP) scaffold. The qualitative dataset was based on osteoimmunological findings gained from IHC analyses of over 350 sheep surgeries over the past two decades. Our systematic and standardized IHC protocols enabled us to gain further insight into the complex and long-drawn-out bone regeneration processes, which ultimately proved to be a critical element for successful translational research.

TI  - Method for cycle detection in sparse, irregularly sampled, long-term neuro-behavioral timeseries: Basis pursuit denoising with polynomial detrending of long-term, inter-ictal epileptiform activity

AB  - Numerous physiological processes are cyclical, but sampling these processes densely enough to perform frequency decomposition and subsequent analyses can be challenging. Mathematical approaches for decomposition and reconstruction of sparsely and irregularly sampled signals are well established but have been under-utilized in physiological applications. We developed a basis pursuit denoising with polynomial detrending (BPWP) model that recovers oscillations and trends from sparse and irregularly sampled timeseries. We validated this model on a unique dataset of long-term inter-ictal epileptiform discharge (IED) rates from human hippocampus recorded with a novel investigational device with continuous local field potential sensing. IED rates have well established circadian and multiday cycles related to sleep, wakefulness, and seizure clusters. Given sparse and irregular samples of IED rates from multi-month intracranial EEG recordings from ambulatory humans, we used BPWP to compute narrowband spectral power and polynomial trend coefficients and identify IED rate cycles in three subjects. In select cases, we propose that random and irregular sampling may be leveraged for frequency decomposition of physiological signals.Trial Registration: NCT03946618.
   Circadian and multiday cycles are an important part of many long-term neuro-behavioral phenomena such as pathological inter-ictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and seizures in epilepsy. Long-term, ambulatory, neuro-behavioral monitoring in human patients involves complex recording systems that can be subject to intermittent, irregular data loss and storage limitations, resulting in sparse, irregularly sampled data. Cycle identification in sparse data or irregular data using traditional frequency decomposition techniques typically requires interpolation to create a regular timeseries. Using unique, long-term recordings of pathological brain activity in people with epilepsy implanted with an investigational device, we developed a method to identify cycles in sparse, irregular neuro-behavioral data without interpolation. We anticipate this approach will enable retrospective cycle identification in sparse neuro-behavioral timeseries and support prospective sparse sampling in monitoring systems to enable long-term monitoring of patients and to extend storage capacity in a variety of ambulatory monitoring applications.

AB  - Anxiety is exceedingly prevalent among individuals with an autism spectrum condition (ASC). While recent literature postulates anxiety as a mechanism encompassing an underlying amygdala-related elevated baseline level of arousal even to nonthreatening cues, whether this same mechanism contributes to anxiety in those with an ASC and supports the transdiagnostic nature of anxiety remains elusive. In this case-control study of 51 youths (26 ASC), we assessed autism and anxiety via the Autism-Spectrum Quotient and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Hemodynamic responses, including amygdala reactivity, to explicit and implicit (backwardly masked) perception of threatening faces were acquired using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). For explicit fear, ASC individuals showed significantly greater negative correlations between the amygdala and the attentional deployment-parietal network. For implicit fear, ASC individuals showed significantly stronger correlations of the amygdala with the prefrontal networks, temporal pole, and hippocampus. Additionally, an fMRI-based neurologic signature for anxiety in ASCs was identified via the LibSVM machine learning model using amygdala-centered functional connectivity during the emotional processing of explicit and implicit stimuli. Hypervigilance to implicit threat in ASCs comorbid with anxiety might exacerbate explicit threat reactivity; hence the use of attentional avoidance patterns to restrict affective hyperarousal for explicitly perceived socioemotional stimuli. Consequently, developing an attention-independent behavioral/neural marker identifying anxiety in ASCs is highly warranted. Lay Summary This study identifies a dissociation of amygdala reactivity dependent on explicit and implicit threat processing. Implicit anxiety in individuals with an autism spectrum condition (ASC) could outweigh explicitly induced threat. When explicitly perceiving socioemotional stimuli, ASC individuals with anxiety might use attentional avoidance patterns to restrict affective hyperarousal.

AB  - The Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway regulates normal development by controlling contact inhibition of growth. In cancer, YAP1 activation is often dysregulated, leading to excessive tumor growth and metastasis. SRC kinase can cross talk to Hippo signaling by disrupting adherens junctions, repressing the Hippo cascade, or activating YAP1 to promote proliferation. Here, we demonstrate that the IGF2 messenger RNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) impedes the repression of YAP1 by Hippo signaling in carcinomas. IGF2BP1 stabilizes the YAP1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and enhances YAP1 protein synthesis through an m6A-dependent interaction with the 3 ' untranslated region of the YAP1 mRNA, thereby increasing YAP1/TAZ-driven transcription to bypass contact inhibition of tumor cell growth. Inhibiting IGF2BP1-mRNA binding using BTYNB reduces YAP1 levels and transcriptional activity, leading to significant growth inhibition in carcinoma cells and ovarian cancer organoids. In contrast, SRC inhibition with Saracatinib fails to inhibit YAP1/TAZ-driven transcription and cell growth in general. This is particularly significant in de-differentiated, rather mesenchymal carcinoma-derived cells, which exhibit high IGF2BP1 and YAP1 expression, rendering them less reliant on SRC-directed growth stimulation. In such invasive carcinoma models, the combined inhibition of SRC, IGF2BP1, and YAP1/TAZ proved superior over monotherapies. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting IGF2BP1, a key regulator of oncogenic transcription networks.

TI  - Ultra-sensitive triethylamine sensors based on oxygen vacancy-enriched ZnO/SnO2 micro-camellia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
LA  - English
AB  - The detection of volatile organic gas triethylamine (TEA) is of great significance to environment quality and human health. However, it is still a challenge to achieve high-sensitivity detection at low temperatures. In this work, a TEA sensor with a low operating temperature and high response was successfully prepared by designing ZnO/SnO2 composite material rich in oxygen vacancy defects. A camellia-like ZnO material was synthesized by a hydrothermal method using surfactant, bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate sodium salt (AOT) as a soft template. SnO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 20 nm were dispersed on ZnO nanosheets to form a ZnO/SnO2 heterostructure. The sensor based on ZnO/SnO2-10 demonstrates an extremely high response of 780 to 100 ppm TEA. More importantly, the response value of 1 ppm TEA detected is 6 and the detection limit is as low as 0.43 ppm. Besides, the sensor has a low working temperature of 100 degrees C. The enhancement of TEA sensing performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancy (Vo), ZnO-SnO2 heterojunction, and the ZnO (001) exposure plane. Vo can be used as the active center of oxygen molecule adsorption to produce highly active O-2(-) species. Furthermore, Vo-ZnO has higher adsorption energy for TEA molecules than pure ZnO, which was determined using first-principles calculations, confirming the strong interaction between Vo-ZnO and TEA. The sensor shows a broad application prospect in food safety detection and environmental monitoring.

AB  - Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) has been consistently identified in various environmental media and biological specimens. Current understanding of the in vivo toxicities of TDCIPP is limited, especially for potential for neurotoxic and cognitive impairment effects. To better evaluate the potential adverse effect of the chemical on learning and memory, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were administered TDCIPP via gavage at doses of 40, 120, and 360 mg/kg/day for a period of 90 days. Quantitative proteomic analysis, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting were employed to assess alterations in proteins following exposure to TDCIPP. An open field test and the Morris Water Maze were used to assess anxiety and spatial learning memory capacity. Administration of TDCIPP induced anxiety and cognitive impairments in rats. Additionally, a noteworthy decrease in the number of neurons was observed in the hippocampal CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions. Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses revealed dysregulation of numerous hippocampal proteins, particularly those associated with synapses (PKN1) or oxidative stress (GSTM4, NQO1, and BMAL1), which was further confirmed by Western blot analysis. In sum, the cognitive impairment of rats caused by TDCIPP exposure was associated with dysregulation of synaptic and oxidative stress-related proteins.

AB  - Echinococcus granulosus is one of the main causes of economic loss in the livestock industry because of its food-borne transmission. Cutting off the transmission route is a valid prevention method, and vaccines are the most effective means of controlling and eliminating infectious diseases. However, no human-related vaccine has been yet marketed. As a genetic engineering vaccine, recombinant protein P29 of E. granulosus (rEg.P29) could provide protection against deadly challenges. In this study, we generated peptide vaccines (rEg.P29(T), rEg.P29(B), and rEg.P29(T+B)) based on rEg.P29 and an immunized model was established by subcutaneous immunization. Further evaluation showed that peptide vaccine immunization in mice induced T helper type 1 (Th1)-mediated cellular immune responses, leading to high levels of rEg.P29 or rEg.P29(B)-specific antibodies. In addition, rEg.P29(T+B) immunization can induce a higher antibody and cytokine production level than single-epitope vaccines, and immune memory is also longer. Collectively, these results suggest that rEg.P29(T+B) has the potential to be developed as an efficient subunit vaccine for use in areas where E. granulosus is endemic.

AB  - Featured Application Pomace from sea buckthorn fruit constitutes the largest part of the waste that is generated during the production process of sea buckthorn juice and oil. It is an inexpensive but very valuable, functional, and ecological addition to the design of new food products. The management of this type of pomace is justified in order to obtain benefits for potential producers in the bakery and confectionery industries and for consumers looking for another food with pro-health properties. Studies on the use of sea buckthorn pomace in the production of rye bread have shown that the addition of 15-20% of pomace optimally enriches the bread with valuable bioactive and nutritional components, supporting healthy and sustainable consumption. In addition, the use of this pomace as a functional additive to bread reduces the burden on the environment thanks to effective waste management and allows for the maceration of sea buckthorn pulp without the need for enzymes, which supports more ecological production practices.Abstract The aim of the research was to optimize the addition of sea buckthorn pomace to rye bread for sustainable production and consumption. Profit analysis was used to evaluate the optimal impact of added pomace on bread quality. The effects of the management of the by-product (pomace) during the maceration of sea buckthorn fruit pulp were determined on the basis of process efficiency balance. The research materials included five baking variants of bread containing type 720 rye flour, differing in the level of pomace added (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20%). The bread was produced in laboratory conditions on rye sourdough using the three-phase method. The impact of pomace addition on the quality of baked goods was determined by assessing the content of nutritional and energy components, nutritional and building materials, and bioactive compounds. The results show that greater qualitative benefits, including health benefits, were obtained when rye bread was enriched with 15 and 20% pomace. These results have been confirmed by PROFIT analysis. The analysis of the efficiency balance of the sea buckthorn fruit pulp maceration process showed that it is more beneficial to subject these substrates to the processes of drying at 50 degrees C, separation (removal of seeds), and grinding than it is to use enzymatic maceration.

AB  - Aloe vera gel is a valuable raw material used in the cosmetic industry for its skin care properties. The present study analyzed the effects of the fermentation of aloe vera gel with a tea fungus kombucha, which is a symbiotic consortium of bacteria and yeast, carried out for 10 and 20 days (samples F10 and F20, respectively). The resulting ferments and unfermented gel were subjected to chromatographic analysis to determine the content of biologically active compounds. The permeability and accumulation of these compounds in pig skin were evaluated. In addition, the methods of DPPH, ABTS and the determination of intracellular free radical levels in keratinocytes (HaCaT) and fibroblasts (HDF) cell lines were used to determine antioxidant potential. The results showed a higher content of phenolic acids and flavonoids and better antioxidant properties of the ferments, especially after 20 days of fermentation. Cytotoxicity tests against HaCaT and HDF cells confirmed the absence of toxic effects; moreover, samples at the concentrations tested (mainly 10 and 25 mg/mL) showed cytoprotective effects. The analysis of enzymatic activity (collagenase, elastase and hyaluronidase) by the ELISA technique showed higher levels of inhibition for F10 and F20. The kombucha ferments also exhibited better moisturizing properties and lower levels of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), confirming their cosmetic potential.

AB  - The Izpisua-Belmonte group identified a cocktail of metabolites that promote partial reprogramming in cultured muscle cells. We tested the effect of brain injection of these metabolites in the dentate gyrus of aged wild-type mice. The dentate gyrus is a brain region essential for memory function and is extremely vulnerable to aging. A single injection of the cocktail containing four compounds (putrescine, glycine, methionine and threonine) partially reversed brain aging phenotypes and epigenetic alterations in age-associated genes. Our analysis revealed three levels: chromatin methylation, RNA sequencing, and protein expression. Functional studies complemented the previous ones, showing cognitive improvement. In summary, we report the reversal of various age-associated epigenetic changes, such as the transcription factor Zic4, and several changes related to cellular rejuvenation in the dentate gyrus (DG). These changes include increased expression of the Sox2 protein. Finally, the increases in the survival of newly generated neurons and the levels of the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B were accompanied by improvements in both short-term and long-term memory performance. Based on these results, we propose the use of these metabolites to explore new strategies for the development of potential treatments for age-related brain diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary Riding elephants is one of the most controversial activities in the tourist industry, with concerns over whether load carrying is physically harmful. Here, we used an empirical approach to test how carrying loads up to 15% of the elephant's body mass affected gait parameters. The maximal angles of fore- and hindlimb joints of elephants walking at a normal, self-selected speed carrying a mahout only were first evaluated and then compared to those walking with a saddle carrying two people plus added weight to reach a 15% body mass load. Data were analyzed using a computerized three-dimensional inertial measurement system. There were no significant differences between movement angles, including flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of the fore- or hindlimbs between these two riding conditions. Thus, we found no evidence that carrying two people in a saddle causes significant changes in gait patterns or potentially affects musculoskeletal function. More studies are needed to further test longer durations of riding on different types of terrain to develop appropriate working guidelines for captive elephants. Nevertheless, elephants appear capable of carrying significant amounts of weight on the back without showing signs of physical distress. Background: Elephants in Thailand have changed their roles from working in the logging industry to tourism over the past two decades. In 2020, there were approximately 2700 captive elephants participating in activities such as riding and trekking. During work hours, riding elephants carry one or two people in a saddle on the back with a mahout on the neck several hours a day and over varying terrain. A concern is that this form of riding can cause serious injuries to the musculoskeletal system, although to date there have been no empirical studies to determine the influence of weight carriage on kinematics in elephants. Methods: Eight Asian elephants from a camp in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand, aged between 21 and 41 years with a mean body mass of 3265 +/- 140.2 kg, were evaluated under two conditions: walking at a normal speed without a saddle and with a 15% body mass load (saddle and two persons plus additional weights). Gait kinematics, including the maximal angles of fore- and hindlimb joints, were determined using a novel three-dimensional inertial measurement system with wireless sensors. Results: There were no statistical differences between movement angles and a range of motion of the fore- and hindlimbs, when an additional 15% of body mass was added. Conclusion: There is no evidence that carrying a 15% body mass load causes significant changes in elephant gait patterns. Thus, carrying two people in a saddle may have minimal effects on musculoskeletal function. More studies are needed to further test longer durations of riding on different types of terrain to develop appropriate working guidelines for captive elephants. Nevertheless, elephants appear capable of carrying significant amounts of weight on the back without showing signs of physical distress.

AB  - Aiming at the booming building breeding mode, basis on the traditional one-story pig breeding control system, a set of building breeding intelligent control systems based on Model-Free Adaptive Control (MFAC) algorithm was designed. The system adopts the control mode of primary control plus sub-control, which has higher control precision and faster response speed. This paper first designs the hardware system based on the operating principle of the system and then creates the controller software of the system based on the principle of MFAC. Through simulation verification, the results show that the proposed control system based on MFAC can realize the precise control of the environmental parameters of each building unit and has good robustness and adaptability.

AB  - Chronic stress is known to perturb serotonergic regulation in the brain, leading to mood, learning and memory impairments and increasing the risk of developing mood disorders. The influence of the gut microbiota on serotonergic regulation in the brain has received increased attention recently, justifying the investigation of the role of diet on the gut and the brain in mood disorders. Here, using a 4-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model in mice, we aimed to investigate the effects of a high-fat high-glycaemic index (HFD) and high-fibre fruit & vegetable "superfood" (SUP) modifications of a semi-pure AIN93M diet on behaviour, serotonin synthesis and metabolism pathway regulation in the brain and the gut, as well as the gut microbiota and the peripheral adrenal medullary system. CUMS induced anxiety-like behaviour, dysregulated the tryptophan and serotonin metabolic pathways in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and colon, and altered the composition of the gut microbiota. CUMS reduced the catecholamine synthetic capacity of the adrenal glands. Differential effects were found in these parameters in the HFD and SUP diet. Thus, dietary modifications may profoundly affect the multiple dynamic systems involved in mood disorders.

AB  - The value of crops such as perennial wheat (PW) for grain and grazing compared to conventional wheat (W), or the addition of lucerne to PW (PWL) is still being determined. This research sought to determine if these diets were associated with changes in the membranebound proteins that transport nutrients in the rumen epithelium (RE). Crossbred ewes (Poll Dorset x Merino) were fed W, PW, or PWL (50:50) fresh-cut forage ad libitum for 4 weeks. Average daily gain (ADG; p < 0.001) was highest in the W-fed lambs compared to the PW and PWL. Metabolisable energy intake (MEI) was higher in lambs fed W (p < 0.001) compared to PW and PWL. In pairwise comparisons of the PW and PWL diet group we found protein abundance was significantly (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05, Benjamini p < 0.05) different in fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and biosynthesis of cofactors pathways. There were not any differences in protein abundance related to nutrient transport or energy metabolism in the RE between W- vs. PW- and W- vs. PWL-fed lambs. However, in the PW- vs. PWL-fed lambs, there was a difference in the level of proteins regulating the metabolism of fatty acids and energy production in the mitochondria of the rumen epithelium.

AB  - Patients who recover from hospital-acquired pneumonia exhibit a high incidence of end-organ dysfunction following hospital discharge, including cognitive deficits. We have previously demonstrated that pneumonia induces the production and release of cytotoxic oligomeric tau from pulmonary endothelial cells, and these tau oligomers can enter the circulation and may be a cause of long-term morbidities. Endothelial-derived oligomeric tau is hyperphosphorylated during infection. The purpose of these studies was to determine whether Ser-214 phosphorylation of tau is a necessary stimulus for generation of cytotoxic tau variants. The results of these studies demonstrate that Ser-214 phosphorylation is critical for the cytotoxic properties of infection-induced oligomeric tau. In the lung, Ser-214 phosphorylated tau contributes to disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in increased permeability. However, in the brain, both the Ser-214 phosphorylated tau and the mutant Ser-214-Ala tau, which cannot be phosphorylated, disrupted hippocampal long-term potentiation suggesting that inhibition of long-term potentiation was relatively insensitive to the phosphorylation status of Ser-214. Nonetheless, phosphorylation of tau is essential to its cytotoxicity since global dephosphorylation of the infection-induced cytotoxic tau variants rescued long-term potentiation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that multiple forms of oligomeric tau are generated during infectious pneumonia, with different forms of oligomeric tau being responsible for dysfunction of distinct end-organs during pneumonia.

The Tat-CCT2 fusion protein was efficiently delivered into HT22 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and the delivered protein was gradually degraded in HT22 cells. Incubation with Tat-CCT2 significantly ameliorated the 200 mu M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced reduction in cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner, and 8 mu M Tat-CCT2 treatment significantly alleviated H2O2-induced DNA fragmentation and reactive oxygen species formation in HT22 cells. In gerbils, CCT2 protein was efficiently delivered into pyramidal cells in CA1 region by intraperitoneally injecting 0.5 mg/kg Tat-CCT2, as opposed to control CCT2. In addition, treatment with 0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg Tat-CCT2 mitigated ischemia-induced hyperlocomotive activity 1 d after ischemia and confirmed the neuroprotective effects by NeuN immunohistochemistry in the hippocampal CA1 region 4 d after ischemia. Tat-CCT2 treatment significantly reduced the ischemia-induced activation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampal CA1 region 4 d after ischemia. Furthermore, treatment with 0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg Tat-CCT2 facilitated ischemia-induced autophagic activity and ameliorated ischemia-induced autophagic initiation in the hippocampus 1 d after ischemia based on western blotting for LC3B and Beclin-1, respectively. Levels of p62, an autophagic substrate, significantly increased in the hippocampus following treatment with Tat-CCT2. These results suggested that Tat-CCT2 exerts neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress and ischemic damage by promoting the autophagic removal of damaged proteins or organelles.

AB  - Chronic neuropathic pain caused by nerve damage is a most common clinical symptom, often accompanied by anxiety- and depression-like symptoms. Current treatments are very limited at least in part due to incompletely understanding mechanisms underlying this disorder. Changes in gene expression in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) have been acknowledged to implicate in neuropathic pain genesis, but how peripheral nerve injury alters the gene expression in other pain-associated regions remains elusive. The present study carried out strand-specific next-generation RNA sequencing with a higher sequencing depth and observed the changes in whole transcriptomes in the spinal cord (SC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala (AMY) following unilateral fourth lumbar spinal nerve ligation (SNL). In addition to providing novel transcriptome profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs, we identified pain- and emotion-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and revealed that numbers of these DEGs displayed a high correlation to neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Consistently, functional analyses showed that the most significant enriched biological processes of the upregulated mRNAs were involved in the immune system process, apoptotic process, defense response, inflammation response, and sensory perception of pain across three regions. Moreover, the comparisons of pain-, anxiety-, and depression-related DEGs among three regions present a particular molecular map among the spinal cord and supraspinal structures and indicate the region-dependent and region-independent alterations of gene expression after nerve injury. Our study provides a resource for gene transcript expression patterns in three distinct pain-related regions after peripheral nerve injury. Our findings suggest that neuroinflammation and apoptosis are important pathogenic mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain and that some DEGs might be promising therapeutic targets.

AB  - Various studies suggested that neuroinflammation leads to the development of several neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Rotenone is an organic pesticide and potent inhibitor of complex I of electron transport chain widely used to develop the PD model. Numerous studies reported rotenone toxicity in the dopaminergic system but very few studies are available on rotenone-induced glial cell activation and subsequent neurodegeneration and alterations in various types of behavior. Therefore, the present study was designed to explore the effect of rotenone on neuroinflammation and its deleterious effect on the behavior of mice, and also how these effects can be protected through quercetin. Quercetin, a natural flavonoid having strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, is found in vegetables and fruits. The finding of the study indicated that rotenone 5 mg/kg body weight for 60 days through oral gavage leads to the release of inflammatory markers in blood serum, astrocytes activation in substantia nigra and hippocampus, and subsequently decreased density of dopaminergic fibers in the striatum. Rotenone also altered the memory of the mice as indicated by decreased spontaneous alteration in Y-maze and T-maze tests and reduction in exploration time in novel object recognition, increased immobility time in the forced swim test and reduced muscular strength. Co-treatment of quercetin 30 mg/kg/day through oral gavage for 60 days along with rotenone significantly reversed all these adverse effects, suggesting that quercetin could reduce neuroinflammation, and improve memory, and cognitive function.

AB  - Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and diabetes share many risk factors. Despite a strong association between diabetes and CRC being widely studied and confirmed, further genetic research is needed. This study found higher AL049796.1 and TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1) levels (both mRNA and protein) in CRC tissues of diabetic patients compared with nondiabetics, but no significant difference in miR-200b-3p levels. A positive correlation between AL049796.1 and TEAD1 protein existed regardless of diabetes status, whereas miR-200b-3p was only negatively correlated with TEAD1 protein in nondiabetic CRC tissues. In vitro experiments have shown that high glucose (HG) treatment increased AL049796.1 in CRC cells, and AL049796.1 silencing reduced HG-induced proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as connective tissue growth factor, cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61, and epidermal growth factor receptor protein expression. Mechanistic investigations indicated that AL049796.1 could mitigate suppression of miR-200b-3p on TEAD1 posttranscriptionally by acting as a competitive binder. In vivo, subcutaneous CRC tumors in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mice grew significantly faster; AL049796.1 silencing did not affect the growth of subcutaneous CRC tumors but significantly reduced that of STZ-induced mice. Our study suggests that AL049796.1 independently contributes to the risk of CRC in diabetic patients, highlighting its potential as both a therapeutic target and a novel biomarker for CRC among individuals with diabetes.

AB  - Naked mole-rats (NMRs) (Heterocephalus glaber) are highly social and subterranean rodents with large communal colonies in burrows containing low oxygen levels. The inhibition of severe hypoxic conditions is of particular interest to this study. To understand the mechanisms that facilitate neuronal preservation during hypoxia, we investigated the proteins regulating hypoxia tolerance in NMR hippocampal neurons. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a transmembrane scaffolding protein, confers prosurvival signalling in the central nervous system. The present study aimed to investigate the role of Cav-1 in hypoxia-induced neuronal injury. Western blotting analysis and immunocytochemistry showed that Cav-1 expression was significantly upregulated in NMR hippocampal neurons under 8% O-2 conditions for 8 h. Cav-1 alleviates apoptotic neuronal death from hypoxia. Downregulation of Cav-1 by lentiviral vectors suggested damage to NMR hippocampal neurons under hypoxic conditions in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of Cav-1 by LV-Cav-1 enhanced hypoxic tolerance of NMR hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) are also increased under hypoxic conditions. After inhibiting the binding of HIF-1 alpha to hypoxia response elements in the DNA by echinomycin, Cav-1 levels were downregulated significantly. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed the direct role of HIF1 alpha in regulating the expression levels of Cav-1 in NMR hippocampal neurons under hypoxic conditions. These findings suggest that Cav-1 plays a critical role in modulating the apoptosis of NMR hippocampal neurons and warrant further studies targeting Cav-1 to treat hypoxia-associated brain diseases.

AB  - Environmental factors in early life have been demonstrated to increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, especially the deficiency of the cognitive ability. Leptin has emerged as a key hormone that conveys information on energy stores, but there is growing appreciation that leptin signaling may also play an important role in neurodevelopment. The present study aimed to investigate whether maternal HFD exposure impairs the offspring learning and memory through the programming of central leptin system. We observed that hippocampus-dependent learning and memory were impaired in male but not female offspring from HFD-fed maternal ancestors (C57BL/6 mice), as assessed by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. Moreover, the chromatin immunoprecipitation results revealed the maternal HFD consumption led to the increasement in the binding of the histone marker H3K9me3 in male offspring, which mediates gene silencing in the leptin receptor promoter region. Furthermore, there was an increase in the expression of the histone methylase SUV39H1 in male but not female offspring, which regulates H3K9me3. Additionally, it has been observed that IL-6 and IL-1 also could lead to similar alternations when acting on cultured hippocampal neurons in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that maternal HFD consumption influences male offspring hippocampal cognitive performance in a sex-specific manner, and central leptin signaling may serve as the cross-talk between maternal diet and cognitive impairment in offspring.

AB  - Acrylonitrile (AN) is a widely utilized organic compound in the production of diverse industrial synthetic materials. While acute exposure to AN can cause neurotoxicity, the precise mechanism remains unclear. Hypoxiainducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is a pivotal transcription factor that coordinates and orchestrates multiple physiological processes to adapt to hypoxic conditions, ensuring cellular survival and homeostasis. In this study, we used in vitro (cultured mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line, HT22) and in vivo (AN exposed mice) approaches to investigate the potential modulator effects of HIF-1 alpha in AN-induced neurotoxicity. In vitro, AN exposure caused concentration-dependent toxicity in HT22 cells, which was paralleled by increased Bax levels while decreasing Bcl-2. Exposure to AN resulted in reduced protein levels of HIF-1 alpha, Bcl-2 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B) and Beclin1, while increased the protein levels of the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOM20). Furthermore, mitochondrial morphology and function were compromised, suggesting that AN impaired HIF-1 alpha/BNIP3-mediated mitochondrial autophagy and promoted apoptosis. Treatment with a HIF-1 alpha activator, cobalt chloride (CoCl2), reversed these effects, while pretreatment with a HIF-1 alpha inhibitor, 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2), augmented them. In BNIP3 overexpressing HT22 cells, enhanced cell viability and reduced apoptosis rates were observed. Furthermore, the HIF-1 alpha/BNIP3 pathway was activated by the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD2) inhibitor, deferoxamine (DFO), which increased HT22 cell viability. Similarly, the activation of HIF-1 alpha by administering 20 mg/kg of CoCl2 was found to alleviate neurotoxicity in mice. This treatment enhanced elevations of autophagy protein expression and co-localization of BNIP3 and LC3B. In summary, under normoxia, AN induced neurotoxicity by promoting PHD2-mediated HIF-1 alpha degradation, disrupted the BNIP3-mediated mitophagy pathway, and enhanced apoptosis. Our findings underscore the effect of the HIF-1 alpha/BNIP3-mediated mitochondrial autophagy in AN-induced neurotoxicity and suggest potential therapeutic strategies involving HIF-1 alpha activation or BNIP3 overexpression for AN poisoning treatment.

AB  - Research on the interactions between herbivorous insects and plants, facilitated by insect secretions, has increasingly emphasized species with chewing mandibles over time. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Spodoptera frugiperda and plants remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified a protein disulfide isomerase (SfPDI) from the salivary glands of S. frugiperda that regulates the interaction between S. frugiperda and plants. We found that SfPDI is highly expressed in the salivary glands of S. frugiperda and is secreted into plants as a secretory protein. The RNAi revealed that SfPDI contributes to the growth and development of S. frugiperda on host plants, while its overexpression in tobacco induces necrosis in tobacco leaves and triggers a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Differentially expressed genes suggested that SfPDI may suppresses the expression of plant JA by positively regulating MYC2 and TIFYs and negatively regulating WRKYs. Notably, SfPDI may modulate these high expression of receptors (NB-LRR, GL-RLK, and RLK) lead to hypersensitive response (HR) cell death and the accumulation of lignification of plant. This study provides a foundation for further exploring insect-plant interaction mechanisms and a theoretical basis for developing insect-resistant germplasm and environmentally friendly pest control strategies.

AB  - Energy consumption is a major sustainability issue. One of the largest portions of energy consumption in buildings comes from cooling. This paper proposes the use of L-shaped minilouvers as shading, which both improve useful daylight illuminance (UDI) and reduce cooling-energy consumption. Jakarta, Indonesia was chosen as the study location since it has driving factors for higher cooling energy, ranging from those of demographic to the environment. An open office was chosen for simulation in Rhinoceros 3D with the Grasshopper, LadyBug, and Honeybee plug-ins, which utilize the EnergyPlus engine. Following the UDI and cooling-energy simulations, surveys were conducted to gather the information of the price of materials for shading and electricity. Savings from cooling energy were compared with the cost of shading application to obtain the simple payback periods. The best shading was provided by L-shaped minilouvers, which can achieve a simple payback period of 0.86 years, reducing cooling-energy consumption by around 18% while improving around 16.78 UDI in comparison with the base case with the average of all the orientations. All simulated L-shaped minilouvers also performed better than the overhang did, which is a more common form of shading in the simulated location.

AB  - The Japanese encephalitis virus, (JEV), is a flavivirus mostly transmitted by Culex mosquitoes mostly present in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region. Ardeid-wading birds are the natural reservoir of JEV; nonetheless, pigs are frequently a key amplifying host during epidemics in human populations. Although more domestic animals and wildlife are JEV hosts, it is unclear how these animals fit into the ecology and epidemiology of the virus. Even though there is no specific therapy, vaccines are available to prevent this infection. However, current vaccinations do not work against every clinical isolate and can cause neurological problems in certain people. In this study, we have screened 501 phytochemical compounds from various plants from the Zingeberaceae family against the RdRp protein of JEV. Based on this, the top five compounds (IMPHY014466, IMPHY004928, IMPHY007097, IMPHY014179 and IMPHY005010) were selected based on the obtained docking scores, which was above -8.0 Kcal/mol. Further, the binding affinity of these selected ligands was also analysed using molecular interaction, and the presence of interactions like hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic bonds and polar bonds with respective active residues were identified and studied elaborately. Furthermore, the dynamic stability of the docked RdRp protein with these selected phytochemicals was studied using Molecular dynamic simulation and essential dynamics. The free energy landscape analysis also provided information about the energy transition responsible stability of the complex. The results obtained advocated phytochemical compounds from the zingeberaceae family for future experimental validation, as these compounds exhibited significant potential as JEV antagonists.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - The present study investigated the neural health benefit of beta-sitosterol (BSS) against trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neurodegeneration in mice. Forty male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were randomly divided into Sham-veh, TMT-veh, TMT-BSS50, and TMT-BSS100. A one-time intraperitoneal injection of 2.6 mg/kg of TMT was given to mice in TMT groups. Vehicle (veh), BSS 50 mg/kg or BSS 100 mg/kg were orally given for 2 weeks. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated. Brain oxidative status, hippocampal neuropathology, and reactive astrocytes were done. White matter pathology was also evaluated. The results indicated the massy effect of TMT on induced motor ability and spatial memory deficits in accordance with increased neuronal degeneration in Cornus ammonis (CA) 1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) and internal capsule white matter damage. TMT also induced the reduction of reactive astrocytes in CA1 and DG. Brain's catalase activity was significantly reduced by TMT, but not in mice with BSS treatments. Both doses of BSS treatment exhibited improvement in motor ability and spatial memory deficits in accordance with the activation of reactive astrocytes in CA1, CA3, and DG. However, they successfully prevented the increase of neuronal degeneration in CA1 found only with the BSS dose of 100 mg/kg, and it was indicated as the effective dose for neuroprotection in the vulnerable brain area. This study demonstrated mitigative effects of BSS against motor ability and memory deficits with neural health benefits, including a protective effect against CA1 neurodegeneration and a nurturing effect on hippocampal reactive astrocytes.

AB  - The textbook conceptualization of phenotype creation, "genotype (G) + environment (E) + genotype & environment interactions (GE) phenotype (Ph)", is modeled with open quantum systems theory (OQST) or more generally with adaptive dynamics theory (ADT). The model is quantum-like , i.e., it is not about quantum physical processes in biosystems. Generally such modeling is about applications of the quantum formalism and methodology outside of physics. Macroscopic biosystems, in our case genotypes and phenotypes, are treated as information processors which functioning matches the laws of quantum information theory. Phenotypes are the outputs of the E-adaptation processes described by the quantum master equation, Gorini- Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation (GKSL). Its stationary states correspond to phenotypes. We highlight the class of GKSL dynamics characterized by the camel-like graphs of (von Neumann) entropy: in the process of E-adaptation phenotype's state entropy (disorder) first increases and then falls down - a stable and wellordered phenotype is created. Traits, an organism's phenotypic characteristics, are modeled within the quantum measurement theory, as generally unsharp observables given by positive operator valued measures (POVMs. This paper is also a review on the methods and mathematical apparatus of quantum information biology.

AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) is highly toxic to the human brain. Although much is known about MeHg neurotoxic effects, less is known about how chronic MeHg affects hippocampal amino acids and other neurochemical markers in adult mice. In this study, we evaluated the MeHg effects on systemic lipids and inflammation, hippocampal oxidative stress, amino acid levels, neuroinflammation, and behavior in adult male mice. Challenged mice received MeHg in drinking water (2 mg/L) for 30 days. We assessed weight gain, total plasma cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), endotoxin, and TNF levels. Hippocampal myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), amino acid levels, and cytokine transcripts were evaluated. Mice underwent open field, object recognition, Y, and Barnes maze tests. MeHg-intoxicated mice had higher weight gain and increased the TG and TC plasma levels. Elevated circulating TNF and LPS confirmed systemic inflammation. Higher levels of MPO and MDA and a reduction in IL-4 transcripts were found in the hippocampus. MeHg-intoxication led to increased GABA and glycine, reduced hippocampal taurine levels, delayed acquisition in the Barnes maze, and poor locomotor activity. No significant changes were found in AChE activity and object recognition. Altogether, our findings highlight chronic MeHg-induced effects that may have long-term mental health consequences in prolonged exposed human populations.

AB  - Calcium (Ca2+) sparks are the elementary events of excitation-contraction coupling, yet they are not explicitly represented in human ventricular myocyte models. A stochastic ventricular cardiomyocyte human model that adapts to intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) dynamics, spark regulation, and frequency-dependent changes in the form of locally controlled Ca2+ release was developed. The 20,000 CRUs in this model are composed of 9 individual LCCs and 49 RyRs that function as couplons. The simulated action potential duration at 1 Hz steady-state pacing is similar to 0.280 s similar to human ventricular cell recordings. Rate-dependence experiments reveal that APD shortening mechanisms are largely contributed by the L-type calcium channel inactivation, RyR open fraction, and [Ca2+]myo concentrations. The dynamic slow-rapid-slow pacing protocol shows that RyR open probability during high pacing frequency (2.5 Hz) switches to an adapted "nonconducting" form of Ca2+-dependent transition state. The predicted force was also observed to be increased in high pacing, but the SR Ca2+ fractional release was lower due to the smaller difference between diastolic and systolic [Ca2+]SR. Restitution analysis through the S1S2 protocol and increased LCC Ca2+-dependent activation rate show that the duration of LCC opening helps modulate its effects on the APD restitution at different diastolic intervals. Ultimately, a longer duration of calcium sparks was observed in relation to the SR Ca2+ loading at high pacing rates. Overall, this study demonstrates the spontaneous Ca2+ release events and ion channel responses throughout various stimuli.

AB  - The formation of neural circuits requires extensive interactions of cell-surface proteins to guide axons to their correct target neurons. Trans-cellular interactions of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor latrophilin-2 (Lphn2) with its partner teneurin-3 instruct the precise assembly of hippocampal networks by reciprocal repulsion. Lphn2 acts as a repulsive receptor in distal CA1 neurons to direct their axons to the proximal subiculum, and as a repulsive ligand in the proximal subiculum to direct proximal CA1 axons to the distal subiculum. It remains unclear if Lphn2-mediated intracellular signaling is required for its role in either context. Here, we show that Lphn2 couples to Ga-12/13 in heterologous cells; this coupling is increased by constitutive exposure of the tethered agonist. Specific mutations of Lphn2's tethered agonist region disrupt its G protein coupling and autoproteolytic cleavage, whereas mutating the autoproteolytic cleavage site alone prevents cleavage but preserves a functional tethered agonist. Using an in vivo misexpression assay, we demonstrate that wild-type Lphn2 misdirects proximal CA1 axons to the proximal subiculum and that Lphn2 tethered agonist activity is required for its role as a repulsive receptor in axons. By contrast, neither tethered agonist activity nor autoproteolysis were necessary for Lphn2's role as a repulsive ligand in the subiculum target neurons. Thus, tethered agonist activity is required for Lphn2-mediated neural circuit assembly in a context-dependent manner.

AB  - Silibinin is a flavonoid extracted from the medicinal plant Silybum marianum (milk thistle), traditionally used to treat liver disease. Recent studies have shown that the antioxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects of milk thistle are used in the treatment of neurological diseases. Silibinin has antioxidative stress and antiapoptotic effects and reduces cognitive impairment in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanism of silibinin related to improvement of cognition remains poorly understood. In this study, we used the model of lateral ventricle injection of formaldehyde to examine the related mechanism of silibinin in improving cognitive impairment disorders. Oral administration of silibinin for three weeks significantly attenuated the cognitive deficits of formaldehyde-induced mice in a Y-maze test and Morris water maze test. Y-maze results show that silibinin increases the rate of spontaneous response alternation in FA-induced mice. Silibinin increases the target quadrant spending time and decreases escape latency in the Morris water maze test. We examined the effect of silibinin on the NRF2 signaling pathway, and silibinin promoted the nuclear transfer of NRF2 and increased the expression of HO-1 but did not significantly increase the protein expression of NRF2 in the hippocampus. Well, silibinin reduces the content of DHE and decreases the levels of apoptosis of mature neuron cells. We investigated the effect of silibinin on the content of formaldehyde degrading enzymes; biochemical analyses revealed that silibinin increased GSH and ALDH2 in formaldehyde-induced mice. In addition, as one of the pathological changes of AD, TAU protein is also hyperphosphorylated in FA model mice. Silibinin inhibits the expression of GSK-3 beta in model mice, thereby reducing the phosphorylation of TAU proteins ser396 and ser404 mediated by GSK3 beta. Based on our findings, we verified that the mechanism of silibinin improving cognitive impairment may be antioxidative stress, and silibinin is one of the potentially promising drugs to prevent formaldehyde-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - The pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 regulates numerous processes in the body, including neuronal functions. IL-6 either binds to membrane-bound receptor (mIL-6R) and triggers signaling via heteromerization with the signal transducer gp130 (classical signaling), or binds to its soluble form (sIL-6R) to act on cells that do not express mIL-6R (trans-signaling). The ss-secretase BACE1 can cleave gp130 as well as IL-6R and we hypothesized that BACE1 may alter neuron activity and synaptic transmission via modulation of IL-6 signaling. We used multielectrode array (MEA) recordings to monitor electrical activity of neuronal networks in acute cerebellar slices as well as long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation in the hippocampus and to assess how exposure to IL-6 affects these processes. A pharmacological approach was applied to elucidate the contribution of trans-signaling involving BACE1. Spontaneous neuronal activity in cerebellar slices significantly decreased upon perfusion with IL-6 but not LIF and recovered during wash out. BACE1 inhibitors verubecestat or AZD3839 abolished the inhibitory effects of IL6. Furthermore, IL-6 and LIF reversibly inhibited LTP in hippocampal slices, and in contrast to cerebellar neurons, BACE1 inhibitors verubecestat or AZD3839 did not abolish the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on LTP. Interestingly, a dramatic rebound effect on excitatory postsynaptic potentials was observed with BACE1 inhibitor AZD3839 but not verubecestat during wash out. Our results support relevant and differential roles of IL-6, LIF and BACE1 in pathways modulating neuronal discharge activity in the cerebellum and the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, and a possible involvement of this interaction in deficits of memory and learning.

AB  - Simple Summary The shortage of natural resources, prices, and high demand for fish oil has encouraged the use of non-traditional ingredients in aquafeed. The search for an alternative lipid source in aquafeeds has seen terrestrial vegetable oils at the epicenter of various flagship aqua-feed research. Herein, we investigated the effects of substituting fish oil (FO) with camelina oil (CO) on growth performance, fatty acid profile, digestibility, liver histology, and antioxidative status of red seabream (Pagrus major). After 56 days of the feeding trial, the results suggested that FO can be replaced with CO in the feeds of farmed red seabream without compromising growth, blood chemistry, digestibility, and overall health status. A 56-day feeding trial to evaluate the responses of red seabream (initial weight: 1.8 +/- 0.02 g) to the substitution of fish oil (FO) with camelina oil (CO) at different ratios was conducted. The control diet formulated at 46% CP (6F0C) contained only FO without CO; from the second to the fifth diet, the FO was substituted with CO at rates of 5:1 (5F1C), 4:2 (4F2C), 3:3 (3F3C), 2:4 (2F4C), and 0:6 (0F6C). The results of the present study showed that up to full substitution of FO with CO showed no significant effect on growth variables BW = 26.2 g-28.3 g), body weight gain (BWG = 1275.5-1365.3%), specific growth rate (SGR = 4.6-4.7), feed intake (FI = 25.6-27.8), feed conversion ratio (FCR = 1.0-1.1), biometric indices condition factor (CF = 2.2-2.4), hepatosomatic index (HSI = 0.9-1.1), viscerasomatic index (VSI = 7.5-9.5), and survival rates (SR = 82.2-100) with different FO substitution levels with CO. Similarly, there were no significant differences (p < 0.05) found in the whole-body composition except for the crude lipid content, and the highest value was observed in the control group (291 g/kg) compared to the other groups FO5CO1 (232 k/kg), FO4CO2 (212 g/kg), FO2CO4 (232 g/kg) and FO0CO6 (244 g/kg). Blood chemistry levels were not influenced in response to test diets: hematocrit (36-33%), glucose (Glu = 78.3-71.3 mg/dL), total protein (T-pro = 3.1-3.8 g/dL), total cholesterol (T-Chol = 196.0-241 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN = 9.0-14.6 mg/dL), total bilirubin (T-Bil = 0.4-0.5 mg/dL), triglyceride (TG = 393.3-497.6 mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase test (ALT = 50-65.5 UL/L), aspartate aminotransferase test (AST = 38-69.3 UL/L). A remarkable modulation was observed in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the liver, as CAT and SOD values were lower with the complete FO substitution with CO (0F6C), and the highest values were observed in the control and (4F2C). This study indicates that red seabream may have the ability to maintain LC-PUFAs between tissues and diets, and CO substitution of FO could improve both lipid metabolism and oxidation resistance as well as maintain digestibility. In conclusion, dietary FO can be replaced up to 100% or 95% by CO in the diets of red seabream as long as n-3 HUFA, EPA, and DHA are incorporated at the recommended level.

AB  - Typha is a wild plant with invasive growth that causes environmental problems in different areas worldwide. This study investigated the ensiling potential of typha (Typha latifolia) to be preserved and used for ruminant feeding. Four silage treatments were evaluated: typha with no additives (CON); with formic acid (FA; 4 mL/kg); with urea and molasses (UM; 19 and 24 g/kg, respectively); and with formic acid, urea, and molasses (FAUM; all at previous concentrations). Three bags of each silage were prepared and stored for 4 months before being analysed and fermented in vitro with ruminal fluid from sheep. All of the silages were well preserved, and their pH was greater (p < 0.05) for UM and FAUM (8.50 and 7.70, respectively) compared with CON and FA (5.39 and 4.75). The high concentrations of volatile fatty acid and ammonia-nitrogen in the UM and FAUM silages indicated undesirable fermentations and precluded their use in practice. However, neither CON nor FA silages improved the in vitro ruminal degradability of pre-ensiling typha (61.7, 58.2, and 65.2%, respectively), which was lower than that of a medium-quality triticale hay (68.0%). The results indicate that typha silage could replace low-quality forages in ruminant diets, being adequate especially for low-producing animals or for those under maintenance conditions. More studies with different doses of additives are needed to identify the optimal conditions for ensiling typha and increasing its nutritive value.

AB  - Porcine 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 14 (HSD17B14) and FSH reporter (FSHR) genes play important roles in the metabolism of steroid hormones and the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). Our bioinformatics analyses and the dual luciferase reporter assays indicated that porcine miR-20b and miR-31 target the 3 '& nbsp;-& nbsp;UTR region of HSD17B14 gene, and miR-31 also targets the 3 '& nbsp;-& nbsp;UTR region of FSHR gene. Overexpression of porcine HSD17B14 gene promoted the conversion from estradiol (E2) to estrone (E1) and increased the apoptosis of porcine GCs. Overexpression of miR-20b down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression level of HSD17B14 gene, decreased the concentration of progesterone (P4) and E1, increased E2, as well as reduced apoptosis of GCs. Moreover, overexpression of miR-31 also down-regulated the protein expression level of HSD17B14 gene, decreased the concentration of P4 and E1, and increased E2. However, miR-31 promoted apoptosis of GCs by targeting to the 3 '& nbsp;-UTR of porcine FSHR gene. Taken together, we found that both porcine miR-20b and miR-31 target HSD17B14 gene, but miR-31 also targets FSHR gene to regulate the metabolism of steroid hormones and the apoptosis of porcine ovarian GCs. These findings expand the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of porcine miR-31 and miR-20b in ovarian GCs. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells that line the biliary tree, can proliferate under the stimulation of several factors through both autocrine and paracrine pathways. The cocaine-amphetamine-regulated-transcript (CART) peptide has several physiological functions, and it is widely expressed in several organs. CART increases the survival of hippocampal neurons by upregulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose expression has been correlated to the proliferation rate of cholangiocytes. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CART and its role in modulating cholangiocyte proliferation in healthy and bile duct ligated (BDL) rats in vivo, as well as in cultured normal rat cholangiocytes (NRC) in vitro. Liver samples from both healthy and BDL (1 week) rats, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for CART, CK19, TrkB and p75NTR BDNF receptors. PCNA staining was used to evaluate the proliferation of the cholangiocytes, whereas TUNEL assay was used to evaluate biliary apoptosis. NRC treated or not with CART were used to confirm the role of CART on cholangiocytes proliferation and the secretion of BDNF. Cholangiocytes proliferation, apoptosis, CART and TrkB expression were increased in BDL rats, compared to control rats. We found a higher expression of TrkB and p75NTR, which could be correlated with the proliferation rate of biliary tree during BDL. The in vitro study demonstrated increased BDNF secretion by NRC after treatment with CART compared with control cells. As previously reported, proliferating cholangiocytes acquire a neuroendocrine phenotype, modulated by several factors, including neurotrophins. Accordingly, CART may play a key role in the remodeling of biliary epithelium during cholestasis by modulating the secretion of BDNF.

AB  - Among livestock species, pigs have the highest rate of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) because of large litter size and restricted feeding programs. IUGR generally affects 15-20% and 30% of piglets from sows with 10-13 and 18 liveborn piglets per litter, respectively. All piglets may be IUGR neonates when part or all periods of pregnancy occur in warm seasons. Without proper nutritional intervention, most of them will die before preweaning due to physiological and metabolic disorders. Thus, IUGR piglets are culled at birth on most swine farms. This represents a major loss to the global pork industry and a concern over animal welfare. Results of this study indicate that daily oral administration of 0.4 g L-arginine (as L-arginine-HCl) per kg body weight between 0 and 14 days of age was effective in increasing the circulating levels of arginine, anabolic hormones (insulin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-I), and growth, while reducing plasma concentrations of ammonia, cortisol (a catabolic hormone), and mortality. Thus, L-arginine offers a promising solution to both promote growth and save IUGR piglets during the neonatal period, thereby improving the efficiency and profit of the global swine industry. Neonatal piglets with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) exhibit reduced rates of growth and survival. The present study tested the hypothesis that L-arginine supplementation can mitigate this problem. One hundred and twelve (112) IUGR piglets (with a mean birth weight of 0.84 kg) from 28 sows (four IUGR piglets/sow) were assigned randomly into one of four groups. Piglets were nursed by sows and orally administered 0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 g L-arginine (in the form of L-arginine-HCl) per kg body weight (BW) twice daily between 0 and 14 days of age. The total doses of L-arginine were 0, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 g/kg BW/day. Appropriate amounts of L-alanine were added to L-arginine solutions so that all groups of piglets received the same amount of nitrogen. Piglets were weighed on days 0, 7, and 14 of age. On day 14, blood samples (5 mL) were obtained from the jugular vein of piglets at 1 h after suckling, and their milk consumption was measured over a 10-h period using the weigh-suckle-weigh technique. Milk intake did not differ (p > 0.05) among the four groups of piglets. Oral administration of 0.4 g L-arginine/kg BW/day increased (p < 0.05) the circulating levels of arginine, creatine, and anabolic hormones (insulin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-I), but decreased (p < 0.05) plasma concentrations of ammonia and cortisol (a catabolic hormone). Compared to the control group, IUGR piglets administered 0.2 and 0.4 g L-arginine/kg BW/day increased (p < 0.05) weight gain by 19% and 31%, respectively. Growth did not differ (p > 0.05) between the control and 0.8 g L-arginine/kg BW/day groups. The survival rates of IUGR piglets were 50%, 75%, 89%, and 89%, respectively, for the 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g L-arginine/kg BW/day groups. Collectively, these results indicate that the growth and survival of IUGR piglets can be improved through L-arginine supplementation.

AB  - Background: Anxiolytic properties of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) have been previously reported. However, the exact mechanism(s) of action remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effect of KRG on immobilization-induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice and explored the involvement of the serotonin and GABA systems and BDNF in the anxiolytic action.Methods: Mice were orally administered with KRG (200 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks and immobilized once daily for 2 h. p-Chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA) was intraperitoneally injected on day 22-28, and flumazenil or bicuculline was injected on day 25-28. After behavioral evaluations, brains were dissected for biochemical analyses.Results: KRG improved immobilization-induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice, as assessed by the elevated plus maze (EPM) and marble burying tests (MBT). The anxiolytic effect of KRG was comparable to that of fluoxetine, a reference drug clinically used for anxiety disorders. A serotonin synthesis inhibitor, p-CPA, blocked the effect of KRG in the EPM and MBT, indicating the requirement of serotonin synthesis for anxiolytic action. In addition, the anxiolytic effect of KRG was inhibited by bicuculline (a GABAA antagonist) in MBT, implying the involvement of GABA transmission. Western blotting analyses revealed that KRG upregulated the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase and GABAA receptor in the brain, which was blocked by p-CPA. Enhanced BDNF expression by KRG in the hippocampus was also indicated to mediate the anxiolytic action of KRG in immobilized mice.Conclusion: KRG exhibited the anxiolytic effect in immobilized mice by multiple mechanisms of action, involving enhanced serotonin and GABA transmissions and BDNF expression.(c) 2022 The Korean Society of Ginseng.

AB  - Biophysical properties of the cellular microenvironment, including stiffness and geometry, have been shown to influence cell function. Recent findings have implicated 3D confinement as an important regulator of cell behavior. The understanding of how mechanical signals direct cell function is based primarily on 2D studies. To investigate how the extent of 3D confinement affects cell function, a single cell culture platform is fabricated with geometrically defined and fully enclosed microwells and it is applied to investigate how niche volume and stiffness affect human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) life and death. The viability and proliferation of hMSCs in confined 3D microniches are compared with unconfined cells in 2D. Confinement biases hMSC viability and proliferation, and this influence depends on the niche volume and stiffness. The rate of cell death increases and proliferation markedly decreases upon 3D confinement. The observed differences in hMSC behavior are correlated to changes in nuclear morphology and YES-associated protein (YAP) localization. In smaller 3D microniches, hMSCs display smaller and more rounded nuclei and primarily cytoplasmic YAP localization, indicating reduced mechanical activation upon confinement. Interestingly, these effects scale with the extent of 3D confinement. These results demonstrate that the extent of confinement in 3D can be an important regulator of cell function.

AB  - A core assumption of sexual selection theory is that sexually selected weapons, specialized morphological structures used directly in male contests, can improve an individual's reproductive success but only if the bearer can overcome associated costs, the negative effects on the bearer's fitness components. However, recent studies have shown that producing and wielding exaggerated weapons may not necessarily be costly. Rather, some traits can be selected for supporting, or compensating for, the expense of producing and wielding such exaggerated weapons. In the ant-mimicking jumping spider Myrmarachne gisti, exaggerated chelicerae are borne only by adult males and not females, showing sexual dimorphism and steep positive allometry with body size. Here, we determine the potential benefits of bearing exaggerated chelicerae during male contests and explore the potential for costs in terms of prey-capture efficiency and compensation between chelicera size and neighboring trait size. While males with longer chelicerae won most of their male-male contests, we found no significant differences in prey-capture efficiency between males and females regardless of whether prey was winged or flightless. Males' elongated chelicerae thus do not impede their efficiency at capturing prey. Furthermore, we found that the sizes of all neighboring traits are positively correlated with chelicera size, suggesting that these traits may be under correlational selection. Taken together, our findings suggest that M. gisti males armed with the exaggerated chelicerae that function as weapons win more fights at limited cost for performance in prey capture and compensate for neighboring structures.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Nityananda Rasa (NR) is an ayurvedic herbo-metallic formulation used to treat gout, obesity, hypothyroidism, elephantiasis, and other diseases. However, its safety is a concern owing to the use of heavy metals like mercury and arsenic. Aim of the study: To study the sub-chronic oral toxicity of NR on albino wistar rats for safety evaluation. Materials and methods: The male and female albino wistar rats were administered a daily dose of 30 (low), 300 (medium) and 600 (high) mg/kg BW/day of NR for 90-day period. The body weight and feed consumption were monitored once a week. After 90 days, blood and vital organs were harvested for genotoxicity, hematology, biochemistry, histopathology, gene expression and the biodistribution analysis. Results: There was no mortality or severe behavioural changes observed in rats. Significant changes in biochemical enzyme levels were seen at medium and high doses of NR i. e. 300 and 600 mg/kg BW/day respectively. No hematological changes were observed. Mild histopathological changes seen at high dose of NR which were found in concurrence with the biochemical alterations in liver and brain. There was mild genotoxicity and no detectable level of mercury but significant arsenic level in blood at high dose. Gene expression was mildly affected. Conclusions: NR induced moderate toxic effects at high dose but can be considered safe at therapeutic doses.

AB  - Foot and hoof problems are one of the most common health concerns for giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) held in captivity. However, very limited information is available on the foot pathology for free-roaming giraffes. A free-roaming giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) situated within a small Free State game reserve presented with limping, and provided a unique opportunity to examine and treat the apparent foot injury. After being sedated and restrained, radiographs were taken in the field. A lateral fracture was diagnosed in the proximal pastern bone of the right front leg of the giraffe. Hoof trimming was used in an attempt to provide treatment and relief to the animal's gait and appearance. The occurrence and treatment of this hoof injury could provide insight on similar pathology in zoo environments.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Kai-Xin-San (KXS) is a classic herbal formula for the treatment and prevention of AD (Alzheimer 's disease) with definite curative effect, but its mechanism, which involves multiple components, pathways, and targets, is not yet fully understood. Aim of the study: To verify the effect of KXS on gut microbiota and explore its anti-AD mechanism related with gut microbiota. Materials and methods: AD rat model was established and evaluated by intraperitoneal injection of D-gal and bilateral hippocampal CA1 injections of Af3 25-35 . The pharmacodynamics of KXS in vivo includes general behavior, Morris water maze test, ELISA, Nissl & HE staining and immunofluorescence. Systematic analysis of gut microbiota was conducted using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. The potential role of gut microbiota in the anti-AD effect of KXS was validated with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments. Results: KXS could significantly improve cognitive impairment, reduce neuronal damage and attenuate neuroinflammation and colonic inflammation in vivo in AD model rats. Nine differential intestinal bacteria associated with AD were screened, in which four bacteria ( Lactobacillus murinus , Ligilactobacillus , Alloprevotella , Prevotellaceae _ NK3B31_group ) were very significant. Conclusion: KXS can maintain the ecological balance of intestinal microbiota and exert its anti-AD effect by regulating the composition and proportion of gut microbiota in AD rats through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Ion transporters protect esophageal epithelial cells by maintaining intracellular pH at normal levels. In this study, we hypothesized that smoking affects the function of ion transporters, thus playing a role in the development of smoking-induced esophageal diseases. Esophageal cell lines were treated with cigarettesmoke extract (CSE), and the viability and proliferation of the cells, as well as the activity, mRNA and protein expression of the Na+ /H+ exchanger-1 (NHE-1), were studied. NHE-1 expression was also investigated in human samples. For chronic treatment, guinea pigs were exposed to tobacco smoke, and NHE-1 activity was measured. Silencing of NHE-1 was performed by using specific siRNA. CSE treatment increased the activity and protein expression of NHE-1 in the metaplastic cells and decreased the rate of proliferation in a NHE-1-dependent manner. In contrast, CSE increased the proliferation of dysplastic cells independently of NHE-1. In the normal cells, the expression and activity of NHE-1 decreased due to in vitro and in vivo smoke exposure. Smoking enhances the function of NHE-1 in Barrett's esophagus, and this is presumably a compensatory mechanism against this toxic agent.

AB  - Oxycodone is a highly prescribed opioid and its abuse has been rampant. Accumulating evidence shows that the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) plays a key role in mediating rewarding effects to opioids. However, the downstream signalling of CB1R induced by oxycodone remains unclear. The neuropeptide oxytocin is well known as a potential remedy for drug addiction. Thus, our study aims to explore the mechanism of oxycodone-induced learning and memory deficits underlying the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and the effect of oxytocin. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with oxycodone once a day for eight consecutive day. Novel object recognition, resident-intruder and Morris Water Maze tests were employed to assess the cognitive, social and spatial memory of the rats after oxycodone withdrawal. The (co-)expression of CB1R, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), regulatory protein p25, tau and phosphorylated tau was measured 1 day after the last behavioural test. The histopathological staining and synaptic density in the hippocampus were observed as well. We found that oxycodone upregulated the expression of p-GSK3 beta, co-expression of p-Cdk5 and p25 through CB1R. This finding was accompanied by elevation of pSer396, pSer404 in the tau, and reduction of the number of neurons, dendritic spines and synaptic density in the hippocampus. Furthermore, i.c.v. treatment with oxytocin ameliorates memory deficits in oxycodone-treated rats through inhibition of the ECS. We propose further studies on the clinical use of this neuropeptide, which may potentially cure drug addiction.

AB  - In adult dentate gyrus neurogenesis, the link between maturation of newborn neurons and their function, such as behavioral pattern separation, has remained puzzling. By analyzing a theoretical model, we show that the switch from excitation to inhibition of the GABAergic input onto maturing newborn cells is crucial for their proper functional integration. When the GABAergic input is excitatory, cooperativity drives the growth of synapses such that newborn cells become sensitive to stimuli similar to those that activate mature cells. When GABAergic input switches to inhibitory, competition pushes the configuration of synapses onto newborn cells toward stimuli that are different from previously stored ones. This enables the maturing newborn cells to code for concepts that are novel, yet similar to familiar ones. Our theory of newborn cell maturation explains both how adult-born dentate granule cells integrate into the preexisting network and why they promote separation of similar but not distinct patterns.

AB  - The carotenoid content of plants may be impacted by stress with major consequences for photosynthesis and photoprotection. Most carotenoid stress research, however, has concentrated on abiotic stresses, and we know little about how biological stresses, such as herbivory, alter profiles of plant carotenoids and their degradation products. For example, carotenoid derivatives such as ss-cyclocitral and ss-ionone have been recently shown to act as signals in plant growth and protection against oxidative stress and herbivory. To understand how carotenoid composition is influenced by herbivory, changes in biosynthesis and degradation should be investigated. This chapter describes methods to simulate herbivory in a simple reproducible fashion and to assess carotenoid biosynthesis and degradation. Carotenoid biosynthesis depends on precursors provided by the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, which converts pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to the five-carbon units used for construction of larger isoprenoids. We present protocols to quantify the activity of the first enzyme of the MEP pathway, deoxy-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), usually assumed to be rate-controlling, and to estimate the concentration of the first intermediate of the pathway, deoxy-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP). We also discuss procedures to measure the formation of volatile carotenoid breakdown products after herbivory. To monitor the activity of carotenoid-specific biosynthetic enzymes, such as phytoene synthase, protocols are available elsewhere in this volume (Wurtzel, 2022b).

AB  - Water conservation is vital for life in the desert. The dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) produces low volumes of highly concentrated urine, more so when water is scarce, to conserve body water. Two hormones, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin, both produced in the supraoptic nucleus, the core hypothalamic osmoregulatory control centre, are vital for this adaptive process, but the mechanisms that enable the camel supraoptic nucleus to cope with osmotic stress are not known. To investigate the central control of water homeostasis in the camel, we first build three dimensional models of the camel supraoptic nucleus based on the expression of the vasopressin and oxytocin mRNAs in order to facilitate sampling. We then compare the transcriptomes of the supraoptic nucleus under control and water deprived conditions and identified genes that change in expression due to hyperosmotic stress. By comparing camel and rat datasets, we have identified common elements of the water deprivation transcriptomic response network, as well as elements, such as extracellular matrix remodelling and upregulation of angiotensinogen expression, that appear to be unique to the dromedary camel and that may be essential adaptations necessary for life in the desert.
   Comparative transcriptomic analyses between dromedary camels and rats provide insight into water homeostasis gene responses in animals under water stress conditions.

AB  - Camellia oil extracted from the seeds of Camellia oleifera Abel. is a popular and high-quality edible oil, but its yield is limited by seed setting, which is mainly caused by self-incompatibility (SI). One of the obvious biological features of SI plants is the inhibition of self-pollen tubes; however, the underlying mechanism of this inhibition in C. oleifera is poorly understood. In this study, we constructed a semi-in vivo pollen tube growth test (SIV-PGT) system that can screen for substances that inhibit self-pollen tubes without interference from the genetic background. Combined with multi-omics analysis, the results revealed the important role of galloylated catechins in self-pollen tube inhibition, and a possible molecular regulatory network mediated by UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) and serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) was proposed. In summary, galloylation of catechins and high levels of galloylated catechins are specifically involved in pollen tube inhibition under self-pollination rather than cross-pollination, which provides a new understanding of SI in C. oleifera. These results will contribute to sexual reproduction research on C. oleifera and provide theoretical support for improving Camellia oil yield in production.

AB  - In ADHD treatment, methylphenidate (MPH) is the most frequently used medication. The present work provides evidence that MPH restored behavioral impairments and neuroplasticity due to changes in AMPAR subunit composition and distribution, as well as maturation of dendritic spines, in a prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) ADHD mouse model. PNE animals and controls were given a single oral dose of MPH (1 mg/kg), and their behavior was tested for attention, hyperactivity, and working memory. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced and analyzed at the CA3/CA1 synapse in hippocampal slices taken from the same animals tested behaviorally, measuring fEPSPs and whole-cell patch-clamp EPSCs. By applying crosslinking and Western blots, we estimated the LTP effects on AMPAR subunit composition and distribution. The density and types of dendritic spines were quantified by using the Golgi staining method. MPH completely restored the behavioral impairments of PNE mice. Reduced LTP and AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs were also restored. EPSC amplitudes were tightly correlated with numbers of GluA1/GluA1 AMPA receptors at the cell surface. Finally, we found a lower density of dendritic spines in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in PNE mice, with a higher fraction of thin-type immature spines and a lower fraction of mushroom mature spines; the latter effect was also reversed by MPH.

AB  - The effect of different intensity of light exposure (5000 and 10 000 lux) on the growth of two strains (1 and 2) of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.) callus cultures and the accumulation of flavanols in them, including oligomeric forms-proanthocyanidins. The composition and content of monomeric flavanols-(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin in methanol extracts of cultures were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Data on the morphology of calluses are presented and the greening of the strain 1 is noted, especially at high light intensity (10 000 lux). Its high ability to accumulate flavanols was established, which was 12-35 times higher than that of the strain 2. These differences depended on the age of the cultures and the intensity of light exposure. By HPLC method, monomeric flavanols-(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were identified in methanol extracts of the callus strain 1, the amount of which increased at the end of the passage. Calluses of the low-producing strain 2 are characterized by the formation of only (-)-epicatechin, the amount of which did not change during their growth and did not depend on the intensity of light exposure. All this indicates significant differences in the accumulation of flavanols in the two strains of tea callus cultures and their response to light of different intensities.

AB  - Salvia species have a longstanding traditional culinary use, mostly being consumed in the Mediterranean diet as a common herb added to food. Salvia is commonly consumed as a herbal tea for memory enhancement. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia affecting people worldwide Therefore, the current research aimed to investigate potential therapeutic benefits of Salvia officinalis (SOL) cultivated in Jordan and Salvia microphylla (SML) cultivated in Egypt with regard to acetylcholinesterase activity, beta-amyloid deposition and oxidative stress associated with scopolamine-induced AD. Metabolite profiling of the ethanol extracts of SOL and SML was performed using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Methyl carnosate, carnosic acid, carnosol, rosmanol and salvianolic acids were the major secondary metabolites identified in SOL and SML extracts. In our study, scopolamine (1.14 mg kg(-1), i.p.) was administered for 7 consecutive days to induce memory impairment in rats. SML and SOL (150 and 300 mg kg(-1), p.o.) were tested for their effects to reduce the scopolamine-induced deficits. Donepezil (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.p.) was used as a positive control. Scopolamine induced histopathological changes in rats' prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in addition to beta-amyloid plaque deposition. Furthermore, scopolamine treatment promoted oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase activity. On the other hand, treatment with Salvia extracts corrected the histological changes induced by scopolamine and significantly reduced beta-amyloid deposition. Moreover, both oxidative stress markers and acetylcholinesterase activity were ameliorated by Salvia treatment. Using virtual docking to the active sites of the human acetylcholinesterase crystal structure, salvianolic acid K, rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid C showed the best fitting binding modes to active sites of acetylcholinesterase. Accordingly, the present study demonstrates the beneficial effects of Salvia species from Egypt and Jordan against scopolamine-induced AD-like disorder.

AB  - Right ventricular (RV) failure is a common complication in multiple congenital heart disease (CHD), significantly increasing morbidity and mortality. Despite its impact, no therapies specifically target the failing RV. The growing population of CHD patients underscores the need to understand the pathophysiology of RV failure through preclinical research. This study aimed to develop an ovine model of RV failure induced by pressure and volume overload. A total of 14 juvenile sheep randomly underwent pulmonary artery banding (n = 6), pulmonary leaflet perforation (n = 4), and pulmonary annulotomy with transannular patching (TAP) (n = 4). Detailed anesthetic and surgical protocols were described, and intraoperative and early postoperative complications were evaluated. Acute RV pressure overload resulted in a 120% increase in RV pressure (p = 0.0312). The stroke volume index and cardiac index significantly declined (p = 0.0312), and there was a significant decrease in ScvO2 (p = 0.0312). Both TAP and leaflet perforation achieved moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation. Both procedures led to an incremental trend in RV pressures and resulted in a 24% increase in the stroke volume index. All techniques demonstrated safety and feasibility, with low mortality. This comprehensive model could be reproducible in other large animal models, offering a robust platform for preclinical research into CHD-RV failure models.

AB  - Social isolation has emerged as a significant issue during the COVID-19 pandemic that can adversely impact human mental health and potentially lead to pathological aggression. Given the lack of effective therapeutic interventions for aggressive behavior, alternative approaches are necessary. In this study, we utilized a genetic method combined with a pharmacological approach to identify and demonstrate the crucial role of Cdk5 in escalated intermale attack behavior induced by 2-week social isolation. Moreover, we developed a small peptide that effectively disrupts the interaction between Cdk5 and GluN2B, given the known involvement of this complex in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Administration of the peptide, either systemically or via intrahippocampal injection, significantly reduced oxidative stress in the hippocampus and attenuated intermale attack behavior induced by 2-week social isolation. These findings highlight the previously unknown role of the hippocampal Cdk5-GluN2B complex in social isolation-induced aggressive behavior in mice and propose the peptide as a promising therapeutic strategy for regulating attack behavior and oxidative stress.

AB  - A large amount of lignocellulosic waste is generated every day in the world, and their accumulation in the agroecosystems, integration in soil compositions, or incineration for energy production has severe environmental pollution effects. Using enzymes as biocatalysts for the biodegradation of lignocellulosic materials, especially in harsh processing conditions, is a practical step towards green energy and environmental biosafety. Hence, the current study focuses on enzyme computationally screened from camel rumen metagenomics data as specialized microbiota that have the capacity to degrade lignocellulosic-rich and recalcitrant materials. The novel hyperthermostable xylanase named PersiXyn10 with the performance at extreme conditions was proper activity within a broad temperature (30-100 degrees C) and pH range (4.0-11.0) but showed the maximum xylanolytic activity in severe alkaline and temperature conditions, pH 8.0 and temperature 90 degrees C. Also, the enzyme had highly resistant to metals, surfactants, and organic solvents in optimal conditions. The introduced xylanase had unique properties in terms of thermal stability by maintaining over 82% of its activity after 15 days of incubation at 90 degrees C. Considering the crucial role of hyperthermostable xylanases in the paper industry, the PersiXyn10 was subjected to biodegradation of paper pulp. The proper performance of hyperthermostable PersiXyn10 on the paper pulp was confirmed by structural analysis (SEM and FTIR) and produced 31.64 g/L of reducing sugar after 144 h hydrolysis. These results proved the applicability of the hyperthermostable xylanase in biobleaching and saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass for declining the environmental hazards.

AB  - African trypanosomes are the causative agents of neglected tropical diseases affecting both humans and livestock. Disease control is highly challenging due to an increasing number of drug treatment failures. African trypanosomes are extracellular, blood-borne parasites that mainly rely on glycolysis for their energy metabolism within the mammalian host. Trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes are therefore of interest for the development of trypanocidal drugs. Here, we report the serendipitous discovery of a camelid single-domain antibody (sdAb aka Nanobody) that selectively inhibits the enzymatic activity of trypanosomatid (but not host) pyruvate kinases through an allosteric mechanism. By combining enzyme kinetics, biophysics, structural biology, and transgenic parasite survival assays, we provide a proof-of-principle that the sdAb-mediated enzyme inhibition negatively impacts parasite fitness and growth.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues have been commercialized for the management of type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have underscored GLP-1's role as a modulator of alcohol-related behavior. However, the role of the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide on alcohol-withdrawal responses have not been fully elucidated. Liraglutide binds to the G-protein-coupled receptor and activates an adenylyl cyclase and the associated classic growth factor signaling pathway, which acts growth factor-like and neuroprotective properties. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms of liraglutide on alcohol withdrawal remains unknown. This study endeavored to explore the effects of liraglutide on the emotion and memory ability of alcohol-withdrawal mice, and synaptic morphology in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HP), and thus affects the relapse-like drinking of alcohol-withdrawal mice. The alcohol-withdrawal group was reintroduced to a 20% v/v alcohol and water through the two-bottle choice for four consecutive days, a period referred to as alcohol re-drinking. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to a regimen of 20% alcohol and water for a duration of 6 weeks. This regimen established the two-bottle choice model of alcohol exposure. Learning capabilities, memory proficiency, and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated using the Morris water maze, open field, and elevated plus maze paradigms. Furthermore, synaptic morphology and the levels of synaptic transport-related proteins were assessed via Golgi staining and Western Blot analysis after a two-week alcohol deprivation period. Alcohol re-drinking of alcohol-withdrawal mice was also evaluated using a two-bottle choice paradigm. Our findings indicate that liraglutide can substantially decrease alcohol consumption and preference (p < 0.05) in the alcohol group and enhance learning and memory performance (p < 0.01), as well as alleviate anxiety-like behavior (p < 0.01) of alcohol-withdrawal mice. Alcohol consumption led to a reduction in dendritic spine density in the mPFC and HP, which was restored to normal levels by liraglutide (p < 0.001). Furthermore, liraglutide was found to augment the levels of synaptic transport-related proteins in mice subjected to alcohol withdrawal (p < 0.01). The study findings corroborate that liraglutide has the potential to mitigate alcohol consumption and ameliorate the memory impairments and anxiety induced by alcohol withdrawal. The therapeutic efficacy of liraglutide might be attributed to its role in counteracting synapse loss in the mPFC and HP regions and thus prevented relapse-like drinking in alcohol-withdrawal mice.

AB  - Inflammation is associated with depressive symptoms and innate immune mechanisms are likely causal in some cases of major depression. Systemic inflammation also perturbs brain function and microstructure, though how these are related remains unclear. We recruited N = 46 healthy controls, and N = 83 depressed cases stratified by CRP (> 3 mg/L: N = 33; < 3 mg/L: N = 50). All completed clinical assessment, venous blood sampling for C-reactive protein (CRP) assay, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Micro-structural MRI parameters including proton density (PD), a measure of tissue water content, were measured at 360 cortical and 16 subcortical regions. Resting-state fMRI time series were correlated to estimate functional connectivity between individual regions, as well as the sum of connectivity (weighted degree) of each region. Multiple tests for regional analysis were controlled by the false discovery rate (FDR = 5%). We found that CRP was significantly associated with PD in precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (pC/pCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); and with functional connectivity between pC/pCC, mPFC and hippocampus. Depression was associated with reduced weighted degree of pC/pCC, mPFC, and other nodes of the default mode network (DMN). Thus CRP-related increases in proton density-a plausible marker of extracellular oedema-and changes in functional connectivity were anatomically co-localised with DMN nodes that also demonstrated significantly reduced hubness in depression. We suggest that effects of peripheral inflammation on DMN node micro-structure and connectivity may mediate inflammatory effects on depression.

AB  - Research question: Membrane lipid replacement (MLR) of oxidized membrane lipids can restore sperm cellular membrane functionality and help improve surface protein stability during cryopreservation. What are the effects of MLR with nano-micelles made from a glycerophospholipid (GPL) mixture and cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin (CLC), on the cryosurvival and expression of acrosome-related proteins in thawed human spermatozoa? Design: Twenty samples were used to determine the optimum level of nano-micelles by incubation of semen with different concentrations of GPL (0.1 and 1%) and CLC (1 and 2 mg/ml) (including GPL-0.1, GPL-1, CLC-1, CLC-2, CLC-1/GPL-0.1, CLC-2/GPL-0.1, CLC-1/GPL-1 and CLC-2/GPL-1) before cryopreservation. Then, 30 semen samples were collected, and each sample was divided into the following three aliquots: fresh, frozen control and frozen incubated with optimum level of nano-micelles (0.1% GPL and 1 mg/ml CLC). Results: CLC-1/GPL-0.1 and GPL-0.1 significantly increased motility parameters. CLC-1, GPL-0.1 and CLC-1/GPL-0.1 significantly improved viability rate compared with frozen control group. Significantly higher mitochondrial activity and acrosome integrity, and a lower rate of apoptosis, were observed in the CLC-1/GPL-0.1 compared with the frozen control group. The expression ratios of arylsulfatase A (ARSA), serine protease 37 (PRSS37), serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 2 (SPINK2) and equatorin (EQTN) significantly increased compared with the frozen control group. Conclusions: Modification of membrane cholesterol and GPL mixtures in spermatozoa enhances their acrosome protein integrity by inhibiting early apoptotic changes and spontaneous acrosome reactions.

AB  - The present study was aimed to investigate the curative effects of Typha elephantina (T.E) leaves methanolic extract on bioaccumulation of heavy metals along with blood and biochemical variables in Cyprinus carpio (common carp).The heavy metals such as Zn, Ni, Cd and Cr were examined in Muscle, liver, gills, skin and intestine while complete hematology, lipid profile and some liver and kidney related biochemical parameters were analyzed The fish were first exposed to MgCl2 and then treated with extract of T.E alone and along with ascorbic acid. The results showed that all the tissues accumulate the substitutional amount of heavy metals. The accumulation of ZN was highest and Ni come second followed by Cr and in the last and least was Cd respectively i.e Zn > Ni > Cd >Cr. This accumulation was differential in each organ studied such as in the skin the accumulation was highest while in intestine it was high and followed by gills then muscles tissues. However the accumulation was least in the liver tissues. Analysis of blood and serum indices showed that extract alone (group 2) has no effect while the co admiration of extract and ascorbic acid (group 3) significantly ameliorates the altered hematological and biochemical parameters toward normal levels when compared to normal control fish (group 1).

AB  - Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a cardioprotective neuropeptide expressing its receptors in the cardiovascular system. The aim of our study was to examine tissue PACAP-38 in a translational porcine MI model and plasma PACAP-38 levels in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Significantly lower PACAP-38 levels were detected in the non-ischemic region of the left ventricle (LV) in MI heart compared to the ischemic region of MI-LV and also to the Sham-operated LV in porcine MI model. In STEMI patients, plasma PACAP-38 level was significantly higher before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to controls, and decreased after PCI. Significant negative correlation was found between plasma PACAP-38 and troponin levels. Furthermore, a significant effect was revealed between plasma PACAP-38, hypertension and HbA1c levels. This was the first study showing significant changes in cardiac tissue PACAP levels in a porcine MI model and plasma PACAP levels in STEMI patients. These results suggest that PACAP, due to its cardioprotective effects, may play a regulatory role in MI and could be a potential biomarker or drug target in MI.

AB  - The Hippo pathway plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation during tumorigenesis, tissue homeostasis and early embryogenesis. Scaffold proteins from the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family, including neurofibromin 2 (NF2; Merlin), regulate the Hippo pathway through cell polarity. However, the mechanisms underlying Hippo pathway regulation via cell polarity in establishing outer cells remain unclear. In this study, we generated artificial Nf2 mutants in the N-terminal FERM domain (L64P) and examined Hippo pathway activity by assessing the subcellular localization of YAP1 in early embryos expressing these mutant mRNAs. The L64P-Nf2 mutant inhibited NF2 localization around the cell membrane, resulting in YAP1 cytoplasmic translocation in the polar cells. L64P-Nf2 expression also disrupted the apical centralization of both large tumor suppressor 2 (LATS2) and ezrin in the polar cells. Furthermore, Lats2 mutants in the FERM binding domain (L83K) inhibited YAP1 nuclear translocation. These findings demonstrate that NF2 subcellular localization mediates cell polarity establishment involving ezrin centralization. This study provides previously unreported insights into how the orchestration of the cell-surface components, including NF2, LATS2 and ezrin, modulates the Hippo pathway during cell polarization.

AB  - Generalization around aversive stimuli is a key feature of learning and adaptive decision making,1-5 but it can be maladaptive if subjects overgeneralize and respond with fear to stimuli that are only loosely similar to the original experience.6-12 Human imaging studies indicate that the amygdala, a hub of emotional learning, is involved in such overgeneralization,2,9,13-17 and studies in animal models revealed neural correlates of generalized aversive stimuli and identified changes in response properties of single neurons.18-29 Yet, it remains unclear if human neurons contribute specifically in aversive situations and, importantly, if they contribute to subsequent behavior even in a safe environment. We recorded single neurons in human subjects while they engaged in probabilistic loss/gain conditioning, followed by a choice task that included additional stimuli and when the original conditioned stimulus no longer entails an aversive (loss) outcome. We find wider behavioral generalization around the aversive stimulus accompanied by a selective increase in amygdala neural responses that were correlated with the degree of individual generalization. In addition, neural activity in the amygdala was predictive of the later choice on a trial-by-trial basis and specific to loss trials. Whereas other brain regions also modulated their activity during generalization, only amygdala neurons signal a trial- specific and loss-specific generalization. The findings reveal that human amygdala neurons play a role in aversive overgeneralization and contribute to generalized choice behavior in a later safe environment and suggest a single-neuron substrate that might enhance anxious and traumatic behaviors.

AB  - Neurons provide a rich setting for studying post-transcriptional control. Here, we investigate the landscape of translational control in neurons and search for mRNA features that explain differences in translational efficiency (TE), considering the interplay between TE, mRNA poly(A)-tail lengths, microRNAs, and neuronal activation. In neurons and brain tissues, TE correlates with tail length, and a few dozen mRNAs appear to undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation upon light or chemical stimulation. However, the correlation between TE and tail length is modest, explaining <5% of TE variance, and even this modest relationship diminishes when accounting for other mRNA features. Thus, tail length appears to affect TE only minimally. Accordingly, miRNAs, which accelerate deadenylation of their mRNA targets, primarily influence target mRNA levels, with no detectable effect on either steady-state tail lengths or TE. Larger correlates with TE include codon composition and predicted mRNA folding energy. When combined in a model, the identified correlates explain 38%-45% of TE variance. These results provide a framework for considering the relative impact of factors that contribute to translational control in neurons. They indicate that when examined in bulk, translational control in neurons largely resembles that of other types of post-embryonic cells. Thus, detection of more specialized control might require analyses that can distinguish translation occurring in neuronal processes from that occurring in cell bodies.

AB  - Objective and designNeuroinflammation is a protective mechanism but can become harmful if chronic and/or unregulated, leading to neuronal damage and cognitive alterations. Limiting inflammation and promoting resolution could be achieved with nutrients such as grapes and blueberries polyphenols, saffron carotenoids, and omega-3, which have anti-inflammatory and proresolutive properties.MethodsThis study explored the impact of 18-day supplementation with plant extracts (grape, blueberry and saffron), omega-3 or both (mix) on neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 250 mu g/kg) in 149 mice at different time points post-LPS treatment (30 min, 2 h, 6 h). Inflammatory, oxidative and neuroprotective gene expression; oxylipin quantification; and fatty acid composition were analyzed at each time point. PCA analysis was performed with all these biomarkers.ResultsMix supplementation induced changes in the resolution of inflammation. In fact, the production of proinflammatory mediators in the hippocampus started earlier in the supplemented group than in the LPS group. Pro-resolving mediators were also found in higher quantities in supplemented mice. These changes were associated with increased hippocampal antioxidant status at 6 h post-LPS.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that such dietary interventions with plant extracts, and omega-3 could be beneficial in preventing neuroinflammation and, consequently, age-related cognitive decline. Further research is needed to explore the effects of these supplements on chronic inflammation in the context of aging.

AB  - We report the effects of varying physiological and other properties on the heat and water exchange in the maxilloturbinate structure (MT) of the bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus or Eb) in realistic environments, using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. We find that the water retention in percent is very high (about 90 %) and relatively unaffected by either cold (-30 degrees C) or warm (10 degrees C) conditions. The retention of heat is also high, around 80 % . Based on a consideration of entropy production by the maxilloturbinate system, we show that anatomical and physiological properties of the seal provide good conditions for heat and water exchange at the mucus lining in the seal's nasal cavity. At normal values of tidal volume and maxilloturbinate (MT) length, the air temperature in the MT reaches the body temperature before the air has left the MT channels. This confers a safety factor which is expected to be helpful in exercise, when ventilation increases.

AB  - Aging is associated with a general decline in cognitive functions, which appears to be due to alterations in the amounts of proteins involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of proteins involved in neurotransmission in three brain regions, namely, the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, in mice aged 1 and 22 months, using the total protein approach technique. We demonstrate that although the titer of some proteins involved in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity is affected by aging in a similar manner in all the studied brain formations, in fact, each of the formations represents its own mode of aging. Generally, the hippocampal and cortical proteomes are much more unstable during the lifetime than the cerebellar proteome. The data presented here provide a general picture of the effect of physiological aging on synaptic plasticity and might suggest potential drug targets for anti-aging therapies.

AB  - Coxiellosis, a widely dispersed zoonotic disease due to Coxiella burnetii, serve as a key trade barrier and adversely influence the productive and reproductive potential of animals. The current investigation was designed to determine the selective hemato-biochemical variations in dromedary camels due to subclinical coxiellosis. The study encompassed two groups viz, one group of 20 C. burnetii positive camel identified by Real time PCR and second group of 20 healthy camels (Real time PCR negative) used as control. The student t-test demonstrated significant (p<0.05) rise in packed cell volume (36.30 +/- 0.32%), hemoglobin (15.57 +/- 0.32g/dL), neutrophils (71.03 +/- 0.58%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (86.19 +/- 0.78mm/hr), creatinine (2.13 +/- 0.08mg/dl), urea (69.30 +/- 1.14mg/dl), blood urea nitrogen (32.38 +/- 0.62mg/dl), gamma-glutamyl transferase (11.66 +/- 0.63 mu/L), aspartate aminotransferase (70.63 +/- 0.65 mu/L), alkaline phosphatase (94.10 +/- 0.89 mu/L) and calcium (9.48 +/- 0.39mg/dl). On the other hand, a significant decline (p<0.05) in WBC count (11.94 +/- 0.04), eosinophils% (3.10 +/- 0.20), basophils% (0.76 +/- 0.06), platelets count (103.2 +/- 0.56103 mu/l), glucose (55.13 +/- 0.84mg/dl), albumin (4.25 +/- 0.01g/dl) and sodium (110.26 +/- 1.21mEq/L) were observed in infected camels. This investigation demonstrated significant differences in hematological and serum biochemical variables of infected and healthy camels. Moreover, to set a reference line of blood variables for the detection of coxiellosis in camels additional investigations are obligatory.

AB  - Objective. To explore the molecular mechanism of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity and to determine whether lncRNA HOXA11-AS affects sevoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis and inflammation by regulating miR-98-5p/EphA4. Methods. Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to detect the learning and memory ability of rats, HE staining was used to observe hippocampal pathology, TUNEL staining was used to detect the level of neuronal apoptosis, and RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of HOXA11-AS, miR-98-5p, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. At the same time, the contents of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha in serum were detected by ELISA. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins EphA4, Bax, Cleaved caspase 3, and Bcl-2 were detected by Western blot. The dual-luciferase gene reporter verified the targeting relationship between HOXA11-AS and miR-98-5p and the targeting relationship between miR-98-5p and EphA4. Results. The expression of HOXA11-AS was observed in sevoflurane-treated rats or cells and promoted neuronal apoptosis and inflammation. HOXA11-AS was knocked out alone, or miR-98-5p was overexpressed which attenuates neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory inflammation after sevoflurane treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of HOXA11-AS alone was partially restored by knockdown of miR-98-5p or overexpression of EphA4. Conclusion. Inhibition of lncRNA HOXA11-AS attenuates sevoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory responses via miR-98-5p/EphA4.

AB  - Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) with twelve FDA approved drugs, known as a novel category of anti-neoplastic treatment created to merge the monoclonal antibody specificity with cytotoxicity effect of chemotherapy. However, despite many undeniable advantages, ADCs face certain problems, including insufficient internalization after binding, complex structures and large size of full antibodies especially in targeting of solid tumors. Camelid single domain antibody fragments (Nanobody (R)) offer solutions to this challenge by providing nanoscale size, high solubility and excellent stability, recombinant expression in bacteria, in vivo enhanced tissue penetration, and conjugation advantages. Here, an anti-human CD22 Nanobody was expressed in E.coli cells and conjugated to Mertansine (DM1) as a cytotoxic payload. The anti-CD22 Nanobody was expressed and purified by Ni-NTA resin. DM1 conjugated anti-CD22 Nanobody was generated by conjugation of SMCC-DM1 to Nanobody lysine groups. The conjugates were characterized using SDS-PAGE and Capillary electrophoresis (CE-SDS), RP-HPLC, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis and a competition ELISA were carried out for binding evaluation. Finally, cytotoxicity of conjugates on Raji and Jurkat cell lines was assessed. The drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of conjugates was calculated 2.04 using UV spectrometry. SDS-PAGE, CE-SDS, HPLC, and mass spectrometry confirmed conjugation of DM1 to the Nanobody. The obtained results showed the anti-CD22 Nanobody cytotoxicity was enhanced almost 80% by conjugation with DM1. The binding of conjugates was similar to the non-conjugated anti-CD22 Nanobody in flow cytometry experiments. Concludingly, this study successfully suggest that the DM1 conjugated anti-CD22 Nanobody can be used as a novel tumor specific drug delivery system.

AB  - Mounting evidence indicates that immune dysfunction may contribute to the neurobiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) were recently reckoned pivotally to regulate NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in microglia. Pinocembrin, one of the primary flavonoids from Pinus heartwood and Eucalyptus, has been studied in various animal models of human disease with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Herein, we investigated the potential antineuroinflammatory effects of pinocembrin on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like behavior. Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to CUMS for 4 weeks, treatment group was injected with pinocembrin at a dose of 20 mg/kg. After the stress procedure, behavioral tests, including sucrose preference tests (SPTs) and tail suspension tests (TSTs) were performed to evaluate depressive-like phenotype. Subsequently, the expression of cytokines and microglia-related inflammatory biomarkers were assessed. In the study, we found that pinocembrin significantly blocked the declination of SPT percentage and the extension of TST immobility durations in the depression mouse model. Also, we observed that pinocembrin significantly suppressed microglial activation in the hippocampus. Additionally, pinocembrin downregulated hippocampal NLRP3 through P2X7/TLR4 pathway, and also regulated the CUMS-induced imbalance of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. In conclusion, pinocembrin ameliorates CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors possibly through downregulating P2X7/TLR4 pathway, providing the mechanism of antidepressant treatment.

AB  - . Allium ampeloprasum var. holmense (elephant garlic) is traditionally cultivated in "Val di Chiana", an area between Umbria and Tuscany regions of Central Italy, under the name "Aglione della Valdichiana". This product has recently increased in importance, becoming a key economic resource for local farmers. In 2019, phytosanitary problems of elephant garlic cloves ready for transplanting emerged in this cultivation area. Symptom/sign observations and fungal isolations were performed for cloves divided into four components (tunic, basal plate, reserve tissue and shoot) from six farms in the "Val di Chiana" area. Isolates obtained were identified, using partial beta-tubulin ( BenA ) and calmodulin ( CaM ) or translation elongation factor 1 alpha ( tef1 alpha ) genes sequences, as belonging to Penicillium [ P. allii (95%), P. citrinum (4%), P. brevicompactum (1%)] or Fusarium [ F. oxysporum (81%), F. proliferatum (19%)]. Fusarium spp. were mainly associated with clove tunics and basal plates, while Penicillium spp. with basal plates, reserve tissues and shoots. Fungi often also developed from asymptomatic components, but a correlation was found between isolated pathogens and disease symptoms. Pathogenicity and virulence towards elephant garlic cloves were verified for a representative isolate of each identified species, and Penicillium allii was the most virulent. Strategies to control Fusarium and Penicillium spp. on cloves were assessed, including chemicals, a biocontrol agent, surface sterilization and heat treatment. Among these, treatments with Patriot Gold (R) (active ingredient [a.i.] Trichoderma asperellum TV1, approved in organic farming on crops similar to elephant garlic), or Signum (R) (a.i. boscalid + pyraclostrobin, approved for Integrated Pest Management systems on crops similar to elephant garlic), were effective in simultaneous reduction of Penicillium spp. and Fusarium spp. Transplanting of asymptomatic cloves combined with the use of the above treatments showed promising effects for pathogens control, and to assist elephant garlic crop establishment.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal, exerts deleterious effects on neuronal survival and cognitive function. NOD like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis has been linked to Cd-induced cytotoxicity. The current research intended to elucidate the role of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in Cd-evoked neuronal death and cognitive impairments and the underlying mechanisms. Exposure to 1 mg/kg Cd for 8 weeks led to hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits and neural/synaptic damage in mice. NLRP3 inflammasome-related protein expression (NLRP3, ASC, and caspase1 p20) and neuronal pyroptosis were significantly upregulated in Cd-treated hippocampi and SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, pretreatment with the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 mitigated Cd-elicited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent neuronal pyroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, exposure to Cd downregulated Sirt3 expression, suppressed SOD2 activity by hyperacetylation, and enhanced mtROS accumulation in vivo and in vitro. Notably, Cd-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent neuronal pyroptosis was attenuated by a mtROS scavenger or Sirt3 overexpression in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, Cd failed to further suppress SOD activity and activate NLRP3 inflammasome dependent neuronal pyroptosis in Sirt3 shRNA-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that Cd exposure induces neuronal injury and cognitive deficits by activating NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent neuronal pyroptosis and that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is partially mediated by the Sirt3-mtROS axis.

AB  - Simple Summary Firmly squeezing the chests of newborn foals and calves that are showing abnormal behaviours after birth causes them to enter a less-responsive state, characterised by lying down with eyes closed and no limb movements. Once the squeeze is removed, the newborns immediately 'wake up' and begin to display more normal behaviours. This response to the thoracic squeeze has also been observed in healthy, normally behaving foals. However, no studies have looked at the effects of the thoracic squeeze in healthy newborns of other mammalian species. We aimed to characterise the behavioural responses of healthy newborn piglets to a thoracic squeeze using the following two methods: a soft fabric rope, or a purpose-made inflation cuff. Behavioural data indicated that all piglets initially became less responsive, with reduced or absent reflex responses to a toe pinch or touch of the eyelid observed in over half of the piglets. The piglets squeezed with the inflation cuff appeared to enter a less-responsive state faster than the piglets squeezed with the rope. These findings suggest that the piglets responded to the thoracic squeeze in a similar way to healthy foals and that this may be a response conserved across multiple precocial mammalian species. Furthermore, the squeeze was found to be safe for inducing a less-responsive state in healthy piglets. This study provides a foundation for exploring the mechanisms underlying the responses to the thoracic squeeze and potential applications whilst performing husbandry procedures. A thoracic squeeze has been observed to cause both healthy and low vigour neonatal foals to enter a 'less-responsive state', characterised by loss of posture, eye closure and cessation of movement, from which they rapidly recover to express normal healthy behaviours when the squeeze is released. To date, there have been no systematic studies characterising the responses of healthy neonates of other mammalian species to a thoracic squeeze. We describe the responses of healthy newborn piglets (n = 17) to a standardised application of the thoracic squeeze and evaluate the effect of the method of squeeze application on the response. Neonatal piglets were squeezed around the chest with either a soft fabric rope as has been used in foals (n = 8) or a novel purpose-made inflation cuff (n = 9). Both methods were effective at inducing a less-responsive behavioural state in all piglets, with neural reflexes reduced or absent in over half of them. The inflation cuff appeared to induce the less-responsive state faster than the rope, and more piglets squeezed with the cuff remained in this state for the full 10-min squeeze. These findings suggest that the behavioural response of foals to thoracic squeezing can be generalised to neonates of other precocial mammalian species. This initial study provides a foundation for further research using the inflation cuff to explore mechanisms underlying the thoracic squeeze and ways in which it may be applied whilst performing husbandry procedures.

AB  - Among the responses in the early stages of stroke, activation of neurodegenerative and proinflammatory processes in the hippocampus is of key importance for the development of negative post-ischemic functional consequences. However, it remains unclear, what genes are involved in these processes. The aim of this work was a comparative study of the expression of genes encoding glutamate and GABA transporters and receptors, as well as inflammation markers in the hippocampus one day after two types of middle cerebral artery occlusion (according to Koizumi et al. method, MCAO-MK, and Longa et al. method, MCAO-ML), and direct pro-inflammatory activation by central administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Differences and similarities in the effects of these challenges on gene expression were observed. Expression of a larger number of genes associated with activation of apoptosis and neuroinflammation, glutamate reception, and markers of the GABAergic system changed after the MCAO-ML and LPS administration than after the MCAO-MK. Compared with the MCAO-ML, the MCAO-MK and LPS challenges caused changes in the expression of more genes involved in glutamate transport. The most pronounced difference between the responses to different challenges was the changes in expression of calmodulin and calmodulin-dependent kinases genes observed after MCAO, especially MCAO-ML, but not after LPS. The revealed specific features of the hippocampal gene responses to the two types of ischemia and a pro-inflammatory stimulus could contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying diversity of the post-stroke consequences both in the model studies and in the clinic.

AB  - Simple Summary
   This study focused on human negative emotions (fear and disgust) evoked by animals and aimed to find the most fear- and disgust-eliciting species/morphotypes across the animal kingdom. The examined stimuli included the top-scoring animals from previous experiments (two sets of 34 pictures). These were evaluated by Central European respondents representing WEIRD societies (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic). The respondents ranked the stimuli according to both elicited emotions. The results show that the most feared animals are mostly large vertebrates, such as carnivorans (bear, lion, tiger, etc.), ungulates (rhinoceros, hippopotamus, etc.), sharks, and crocodiles. Smaller fear-evoking vertebrates are represented by snakes, and invertebrates are represented by spiders and scorpions. The most disgust-evoking animals are human endo- and ectoparasites (e.g., tapeworm and tick) or animals visually resembling them (e.g., earthworm). A deeper understanding of negative emotions and the differences between fear and disgust elicited by animals might also help in nature conservation efforts, so that we know what factors or features may affect a negative attitude toward certain animals.
   Animals have always played an important role in our everyday life. They are given more attention than inanimate objects, which have been adaptive during the evolution of mankind, with some animal species still presenting a real threat to us. In this study, we focused on the species usually evaluated as the scariest and most disgusting in the animal kingdom. We analyzed which characteristics (e.g., weight, potential threat for humans) influence their evaluation in a nonclinical Central European WEIRD population (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic). The tested animals were divided into two separated sets containing 34 standardized photos evoking predominantly one negative emotion, fear or disgust. The pictures were ranked according to their emotional intensity by 160 adult respondents with high inter-rater agreement. The most fear-eliciting species are mostly large vertebrates (e.g., carnivorans, ungulates, sharks, crocodiles), whereas smaller fear-evoking vertebrates are represented by snakes and invertebrates are represented by arachnids. The most disgust-evoking animals are human endo- and ectoparasites or animals visually resembling them. Humans emotionally react to fear-evoking animals that represent a real threat; however, identifying truly dangerous disgust-evoking animals might be harder. The results also support a somewhat special position of snakes and spiders.

AB  - Major burdens for patients suffering from stroke are cognitive co-morbidities and epileptogenesis. Neural network disinhibition and deficient inhibitive pulses for fast network activities may result from impaired presynaptic release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. To test this hypothesis, a cortical photothrombotic stroke was induced in Sprague Dawley rats, and inhibitory currents were recorded seven days later in the peri-infarct blood-brain barrier disrupted (BBBd) hippocampus via patch-clamp electrophysiology in CA1 pyramidal cells (PC). Miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) frequency was reduced to about half, and mIPSCs decayed faster in the BBBd hippocampus. Furthermore, the paired-pulse ratio of evoked GABA release was increased at 100 Hz, and train stimulations with 100 Hz revealed that the readily releasable pool (RRP), usually assumed to correspond to the number of tightly docked presynaptic vesicles, is reduced by about half in the BBBd hippocampus. These pathophysiologic changes are likely to contribute significantly to disturbed fast oscillatory activity, like cognition-associated gamma oscillations or sharp wave ripples and epileptogenesis in the BBBd hippocampus.

AB  - Epilepsy is the most common neurological condition worldwide and is largely associated with memory impairment, both in human as well as animal models. Furthermore, differences in seizure onset and severity have already been observed between the sexes. The induction of epilepsy through multiple systemic injections of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a protocol known as chemical kindling, is a well-established tool for studies regarding epileptogenesis, as well as the efficacy of antiseizure medication. The aim of this study was to compare possible sex-related differences in seizure severity, memory, neuronal damage as well as the effects of the estrous cycle on seizure severity. Male (n = 10) and Female (n = 11) animals received 30 mg/kg i.p. injections three days a week for 6 weeks and, after the last application, were tested for short and long-term memory. Control, Male (n = 8) and Female (n = 5) groups did not receive PTZ injections. Although PTZ did not promote important changes into the estrous cycle phases throughout the entire experiment, female animals presented lower seizure scores but had both short and longterm memory impairments associated with cell loss in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate area. Male rats presented higher seizure scores associated with pronounced cell loss, but only long-term memory deficits. Our results demonstrate that the PTZ kindling protocol results in higher seizure scores with increased vulnerability in male rats, but female rats displayed more intense memory deficits.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A total of ninety-six weaned piglets were assigned to four dietary treatments in a 2 x 2 design. The treatments included: a standard milk formula (CTR); CTR + probiotics (6.4 x 108 cfu L-1Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 and 1.1 x 108 cfu L-1Lactobacillus rhamnosus NH001) + prebiotics (galacto-oligosaccharides 4.36 g L-1 and human-milk-oligosaccharide 0.54 g L-1) (SYN); CTR + osteopontin (0.43 g L-1) (OPN); and CTR + SYN + OPN (CON). Daily records including feed intake, body weight, and clinical signs, were maintained throughout the 15-day trial. At the end of the study samples from blood, digestive content, and gut tissues were collected to determine serum TNF-alpha, intestinal fermentative activity (SCFA and ammonia), colonic microbiota (16S rRNA Illumina-MiSeq), histomorphology, and jejunal gene expression (Open-Array). No statistical differences were found in weight gain; however, the animals supplemented with osteopontin exhibited higher feed intake. In terms of clinical signs, synbiotic supplementation led to a shorter duration of diarrhoea episodes. Regarding gut health, the sequenced faecal microbiota revealed better control of potentially dysbiotic bacteria with the CON diet at day 15. In the colon compartment, a significant increase in SCFA concentration, a decrease in ammonia concentration, and a significant decrease in intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were particularly observed in CON animals. The supplemented diets were also associated with modified jejunal gene expression. The synbiotic combination was characterized by the upregulation of genes related to intestinal maturation (ALPI, SI) and nutrient transport (SLC13A1, SLC15A1, SLC5A1, SLC7A8), and the downregulation of genes related to the response to pathogens (GBP1, IDO, TLR4) or the inflammatory response (IDO, IL-1 beta, TGF-beta 1). Osteopontin promoted the upregulation of a digestive function gene (GCG). Correlational analysis between the microbiota population and various intestinal environmental factors (SCFA concentration, histology, and gene expression) proposes mechanisms of communication between the gut microbiota and the host. In summary, these results suggest an improvement in the colonic colonization process and a better modulation of the immune response when milk formula is supplemented with the tested synbiotic combined with osteopontin, benefiting from a synergistic effect.
   Supplementation of synbiotic and osteopontin in milk formulas influences the establishment of intestinal microbiota and gene expression in the intestine.

AB  - Nanosilicon applications have been shown to increase plant defenses against both abiotic and biotic stresses. Silicon quantum nanodots (Si NDs), a form of nanosilicon, possess excellent biological and physiochemical properties (e.g., minimal size, high water solubility, stability, and biocompatibility), potentially making them more efficient in regulating plant responses to stress than other forms of silicon. However, to date, we still lack mechanistic evidence for how soil-applied Si NDs alter the regulation of plant physical and chemical defenses against insect herbivores. To address this gap, we compared the effect of fluorescent amine-functionalized Si NDs (5 nm) and the conventional fertilizer sodium silicate on maize (Zea mays L.) physical and chemical defenses against the oriental armyworm (Mythimna separata, Walker) caterpillars. We found that 50 mg/kg Si NDs and sodium silicate additions inhibited the growth of caterpillars the most (35.7% and 22.8%, respectively) as compared to other application doses (0, 10, and 150 mg/kg). Both Si NDs and silicate addition activated biosynthesis genes responsible for chemical (benzoxazinoids) and physical (lignin) defense production. Moreover, Si NDs upregulated the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and POD) and promoted the antioxidant metabolism (flavonoids) in maize leaves under M. separata attack. Finally, we show that, under field conditions, Si ND addition increased maize cob weight (28.7%), cob grain weight (40.8%), and 100-grain weight (26.5%) as compared to the control, and more so than the conventional silicon fertilizer. Altogether, our findings highlight the potential for Si NDs to be used as an effective and ecofriendly crop protection strategy in agroecosystems.

AB  - Melatonin (Mlt) confers potential antitumor effects in various types of cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of Mlt in the giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) remains unknown. Moreover, further research is required to assess whether Mlt can enhance the therapeutic effect of zoledronic acid (Zol), a commonly used anti-GCTB drug. In this research, we investigated the effects of Mlt, Zol, and the combination of these two drugs on GCTB cells' characteristics, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, osteogenic differentiation, migration, and invasion. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, alizarin red staining (ARS), scratch wound healing assay, and transwell experiment were performed, respectively. Our results showed that Mlt could effectively inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GCTB cells, as well as promote the apoptosis and osteogenic differentiation of tumor cells. Of note, a stronger antitumor effect was observed when Mlt was combined with Zol treatment. This therapeutic effect might be achieved by inhibiting the activation of both the Hippo and NF-KB pathways. In conclusion, our study suggests that Mlt can be a new treatment for GCTB, which could further enhance the antitumor effect of Zol.

KW  - GROWTH
AB  - The morbidity rate of ovarian cancer, a malignant tumour in gynaecological tumours, is rising, and it is considered to be the most lethal cancer. The majority of patients are typically diagnosed during the advanced stages of the illness due to the elusive characteristics of ovarian cancer and an absence of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic indicators. Surgical excision of the lesions, along with chemotherapy, is the conventional treatment for ovarian cancer; however, resistance to platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs and molecular targeted therapies frequently arises. Improving the survival rate and prognosis of patients with end-stage or recurring ovarian cancer requires the identification of new therapeutic targets due to the absence of efficient medications, and this has emerged as a highly demanding issue. Studies have demonstrated that ferroptosis effectively hinders the proliferation of ovarian cancer and induces the demise of malignant cells. Ferroptosis is composed of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system (the system Xc-) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2) play crucial roles in the regulation of ferroptosis by facilitating the uptake of cystine into cells and the efflux of glutamate out of cells, respectively. In cells, GPX4 is the exclusive enzyme employed for reducing liposomal peroxide through glutathione peroxidase activity. The occurrence of ferroptosis in ovarian cancer is strongly associated with three main pathways, namely, the GPX4-glutathione (GSH) protective pathway, the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)- coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) protective pathway, and the guanosine 5'-triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) protective pathway. In ovarian cancer cells, the postsynaptic density-95, discs-large, zona occludens 1 (PDZ)-binding motif-angiopoietin-like 4-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases 2 (TAZ-ANGPTL4-NOX2) pathway can be regulated by Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TAZ, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway, leading to the modulation of ferroptosis. By targeting microRNA-587, lncRNA ADAMTS9 antisense RNA 1 (ADAMTS9-AS1) can modulate the expression of SLC7A11 and reduce the occurrence of ferroptosis. Although ferroptosis holds promise in overcoming the resistance mechanism, there remain obstacles in utilizing it as a cancer treatment, including the potential harm of drugs to healthy cells. Hence, additional investigations are required to formulate safer and more efficient chemotherapy protocols for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other malignancies.

AB  - The echolocation calls emitted by stationary bats are characterised by their resting frequency (RF). The ecological role of RF has been widely discussed across the literature concerning the Rhinolophidae family, where it has been found that the RF may vary depending on many factors, although its role in shaping the variability of different populations remains unclear, and the data for many species - including Rhinolophus hipposideros - is scarce. In this study, we aimed to determine how sex, age and biometric parameters (body mass, forearm length and the body condition index) affected the RF in a R. hipposideros population and to investigate the individual variability in this parameter. Bats were captured in front of two Carpathian caves in Southern Poland during the mating season. The echolocation calls of the hand-held bats were recorded, and later their peak frequency was measured with computer software. The analyses showed higher RF values for females than for males, but (in contrast to previous reports) no differences between the age classes were identified. RF did not correlate with any biometric parameters in the studied population, which rules out the possibility of quality characteristic signalling through this parameter. However, we observed significant individual differences in RF within the sex-age groups, which might reflect some communication potential. The discrepancies among the research results available for this topic indicate the need for further studies aimed at investigating the variability of RF and its role across species distribution ranges and their phonology.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a viral disease in swine with a mortality rate of approximately 100%, threatening the global pig industry's economic development. However, vaccines are not yet commercially available, and other antiviral therapeutics, such as antiviral drugs, are urgently needed. In this study, berbamine hydrochloride, a natural bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Berberis amurensis, showed significant antiviral activity against ASFV. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of berbamine hydrochloride in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) was 27.89 mu M. The antiviral activity assay demonstrated that berbamine hydrochloride inhibits ASFV in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, a 4.14 log TCID50 decrease in the viral titre resulting from non-cytotoxic berbamine hydrochloride was found. Moreover, the antiviral activity of berbamine hydrochloride was maintained for 48h and took effect at multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 0.01, 0.1, and 1. The time-of-addition analysis revealed an inhibitory effect throughout the entire virus life-cycle. A subsequent viral entry assay verified that berbamine hydrochloride blocks the early stage of ASFV infection. Moreover, similar anti-ASFV activity of berbamine hydrochloride was also found in PK-15 and 3D4/21 cells. In summary, these results indicate that berbamine hydrochloride is an effective anti-ASFV natural product and may be considered a novel antiviral drug.

AB  - This experiment was to explore the possible defensive properties and potential molecular mechanisms of Camellia japonica (CJ) against APAP-stimulated acute liver failure (ALF) in mice. In this study, we investigated the effects of CJ on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. Mice were orally treated with CJ before or after challenge with APAP. Both pretreatment and post-treatment with CJ attenuated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, as confirmed by significantly reduced serum toxicity biomarkers and improved hepatic pathological damage. Pretreatment with CJ drastically decreased the rise of hepatic inflammatory cytokines levels and weakened neutrophil infiltration. Furthermore, pretreatment with CJ dramatically decreased the levels of hepatic oxidative stress markers such as hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) expression and rescued the reduced hepatic level of GSH caused by APAP overdose. Additionally, CJ pretreatment markedly attenuated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activation, transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) phosphorylation, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway in the liver. The present study thus reveals that CJ attenuated APAP-induced ALF by inhibiting COX-2 activation, NF-kappa B, and JNK phosphorylation and activating the AMPK signaling pathway.

AB  - Active recall of short-term memory (STM) is known to last for a few hours, but whether STM has long-term functions is unknown. Here we show that STM can be optogenetically retrieved at a time point during which natural recall is not possible, uncovering the long-term existence of an STM engram. Moreover, re-training within 3 days led to natural long-term recall, indicating facilitated consolidation. Inhibiting offline CA1 activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity, or protein synthesis after first exposure to the STM-forming event impaired the future re-exposure-facilitated consolidation, which highlights a role of protein synthesis, NMDAR and NREM sleep in the long-term storage of an STM trace. These results provide evidence that STM is not completely lost within hours and demonstrates a possible two-step STM consolidation, first long-term storage as a behaviorally inactive engram, then transformation into an active state by recurrence within 3 days.
   Short-term memory (STM) forms a protein synthesis-, NMDAR- and NREM sleep-dependent engram which lasts at least 3 days in the mouse hippocampus following a novel object location task, suggesting that STM is not completely lost within hours.

(FE), commonly known as the ash, belongs to the Oleaceae family and has shown several pharmacological and biological properties, such as antioxidant, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. It has also attracted the most attention toward neuroinflammation. Moreover, FE bark and leaves have been used to treat neurological disorders, aging, neuropathic pain, urinary complaints, and articular pain in traditional and ethnomedicine. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the involvement of amyloid-beta, metal-induced oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Aim of the study: The objective of the current study was to assess the neuroprotective effects of hydromethanolic extract from FE bark in an AlCl3-induced rat model of AD. Materials and methods: The maceration process was utilized to prepare the hydromethanolic extract of FE bark, and characterized by LC-MS/MS. To assess the anti -AD effects of the FE extract, rats were categorized into five different groups, AlCl3; normal control; FE-treated groups at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. Passive avoidance learning test, Y-maze, open field, and elevated plus maze behavioral tests were evaluated on days 7 and 14 to analyze the cognitive impairments. Zymography analysis, biochemical tests, and histopathological changes were also followed in different groups. Results: LC-MS/MS analysis indicated the presence of coumarins, including isofraxidin7-O-diglucoside in the methanolic extract of FE as a new isofraxidin derivative in this genus. FE significantly improved memory and cognitive function, maintained weight, prevented neuronal damages, and preserved the hippocampus's histological features, as demonstrated by behavioral tests and histopathological analysis. FE increased antiinflammatory MMP-2 activity, whereas it decreased that of inflammatory MMP-9. Moreover, FE increased plasma antioxidant capacity by enhancing CAT and GSH while decreasing nitrite levels in the serum of treated groups. In comparison between the treated groups, the rats that received high doses of the FE extract (200 mg/ kg) showed the highest therapeutic effect. Conclusion: FE rich in coumarins could be an effective anti -AD adjunct agent, passing through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways. These results encourage further studies for the development of this extract as a promising agent in preventing, managing, or treating AD and related diseases.

AB  - Mare milk, as well as fermented products produced from it, are recognized as having medicinal effects. Mare milk has been consumed for hundreds of years in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. In Europe it became popular in the 1990s. However, in many European countries, including Poland, the milking of mares remains marginal. Nevertheless, the group of consumers interested in purchasing mare milk is gradually growing. The horse population in Poland is about 300,000, of which half are cold-blooded horses. Native breeds of cold-blooded horses, including the Sokolski horse, are included in a genetic resources conservation programme. These horses are used in diverse ways, including for meat. For ethical and cultural reasons, however, the slaughter of horses is negatively perceived in Poland. An alternative to this type of use could be the acquisition of milk from mares. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the effect of selected factors (access to pasture, lactation number, and sex of the foal) on the proximate composition, whey protein profile, and fatty acid profile of milk from mares of the Sokolski breed. The results may be useful for those managing herds of Sokolski mares and other mares of cold-blooded breeds that are in good condition.
   This study assessed the effect of access to pasture, lactation number, and foals' sex on the nutritional value of milk (79 samples) from nine mares. The following were analysed: content of dry matter, protein, fat, lactose, and ash; percentages of alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-La), beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg), serum albumin (SA), immunoglobulins (Ig), lactoferrin (Lf), and lysozyme (Lz) in the total protein; and the fatty acid profile. Mares without access to pastures were shown to produce milk with a higher dry matter content, including fat, lactose, and ash; higher percentages of beta-Lg, alpha-La, Ig, and Lf; and a better fatty acid profile. The milk from mares with access to pasture contained more protein, including higher percentages of SA and Lz. Milk from mares in lactations 4-6 had the highest fat and protein concentrations and the lowest lactose concentration. The alpha-La level was highest in lactation 1, Lf in lactations 2-3, and Lz in lactations 4-6. Milk from mares in lactations 4-6 had the best fatty acid profile (the lowest concentration of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and the highest concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)). Milk from mothers of female offspring had higher dry matter, fat, and protein concentrations, a higher share of lysozyme, and a better fatty acid profile.

AB  - Several psychopathologies may be triggered, among other factors, by stress or trauma in childhood. The maternal deprivation model (MD) replicates some of the core factors that may induce the onset of different psychopathologies like structural and plasticity defects. Among other brain regions, the amygdala is susceptible to stress and trauma and plays a key role in integrating social behavior. Several molecules, such as Cerebrolysin (R) (CBL), have been used to treat different symptoms by reversing the underlying neurobiological plasticity-related changes. In this study, maternal deprivation (MD) was conducted on 9-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 28; 7 rats per group: Intact, Intact + CBL, MD, and MD + CBL). At 25 postnatal days (PND), CBL treatment was administered for 10 consecutive days, and social behavior was evaluated in a three-chamber social test at 35 PND. Moreover, Sholl analysis and immunohistochemistry were carried out for dendritic intersection and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) presence in the amygdala, respectively. CBL treatment had an augmentative effect on intact animals in terms of social behavior and incidences, but no differences between MD and CBL-treated animals. Moreover, dendritic intersections and BDNF decreased after the MD protocol but increased by CBL treatment in MD animals. Our results show that CBL could be part of the treatment in case of a traumatic or stressful event in neurodevelopment, especially in the youth age. According to this preclinical study, CBL could help reverse symptoms of different psychopathologies caused by stress or trauma, with neurobiological changes underlying its effect.

AB  - Background: The aetiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is multifactorial with a complex interplay between environmental, microbial endogenous and genetic factors. The impact of outdoor air pollution on prevalence or severity of CRS remains largely unknown.Methods: Real-life geolocation data (2017-2018, Belgium) from 278 CRS patients (2576 health records) using the mySinusitisCoach mobile application were analysed to calculate the patients' individual exposure to outdoor air pollutants (ozone (O-3), black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5)) and to associate these pollutants with the patients' sinus related symptoms measured at multiple occasions by visual analogue scale (VAS).Results: The adjusted seasonal model for the spring-summer (n = 1000 health entries, N = 83 patients) population revealed an increase of 6.07 (p < 0.0001) in overall CRS symptom scoring for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure to O-3 (26.9 mu g/m(3)). An increase of 1.69 (p = 0.05) in total CRS symptom scoring was observed for an IQR increase of PM2.5 (7.1 mu g/m(3)) exposure. Sex-stratified analysis in the spring-summer population showed significant interaction between air pollution and sex with male patients having higher total CRS symptom scores for an IQR increase in exposure to PM2.5 (3.52, p = 0.001), and O-3 (8.33, p < 0.0001), while no significant association with symptom severity was seen in the female patients. In the analysis stratified by comorbid asthma, CRS patients with comor-bid asthma had higher total CRS symptoms for an IQR increase in exposure to PM2.5 (2.58, p = 0.04) and O-3 (7.72, p < 0.0001) while the patients without comorbid asthma had no significant symptom increases.Conclusion: Exposure to outdoor air pollution is associated with increased symptom severity in CRS patients. The extent to which CRS patients are sensitive to outdoor air pollution exposure varies per season and depends on their sex and comorbid asthma status. mHealth technology has the potential to reveal novel insights on the patients' expo-some and disease severity in the real-life situation.

AB  - Tissue dissociation, a crucial step in single-cell sample preparation, can alter the transcriptional state of a sample through the intrinsic cellular stress response. Here we demonstrate a general approach for measuring transcriptional response during sample preparation. In our method, transcripts made during dissociation are labeled for later identification upon sequencing. We found general as well as cell-type-specific dissociation response programs in zebrafish larvae, and we observed sample-to-sample variation in the dissociation response of mouse cardiomyocytes despite well-controlled experimental conditions. Finally, we showed that dissociation of the mouse hippocampus can lead to the artificial activation of microglia. In summary, our approach facilitates experimental optimization of dissociation procedures as well as computational removal of transcriptional perturbation response.

AB  - Long-term adverse effects on human health are caused by exogenous compounds that alter the functions of biological systems, especially neuroendocrine disruptors like diethyl phthalate (DEP) and bisphenol S (BPS). Although vanillic acid (VA) has pertinent neuropharmacological characteristics, its effect against DEP + BPS-induced neurotoxicity has not been explored. This study proposed that VA may offer protection against the neurotoxicity caused by DEP + BPS. Thirty male Wistar rats were randomly distributed across five groups: a control group receiving DMSO, a group exposed to a mixture of BPS and DEP, two BPS + DEP-exposed groups treated with VA at doses of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg, and a nonexposed group treated with 50 mg VA/kg. After 21 days, the hippocampal tissues were processed for biochemical analyses. Our results indicate that exposure to DEP + BPS upregulated neurosignaling mediators (NTPDase, ADA, MAO-A, and Ca2+), inhibited others (AChE and Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase), decreased hippocampus antioxidants (GSH, GPx, CAT, and SOD), and elevated markers of oxidative stress/damage (NO, H2O2, MDA, and AOPP). AR, BAX, TNF-alpha, BAK1, and IL-1 beta expressions were upregulated, while IL-10 and BDNF expressions were downregulated. NF-kappa B and caspase-3/9 pathways were also upregulated. Co-treatment with vanillic acid remarkably precluded these neurotoxic outcomes by improving neurosignaling, augmenting antioxidant status, abrogating oxidative damage, inflammation (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta), and apoptosis (BAX, BAK1, caspase-3/9). Vanillic acid also restored IL-10 and BDNF levels, thereby exhibiting neuroprotective effects, corroborated by histological examinations. We posit vanillic acid as a safe and effective therapeutic agent against neurotoxicity occasioned by exposure to neuroendocrine disruptors.
   DEP and BPS mediated increase in hippocampus activities in rat model via oxidative stress. Plastics and other neglected home producing toxicity could be contributing factors of disease in our Environment DEP and BPS impaired inflammation, and apoptosis occasioned by stress response. Vanillic acid prevent oxidative damage. image

AB  - Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is an antioxidant that directly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibits pro-oxidant enzymes. Although EGCG protects hippocampal neurons from status epilepticus (SE, a prolonged seizure activity), the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. As the preservation of mitochondrial dynamics is essential for cell viability, it is noteworthy to elucidate the effects of EGCG on impaired mitochondrial dynamics and the related signaling pathways in SE-induced CA1 neuronal degeneration, which are yet unclear. In the present study, we found that EGCG attenuated SE-induced CA1 neuronal death, accompanied by glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) induction. EGCG also abrogated mitochondrial hyperfusion in these neurons by the preservation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-mediated mitochondrial fission, independent of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. Furthermore, EGCG abolished SE-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) serine (S) 536 phosphorylation in CA1 neurons. ERK1/2 inhibition by U0126 diminished the effect of EGCG on neuroprotection and mitochondrial hyperfusion in response to SE without affecting GPx1 induction and NF-kappa B S536 phosphorylation, indicating that the restoration of ERK1/2-DRP1-mediated fission may be required for the neuroprotective effects of EGCG against SE. Therefore, our findings suggest that EGCG may protect CA1 neurons from SE insults through GPx1-ERK1/2-DRP1 and GPx1-NF-kappa B signaling pathways, respectively.

AB  - Background: Gintonin (GT), a Panax ginseng-derived lysophosphatidic acid receptor (LPAR) ligand, has positive effects in cultured or animal models for Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and so on. However, the potential therapeutic value of GT in treating epilepsy has not yet been reported.Methods: Effects of GT on epileptic seizure (seizure) in kainic acid [KA, 55mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)]-induced model of mice, excitotoxic (hippocampal) cell death in KA [0.2 mg, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)]-induced model of mice, and levels of proinflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 cells were investigated.Results: An i.p. injection of KA into mice produced typical seizure. However, it was significantly alleviated by oral administration of GT in a dose-dependent manner. An i.c.v. injection of KA produced typical hippocampal cell death, whereas it was significantly ameliorated by administration of GT, which was related to reduced levels of neuroglial (microglia and astrocyte) activation and proinflammatory cyto-kines/enzymes expression as well as increased level of the Nrf2-antioxidant response via the upregu-lation of LPAR 1/3 in the hippocampus. However, these positive effects of GT were neutralized by an i.p. injection of Ki16425, an antagonist of LPA1-3. GT also reduced protein expression level of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, a representative proinflammatory enzyme, in LPS-induced BV2 cells. Treatment with conditioned medium clearly reduced cultured HT-22 cell death.Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that GT may suppress KA-induced seizures and exci-totoxic events in the hippocampus through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities by activating LPA signaling. Thus, GT has a therapeutic potential to treat epilepsy.(c) 2022 The Korean Society of Ginseng. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction brain disorder brought on by the dysfunctional amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and clearance of APP peptides. Increased APP levels lead to the production of AD-related peptides including the amyloid APP intracellular domain (AICD) and amyloid beta (A beta), and consequently modify the intrinsic excitability of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, synaptic protein activity, and impair synaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA1-CA3 synapses. The goal of the present study is to build computational models that incorporate the effect of AD-related peptides on CA1 pyramidal neuron and hippocampal synaptic plasticity under the AD conditions and investigate the potential pharmacological treatments that could normalize hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning in AD. We employ a phenomenological N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-based voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity model that includes the separate receptor contributions on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) and embed it into the a detailed compartmental model of CA1 pyramidal neuron. Modeling results show that partial blockade of Glu2NB-NMDAR-gated channel restores intrinsic excitability of a CA1 pyramidal neuron and rescues LTP in AICD and A beta conditions. The model provides insight into the complex interactions in AD pathophysiology and suggests the conditions under which the synchronous activation of a cluster of synaptic inputs targeting the dendritic tree of CA1 pyramidal neuron leads to restored synaptic plasticity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the preovulatory follicular development and superovulatory outcomes in superovulated ewes which were either stimulated or not stimulated by placement with rams. The treatment regimen to super-stimulate ovarian follicular development was imposed to 28 ewes on "Day 0", from which 14 were stimulated with active rams for 48 h, starting at the time of the fifth FSH dose, with the ram being removed from the pen with the ewes and replaced which other ram every 12 h, using four different rams (group GRE). The other 14 ewes remained isolated from rams throughout the protocol (group GCON). All ewes were administered 133 mg of FSH, into six doses in decreasing quantities, every 12 h. The follicular development and number of ovulations were determined using ultrasonography. Biostimulation resulted in an increased number of large follicles, follicle diameter, and embryo viability rate (viable embryos/recovered structures*10 0) was greater in ewes of the GRE than GCON group. The number of corpora lutea, follicular cysts, recovered structures, viable embryos, and degenerated and unfertilized structures was similar in ewes of the GRE and GCON group. Structures were recovered from more GRE than GCON ewes. In conclusion, biostimulation with rams during the last phase of the treatment regimen to induce superovulation enhanced the follicular growth and increased the embryo viability rate in ewes.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We investigated the changes in redox state and protein expression in selected parts of the rat brain induced by a 4 week administration of morphine (10 mg/kg/day). We found a significant reduction in lipid peroxidation that mostly persisted for 1 week after morphine withdrawal. Morphine treatment led to a significant increase in complex II in the cerebral cortex (Crt), which was accompanied by increased protein carbonylation, in contrast to the other brain regions studied. Glutathione levels were altered differently in the different brain regions after morphine treatment. Using label-free quantitative proteomic analysis, we found some specific changes in protein expression profiles in the Crt, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum on the day after morphine withdrawal and 1 week later. A common feature was the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and dysregulation of the extracellular matrix. Our results indicate that the tested protocol of morphine administration has no significant toxic effect on the rat brain. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in lipid peroxidation and activation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Furthermore, our data suggest that long-term treatment with morphine acts specifically on different brain regions and that a 1 week drug withdrawal is not sufficient to normalize cellular redox state and protein levels.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a methodology for the calculation of internal doses of radiation following exposure to radioactive fallout from the detonation of a nuclear fission device. Reliance is on methodology previously published in the open literature or in reports not readily available, though some new analysis is also included. Herein, we present two methodologic variations: one simpler to implement, the other more difficult but more flexible. The intention is to provide in one place a comprehensive methodology. Pathways considered are (1) the ingestion of vegetables and fruits contaminated by fallout directly, (2) the ingestion of vegetables and fruits contaminated by continuing deposition by rain- or irrigation-splash and resuspension, (3) the ingestion of vegetables and fruits contaminated by absorption of radionuclides by roots after tillage of soil, (4) the non-equilibrium transfer of short-lived radionuclides through the cow-milk and goat-milk food chains, (5) the equilibrium transfer of long lived radionuclides through milk and meat food chains, and (6) inhalation of descending fallout. Uncertainty in calculated results is considered. This is one of six companion papers that describe a comprehensive methodology for assessing both external and internal dose following exposures to fallout froma nuclear detonation. Input required to implement the dose-estimation model for any particular location consists of an estimate of the post-detonation external gamma-exposure rate and an estimate of the time of arrival of the fallout cloud. The additional data required to make such calculations are included in the six companion papers.

AB  - Ovarian steroids play an important role in increasing plasma volume in pregnant females and preparing the uterus for implantation. We hypothesized that a short duration of increased estradiol-17 beta (E2) would increase plasma volume and uterine cell proliferation in ovariectomized ewes. Adult non-pregnant Romanov ewes (n = 15) were ovariectomized. After ovariectomy, ewes were individually housed and were offered water at ad libitum intake and were fed a pelleted diet at maintenance once daily according to body weight. After at least 30 days post-ovariectomy ewes were fasted and received an implant placed in the axillary region that contained 100 mg of E2 (E2; n = 8) or a sham implant with no E2 (CON, n = 7). After 24 h, ewes were weighed prior to plasma volume measurement procedures. Plasma volume was determined using the Evans blue dye method. Blood samples were taken at 0 (pre dye injection), 5,10,15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min after dye injection. After the final blood collection, ewes were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentabarbital and uterine weights were recorded. Uterine cross-sections were fixed in formalin for immunohistochemical localization of Ki67 (a marker of proliferating cells) followed by image generation of luminal epithelium and endometrial stroma (5 areas each/tissue section) and analysis to determine the proportion of proliferating cells. Plasma volume tended to be greater in E2 vs CON (2.75 +/- 0.11 vs. 2.54 +/- 0.12 L, P = 0.07) and uterine weights were greater in E2 vs CON (27.25 +/- 2.35 vs. 17.35 +/- 2.51 g, P < 0.01). Water intake after implant placement was similar in E2 and CON (3.85 vs. 4.87 +/- 0.67 L; P = 0.28). Cell proliferation in the luminal epithelium was greater in E2 vs CON (6.55 vs. 1.2 +/- 1.75%, P = 0.02) and stromal cells tended to be greater in E2 vs CON (0.59 vs 0.37 +/- 0.06%, P = 0.07). Our results demonstrate that E2-treatment tends to increase plasma volume acutely and increases uterine cell proliferation in ewes. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - One of the most extensively studied members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, Rac1 is an intracellular signal transducer that remodels actin and phosphorylation signaling networks. Previous studies have shown that Rac1-mediated signaling is associated with hippocampal-dependent working memory and longer-term forms of learning and memory and that Rac1 can modulate forms of both pre- and postsynaptic plasticity. How these different cognitive functions and forms of plasticity mediated by Rac1 are linked, however, is unclear. Here, we show that spatial working memory in mice is selectively impaired following the expression of a genetically encoded Rac1 inhibitor at presynaptic terminals, while longer-term cognitive processes are affected by Rac1 inhibition at postsynaptic sites. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of this presynaptic process, we leveraged new advances in mass spectrometry to identify the proteomic and post-translational landscape of presynaptic Rac1 signaling. We identified serine/threonine kinases and phosphorylated cytoskeletal signaling and synaptic vesicle proteins enriched with active Rac1. The phosphorylated sites in these proteins are at positions likely to have regulatory effects on synaptic vesicles. Consistent with this, we also report changes in the distribution and morphology of synaptic vesicles and in postsynaptic ultrastructure following presynaptic Rac1 inhibition. Overall, this study reveals a previously unrecognized presynaptic role of Rac1 signaling in cognitive processes and provides insights into its potential regulatory mechanisms.

Using our swine model for mTBI in young children, our aim was to (i) establish a reference range (RR) for each parameter to validate injury and track recovery, and (ii) evaluate changes in gait patterns following a single and multiple (5x) sagittal rapid non-impact head rotation (RNR). Gait patterns were studied in four groups of 4-week-old Yorkshire swine: healthy (n = 18), anesthesia-only sham (n = 8), single RNR injury (n = 12) and multiple RNR injury (n = 11). Results were evaluated pre-injury and at 1, 4, and 7 days post-injury. RR reliability was validated using additional healthy animals (n = 6). Repeated mTBI produced significant increases in gait time, cycle time, and stance time, as well as decreases in gait velocity and cadence, on Day One post-injury compared to pre-injury, and these remained significantly altered at Day Four and Day Seven post-injury. The gait metrics of the repeated TBI group also significantly fell outside the healthy RR on Day One, with some recovery by Day Four, while many remained altered at Day Seven. Only a bilateral decrease in hind stride length was observed at Day Four in our single RNR group compared to pre-injury. In sum, repeated and single sagittal TBI can significantly impair motor performance, and gait metrics can serve as reliable, objective, quantitative functional assessments in a juvenile porcine RNR TBI model.

AB  - Lactoferrin (Lf) is a multifunctional protein from the transferrin family. Of particular interest is the ability of Lf to affect a wide range of neuronal processes by modulating the expression of genes involved in long-term neuroplasticity. The expression of the immediate early gene c-fos that is rapidly activated in response to external influences, and its product, transcription factor c-Fos, is widely used as a marker of long-term neuronal plasticity. The present study aims to examine the effect of human Lf on the induction of transcription factor c-Fos in the primary mouse neuronal cultures after stimulation and to determine the cellular localization of human Lf and its colocalization with induced c-Fos protein. Primary dissociated cultures of hippocampal cells were obtained from the brains of newborn C57BL/6 mice (P0-P1). On day 7 of culturing, human Lf was added to the medium. After 24 h (day 8 in culture), c-Fos protein was induced in cells by triple application of 50 mM KCl. c-Fos content was analyzed using the immunofluorescent method 2 h after stimulation. Stimulation promoted exogenous Lf translocation into the nuclei of cultured neuronal cells, which correlated with increased induction of transcription factor c-Fos and was accompanied by nuclear colocalization of these proteins. These results attest to the potential of Lf as a modulator of neuronal processes and open up new prospects in studying the mechanisms of the regulatory effects of lactoferrin on cell function.

AB  - Simple Summary Camel products are receiving great interest worldwide because of their high functional properties and nutritive values, but concern regarding their high content of unhealthy ingredients has also been raised. The trace, macrominerals, and heavy metal levels were investigated in the tissue and whole blood of slaughtered camels during the summer and winter seasons in Saudi Arabia. For whole blood, there was no significant effect of season on all mineral concentrations, but it was affected by regions in Saudi Arabia. A significantly higher Ca and P concentration was reported during the winter in liver tissues compared with the summer, with a significant variation in Ca, Mg, P, and Se between different locations. Furthermore, summer season affected the Cd and P concentrations in rumen tissues with no effect on rumen fluid. Camel products are receiving great interest worldwide because of their high functional properties and nutritive values. Therefore, this study was focused on the variation of copper [Cu], zinc [Zn], manganese [Mn], selenium [Se], iron [Fe], iodine [I], and some heavy metals, cobalt [Co], lead [Pb], and cadmium [Cd], in the blood and tissues of slaughtered camels from five regions in Saudi Arabia [SA] during the summer and winter seasons, because environmental factors vary from region to region. Whole blood, meat, liver, rumen fluid, and rumen tissues were collected from the slaughterhouse in each region during the two seasons. Moreover, samples were prepared and analyzed for trace mineral and heavy metal concentrations using ICP-MS. The data were statistically analyzed as part of a complete randomized design and correlation analysis for season and location using SAS. The findings revealed a pattern in the minerals, with Ca being the only mineral that was unrelated to other minerals in the liver. For lead and cadmium, our mean value in liver [0.40 mu g/g] was below the limit of the EU standard for cadmium [0.50 mu g/g], while in meat and liver, lead contents [1.62 mu g/g and 2.57 mu g/g, respectively] were above the limit of the EU standard [0.10 and 0.20 mu g/g, respectively]. For meat, the significantly highest positive correlations were observed between P and Mg [R-2 = 0.928], Fe and Mn [R-2 = 0.860], and Co and Mn [R-2 = 0.821]. For rumen tissues, P and Mg were highly correlated [R-2 = 0.958] as well as Zn and Mg [R-2 = 0.857], Zn and P [R-2 = 0.836], and Fe and Ca [R-2 = 0.802]. As a result, a region and season reflect variations in mineral concentrations in SA during the summer and winter seasons. Further intensive research is needed to investigate the minerals' biological mechanisms in camels under different environmental conditions.

AB  - Vocal animals produce multiple categories of calls with high between- and within-subject variability, over which listeners must generalize to accomplish call categorization. The behavioral strategies and neural mechanisms that support this ability to generalize are largely unexplored. We previously proposed a theoretical model that accomplished call categorization by detecting features of intermediate complexity that best contrasted each call category from all other categories. We further demonstrated that some neural responses in the primary auditory cortex were consistent with such a model. Here, we asked whether a feature-based model could predict call categorization behavior. We trained both the model and guinea pigs (GPs) on call categorization tasks using natural calls. We then tested categorization by the model and GPs using temporally and spectrally altered calls. Both the model and GPs were surprisingly resilient to temporal manipulations, but sensitive to moderate frequency shifts. Critically, the model predicted about 50% of the variance in GP behavior. By adopting different model training strategies and examining features that contributed to solving specific tasks, we could gain insight into possible strategies used by animals to categorize calls. Our results validate a model that uses the detection of intermediate-complexity contrastive features to accomplish call categorization.

AB  - In Mauritania, the dromedary breeding is the most widespread pastoral activity, and it is considered as the first source of animal protein; however, the research on meat is relatively rare compared with fish, especially in relation with the presence of trace metals. In this work, livers, kidneys, and muscles of 25 Camelus dromedarius were collected from butcheries in Nouakchott (Mauritania) between February and April 2020 to study the concentration of trace metals (three essential metals: cooper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn), and four toxic metals: mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb)). Statistical treatment did not show significant differences associated with age (P = 0.7004), sex (P = 0.9353), or type of diet (0.9951) in the found concentration of the target substances, but the differences were significant between metals and between organs (P < 0.0001). The mean concentrations of the essential metals were 0.80 mg/100 g for Cu, 6.02 mg/100 g for Fe, and 3.28 mg/100 g for Zn, and the ratios between these concentrations were significant (P < 0.0001 in all cases), with [Fe] > [Zn] > [Cu]. Cu was most concentrated in the liver, Fe in the kidney, and Zn in muscle. The mean concentrations of toxic metals were 0.055 mg/kg for As, 0.064 mg/kg for Cd, 0.040 mg/kg for Pb, and 0.027 mg/kg for Hg. They also exhibited significant difference between organs. Hg and Pb showed their largest concentrations in the liver, whereas As and Cd reached their maximum values in the kidney. Therefore, the found concentrations in all cases were lower than the admissible level of trace metals.

AB  - Posture and the rate of postural changes of farrowing and lactating sows are considered reliable indicators of environmental comfort and health status and are risk factors for piglet crushing. The objective of this study was to develop a combined deep learning and principle component analysis (PCA) based approach to classify different postural behaviours of sows in videos. Compared to previous studies of sow's postural behaviour classification based on deep learning, this study selects sequences of frames from the videos that distinguish different postural behaviours rather than using all frames for the classification. Videos were collected from 13 sows, and the recording started from 5 days before the expected date of farrowing until weaning. From the videos, 3100 videos without piglets and 1680 including piglets were manually selected. Then, these videos were augmented by using vertical mirroring and adding Gaussian noise, which resulted in 7200 and 4600 videos without and including piglets, respectively. Each video lasted 5 sec and included 1 out of 5 behavioural postures (sternal lying, lateral lying, sitting, standing, walking) labelled by one trained expert with extensive experience in sow's behaviour classification. Out of the total of 11,800 videos, 75% were randomly allocated as training set and the remaining 25% as validation set. To select motion-related frames, each video was first converted into a multidimensional matrix. Then, PCA was performed on the matrix and a number of component(s) were selected to represent the frame. After that, the frame Euclidean distances were computed based on the components and the frames over a certain distance threshold were selected to generate new videos. Since a different number of components and distance thresholds can affect the number of selected frames, a range of component numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50) and distance thresholds were further tested to find the optimal parameters. The best balance between accuracy and performance of the classification was obtained when using 10 components (87.98% of total variation). The best results were obtained when the threshold was set as one fourth of the largest distance between two successive frames. To classify different behaviours, the videos composed of the selected frames were trained and validated with convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Using the proposed method, postural behaviours could be classified with accuracies of 95.33% and 92.67% on videos without piglets and all data (including and not including piglets). Furthermore, 500 new videos were selected from the experiment and were used as test set. The final model was further tested on the test set and returned an accuracy of 90.60%, which indicated that the proposed method can be generalized on new data.

AB  - Hypoxia and HIF signaling drive cancer progression and therapy resistance and have been demonstrated in breast cancer. To what extent breast cancer subtypes differ in their response to hypoxia has not been resolved. Here, we show that hypoxia similarly triggers HIF1 stabilization in luminal and basal A triple negative breast cancer cells and we use high throughput targeted RNA sequencing to analyze its effects on gene expression in these subtypes. We focus on regulation of YAP/TAZ/TEAD targets and find overlapping as well as distinct target genes being modulated in luminal and basal A cells under hypoxia. We reveal a HIF1 mediated, basal A specific response to hypoxia by which TAZ, but not YAP, is phosphorylated at Ser89. While total YAP/TAZ localization is not affected by hypoxia, hypoxia drives a shift of [p-TAZ(Ser89)/p-YAP(Ser127)] from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in basal A but not luminal breast cancer cells. Cell fractionation and YAP knock-out experiments confirm cytoplasmic sequestration of TAZ(Ser89) in hypoxic basal A cells. Pharmacological and genetic interference experiments identify c-Src and CDK3 as kinases involved in such phosphorylation of TAZ at Ser89 in hypoxic basal A cells. Hypoxia attenuates growth of basal A cells and the effect of verteporfin, a disruptor of YAP/TAZ-TEAD-mediated transcription, is diminished under those conditions, while expression of a TAZ-S89A mutant does not confer basal A cells with a growth advantage under hypoxic conditions, indicating that other hypoxia regulated pathways suppressing cell growth are dominant.

AB  - The article presents the results of electron microscopy of 52 teeth with acute and chronic initial caries infiltrated with "Icon" material (DMG, Germany). According to the results of the study, in acute initial dental caries (white spot stage), the infiltrate filled almost the entire volume of the pathological focus (81.8 +/- 6.7% of cases). The technique of infiltration by replacing the lost mineral with a low-viscosity light-curing resin creates a barrier inside the carious lesion. Minimally invasive approaches, including the enamel infiltration technique, can be used for caries in the white spot stage for therapeutic-prophylactic purposes. However, in the case of chronic initial caries (pig-mented spot stage), the infiltrate does not infiltrate the entire depth of the lesion. In 79.0 +/- 9.4% of the teeth of this group, non-infiltrated areas of carious lesions were localized within the surface layers of dentin. Extrapolating the results obtained to the clinic, we can assume that the infiltration of initial caries at the stage of a pigmented spot does not ensure the stabilization of the carious process. Clinical recom-mendation of the low-viscosity resin infiltration technique requires evidence that requires long-term clinical observations

AB  - Protein malnourishment and immune stress are potent perinatal stressors, encountered by children born under poor socioeconomic conditions. Thus, it is necessary to investigate how such stressors synergistically contribute towards developing neurological disorders in affected individuals. Pups from Wistar females, maintained on normal (high-protein, HP:20%) and low-protein (LP:8%) diets were used. Single and combined exposures of Poly I:C (viral mimetic: 5 mg/kg body weight) and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; bacterial endotoxin: 0.3 mg/kg body weight) were injected to both HP and LP pups at postnatal days (PND) 3 and 9 respectively, creating eight groups: HP (control); HP+Poly I:C; HP+LPS; HP+Poly I:C+LPS; LP; LP+Poly I:C; LP+LPS; LP+Poly I:C+LPS (multi-hit). The effects of stressors on hippocampal cytoarchitecture and behavioral abilities were studied at PND 180. LP animals were found to be more vulnerable to immune stressors than HP animals and symptoms like neuronal damage, spine loss, downregulation of Egr 1 and Arc proteins, gliosis and behavioral deficits were maximum in the multi-hit group. Thus, from these findings it is outlined that cellular and behavioral changes that occur following multi-hit exposure may predispose individuals to developing Schizophrenia-like pathologies during adulthood.

AB  - High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most common and aggressive ovarian malignancy. Accumulating evidence indicates that HGSOC may originate from human fallopian tube epithelial cells (FTECs), although the exact pathogen(s) and/or molecular mechanism underlying the malignant transformation of FTECs is unclear. Here we show that human papillomavirus (HPV), which could reach FTECs via retrograde menstruation or sperm-carrying, interacts with the yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) to drive the malignant transformation of FTECs. HPV prevents FTECs from natural replicative and YAP1-induced senescence, thereby promoting YAP1-induced malignant transformation of FTECs. HPV also stimulates proliferation and drives metastasis of YAP1-transformed FTECs. YAP1, in turn, stimulates the expression of the putative HPV receptors and suppresses the innate immune system to facilitate HPV acquisition. These findings provide critical clues for developing new strategies to prevent and treat HGSOC.

AB  - Background: The genetic basis of phenotypic traits is highly variable and usually divided into mono-, oligo- and polygenic inheritance classes. Relatively few traits are known to be monogenic or oligogeneic. The majority of traits are considered to have a polygenic background. To what extent there are mixtures between these classes is unknown. The rapid advancement of genomic techniques makes it possible to directly map large amounts of genomic markers (GWAS) and predict unknown phenotypes (GWP). Most of the multi-marker methods for GWAS and GWP falls into one of two regularization frameworks. The first framework is based on l(1)-norm regularization (e.g. the LASSO) and is suitable for mono- and oligogenic traits, whereas the second framework regularize with the l(2)-norm (e.g. ridge regression; RR) and thereby is favourable for polygenic traits. A general framework for mixed inheritance is lacking.
   Results: We have developed a proximal operator algorithm based on the recent LAVA regularization method that jointly performs l(1)- and l(2)-norm regularization. The algorithm is built on the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal translation mapping (LAVA ADMM). When evaluated on the simulated QTLMAS2010 data, it is shown that the LAVA ADMM together with Bayesian optimization of the regularization parameters provides an efficient approach with lower test prediction mean-squared-error (65.89) than the LASSO (66.11), Ridge regression (83.41) and Elastic net (66.11). For the real pig data the test MSE of the LAVA ADMM is 0.850 compared to the LASSO, RR and EN with 0.875, 0.853 and 0.853, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study presents the LAVA ADMM that is capable of joint modelling of monogenic major genetic effects and polygenic minor genetic effects which can be used for both genome-wide assoiciation and prediction purposes. The statistical evaluations based on both simulated and real pig data set shows that the LAVA ADMM has better prediction properies than the LASSO, RR and EN. Julia code for the LAVA ADMM is available at: https://github.com/patwa67/LAVAADMM.

AB  - Various nanomaterials have been produced with the development of nanotechnology, some of which have been reported to have adverse effects on several types of cells, organs, and the environment. It has been suggested that some small nanoparticles can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain, which may be a potential cause of brain diseases. Neuronal cells are vulnerable to hypoxia, hypotrophy, and mechanical and oxidative stress. Therefore, it is essential to assess the toxicity of nanoparticles to neurons accurately. In this report, we describe a primary culture protocol to evaluate the toxicity of nanoparticles on neurons, a potential high-throughput method for assessing the cytotoxicity, and a method for evaluating the effect on neuronal maturation. This report assessed the toxicity of silicon dioxide, zinc oxide, and iron nanoparticles using rat hippocampal neurons, which are used frequently in pharmacological and physiological studies. Based on the methods and protocols we reported in this report, it may be possible to evaluate nanotoxicity to various neurons by using primary cultures of other brain regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, etc.), spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.

AB  - Quinoa is a nutrient-dense food that lowers chronic disease risk. This study evaluated the physicochemical and sensory qualities of fermented camel milk with 1, 2, 3, and 4% quinoa. The results showed that improvement in camel's milk increased the total solids, protein, ash, fiber, phenolic content, and antioxidant activity more effectively. Fermented camel milk with 3% of quinoa flour exhibited the highest sensory characteristics compared to other treatments. Fermented camel milk enriched with 3% red quinoa flour was studied in obese rats. Forty male Wistar rats were separated into five groups: the first group served as a normal control, while groups 2-4 were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HF)-diet and given 2 mL/day of fermented milk and quinoa aqueous extract. Blood glucose, malondialdehyde (MDA), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, triglyceride, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine, and urea levels decreased dramatically in comparison to the positive control group, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL), albumin, and total protein concentrations increased significantly. Fortified fermented camel milk decreased the number of giant adipocytes while increasing the number of tiny adipocytes in the body. The results showed that the liver and renal functions of hypercholesterolemic rats were enhanced by consuming fermented milk and quinoa. These results demonstrated the ability of quinoa and camel milk to protect rats from oxidative stress and hyperlipidemia. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms behind the metabolic effects of fermented camel milk and quinoa.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The sclerotium of Lignosus rhinocerus (Cooke) Ryvarden is used by the local communities in Southeast Asia and China to treat cancer, asthma, fever, and other ailments based on traditional knowledge. The sclerotial water extracts were previously reported to exhibit cytotoxic, apoptotic, and immunomodulatory activities - providing a scientific basis for its use in treating cancer; however, there is still a lack of evidence on its potential anti-angiogenic activity. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the toxicity, anti-angiogenic, and anti -tumour activities of the hot-water and cold -water extracts of L. rhinocerus using HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells implanted in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Materials and methods: The toxicity of L. rhinocerus extracts towards the chick embryos was determined 24 h posttreatment. The anti-angiogenic activity of the extracts was then investigated at 0.1 -10 mu g/embryo (6.7 -670 mu g/ mL) at targeted blood vessels. The anti -tumour effect of selected extracts against the HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells xenografted onto the chick embryos was also studied. Results: The cold -water extracts of L. rhinocerus displayed strong in ovo toxicity (LC 50 : 1.2 -37.7 mu g/mL) while the hot-water extracts are non-toxic up to 670 mu g/mL. Among the extracts, the hot-water extracts demonstrated the highest anti-angiogenic activity with 44.0 +/- 17.7% reduction of capillary diameter (relative to the saline -treated control). Moreover, treatment of the HCT116 cells xenografted onto the chick embryos with the hot-water extracts resulted in smaller tumour size and lower number of blood vessels compared to the saline -treated control. Conclusions: The hot-water extracts of L. rhinocerus sclerotium demonstrated anti-angiogenic and anti -tumour activities but most of the cold -water extracts at similar concentrations were devoid of that. Our findings provide further scientific validation of the medicinal use of the sclerotium in treating cancer and thus, expanding our knowledge on the possible mechanism of its anti -cancer effect apart from direct cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis and immunomodulation that have been studied thus far.

AB  - Heat stress represents significant challenges for livestock, adversely affecting their production, reproduction, and overall welfare. This study aimed to explore the interrelationships between environmental and animal-related factors and the flank temperature (FT) and eye temperature (ET) recorded using IRT in dromedary camels. This study was conducted in the Cholistan Desert in 2023, and IRT images of the eyes and flanks were captured from 510 camels across 54 herds. During the image analyses, pictures taken from 499 camels were of good quality and included. The camels were of both sexes and of various ages (minimum 3 years, pubertal and adult stages), and they had diverse physiological statuses (breeding, immature, lactating, non-lactating, and pregnant). Before taking the IRT pictures, ambient temperature and humidity were registered using a weather station, and light intensity was recorded using a lux meter. The ET was associated only with physiological status (p < 0.05), with pregnant females showing the lowest values, while no effects of physiological status, sex, or age were found for FT. The environmental temperature showed a positive correlation with both ET (r = 0.7887) and FT (r = 0.6280), highlighting the sensitivity of camel thermoregulation to temperature fluctuations. As expected, a strong positive correlation between ET and FT (r = 0.6643) was found. Conversely, a significant negative correlation was observed between humidity and ET (-0.7444) and FT (-0.5519), indicating that higher humidity levels lead to decreased temperatures in both regions. Light intensity (lux) exhibited minimal influence on both temperatures, with correlations of 0.1019 for ET and 0.2650 for FT. This study contributes to the field of precision livestock farming by suggesting a possible application of IRT for detecting thermal stress in camels in pastoral settings.

AB  - A wide range of viruses cause neurological manifestations in their hosts. Infection by neurotropic viruses as well as the resulting immune response can irreversibly disrupt the complex structural and functional architecture of the brain, depending in part on host genetic background. The interaction between host genetic background, neurological response to viral infection, and subsequent clinical manifestations remains poorly understood. In the present study, we used the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse resource to better understand how differences in genetic background drive clinical signs and neuropathological manifestations of acute Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection. For the first time, we characterized variations of TMEV viral tropism and load based on host genetic background, and correlated viral load with microglial/macrophage activation. For five CC strains (CC002, CC023, CC027, CC057, and CC078) infected with TMEV, we compared clinical signs, lesion distribution, microglial/macrophage response, expression, and distribution of TMEV mRNA, and identified genetic loci relevant to the early acute (4 days post-infection [dpi]) and late acute (14 dpi) timepoints. We examined brain pathology to determine possible causes of strain-specific differences in clinical signs, and found that fields CA1 and CA2 of the hippocampal formation were especially targeted by TMEV across all strains. Using Iba-1 immunolabeling, we identified and characterized strain- and timepoint-specific variation in microglial/macrophage reactivity in the hippocampal formation. Because viral clearance can influence disease outcome, we used RNA in situ hybridization to quantify viral load and TMEV mRNA distribution at both timepoints. TMEV mRNA expression was broadly distributed in the hippocampal formation at 4 dpi in all strains but varied between radiating and clustered distribution depending on the CC strain. We found a positive correlation between microglial/macrophage reactivity and TMEV mRNA expression at 4 dpi. At 14 dpi, we observed a dramatic reduction in TMEV mRNA expression, and localization to the medial portion of field CA1 and field CA2. To better understand how host genetic background can influence pathological outcomes, we identified quantitative trait loci associated with frequency of lesions in a particular brain region and with microglial/macrophage reactivity. These QTL were located near several loci of interest: lysosomal trafficking regulator (Lyst) and nidogen 1 (Nid1), and transmembrane protein 106 B (Tmem106b). Together, these results provide a novel understanding about the influences of genetic variation on the acute neuropathological and immunopathological environment and viral load, which collectively lead to variable disease outcomes. Our findings reveal possible avenues for future investigation which may lead to more effective intervention strategies and treatment regimens.

AB  - In the evolution of proboscideans, the emergence of dwarf and semi-dwarf forms occurred repeatedly, on various territories and at various times, due to a lack of resources caused by geographic isolation on the islands and landscape isolation on the mainland. Despite a significant amount of information on the island forms of mammoths and elephants, the question of the association between a decrease in the body size and morphological changes in the dental system remains controversial. According to some data, the formation of dwarf forms was accompanied by a unidirectional decrease in the number of dental plates (NDP) of the tooth and thickening of the enamel. According to other data, changes in the dental system on the islands were mosaic in nature; that is, the NDP could decrease, remain unchanged, or even increase. Taking into account the importance of the NDP as a diagnostic tool for species identification of proboscidean taxa and the absence of a consensus on the stability of a trend towards a decrease in the NDP from tall continental ancestors to island dwarf descendants, we (1) summarize data on the finds of small teeth of mammoths from the Mammuthus genus with a reduced NDP in the localities in northern Eurasia, (2) present new radiocarbon dates, and (3) consider the NDP as a characteristic of developing dwarfism in continental mammoths. The study of small teeth of the last generation of M. primigenius from the coastal part of northeastern Siberia and a comparison with data from other regions demonstrated that the posterior sections of cheek teeth in mammoths are the most variable and represent a reduction complex. For woolly mammoth, the reduction primarily affects that part of the crown that became more complex by the gradual addition of the plates during phyletic evolution in the Middle-Late Pleistocene. A rapid loss of evolutionary achievements of the ancestral forms due to reduction is not a unique peculiarity of the woolly mammoth teeth, and was also traced in other mammals. The similarity of the reduction complexes of cheek teeth in proboscideans and rodents of the Arvicolinae subfamily was demonstrated; it can be traced by a decrease in the number of serially homologous elements of the crown: plates in proboscideans and pairs of prisms in arvicolines. A comparison of the NDP with the size of the M. primigenius teeth allowed us to make the assumption that a decrease in the NDP while maintaining other species-specific peculiarities of the tooth can be used as a criterion for separating semi-dwarf and small individuals of the woolly mammoth. The size of continental mammoths decreased most intensively during warmer intervals, when significant transformation of landscapes and a reduction in resource space occurred.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a toxic metal with great neurotoxic potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a long-term Pb intoxication on the global proteomic profile, oxidative biochemistry and neuronal density in motor cortex of adult rats, and the possible outcomes related to motor functions. For this, Wistar rats received for 55 days a dose of 50 mg/Kg of Pb acetate by intragastric gavage. Then, the motor abilities were evaluated by open field and inclined plane tests. To investigate the possible oxidative biochemistry modulation, the levels of pro-oxidant parameters as lipid peroxidation and nitrites were evaluated. The global proteomic profile was evaluated by ultraefficiency liquid chromatography system coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS) followed by bioinformatic analysis. Moreover, it was evaluated the mature neuron density by anti-NeuN immunostaining. The statistical analysis was performed through Student's t-test, considering p<0.05. We observed oxidative stress triggering by the increase in malonaldehyde and nitrite levels in motor cortex. In the proteomic analysis, the motor cortex presented alterations in proteins associated with neural functioning, morphological organization, and neurodegenerative features. In addition, it was observed a decrease in the number of mature neurons. These findings, associated with previous evidences observed in spinal cord, cerebellum, and hippocampus under the same Pb administration protocol, corroborate with the motor deficits in the rats towards Pb. Thus, we conclude that the long-term administration to Pb in young Wistar rats triggers impairments at several organizational levels, such as biochemical and morphological, which resulted in poor motor performance.

AB  - Biomaterial scientists design organic bone substitutes based on the biochemical properties of the mimicked tissue to achieve near native functionality. Several non-collagenous proteins in bone are known as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), as they lack detectible ordered domains and a fixed 3D structure under physiological conditions. Many IDPs perform regulatory roles in a range of cellular functions, which motivated us to design two proline-rich disordered peptides (P2 and P6) and augmented them into the SmartBone (R)(SBN) biohybrid substitute. Recently we reported an improved proliferation and osteogensis of human osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells in the composite groups containing peptides (named here as SBN + P2 and SBN + P6) in vitro. To address the effects of these composites on bone formation and biomineralization, this in vivo study investigated their functions in critical size craniotomy defects in 16 domestic pigs after 8 and 16 weeks of healing. For this purpose, we used cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), microCT (mCT), histology, immunohistochemistry, fluorescent labeling of abundant reactive entities (FLARE), synchrotron SAXS/XRD, optical photothermal IR (O-PTIR) microscopy and nanoscale atomic force microscopy-infrared (AFMIR) analyses. Our results represent new synthetic IDPs as potential candidates for directing bone formation and biomineralization. The SBN + P6 stimulated significantly higher bone formation and biomineralization after 8 weeks of healing compared to other groups indicating its potential in stimulating early biomineralization. After 16 weeks of healing, the SBN + P2 induced significantly' higher bone formation and biomineralization compared to other groups indicating its effects on later bone formation and biomineralization processes. The vigorous stretching of amide primary and secondary IR absorbance peaks at 1660 and 1546 cm(-1) in the SBN + P2 group verified that this peptide experienced more conformational changes after 16 weeks of implantation with a higher phosphate intensity at 1037 cm-1 compared to peptide 6. Overall, P2 and P6 are promising candidates for bone augmentation strategies in critical clinical applications. We concluded that FLARE and O-PTIR are promising tools in evaluating and diagnosing the biochemical structure of bone tissue and the bonebiomaterial interface.

AB  - Oxycodone is one of the most commonly used analgesics in the clinic. However, long-term use can contribute to drug dependence. Accumulating evidence of changes in DNA methylation after opioid relapse has provided insight into mechanisms underlying drug-associated memory. The neuropeptide oxytocin is reported to be a potential treatment for addiction. The present study sought to identify changes in global and synaptic gene methylation after cue-induced reinstatement of oxycodone conditioned place preference (CPP) and the effect of oxytocin. We analyzed hippocampal mRNA of synaptic genes and also synaptic density in response to oxycodone CPP. We determined the mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and ten-eleven translocations (Tets), observed global 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) levels, and measured DNA methylation status of four synaptic genes implicated in learning and memory (Arc, Dlg1, Dlg4, and Syn1). Both synaptic density and the transcription of 15 hippocampal synaptic genes significantly increased following cue-induced reinstatement of oxycodone CPP. Oxycodone relapse was also related to markedly decreased 5-mC levels and decreased transcription of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b; in contrast, 5-hmC levels and the transcription of Tet1 and Tet3 were increased. Oxycodone exposure induced DNA hypomethylation at the exons of the Arc, Dlg1, Dlg4, and Syn1 genes. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of oxytocin (2.5 mu g/mu l) specifically blocked oxycodone relapse, possibly by inhibition of Arc, Dlg1, Dlg4, and Syn1 hypomethylation in oxycodone-treated rats. Together, these data indicate the occurrence of epigenetic changes in the hippocampus following oxycodone relapse and the potential role of oxytocin in oxycodone addiction.

AB  - The development of the nervous system is crucial to a child's health. However, the nervous system is also susceptible to a variety of factors during development. To date, epidemiological studies have reported controversial results on the relationship between prenatal exposure to particulate matter (PM) and neurobehavioral development. Thus, we investigated the effect of PM exposure during pregnancy on the neurobehavioral development of offsprings. Adult C57BL/6 mice were exposed to PM from gestation day (GD) 0.5-21 by the intratracheal instillation. The daily exposure doses were 250 mu g/kg.b.w and 2500 mu g/kg.b.w respectively. The offspring mice began behavioral tests at the 5th week. We assessed neurobehavioral development, and the gene expression level changes in the mouse hippocampus using RNA-seq. In the open field test, the movement distance in the central area was significantly decreased in the high-dose group. Serum free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels were significantly increased in male offspring mice with prenatal high-dose PM exposure. The RNA-seq results suggested that the Prkca, Med12l, Ep300, and Slc16a10 in the thyroid hormone signaling pathway were significantly decreased in offspring mice in the high-dose group.
   Our data showed that prenatal PM exposure caused the offspring mice's anxiety-like behaviors and increased serum FT3 levels. The changes in thyroid hormone pathway-related genes might be the causes of the above series of changes.

AB  - The integration of hippocampal oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is crucial for memory consolidation. However, how cardinal sleep oscillations bind across various subfields of the human hippocampus to promote information transfer and synaptic plasticity remains unclear. Using human intracranial recordings from 25 epilepsy patients, we find that hippocampal subfields, including DG/CA3, CA1, and SUB, all exhibit significant delta and spindle power during NREM sleep. The DG/CA3 displays strong coupling between delta and ripple oscillations with all the other hippocampal subfields. In contrast, the regions of CA1 and SUB exhibit more precise coordination, characterized by event-level triple coupling between delta, spindle, and ripple oscillations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synaptic plasticity within the hippocampal circuit, as indexed by delta-wave slope, is linearly modulated by spindle power. In contrast, ripples act as a binary switch that triggers a sudden increase in delta-wave slope. Overall, these results suggest that different subfields of the hippocampus regulate one another through diverse layers of sleep oscillation synchronization, collectively facilitating information processing and synaptic plasticity during NREM sleep.
   Different subfields of the hippocampus complement and regulate each other, collectively facilitating information processing and synaptic plasticity during NREM sleep.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by mechanical injury, neuroinflammation, and neurological degeneration is highly lethal and could result in disability and death. Here, we report an adhesive and conductive hydrogel-based therapy to simultaneously target the complexity of TBI pathogenesis and poor neuron regeneration ability of the brain tissue. The hydrogel is soft and strongly adhesive to brain tissue, which provides mechanical support to retard brain swelling and brain atrophy in a controlled cortical impact induced moderate TBI of mice model. Furthermore, the hydrogel exhibits antioxidative ability to reduce oxidative damage and suppress the neuroinflammation response via attenuating the activation of NF-& kappa;B signaling pathway, thus providing neuroprotection for neuron survival. Meanwhile, the hydrogel with high conductivity replicates the neuron-adaptive microenvironments for hippocampal repair to decline neurological dysfunction after TBI. This study sheds light on the hydrogel-mediated combinatory therapy for treating complex and severe consequences after TBI.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Unbalanced metabolism of an extracellular matrix (ECM) in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) is widely acknowledged as the primary cause of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Irisin, a novel myokine, is cleaved from fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) and has recently been proven to regulate the metabolism of ECM. However, little is known about its potential on NPCs and the development of IDD. Therefore, this study sought to examine the protective effects and molecular mechanism of irisin on IDD in vivo and in vitro. Decreased expression levels of FNDC5 and anabolism markers (COL2A1 and ACAN) but increased levels of catabolism markers (ADAMTS4) were found in degenerative nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues. In a punctured-induced rat IDD model, irisin treatment was found to significantly slow the development of IDD, and in TNF-alpha-stimulated NPCs, irisin treatment partly reversed the disorder of ECM metabolism. In mechanism, RNA-seq results suggested that irisin treatment affected the Hippo signaling pathway. Further studies revealed that with irisin treatment, the phosphorylation levels of key factors (LATS and YAP) were downregulated, while the expression level of CTGF was upregulated. Moreover, CTGF knockdown partially eliminated the protective effects of irisin on the metabolism of ECM in NPCs, including inhibiting the anabolism and promoting the catabolism. Taken together, this study demonstrated that the expression levels of FNDC5 were decreased in degenerative NP tissues, while irisin treatment promoted the anabolism, inhibited the catabolism of the ECM in NPCs, and delayed the progression of IDD via LATS/YAP/CTGF signaling. These results shed light on the protective actions of irisin on NPCs, leading to the development of a novel therapeutic target for treating IDD.

AB  - Curvature in mammalian fibers, such as wool and human hair, is an important feature of the functional trait of coat structure-it affects mechanical resilience and thermo-insulation. However, to examine the relationship between fiber curvature, ultrastructure and protein composition fiber diameter variability has to be minimal. To achieve this we utilised the progeny of straight-wool domestic sheep mutant rams (crimp mutants) and wild-type ewes. Proteomic and structural results of the resulting mutant/wild-type twin pairs confirmed that straight crimp mutant wool had a normal cuticle and the same cortical protein and ultrastructural building blocks as wild-type (crimpy) fibers but differed in the layout of its cortical cells and in the relative proportions of keratin (K) and keratin-associated proteins (KAPs). In the case of the crimp mutants (straight fibers), the orthocortex was distributed in a fragmented, annular ring, with some orthocortical cells near the central medulla, a pattern similar to that of straight hairs from humans and other mammals. Crimp mutant fibers were noted for the reduced abundance of some proteins in the high glycine-tyrosine class normally associated with the orthocortex, specifically the KAP6, KAP7, and KAP8 families, while proteins from the KAP16 and KAP19 were found in increased abundance. In addition to this, the type I keratin, K38, which is also associated with the orthocortex, was also found at lower abundance in the mutant fibers. Conversely, proteins from the ultra-high sulfur class normally associated with the paracortex, specifically the KAP4 and KAP9 families, were found in higher abundance.

AB  - Background Cariprazine (CPZ) is a third-generation antipsychotic medication that has been approved for treating schizophrenia. This study aimed to develop a cariprazine-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier (CPZ-NLCs) to prevent first-pass metabolism and improve bioavailability and site-specific delivery from nose to the brain.
   Method The CPZ-NLCs were prepared using melt emulsification. The formulation was optimized using the Box-Behnken design (BBD); where the influence of independent variables on critical quality attributes, such as particle size and entrapment efficiency was studied.
   Result The optimized batch (F6) had a particle size of 173.3 +/- 0.6 nm and an entrapment efficiency of 96.1 +/- 0.57%, respectively. The in vitro release showed >96% release of CPZ from NLC within 30 min. The optimized formulation's ex vivo studies revealed significantly increased CPZ permeability (>75%) in sheep nasal mucosa compared to the CPZ suspension (similar to 26%). The ciliotoxicity study of the nasal mucosa revealed that the CPZ-NLC formulation did not affect the nasal epithelium. The intranasal administration of the formulation achieved 76.14 +/- 6.23 mu g/ml concentration in the brain which was significantly higher than the oral CPZ suspension administration (30.46 +/- 7.24 mu g/ml). The developed formulation was stable for 3 months.
   Conclusion The study concluded that the developed CPZ-NLC could significantly improve the bioavailability with quick delivery to the brain.

AB  - Plants are threatened by a wide variety of herbivorous insect assaults, and display a variety of inherent and induced defenses that shield them against herbivore attacks. Looking at the massive damage caused by the white-backed planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera, we undertook a study to identify and functionally annotate OsWRKY and OsNAC transcription factors (TFs) in rice, especially their involvement in WBPH stress. OsWRKY and OsNAC TFs are involved in various developmental processes and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, no comprehensive reports are available on the specific phycological functions of most of the OsWRKY and OsNAC genes in rice during WBPH infestation. The current study aimed to comprehensively explore the OsWRKY and OsNAC genes by analyzing their phylogenetic relationships, subcellular localizations, exon-intron arrangements, conserved motif identities, chromosomal allocations, interaction networks and differential gene expressions during stress conditions. Comparative phylogenetic trees of 101 OsWRKY with 72 AtWRKY genes, and 121 OsNAC with 110 AtNAC genes were constructed to study relationships among these TFs across species. Phylogenetic relationships classified OsWRKY and OsNAC into eight and nine clades, respectively. Most TFs in the same clade had similar genomic features that represented similar functions, and had a high degree of co-expression. Some OsWRKYs (Os09g0417800 (OsWRKY62), Os11g0117600 (OsWRKY50), Os11g0117400 (OsWRKY104) and OsNACs (Os05g0442700, Os12g0630800, Os01g0862800 and Os12g0156100)) showed significantly higher expressions under WBPH infestation, based on transcriptome datasets. This study provides valuable information and clues about predicting the potential roles of OsWRKYs and OsNACs in rice, by combining their genome-wide characterization, expression profiling, protein-protein interactions and gene expressions under WBPH stress. These findings may require additional investigation to understand their metabolic and expression processes, and to develop rice cultivars that are resistant to WBPH.

AB  - Calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion 1 (CAPS1) is a SNARE accessory protein that facilitates formation of the SNARE complex to enable neurotransmitter release. Messenger RNAs encoding CAPS1 are subject to a site-specific adenosineto-inosine (A-to-I) editing event resulting in a glutamate-to-glycine (E-to-G) substitution in the C-terminal domain of the encoded protein product. The C-terminal domain of CAPS1 is necessary for its synaptic enrichment and Cadps RNA editing has been shown previously to enhance the release of neuromodulatory transmitters. Using mutant mouse lines engineered to solely express CAPS1 protein isoforms encoded by either the non-edited or edited Cadps transcript, primary neuronal cultures from mouse hippocampus were used to explore the effect of Cadps editing on neurotransmission and CAPS1 synaptic localization at both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. While the editing of Cadps does not alter baseline evoked neurotransmission, it enhances short-term synaptic plasticity, specifically short-term depression, at inhibitory synapses. Cadps editing also alters spontaneous inhibitory neurotransmission. Neurons that solely express edited Cadps have a greater proportion of synapses that contain CAPS1 than neurons that solely express non-edited Cadps for both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Editing of Cadps transcripts is regulated by neuronal activity, as global network stimulation increases the extent of transcripts edited in wild-type hippocampal neurons, whereas chronic network silencing decreases the level of Cadps editing. Taken together, these results provide key insights into the importance of Cadps editing in modulating its own synaptic localization, as well as the modulation of neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Na,K-ATPase is an electrogenic pump found in cell plasma membranes that acts as the basic unit of animal life. This enzyme is highly susceptible to cardiotonic steroid (CTS) inhibition. The role of Na,K-ATPase in signaling has introduced a novel viewpoint regarding the enzyme's function, as the ouabain-binding site is involved in several physiological processes. At high concentrations, ouabain blocks Na+ and K+ ion transport by Na,K-ATPase, whereas at low concentrations, it activates the signaling function of the enzyme. Notably, Na,K-ATPase does not fit into the categories of G protein-coupled receptors or ligand-gated ion channels. This indicates that it may be a distinct cell surface receptor that interacts with signaling molecules through allosteric regulation. In the present study, we have identified new modulators of Na,K-ATPase sensitivity to ouabain, and studied the kinetic effects of physiological concentrations of ouabain on Na,K-ATPase in the hippocampus. Specifically, Cytochrome c (Cytc) increases an affinity for ouabain and the maximal velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme. After binding to Na,K-ATPase, ouabain induces conformational changes that drive shifts between enzymatic cycles.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Guhan Yangsheng Jing (GHYSJ) is a traditional Chinese patent medicine, that has the function of nourishing the kidney and replenishing the essence, invigorating the brain and calming the mind. It is often used to treat dizziness, memory loss, sleep disorders, fatigue, and weakness, etc. However, its mechanism for improving sleep has not yet been determined. Aim of the study: This study aims to explore the effects of GHYSJ on Sleep Deprivation (SD) -induced hippocampal neuronal pyroptotic injury, learning and cognitive abilities, and sleep quality in mice. Methods: In this study, a PCPA-induced SD mouse model was established. We assessed the influence of GHYSJ on sleep quality and mood by using the pentobarbital -induced sleep test (PIST) and sucrose preference test (SPT). The pharmacological effects of GHYSJ on learning and memory impairment were evaluated by the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and Open Field Test (OFT). Pathological changes in the hippocampal tissue of the SD rats were observed via HE staining and Nissl staining. The severity of neuronal damage was evaluated by detecting the expression of the neuronal marker Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, the levels of neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 5-hydroxy tryptamine (5 -HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and Glutamic acid (Glu) in hippocampal tissues, as well as the expression of inflammatory factors Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and Interleukin-18 (IL -18) in serum, were determined by ELISA. The expressions of mRNA and protein NOD -like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3), Gasdermin D (GSDMD), Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase1 (Caspase1), High mobility group box -1 protein (HMGB1) and Apoptosis-associated speck -like protein containing CARD (ASC) related to the cellular ferroptosis pathway were tested and analyzed by RT-PCR and WB respectively. Results: PCPA significantly diminishes the sleep span of experimental animals by expediting the expenditure of 5HT, consequently establishing an essentially direct SD model. The intervention of GHYSJ displays remarkable efficacy in mitigating insomnia symptoms, encompassing difficulties in initiating sleep and insufficient sleep duration. Likewise, it ameliorates memory function impairments induced by sleep deprivation, along with symptoms such as fatigue and depletion of vitality. GHYSJ exerts a protective influence on hippocampal neurons facilitated by inhibiting the down regulation of MAP2 and maintaining the equilibrium of neurotransmitters (5HTP, 5 -HT, GABA, and Glu). It diminishes the expression of intracellular pyroptosis-associated inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta and IL -18) and curbs the activation of the NLRP3/Caspase1/GSDMD pyroptosis-related signaling pathways, thereby alleviating the damage caused by hippocampal neuronal pyroptosis.

AB  - Natural melanocortins (MCs) have been used in the successful development of drugs with neuroprotective properties. Here, we studied the behavioral effects and molecular genetic mechanisms of two synthetic MC derivatives-ACTH(4-7)PGP (Semax) and ACTH(6-9)PGP under normal and acute restraint stress (ARS) conditions. Administration of Semax or ACTH(6-9)PGP (100 p.g/kg) to rats 30 min before ARS attenuated ARS-induced behavioral alterations. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we identified 1359 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hippocampus of vehicle-treated rats subjected to ARS, using a cutoff of >1.5 fold change and adjusted p-value (Padj) < 0.05, in samples collected 4.5 h after the ARS. Semax administration produced > 1500 DEGs, whereas ACTH(6-9)PGP administration led to <400 DEGs at 4.5 h after ARS. Nevertheless, -250 overlapping DEGs were identified, and expression of these DEGs was changed unidirectionally by both peptides under ARS conditions. Modulation of the expression of genes associated with biogenesis, translation of RNA, DNA replication, and immune and nervous system function was produced by both peptides. Furthermore, both peptides upregulated the expression levels of many genes that displayed decreased expression after ARS, and vice versa, the MC peptides downregulated the expression levels of genes that were upregulated by ARS. Consequently, the antistress action of MC peptides may be associated with a correction of gene expression patterns that are disrupted during ARS.

AB  - The second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) window is advantageous for bioimaging due to its deep tissue penetration and low autofluorescence. Despite these benefits, creating highly sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobes in this range is challenging. This study introduces an ultra-sensitive SERS nanoprobe developed using plasmonic engineering. We selected the commercial Raman dye IR1061, with an absorption peak at 1061 nm, and synthesized gold nanotriangles (AuNTs) to absorb visible light and transfer energy to NIR-II phonons. The combination of IR1061 and AuNTs significantly improved the nanoprobe's sensitivity to 116 fM in the NIR-II window, due to enhanced electromagnetic fields and SERS effects. Theoretical analysis shows AuNTs have stronger electromagnetic hotspots than gold nanorods, enhancing SERS sensitivity. The nanoprobe penetrates pig tissue over 4 mm and agarose gels up to 5 cm. This work presents a novel approach to ultra-sensitive NIR-II SERS nanoprobes for bioimaging and diagnostics. It can not only overcome the bottleneck of traditional imaging technology, but also provide strong support for high-resolution imaging of deep tissues and provide more accurate information for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis cause damage to the myelin sheath, leading to neurological problems. While the exact causes of MS are unclear, it is known that inflammatory processes and poor remyelination contribute to disease progression. Exercise has shown promise as a non-drug treatment for MS, with benefits reported for mobility, mood, and potential neuroprotection. However, the specific ways in which exercise affects remyelination and neuroinflammation in demyelinating conditions are not fully understood. This study explores the effects of low-intensity physical exercise on myelination, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis in a cuprizone-induced demyelination model, focusing on the hippocampus, which are critical for cognitive function and interhemispheric communication. Mice subjected to cuprizone treatment underwent a low-intensity forced wheel-running exercise. The results showed that low-intensity physical exercise significantly increased the expression of myelin basic protein in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus and the corpus callosum, suggesting enhanced remyelination in these regions. Additionally, cuprizone-induced demyelination led to morphological changes in microglia, activating them in the hippocampus. However, low-intensity physical exercise significantly reduced microglial activation, indicating that exercise modulated the neuroinflammatory response. Despite observing reduced microglial activation with low-intensity exercise, TNF-alpha levels remained elevated in the low-intensity exercise group, suggesting a complex relationship between microglial activation markers and cytokine production in this model of demyelination. This indicates that low-intensity exercise may not fully suppress the pro-inflammatory potential of microglia in the cuprizone model. Although low-intensity exercise promoted remyelination and modulated neuroinflammation in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, it did not significantly counteract the cuprizone-induced reduction in proliferating cells and immature neurons in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. These findings suggest that while the exercise regimen had beneficial effects, it did not significantly influence overall neurogenesis. This novel study investigates the region-specific effects of low-intensity exercise on myelination and neuroinflammation, with a focus on the hippocampus, which is less frequently explored in the context of demyelination models. The findings highlight the potential rehabilitative benefits of low-intensity exercise for demyelination-related neurological disorders and provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms contributing to neuroprotection.

AB  - 1,4-naphthoquinones hydroxyderivatives belong to an important class of natural products and have been known as a favored scaffold in medicinal chemistry due to their multiple biological properties. Juglone is one of the most important 1,4-naphthoquinone extracted from juglandaceae family showing a good antibacterial activity. In this study, we report the synthesis of aminojuglone derivatives through Michael addition reaction using Cerium (III) chloride heptahydrate (CeCl3 & sdot;7H(2)O) as catalyst. The synthesized aminojuglone derivatives were evaluated for their antibacterial properties against sensitive, clinical resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Compound 3c showed a good antibacterial activity similar to cloxacillin (2 mu g/mL) against the clinically resistant S.aureus. . The antibiotic adjuvant activity of compounds was evaluated in combination with three clinically use antibiotics. The combination of compounds 3a , 3b , 3e , 3 h- 3 l , 3n and 3o with cloxacillin showed remarkable adjuvant activity against clinically resistant S. aureus (66-fold potentiation of cloxacillin activity). 3e is the only compound consistent with the concept of antibiotic adjuvant, presenting insufficient antibacterial activity (MIC > 128 mu g/mL) and potentiate the activity of cloxacillin (66-fold) with synergistic effect. A structural characterization of 3e was carried out for the first time using X-ray diffraction technic. Moreover, compound 3e did not show a cytotoxic activity on sheep red blood cells.

AB  - Foodborne transmission appears to be a significant route for human hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in Europe. We have developed a quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) for HEV infection due to consumption of three selected pork products (liver p & acirc;t & eacute;, minced meat, and sliced liver), which models the steps from farm to human consumption in high detail, including within-farm transmission dynamics and microbiological processes such as cross contamination and thermal inactivation. Our model is unique in that it considers prevalence and viral load of two microbiological variables, HEV RNA and infectious HEV, expressing the latter in terms of the former through so-called "adjustment factors" where data are lacking. When the QMRA was parameterized for France and using infectious HEV, we found that sliced liver posed by far the highest risk of infection, with mean probability per portion 3.35x10-4[95%CI(3.28-3.42)x10-4]$3.35\times 10<^>{-4}\,[95\%\ \text{CI}\ (3.28-3.42)\times 10<^>{-4}]$, corresponding to 3447(95%CI3372-3522)$3447\,(95\%\ \text{CI}\ 3372-3522)$ human cases annually. For minced meat, the probability of infection was 3.68x10-8[95%CI(3.56-3.80)x10-8]$3.68\times 10<^>{-8}\,[95\%\ \text{CI}\ (3.56-3.80)\times 10<^>{-8}]$, with only 21(95%CI20-21)$21\,(95\%\ \text{CI}\ 20-21)$ human cases. While our model predicted appreciable levels of HEV RNA remaining in liver p & acirc;t & eacute; at the point of consumption, the amount of infectious HEV and hence risk of infection was zero, emphasizing the importance of using the correct microbiological variable when assessing the risk to consumers. Owing to its highly mechanistic nature, our QMRA can be used in future work to assess the impact of control measures along the pork-supply chain at high resolution.

AB  - Introduction: Nowadays, using electromagnetic devices (EMD) has been increased. However, the control of EMD hazards was poorly evaluated, especially those affected the hippocampus. Regular physical exercises are safe, easily, inexpensive, and acceptable for long-term use. It is reported that exercise protects against many health problems.Aim: is to investigate the hypothesis of the possible prophylactic effect of exercise on the hippocampal damage induced by electromagnetic waves of Wi-Fi.Material and methods: Adult male albino rats were divided into four groups: group I (control), group II (exercise), group III (Wi-Fi), and group IV (exercise -Wi-Fi). Hippocampi were subjected to biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques.Results: In group III, a significant increase in the oxidative enzymes as well as decrease in antioxidant enzymes were detected in rat hippocampus. Additionally, the hippocampus showed degenerated pyramidal and granular neurons. An evident decrease in both PCNA and ZO-1 immunoreactivity was also noticed. In group IV, physical exercise alleviates the effect of Wi-Fi on previously mentioned parameters.Conclusion: Regular physical exercise performance significantly minimizes the hippocampal damage and protects against the hazarders of chronic Wi-Fi radiation exposure.

AB  - Plants typically respond to attacks by herbivorous arthropods by releasing specific blends of volatiles. A common effect of these herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) is that they prime neighboring plants to become more resistant to the same herbivores. The brown planthopper (BPH) apparently has "turned the tables" on rice plants by inducing volatiles that make exposed plants more susceptible to BPH attack. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism behind this counterintuitive response in rice plants. Exposure to BPHinduced volatiles was found to suppress jasmonic acid (JA) signaling in rice plants, impairing their chemical defenses and enhancing planthopper performance. Metabolomic analyses revealed a significant reduction in phenolamides, notably N-feruloylputrescine, a JA-regulated compound with strong anti-BPH activity. We identify Os4CL5, a key gene in the phenylpropanoid-polyamine conjugate pathway, as a central node in this suppression. HIPV exposure markedly reduced Os4CL5 expression and N-feruloylputrescine accumulation. Using a rice mutant, we confirmed that Os4CL5 is essential for both N-feruloylputrescine production and resistance to BPH. By identifying Os4CL5 as the molecular target of BPH-induced volatiles and linking its suppression to reduced N-feruloylputrescine biosynthesis, our study provides the first mechanistic insight into volatile-mediated defense disruption and opens a new avenue for enhancing rice pest resistance.

AB  - The brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B/cAMP response element-binding protein (BDNF/TrkB/CREB) signaling pathway is a critical therapeutic target for inducing adult hippocampal neurogenesis and antidepressant therapy. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that naringin, a natural medicinal compound, could promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis and improve depression-like behaviors via regulating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway. We first investigated the effects of naringin on promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis in both normal and chronic corticosterone (CORT)-induced depressive mice. Under physiological condition, naringin treatment enhanced the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and accelerated neuronal differentiation. In CORT-induced depression mouse model, naringin treatment promoted neuronal differentiation and maturation of NSPCs for hippocampal neurogenesis. Forced swim test, tail suspension test, and open field test confirmed the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of naringin. Co-treatment of temozolomide (TMZ), a neurogenic inhibitor, abolished these antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Meanwhile, naringin treatment increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) but had no effect on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and phosphorylation of TrkB in the hippocampus of CORT-induced depressive mice. Co-treatment of CREB inhibitor 666-15, rather than TrkB inhibitor Cyc-B, abolished the neurogenesis-promoting and antidepressant effects of naringin. Taken together, naringin has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, and the underlying mechanisms could be attributed to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis via activating CREB signaling.

AB  - Background: High rates of co-morbidity have been reported in patients with diabetes mellitus with depression (DD). Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBD), a Traditional Chinese Medicine formula composed of Angelica and Astragalus, has been historically used for the treatment of diabetes.
   Purpose: This study aimed to investigated whether DBD and its main active component, ferulic acid (FA) from Angelica, could ameliorate depression-like behavior in DD and the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were administered DBD (4 or 8 g/kg) by oral gavage during a 4-week period of chronic unpredictable mild stress. After 4 weeks, blood glucose, glycated serum protein, serum insulin, oral glucose tolerance and depression-like behavior were examined, along with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-related signaling pathway proteins and the ultrastructure of hippocampal tissues. UPLC-QTOF-MS was adopted to detect the absorption of FA in the serum and hippocampus. Rat primary hippocampal cells were cultured in a DD model. Protein and mRNA levels of genes involved in BDNF-related signaling and neuroplasticity were analyzed.
   Results: DBD effectively improved glucose tolerance in DD rats and relieved depression-like behavior. Upregulation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), BDNF, and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and improvement of the hippocampal neuron ultrastructure supported the antidepressant-Like effects of DBD on the hippocampal neurons. In addition, DBD enhanced the protein and mRNA levels of components of the CREB/ BDNF/TrkB pathway in rat primary hippocampal cells induced by elevated glycemia and cortisol. Interestingly, FA, the main component of DBD absorbed in the blood and hippocampus, showed similar effects as DBD on primary hippocampal cells.
   Conclusion: :This study suggests that the TCM formula DBD effectively serves as a potential therapeutic agent for prevention of DD through regulatory effects on the CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway to protect and remodel hippocampal neurons. Moreover, FA contributes significantly to the treatment effects of DBD.

AB  - Social recognition memory (SRM) forms the basis of social relationships of animals. It is essential for social interaction and adaptive behavior, reproduction and species survival. Evidence demonstrates that social deficits of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia are caused by alterations in SRM processing by the hippocampus and amygdala. Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) and its receptors PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2 are highly expressed in these regions. PACAP is a pleiotropic neuropeptide that modulates synaptic function and plasticity and is thought to be involved in social behavior. PACAP signaling also stimulates the nitric oxide (NO) production and targets outcomes to synapses. In the present work, we investigate the effect of the infusion of PACAP-38 (endogenous neuropeptide and potent stimulator of adenylyl cyclase), PACAP 6?38 (PAC1/VPAC2 receptors antagonist) and S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP, NO donor) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) on the consolidation of SRM. For this, male Wistar rats with cannulae implanted in CA1 or in BLA were subjected to a social discrimination paradigm, which is based on the natural ability of rodents to investigate unfamiliar conspecifics more than familiar one. In the sample phase (acquisition), animals were exposed to a juvenile conspecific for 1 h. Immediately, 60 or 150 min after, animals received one of different pharmacological treatments. Twenty-four hours later, they were submitted to a 5 min retention test in the presence of the previously presented juvenile (familiar) and a novel juvenile. Animals that received infusions of PACAP 6?38 (40 pg/side) into CA1 immediately after the sample phase or into BLA immediately or 60 min after the sample phase were unable to recognize the familiar juvenile during the retention test. This impairment was abolished by the coinfusion of PACAP 6?38 plus SNAP (5 ?g/ side). These results show that the blockade of PACAP/PAC1/VPAC2 signaling in the CA1 and BLA during a restricted post-acquisition time window impairs the consolidation of SRM and that the SNAP is able to abolish this deficit. Findings like this could potentially be used in the future to influence studies of psychiatric disorders involving social behavior.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Jiawei-Xiaoyao pill (JWX), a traditional Chinese medicine, was recorded in ancient Chinese medicine pharmacopoeia using for treatment of various diseases, including mood disorders. Current mainstream antidepressants have a disadvantage in delayed onset of action. The rapid antidepressant potential of JWX and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of the study: We aimed to assess the rapid antidepressant potential of JWX, within the prescription dose range, and the distinct underlying neuroplasticity signaling mechanism. Materials and methods: The rapid antidepressant response of JWX were determined using various behavioral paradigms, and in a corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression model in mice. The molecular neuroplasticity signaling and the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus was evaluated using immunoblotting and immunostaining. The contribution of specific signaling was investigated using pharmacological interventions. Results: A single dose of JWX induced rapid and persistent antidepressant effects in both the normal and chronic CORT-exposed mice. The phosphorylation of CaMKII, mTOR, ERK and the expressions of BDNF, synapsin1 and PSD95 increased at 30 min post JWX. JWX restored the expression of BDNF in the hippocampal dentate gyrus reduced by CORT-exposure. The rapid antidepressant effect and upregulation of BDNF expression by JWX was blunted by a mTOR antagonist, rapamycin, or a CaMKII antagonist, KN-93. CaMKII signaling blockade blunted mTOR signaling activated by JWX, but not vice versa. Conclusion: JWX elicits a rapid antidepressant effect, via quickly stimulating CaMKII signaling, subsequently activating mTOR-BDNF signaling pathway, and thus enhancing hippocampal neuroplasticity.

AB  - In our previous study, microRNA (miR)-381 was found to be the most down-regulated miRNA in skeletal muscle of Liaoning cashmere goats with higher skeletal muscle mass, but the molecular mechanism involved remains unclear. In this study, primary caprine skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) were isolated and identified. We investigated the effect of miR-381 on the viability, proliferation and differentiation of caprine SMSCs, and the target relationships of miR-381 with jagged canonical Notch ligand 2 (JAG2) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Cells isolated were positive for SMSC-specific marker protein Pax7. This suggests that purified SMSCs were obtained. The expression level of miR-381 achieved a peak value on day 4 after SMSC differentiation, and miR-381 also significantly increased the expression levels of myogenic differentiation marker genes: myosin heavy chain (MyHC), myogenin (MyoG) and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) in differentiated SMSCs, the area of MyHC-positive myotubes and the myogenic index. These findings suggest that miR-381 promoted myogenic differentiation of caprine SMSCs. The CCK8 assay and EDU staining analysis showed that miR-381 mimic both inhibited the viability of SMSCs and decreased the percentage of EDU-labeled positive SMSCs. In contrast, miR-381 inhibitor had the opposite effect with miR-381 mimic. A dual luciferase reporter assay verified that miR-381 can target JAG2 and PTEN by binding to the 3 '-untranslated regions (3 '-UTR) of the genes. The transfection of miR-381 mimic into caprine SMSCs resulted in decreases in expression levels of JAG2 and PTEN, while miR-381 inhibitor increased the two target genes in expression. This is the first study to reveal the biological mechanisms by which miR-381 regulates caprine SMSC activities.

AB  - The tea plant accumulates elevated levels of fluoride (F) from environmental sources. Drinking tea containing high F levels poses a potential threat to human health. Selenium (Se) was applied by foliar spray to investigate its effects on F accumulation and physiology in tea plant. Foliar application of different forms of Se, i.e., Na2SeO3, Kappa-selenocarrageenan, Selenomethionine and Nanoselenium, reduced F content in tea leaves by 10.17 %-44.28 %, 16.12 %-35.41 %, 22.19 %-45.99 % and 22.24 %-43.82 %, respectively. Foliar spraying Se could increase F accumulation in pectin through increasing pectin content and pectin demethylesterification to bind more F in the cell wall, which decreased the proportion of water-soluble fluoride in tea leaves. Application of Se significantly decreased the contents of chromium (39.6 %-72.0 %), cadmium (48.3 %-84.4 %), lead (2.2 %-44.4 %) and copper (14.1 %-44.6 %) in tea leaves. Foliar spraying various forms of Se dramatically increased the Se content and was efficiently transformed into organic Se accounting for more than 80 % in tea leaves. All Se compounds increased peroxidase activity by 3.3 %-35.5 % and catalase activity by 2.6 %-99.4 %, reduced malondialdehyde content by 5.6 %-37.1 %, and increased the contents of chlorophyll by 0.65 %-31.8 %, ca-rotenoids by 0.24 %-27.1 %, total catechins by 1.6 %-21.0 %, EGCG by 4.4 %-17.6 % and caffeine by 9.1 %-28.6 %. These results indicated that Se application could be served as a potential efficient and safe strategy diminishing the concentration of F in tea leaves.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of the unspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor lornoxicam on the immunophenotype and some functions of dromedary camel blood leukocytes. Intravenous injection of camels with a single dose of lornoxicam induced a significant change in the camel leukogram, which is characterized by reduced cell numbers of all leukocyte subpopulations. In vitro analysis of cell vitality revealed a pro-apoptotic effect of lornoxicam on camel leukocytes, which may be responsible for the lornoxicam-induced leukocytopenia in vivo. Functional ex vivo and in vitro analysis of the key antimicrobial functions, phagocytosis and ROS production indicates inhibitory effects of lornoxicam on the antimicrobial capacity of the blood phagocytes, monocytes and neutrophils. Furthermore, lornoxicam induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes, characterized by reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and increased expression of CD163 molecules. The present study identified for the first time inhibitory effects of the COX-inhibitor lornoxicam on some phenotypic and functional properties of camel blood immune cells and recommends considering these effects when using lornoxicam in camel medicine. (1) Background: Lornoxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic, antiphlogistic and antipyretic effects. The improved tolerance of lornoxicam due to the relatively shorter elimination half-life in comparison to other members of the oxicams may favor its application in the management of pain and inflammation in race dromedary camels. There are no studies conducted yet on the immunomodulatory or immunotoxilogic effect of lornoxicam in camels. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor lornoxicam on some phenotypic and functional properties of camel blood leukocytes; (2) Methods: Using flow cytometry, blood leukocyte composition, monocyte phenotype, and antimicrobial functions of neutrophils and monocytes were analyzed ex vivo after a single dose injection with lornoxicam. In addition, the effect of in vitro incubation of camel blood with lornoxicam on leukocyte cell vitality and antimicrobial functions were evaluated; (3) Results: The injection of camels with a single dose of lornoxicam resulted in a significant change in their leukogram with reduced numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Within the lymphocyte population, the numbers of CD4(+) T cells, gamma delta T cells, and B cells decreased significantly in blood after injection of camels with lornoxicam. In addition, injection of lornoxicam resulted in decreased abundance of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and increased abundance of the scavenger receptor CD163 on blood monocytes, indicating an anti-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes. Functionally, administration of lornoxicam decreased the capacity of camel neutrophils and monocytes to uptake bacteria and to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) after bacterial stimulation. Similarly, the in vitro whole blood incubation with lornoxicam resulted in reduced phagocytosis and ROS production activity of the camel blood phagocytes.
   Flow cytometric analysis of cell vitality, including cell necrosis and apoptosis, revealed a pro-apoptotic effect of lornoxicam on camel leukocytes; (4) Conclusions: Lornoxicam administration, at the dose and intervals utilized herein, induces significant changes in the phenotype and function of camel blood leukocytes.
   The reduced cell numbers of all studied leukocyte subpopulations in lornoxicam-treated camels, which seems to be a result of enhanced cell apoptosis, indicates an inhibitory effect rather than a modulatory effect of lornoxicam on the camel immune system, which need to be considered when using lornoxicam in camel medicine.

AB  - Objective: The relationship of preoperative memory deficits in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) to the distribution of neuronal loss is uncertain. Building on the material specificity theory, we tested the hypothesis that visual memory deficits are associated with posterior hippocampal atrophy, whereas verbal memory deficits are associated with anterior hippocampal atrophy.Methods: We studied 22 adults with mTLE and HS, calculating hippocampal head, body, and tail volumes, correcting for estimated total intracranial volume, using automated segmentation. Preoperative memory ability was evaluated with the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-II: logical memory, verbal paired associates, family pictures, and faces subtests). We correlated memory ability with hippocampal division volumes using SPSS 26.1 (repeated measures ANOVAs, one-way ANOVAs, Pearson r correlations) for statistical analysis.Results: We found a significant main effect of hippocampal subdivision, reporting volumetric differences between the head, body, and tail. Pairwise comparisons reported that the hippocampal head had significantly greater volume than both the body and tail (p < 0.001). For both left and right focus groups, the ipsilateral hippocampi were significantly smaller than the contralateral. Linear regression reported a left hippocampal model (head, body, and tail volumes) predicted performance on logical memory with the left hippocampal tail volume being the strongest predictor. A right hippocampal model (head, body, and tail volumes) predicted memory ability for family pictures and verbal paired associates at a trend level.Conclusions: Ipsilateral hippocampal head and tail seem more vulnerable to injury than the body in both the left and right mTLE. Our study suggests there may be functional differences along the hippocampal longitudinal axis, particularly for the left hippocampal tail with verbal memory. Our findings are consistent with material-specific right-left differences in memory processing.

AB  - Cognitive impairment and anxiety are common side effects of chemotherapy, particularly with the use of doxorubicin (DOX), known as "chemobrain". This study aimed to examine the dose-dependent effects of DOX on cognitive decline, anxiety, and locomotor activity in healthy female Wistar rats. The rats were divided into groups receiving low (2 mg/kg), intermediate (4 mg/kg), and high (5 mg/kg) doses of DOX for four weeks, alongside a control group. Behavioral tests, including open field, elevated plus maze, and Y-maze tests, assessed anxiety, locomotion, and cognitive performance, while brain tissue analysis evaluated neuroinflammation using markers such as GFAP and Iba-1. The results showed that all doses of DOX induced anxiety-like behavior, reduced locomotion, and caused neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, with more severe effects at higher doses. Notably, high-dose DOX also caused short-term memory deficits. These findings highlight the dose-dependent nature of DOX's impact on behavior and cognition, suggesting that DOX plays a key role in the development of cognitive symptoms during chemotherapy. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind these effects and to explore potential interventions.

AB  - LIS1 is one of the principal genes related to Type I lissencephaly, a severe human brain malformation characterized by an abnormal neuronal migration in the cortex during embryonic development. This is clinically associated with epilepsy and cerebral palsy in severe cases, as well as a predisposition to developing mental disorders, in cases with a mild phenotype. Although genetic variations in the LIS1 gene have been associated with the development of schizophrenia, little is known about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. We have studied how the Lis1 gene might cause deficits associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia using the Lis1/sLis1 murine model, which involves the deletion of the first coding exon of the Lis1 gene. Homozygous mice are not viable, but heterozygous animals present abnormal neuronal morphology, cortical dysplasia, and enhanced cortical excitability. We have observed reduced number of cells expressing GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) in the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate area, as well as fewer parvalbumin-expressing cells in the anterior cingulate cortex in Lis1/sLis1 mutants compared to control mice. The cFOS protein expression (indicative of neuronal activity) in Lis1/sLis1 mice was higher in the medial prefrontal (mPFC), perirhinal (PERI), entorhinal (ENT), ectorhinal (ECT) cortices, and hippocampus compared to control mice. Our results suggest that deleting the first coding exon of the Lis1 gene might cause cortical anomalies associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

AB  - Progestin-only long-acting reversible-contraceptive (pLARC)-exposed endometria displays decidualized human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) and hyperdilated thin-walled fragile microvessels. The combination of fragile microvessels and enhanced tissue factor levels in decidualized HESCs generates excess thrombin, which contributes to abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) by inducing inflammation, aberrant angiogenesis, and proteolysis. The- zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16) has been reported as an essential regulator of decidualization. Microarray studies have demonstrated that ZBTB16 levels are induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and etonogestrel (ETO) in cultured HESCs. We hypothesized that pLARC-induced ZBTB16 expression contributes to HESC decidualization, whereas prolonged enhancement of ZBTB16 levels triggers an inflammatory milieu by inducing pro-inflammatory gene expression and tissue-factor-mediated thrombin generation in decidualized HESCs. Thus, ZBTB16 immunostaining was performed in paired endometria from pre- and post-depo-MPA (DMPA)-administrated women and oophorectomized guinea pigs exposed to the vehicle, estradiol (E-2), MPA, or E-2 + MPA. The effect of progestins including MPA, ETO, and levonorgestrel (LNG) and estradiol + MPA + cyclic-AMP (E-2 + MPA + cAMP) on ZBTB16 levels were measured in HESC cultures by qPCR and immunoblotting. The regulation of ZBTB16 levels by MPA was evaluated in glucocorticoid-receptor-silenced HESC cultures. ZBTB16 was overexpressed in cultured HESCs for 72 h followed by a & PLUSMN; 1 IU/mL thrombin treatment for 6 h. DMPA administration in women and MPA treatment in guinea pigs enhanced ZBTB16 immunostaining in endometrial stromal and glandular epithelial cells. The in vitro findings indicated that: (1) ZBTB16 levels were significantly elevated by all progestin treatments; (2) MPA exerted the greatest effect on ZBTB16 levels; (3) MPA-induced ZBTB16 expression was inhibited in glucocorticoid-receptor-silenced HESCs. Moreover, ZBTB16 overexpression in HESCs significantly enhanced prolactin (PRL), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), and tissue factor (F3) levels. Thrombin-induced interleukin 8 (IL-8) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA levels in control-vector-transfected HESCs were further increased by ZBTB16 overexpression. In conclusion, these results supported that ZBTB16 is enhanced during decidualization, and long-term induction of ZBTB16 expression by pLARCs contributes to thrombin generation through enhancing tissue factor expression and inflammation by enhancing IL-8 and PTGS2 levels in decidualized HESCs.

AB  - The study investigated the prophylactic efficacy of Quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosiderich fraction (Q3G-RF) from Spondias mombin leaves on oxidative and neuronal damages in the brain sections of dichlorvos (DDVP)-treated female Wistar rats. Female Wistar rats assigned into 5 groups of 12 rats each were orally treated with appropriate regimens. Group 1 received sunflower oil. Group 2 received DDVP (8.8 mg/kg). Group 3 received Q3G-RF (100 mg/kg). Group 4 received DDVP + Q3G-RF (50 mg/kg). Group 5 received DDVP + Q3G-RF (100 mg/kg). Q3G-RF reversed DDVP-induced cognitive deficits in the rats and reversed rearing activity impairment; it protected against the following DDVP-induced activities: inhibition of cholinesterases (acetylcholinestere (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)), elevated marker-enzymes (acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH), dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP-IV), prolyl oligopeptidase (POP)), oxidative stress (total thiol, malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), reduced glutathione and the activities glutathione S-transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase), inflammation (myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)), and apoptosis (caspase-3) in the hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex of the experimental rats exposed to DDVP (p < 0.05). Conclusively, the neuroprotective effects of Q3G-RF on DDVP-induced toxicity in the hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex in brain of rats suggests its potent antioxidant, prophylactic, and chemotherapeutic properties.

AB  - Early life maternal separation (MS) increases the vulnerability to depression in rats with chronic mild stress (CMS). N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) improved depressive behaviors in rats with acute stress; however, their effects on rats with MS+ CMS were not apparent. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that lifetime n-3 PUFA supplementation improves post-menopausal depression through the serotonergic and glutamatergic pathways while modulating n-3 PUFA-derived metabolites. Female rats were fed diets of either 0% n-3 PUFA during lifetime or 1% energy n-3 PUFA during pre-weaning, post-weaning, or lifetime periods. Rats were allocated to non-MS or MS groups and underwent CMS after ovariectomy. N-3 PUFA in-creased brain n-3 PUFA-derived endocannabinoid/oxylipin levels, and reversed depressive behaviors. N-3 PUFA decreased blood levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone, and brain expressions of corticotropin-releasing factor and miRNA-218, which increased the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor. N-3 PUFA decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, and prostaglandin E-2, while increased the expression of miRNA-155. N-3 PUFA also increased brainstem serotonin levels and hippocampal expression of the serotonin-1A receptor, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), phospho-CREB, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. However, n-3 PUFA did not affect brain expression of a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl4-isoxazole propionate receptor subtype 1, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B, or miRNA-132. Moreover, n-3 PUFA exposure during lifetime caused greater effects than pre- and post-weaning periods. The present study suggested that n-3 PUFA improved depressive behaviors through serotonergic path-way while modulating the metabolites of n-3 PUFA in post-menopausal depressed rats with chronic stress.

AB  - Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) is utilized to treat depression but may cause learning/memory impairments, which may be ameliorated by anesthetics through the modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Given that synaptic plasticity is governed by aerobic glycolysis, it remains unclear whether anesthetics modulate aerobic glycolysis to enhance learning and memory function. Depression-like behavior in rats was induced by chronic mild unpredictable stress (CUMS), with anhedonia assessed via sucrose preference test (SPT). Depressive-like behaviors and spatial learning/memory were assessed with forced swim test (FST), open field test (OFT), and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Changes in aerobic glycolysis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal region of depressive-like rats post-ECS were documented using immunofluorescence analysis, Western blot, Lactate Assay Kit and transmission electron microscopy. Both the OFT and FST indicated that ECS was effective in alleviating depressive-like behaviors. The MWM test demonstrated that anesthetics were capable of attenuating ECS-induced learning and memory deficits. Immunofluorescence analysis, Western blot, Lactate Assay Kit and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the decline in learning and memory abilities in ECS-induced depressive-like rats was correlated with decreased aerobic glycolysis, and that the additional use of ciprofol or propofol ameliorated these alterations. Adding the glycolysis inhibitor 2-DG diminished the ameliorative effects of the anesthetic. No significant difference was observed between ciprofol and propofol in enhancing aerobic glycolysis in astrocytes and synaptic plasticity after ECS. These findings may contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which anesthetic drugs modulate learning and memory impairment after ECS in depressive-like behavior rats.

AB  - The hippocampus (HPC) supports spatial working memory (SWM) through its interactions with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, it is not clear whether and how the dorsal (dHPC) and ventral (vHPC) poles of the HPC make distinct contributions to SWM and whether they differentially influence the PFC. To address this question, we optogenetically silenced the dHPC or the vHPC while simultaneously recording from the PFC of mice performing a SWM task. We found that whereas both HPC subregions were necessary during the encoding phase of the task, only the dHPC was necessary during the choice phase. Unexpectedly, silencing of either subregion did not affect PFC neurons' ability to represent the animal's position, but did alter how it was represented. In contrast, only silencing of the vHPC affected their coding of spatial goals. These results thus reveal distinct contributions of the dorsal and ventral HPC poles to SWM and the coding of behaviorally relevant spatial information by PFC neurons.

AB  - As an all-inorganic solid state lighting material, phosphor-in-glass (PiG) receives much attention in high-power white lighting. However, poor heat-dissipation performance and low color rendering index (Ra) caused by low doping concentration of phosphor limit its application in white laser diodes (wLDs). Herein, phosphor-in-glass films on sapphire (PiFS) with heat-conducting properties and high Ra were newly synthesized via screen printing technology, which is highly desired for high-power wLEDs/wLDs. The interfacial corrosion product of CaWO4 between nitride phosphor (CaAlSiN3:Eu2+) and borosilicate glass (BS-glass) was found and investigated in detail firstly to determine the sintering temperature. Laminated structure of PiFS with red layer inside and green layer outside was intentionally designed to effectively avoid "reabsorption" effect between the red and green emitting phosphors. Compared with the opposite laminated structure, the PiFS exhibited the higher luminance efficiency (LE) and better optical properties (Ra = 85, CCT = 5362, CIE = (0.3348, 0.3156)) in wLDs. Notably, the adjustable optical characteristics can be achieved by changing the concentration of phosphor, the number of printing layers and the driving current for the application of PiFS in wLED and wLDs. High quality white light in wLED with CIE coordinates (0.3679, 0.3648) was also acquired and showed the excellent color rendering property (Ra = 90.8) and low color correlated temperature (CCT = 4280 K). Further, the working temperature of PiFS stabilized at 47 degrees C when applied in wLDs (1 W), which greatly prevented the phenomenon of "thermal quenching" for the phosphors caused by high temperature under high power LDs. Thus, high Ra PiFS prepared by this strategy has better heat dissipation and optical properties than PiG, indicating a prospective application in high-power white LEDs/LDs. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BackgroundOsteoporosis, resulting from an imbalance between osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation, affects millions globally. Recent studies have identified type H vessels (CD31hiEMCNhi) as a specialized subset of bone blood vessels that positively regulate bone formation. This study aims to investigate the effects of metformin on bone mass, strength, and angiogenesis in osteoporotic mice, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, particularly focusing on the YAP1/TAZ-HIF1 alpha axis.MethodsOsteoporotic mice were administered metformin, and bone mass and strength were measured. In vivo and in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed under hypoxic conditions. Expression levels of YAP1/TAZ and HIF1 alpha were assessed in femoral metaphysis and hypoxia-cultured human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs). Small interfering RNA was used to interfere with HIF1 alpha or YAP1/TAZ expression in hypoxia-cultured HMECs. Additionally, we employed AAV-mediated overexpression of YAP1/TAZ in vivo to determine whether elevated YAP1/TAZ levels alter metformin's effects on bone mass and angiogenesis.ResultsMetformin significantly enhanced bone mass and strength in osteoporotic mice. It also promoted angiogenesis under hypoxia conditions both in vivo and in vitro. Metformin reduced YAP1/TAZ expression while increasing HIF1 alpha expression in both the femoral metaphysis of osteoporotic mice and hypoxia-cultured HMECs. Interference with HIF1 alpha or YAP1/TAZ confirmed that metformin enhances HIF1 alpha and its target genes primarily by inhibiting YAP1/TAZ. Furthermore, overexpression of YAP1/TAZ partially reversed the bone-protective effect of metformin, leading to reduced HIF1 alpha levels and diminished type H vessel formation.ConclusionOur findings suggest that metformin holds promise as a therapeutic agent for osteoporosis by enhancing type H vessel formation through the inhibition of the YAP1/TAZ-HIF1 alpha axis.

AB  - Condition-dependent acoustic signals that potentially reveal information about the signaler's physical or physiological condition are common and important in the animal kingdom. Given the negative effects of parasites on the health and fitness of their hosts, it is reasonable to expect animal acoustic signals to reflect detailed information concerning parasite infection. However, despite previous studies having verified the potential of sexually selected vocalizations to provide information on parasitism based on the correlations between call acoustic properties and parasitism in some animal taxa, less is known about whether acoustic signals used in a non-sexual context also reflect parasite infection especially for highly vocal bats. We thus investigated the relationships between the acoustic properties of distress calls and echolocation pulses and the infestation intensity of gamasid mites and bat flies in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) to determine whether acoustic signals potentially contain information about parasite infection. We found that bats infected with more gamasid mites uttered significantly shorter echolocation pulses, suggesting that echolocation pulses may contain information on the intensity of mite infection. Additionally, bats infected with more gamasid mites emitted distress calls with narrower bandwidth, while bats with more bat flies emitted calls with longer pause duration. These results suggest that distress calls may not only reflect a signaler's parasite infection intensity but also may provide information concerning infection with specific parasites. In short, our findings suggest that acoustic signals of bats potentially reflect detailed information about parasite infection.

AB  - Honeybee venom has recently been considered an anti-neurodegenerative agent, primarily due to its anti-inflammatory effects. The natural accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) in the brain is reported to be the natural cause of aging neural ability downfall, and oxidative stress is the main route by which A beta ignites its neural toxicity. Anti-neural oxidative stress is considered an effective approach for neurodegenerative therapy. To date, it is unclear how bee venom ameliorates neuronal cells in oxidative stress induced by A beta. Here, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of bee venom on A beta-induced neural oxidative stress in both HT22 cells and an animal model. Our results indicate that bee venom protected HT22 cells against apoptosis induced by A beta(1-42). This protective effect was explained by the increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2), consequently upregulating the production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a critical cellular instinct antioxidant enzyme that neutralizes excessive oxidative stress. Furthermore, bee venom treatment activated the tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB)/cAMP response element-binding (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is closely related to the promotion of cellular antioxidant defense and neuronal functions. A mouse model with cognitive deficits induced by A beta(1-42) intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections was also used. Bee venom enhanced animal cognitive ability and enhanced neural cell genesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis of animal brain tissue and serum confirmed that bee venom reduced oxidative stress, cholinergic system activity, and intercellular neurotrophic factor regulation, which were all adversely affected by A beta(1-42). Our study demonstrates that bee venom exerts antioxidant and neuroprotective actions against neural oxidative stress caused by A beta(1-42,) thereby promoting its use as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Health damage caused by environmental arsenic pollution has attracted widespread attention, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) thought to be one of the adverse effects of long-term arsenic exposure. In this study, we sought to investigate the relationship between arsenic exposure and AD-like neurodegeneration and to determine the role of microglia in the process of AD-like neurodegeneration induced by arsenic exposure. The relationship between arsenic exposure and AD-like neurodegeneration was investigated using cognitive assessments and biological experiments. Arsenic exposure induced memory impairment in C57BL/6 mice and resulted in a significant increase in the number of A beta+ and pTau+ cells in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus with neuronal granular vacuolar degeneration and necroptosis, accompanied by upregulated expression of related proteins, which showed dose-and time-response relationships. Arsenic exposure intensified memory decline in FAD4T mice with accelerated AD-like neurodegeneration. Correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between memory impairment and neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in mice. Arsenic exposure also activated microglia in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, with enlargement of the cytosol, shortened and thickened cell protrusions, hypertrophic changes, and abnormal proliferation, as well as upregulated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Arsenic exposure induced overactivation of microglia in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus of FAD4T mice, resulting in de-branching or bulbous protrusions and fragmented cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that arsenic exposure promotes the occurrence and development of AD-like neurodegeneration via the activation of microglia, which induces neuroinflammation in mice.

AB  - Background: Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome in which diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative disorders occur as a result of Wolframin deficiency and increased ER stress. In addition, WFS1 deficiency leads to calcium homeostasis disturbances and can change mitochondrial dynamics. The aim of this study was to evaluate protein levels and changes in gene transcription on human WFS cell model under experimental ER stress.
   Methods: We performed transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on WFS human cell model-skin fibroblasts reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and then into neural stem cells (NSC) with subsequent ER stress induction using tunicamycin (TM). Results were cross-referenced with publicly available RNA sequencing data in hippocampi and hypothalami of mice with WFS1 deficiency.
   Results: Proteomic analysis identified specific signal pathways that differ in NSC WFS cells from healthy ones. Next, detailed analysis of the proteins involved in the mitochondrial function showed the down-regulation of subunits of the respiratory chain complexes in NSC WFS cells, as well as the up-regulation of proteins involved in Krebs cycle and glycolysis when compared to the control cells. Based on pathway enrichment analysis we concluded that in samples from mice hippocampi the mitochondrial protein import machinery and OXPHOS were significantly down-regulated.
   Conclusions: Our results show the functional and morphological secondary mitochondrial damage in patients with WFS.

AB  - Background: Gintonin is an exogenous ginseng-derived G-protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand. LPA induces in vitro morphological changes and migration through neuronal LPA1 receptor. Recently, we reported that systemic administration of gintonin increases blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability via the paracellular pathway and its binding to brain neurons. However, little is known about the influences of gintonin on in vivo neuron morphology and migration in the brain.
   Materials and methods: We examined the effects of gintonin on in vitro migration and morphology using primary hippocampal neural precursor cells (hNPC) and in vivo effects of gintonin on adult brain neurons using real time microscopic analysis and immunohistochemical analysis to observe the morphological and locational changes induced by gintonin treatment.
   Results: We found that treating hNPCs with gintonin induced morphological changes with a cell rounding following cell aggregation and return to individual neurons with time relapses. However, the in vitro effects of gintonin on hNPCs were blocked by the LPA1/3 receptor antagonist, Ki16425, and Rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632. We also examined the in vivo effects of gintonin on the morphological changes and migration of neurons in adult mouse brains using anti-NeuN and -neurofilament H antibodies. We found that acute intravenous administration of gintonin induced morphological and migrational changes in brain neurons. Gintonin induced some migrations of neurons with shortened neurofilament H in the cortex. The in vivo effects of gintonin were also blocked by Ki16425.
   Conclusion: The present report raises the possibility that gintonin could enter the brain and exert its influences on the migration and morphology of adult mouse brain neurons and possibly explains the therapeutic effects of neurological diseases behind the gintonin administration.

AB  - Epicatechin (EPC) is a flavonoid belonging to the family of catechins; it has been described as a powerful scavenger of a wide spectrum of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a modulator of ex vivo sperm vitality. In this study, we assessed the potential protective abilities of EPC on cryopreserved bovine spermatozoa. We focused on conventional quality parameters, as well as the oxidative profile of spermatozoa alongside capacitation patterns, and expression profiles of proteins involved in the process of capacitation. Semen samples were cryopreserved in the presence of 25, 50 or 100 mu mol/L EPC and compared to native semen (negative control) as well as ejaculates frozen in the absence of EPC (positive control). A dose-dependent improvement of conventional sperm quality parameters was observed following EPC administration, particularly in case of the sperm motility, membrane, acrosome and DNA integrity in comparison to the positive control. Experimental groups exposed to all EPC doses presented with a significantly lower proportion of capacitated spermatozoa as opposed to the positive control. While no significant effects of EPC were observed in cases of superoxide production, a significant decrease in the levels of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical were recorded particularly in the experimental groups supplemented with 50 and 100 mu mol/L EPC. Western blot analysis revealed that supplementation of particularly 100 mu mol/L EPC to the semen extender prevented the loss of the cation channel of sperm (CatSper) isoforms 1 and 2, sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) and protein kinase A (PKA), which play important roles in the process of sperm capacitation. In summary, we may hypothesize that EPC is particularly effective in the stabilization of the sperm membrane during the freeze-thaw process through its ability to quench ROS involved in damage to the membrane lipids and to prevent the loss of membrane channels crucial to initiate the process of sperm capacitation. These attributes of EPC provide an additional layer of protection to spermatozoa exposed to low temperatures, which may be translated into a higher post-thaw structural integrity and functional activity of male gametes.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves significant impairments in synaptic plasticity and dendritic spines integrity. Intriguingly, exercise interventions have demonstrated efficacy in enhancing cognitive function. However, the precise molecular mechanisms, particularly the upstream endogenous regulators (such as miRNAs) through which exercise mediates this synaptic improvement, remain unclear. Our findings indicated that 12 weeks of aerobic exercise effectively increased learning and memory, promoted amyloid beta (A beta) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) clearance in early-stage AD. Furthermore, aerobic exercise markedly enhanced dendritic spines density of pyramidal neurons in cortical layers II/III and the hippocampal CA1 region, as well as the expression of synapse-associated proteins such as cAMP response elementbinding protein (CREB), synaptophysin (SYN), and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). Whole genome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify miR-3473e, a target closely related to AD and also a response factor that serves as a key mediator of aerobic exercise benefits. Subsequent findings revealed that miR-3473e was overexpressed in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, whereas aerobic exercise led to a decrease in its expression. Moreover, aerobic exercise enhanced its downstream targets, EPH receptor B2 (EphB2) and solute carrier family 1 member 1 gene (Slc1a1) as well as increased downstream GluN1, GRIA1 and p-GluN2B/GluN2B protein expression levels. In summary, we demonstrate that aerobic exercise can improve synaptic plasticity, and these effects are mediated via suppression of miR-3473e and regulation EphB2-NMDA/ AMPA receptor signaling pathway, underscoring the potential of aerobic exercise to enhance cognitive function in early-stage of AD.

AB  - Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a critical condition that requires rapid and effective intervention. Although thrombin is a widely used hemostatic agent, its efficacy is limited in the harsh environment of the digestive tract, especially in patients with chronic liver disease or coagulation disorders. Current treatment techniques often fall short, particularly when faced with severe blood loss and coagulation challenges. Here, a novel solution: waxberry-inspired smart nanogels that offer a cost-effective, highly efficient, and mechanically stable approach for local hemostasis is presented. Drawing inspiration from the microfibrous structures of waxberry, a waxberry-like nano-silica with a radially fibrous structure is synthesized for effective thrombin loading and release upon emergency. This nano-silica, coated with GelMA, forms a stable nanogel network activated by blue laser during endoscopy. Within just 5 s, the nanogel effectively triggers coagulation, even in patients with coagulation disorders. The formed blood clots are stable enough to withstand the challenging conditions of the digestive tract, preventing secondary bleeding. Upon injection, thrombin rapidly converts fibrinogen to fibrin, creating a secondary network that reinforces clot stability. This dual-network system demonstrates strong adhesive properties and effective hemostasis in the blood of cirrhotic patients, as well as in gastrointestinal bleeding scenarios involving the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum of mini-pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Our study examined the challenges newborn piglets face, comparing those born with growth restriction, those born with low body weight, and those of normal body weight. We aim to understand if their start in life is related to their physical characteristics and whether this affects their chances of survival. We categorized newborn piglets based on their size and physical characteristics immediately after birth. Over three hours, we assigned vitality scores, measured body temperature, and described behaviors such as seeking sow's milk. We found that piglets with growth restrictions had more difficulty keeping warm and feeding than their counterparts with a low and normal body weight at birth. Consequently, they faced a higher mortality rate within the first 24 h after birth. This suggests they need special care to improve their survival and health. Our research highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing the needs of specifically intra-uterine growth-restricted piglets early on to improve the welfare of these growth-restricted piglets.Abstract This observational study explored the early-life challenges of intra-uterine growth restricted (IUGR), low birth body weight (LBW), and normal birth body weight (NBW) piglets. The aim was to understand the impact of birth weight and intra-uterine growth restriction phenotype on neonatal survival and behavior. Based on weight and phenotype, piglets were classified as IUGR (n = 32), LBW (n = 34), and NBW (n = 29) immediately after birth. The piglets were litter- and sex-matched. Vitality scores were assigned based on motor activity and breathing and complemented with an assessment of umbilical cord condition, rectal temperature, crown-rump length (CRL), time to reach the udder, time to suckle, colostrum intake, and weight gain over 24 h. Beyond the lower birth weight, reduced CRL, and higher mortality rate, IUGR piglets faced several other challenges compared with LBW and NBW piglets. Growth-impaired piglets often struggled to engage in early feeding behaviors and displayed consistently lower rectal temperatures at 1, 3 and 24 h after birth. IUGR piglets showed inadequate colostrum intake and weight loss, which were also observed for LBW counterparts. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in vitality scores and umbilical cord conditions across the groups. In conclusion, our findings underscore the impact of intra-uterine growth restriction on neonatal piglets, emphasizing the need for specialized care strategies to improve survival and health outcomes in IUGR.

AB  - Although black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis are mostly solitary in the wild, the Hiroshima City Asa Zoological Park (Asa Zoo) has kept a family group together during the daytime, with good reproductive performance over five decades. Management procedures at the zoo include temporary single housing of the mother before and after giving birth, which facilitates maintenance of a compatible family group. We recorded intra-group spatial relationships for 4 years and 4 months, during which time an adult female reared two consecutive calves. During daytime she remained in an enclosure with her new calf, one or two older offspring, and an adult male, the sire of all her offspring. Proximity (within two adult body-lengths) scores between the mother and her two calves were especially high during the first year after birth, and only slightly lower for her older offspring. The adult male had the lowest proximity scores. The spatial relationships were visualized by applying multidimensional scaling (MDS) to the proximity scores. Mother and calves were plotted close to each other, with older offspring slightly farther apart on the two-dimensional MDS representation; the adult male was more distant from the other group members. These findings indicate clear follower-type characteristics in the mother-calf pair and also older immature offspring, albeit to a lesser degree. Although black rhinoceros are generally solitary in the wild, our results duplicate observations of some wild black rhinoceros groups containing an adult female, her calf, and an older immature, with adult males being largely solitary.

AB  - Physiological brain aging is characterized by gradual, substantial changes in cognitive ability, accompanied by chronic activation of the neural immune system. This form of inflammation, termed inflammaging, in the central nervous system is primarily enacted through microglia, the resident immune cells. The endocannabinoid system, and particularly the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), is a major regulator of the activity of microglia and is upregulated under inflammatory conditions. Here, we elucidated the role of the CB2R in physiological brain aging. We used CB2R-/- mice of progressive ages in a behavioral test battery to assess social and spatial learning and memory. This was followed by detailed immunohistochemical analysis of microglial activity and morphology, and of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. CB2R deletion decreased social memory in young mice, but did not affect spatial memory. In fact, old CB2R-/- mice had a slightly improved social memory, whereas in WT mice we detected an age-related cognitive decline. On a cellular level, CB2R deletion increased lipofuscin accumulation in microglia, but not in neurons. CB2R-/- microglia showed an increase of activity markers Iba1 and CD68, and minor upregulation in tnfa and il6 expression and downregulation of ccl2 with age. This was accompanied by a change in morphology as CB2R-/- microglia had smaller somas and lower polarity, with increased branching, cell volume, and tree length. We present that CB(2)Rs are involved in cognition and age-induced microglial activity, but may also be important for microglial activation itself.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of proanthocyanidin-rich fraction (PRF) of Vitis vinifera seed extract on the markers of hippocampal-dependent memory in convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) rat model. One hundred juvenile Wistar rats were randomized into 6 groups. Group 1 (n = 10) received propylene glycol (PG 0.1 ml/100 g) intraperitoneally (i.p), while convulsion was induced in groups 2-6 (n = 18 each) using lithium (127 mg/kg i.p) and pilocarpine hydrochloride (40 mg/kg i.p). The established CSE rats in groups 2-6 received a daily treatment of PG (0.1 ml i.p), PRF (30 mg/kg i.p), PRF (20 mg/kg BW i.p), PRF (10 mg/kg BW i.p) or diazepam (5 mg/kg BW i.p) for seven days. Thereafter, they were kept untreated but with access to feed and water for 21 days. The control and CSE-treated rats were subjected to beha-vioral tests, while the biochemical and histomorphological evaluations of the hippocampus were done after the sacrifice. The results were presented as mean +/- SEM in graphs or tables. The level of significance was considered when p < 0.05. There was significant decrease in the hippocampal-dependent memory, hippocampal weight and an increased malondialdehyde concentration following CSE. The activities of acetylcholinesterase decreased significantly in the PRF-treated CSE rats. The hippocampal glial cells and granule count increased signif-icantly following CSE, with various neurodegenerative features in the CA1 of the hippocampus. These derangements were attenuated significantly following PRF treatment. Memory impairment following CSE may be attenuated with the administration of PRF from V. vinifera seed in rats.

AB  - Febrile seizures (FSs) in early life are significant risk factors of neurological disorders and cognitive impairment in later life. However, existing data about the impact of FSs on the developing brain are conflicting. We aimed to investigate morphological and functional changes in the hippocampus of young rats exposed to hyperthermia-induced seizures at postnatal day 10. We found that FSs led to a slight morphological disturbance. The cell numbers decreased by 10% in the CA1 and hilus but did not reduce in the CA3 or dentate gyrus areas. In contrast, functional impairments were robust. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA3-CA1 synapses was strongly reduced, which we attribute to the insufficient activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Using whole-cell recordings, we found higher desensitization of NMDAR currents in the FS group. Since the desensitization of NMDARs depends on subunit composition, we analyzed NMDAR current decays and gene expression of subunits, which revealed no differences between control and FS rats. We suggest that an increased desensitization is due to insufficient activation of the glycine site of NMDARs, as the application of D-serine, the glycine site agonist, allows the restoration of LTP to a control value. Our results reveal a new molecular mechanism of FS impact on the developing brain.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment disorder that mainly arises due to abnormalities in different brain regions, resulting in behavioral deficits. Besides its diverse phenotypical features, ASD is associated with complex and varied etiology, presenting challenges in understanding its precise neuropathophysiology. Pioglitazone was reported to have a fundamental role in neuroprotection in various other neurological disorders. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of pioglitazone in the prenatal valproic acid (VPA)-model of ASD in Wistar rats. Pregnant female Wistar rats received VPA on Embryonic day (E.D12.5) to induce autistic-like-behavioral and neurobiological alterations in their offspring. VPAexposed rats presented core behavioral symptoms of ASD such as deficits in social interaction, poor spatial and learning behavior, increased anxiety, locomotory and repetitive activity, and decreased exploratory activity. Apart from these, VPA exposure also stimulated neurochemical and histopathological neurodegeneration in various brain regions. We administered three different doses of pioglitazone i.e., 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg in rats to assess various parameters. Of all the doses, our study highlighted that 10 mg/kg pioglitazone efficiently attenuated the autistic symptoms along with other neurochemical alterations such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. Moreover, pioglitazone significantly attenuated the neurodegeneration by restoring the neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Taken together, our study suggests that pioglitazone exhibits therapeutic potential in alleviating behavioral abnormalities induced by prenatal VPA exposure in rats. However, further research is needed to fully understand and establish pioglitazone's effectiveness in treating ASD.

AB  - With the popularity of takeaway and processed food, combined exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA) and high fat diet (HFD) is becoming increasingly common. BPA or HFD intake in children could impair learning and memory ability, but the combined effect and mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we fed young male mice with 0.1 mu g/mL BPA (L-BPA), 0.2 mu g/mL BPA (H-BPA), 60 %HFD (HFD), 0.1 BPA + HFD (L-BPA + HFD) and 0.2 BPA + HFD (H-BPA + HFD) for 8 weeks. The results showed that recognition memory and free exploration of mice were impaired in the BPA or HFD group, and the damage of exploration was more severe in the combined group. All treated groups showed morphological changes in hippocampal neurons. The levels of synaptic structural protein PSD-95 and SYN were reduced in BPA and HFD alone or in combination groups. BPA or HFD led to changes in autophagy levels in the hippocampus, manifested by decreased protein levels of mTOR and P62, increased level of LC3B, and more significant changes in the combined group. The BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/AKT pathway was inhibited in BPA or HFD groups, especially in the combined group. Our results suggested that combined BPA with HFD exposure could impair learning and memory ability, and the combined effect might be related to the BDNF/ TrkB/PI3K/AKT pathway, which regulated mTOR mediated autophagy and finally caused hippocampal synaptic damage.

AB  - Although the peripheral nervous system lacks a dedicated receptor, the brain processes temporal information through different sensory channels. A critical question is whether temporal information from different sensory modalities at different times forms modalityspecific representations or is integrated into a common representation in a supramodal manner. Behavioral studies on temporal memory mixing and the central tendency effect have provided evidence for supramodal temporal representations. We aimed to provide electrophysiological evidence for this proposal by employing a cross-modality time discrimination task combined with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The task maintained a fixed auditory standard duration, whereas the visual comparison duration was randomly selected from the short and long ranges, creating two different audio-visual temporal contexts. The behavioral results showed that the point of subjective equality (PSE) in the short context was significantly lower than that in the long context. The EEG results revealed that the amplitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV) in the short context was significantly higher (more negative) than in the long context in the early stage, while it was lower (more positive) in the later stage. These results suggest that the audiovisual temporal context is integrated with the auditory standard duration to generate a subjective time criterion. Compared with the long context, the subjective time criterion in the short context was shorter, resulting in earlier decision-making and a preceding decrease in CNV. Our study provides electrophysiological evidence that temporal information from different modalities inputted into the brain at different times can form a supramodal temporal representation.

AB  - Baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has been recognized as a potent protein expression system in engineering valuable enzymes and vaccines. Various fusion tags facilitate protein purification, leaving the potential risk to influence the target protein???s biological activity negatively. It is of great interest to consider removing the additional tags using site-specific proteases, such as human rhinoviruses (HRV) 3C protease. The current study validated the cleavage activity of 3C protease in Escherichia coli and silkworm-BEVS systems by mixing the cell or fat body lysates of 3C protein and 3C site containing target protein in vitro. Further verification has been performed in the fat body lysate from co-expression of both constructs, showing remarkable cleavage efficiency in vivo silkworm larvae. We also achieved the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag-cleaved product of the VP15 protein from the White spot syndrome virus after purification, suggesting that we successfully established a coinfection-based recognition-and-reaction BEVS platform for the tag-free protein engineering.

AB  - The oscillatory patterns of electroencephalography (EEG), during resting states, are informative and helpful in understanding the functional states of brain network and their contribution to behavioral performances. The aim of this study is to characterize the functional brain network alterations in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). To this end, rsEEG signals were recorded before and after a cognitive task. Functional connectivity metrics were calculated using debiased weighted phase lag index (DWPLI). Topological features of the functional connectivity network were analyzed using both the classical graph approach and minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. Subsequently, the network and connectivity values together with Mini-Mental State Examination cognitive test were used as features to classify the participants. Results showed that: (1) across the pre-task condition, in the theta band, the aMCI group had a significantly lower global mean DWPLI than the control group; the functional connectivity patterns were different in the left hemisphere between two groups; the aMCI group showed significantly higher average clustering coefficient and the remarkably lower global efficiency than the control. (2) Analysis of graph measures under post-task resting state, unveiled that for the percentage change of post-task vs. pre-task in beta EEG, a significant increase in tree hierarchy was observed in aMCI group (2.41%) than in normal control (-3.89%); (3) Furthermore, the classification analysis of combined measures of functional connectivity, brain topology, and MMSE test showed improved accuracy compared to the single method, for which the connectivity patterns and graph metrics were used as separate inputs. The classification accuracy obtained for the case of post-task resting state was 87.2%, while the one achieved under pre-task resting state was found to be 77.7%. Therefore, the functional network alterations in aMCI patients were more prominent during the post-task resting state. This study suggests that the disintegration observed in MCI functional network during the resting states, preceding and following a task, might be possible biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction in aMCI patients.

AB  - Microencapsulating pancreatic islets in immunoprotective alginate hydrogels is a promising strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, this strategy is limited by inflammation and hypoxia mediated oxidative stress, due to encapsulation and the hydrogel itself, leading to impaired insulin secretion and limited short and long term cell survival. Herein, the antioxidant effect of fucoidan, an algae derived polysaccharide, on beta cells, and its positive effects on encapsulated beta cell viability and function is presented. Fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus (FF) exhibits a high total antioxidant capacity, and free radical scavenging activity, and is able to significantly alleviate intracellular oxidative stress in rat insolinoma beta cells (INS1E). In addition, FF significantly increases insulin secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When FF is incorporated in ultrapure alginate used for microencapsulation of primary rat islets, both viability and glucose responsiveness of rat islets in these socalled Fucogel microcapsules (Fucocaps) are found to be significantly higher compared to islets encapsulated in alginate alone. Similar results are obtained with INS1E pseudoislets and neonatal pig islets. Fucocaps can provide a redox-modulatory niche and an immune barrier for islets and beta cells in the same time leading to significantly improved survival and endocrine function by mitigating oxidative strees.

AB  - Various preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the robust wound healing capacity of the natural anticoagulant activated protein C (APC). A bioengineered APC variant designated 3K3A-APC retains APC's cytoprotective cell signalling actions with <10% anticoagulant activity. This study was aimed to provide preclinical evidence that 3K3A-APC is efficacious and safe as a wound healing agent. 3K3A-APC, like wild-type APC, demonstrated positive effects on proliferation of human skin cells (keratinocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts). Similarly it also increased matrix metollaproteinase-2 activation in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Topical 3K3A-APC treatment at 10 or 30 mu g both accelerated mouse wound healing when culled on Day 11. And at 10 mu g, it was superior to APC and had half the dermal wound gape compared to control. Further testing was conducted in excisional porcine wounds due to their congruence to human skin. Here, 3K3A-APC advanced macroscopic healing in a dose-dependent manner (100, 250 and 500 mu g) when culled on Day 21. This was histologically corroborated by greater collagen maturity, suggesting more advanced remodelling. A non-interference arm of this study found no evidence that topical 3K3A-APC caused either any significant systemic side-effects or any significant leakage into the circulation. However the female pigs exhibited transient and mild local reactions after treatments in week three, which did not impact healing. Overall these preclinical studies support the hypothesis that 3K3A-APC merits future human wound studies.

AB  - Simple Summary Within recent decades, the reproductive performance of sows has risen enormously thanks to efforts in breeding, i.e., litter sizes with more than 15-16 piglets. These changes in litter size have had considerable effects on the individual birth weights of piglets, as well as on the variation in birth weights within a litter (e.g., proportion of "underweight" newborns). The present study showed that the energy and protein accumulation in the fetus and placenta increased by about 75% and 64%, respectively, in comparison to studies as far as 30 years ago, in which the litter size varied around 10-12 piglets. Also, the newborn piglets with a body weight of 1.0 kg scarcely have impaired chances of survival, which is reflected in their normal energy content. On the other hand, the energy and nutrient supply for high yielding sows at the end of gestation must be significantly augmented, as the main influencing factors, namely energy and protein accretion, have increased considerably due to the marked higher masses of fetuses. The present study aimed to quantify and update the data on the body composition (energy nutrients) of newborn piglets of different body weights at the time of birth, as well as of the placenta mass. Data were collected from newborn piglets (n = 25) from modern genetic lines which were stillborn or died within the first 24 h of life after being crushed to death with various body weights at birth (<0.8 kg (n = 5); 0.8-1.2 kg (n = 5); >1.2-1.6 kg (common birth weight, n = 10) and >1.6 kg (n = 5)). The placenta (n = 20) of sows from a conventional breeding farm were collected, too. The body composition of newborns of "normal" (>1.2-1.6 kg) and even lighter (0.8-1.2) weights still indicated a "normal" composition. In the case of a lower body weight of piglets <0.8 kg at birth, the crude ash (24.1%) and crude protein (8.21%) contents were higher, but the crude fat (16.1%), carbohydrate (57.4%), and gross energy (3.60%) contents were lower. The placental composition in comparison to the piglet body composition was characterized by higher crude protein contents (24.3%) and lower crude ash (31.6%), crude fat (9.08%), and carbohydrate (55.6%) contents. In conclusion, the energy and protein accumulation in the total mass of fetuses and placentas increased by 75% and 64%, respectively, in comparison to times in which the litter size varied around 10-12 piglets, essentially as a result of the larger fetal mass and not of a different body composition.

AB  - Positron emission tomography (PET) allows biomolecular tracking but PET monitoring of brain networks has been hampered by a lack of suitable reporters. Here, we take advantage of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, ecDHFR, and its unique antagonist, TMP, to facilitate in vivo imaging in the brain. Peripheral administration of radiofluorinated and fluorescent TMP analogs enabled PET and intravital microscopy, respectively, of neuronal ecDHFR expression in mice. This technique can be used to the visualize neuronal circuit activity elicited by chemogenetic manipulation in the mouse hippocampus. Notably, ecDHFR-PET allows mapping of neuronal projections in non-human primate brains, demonstrating the applicability of ecDHFR-based tracking technologies for network monitoring. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of TMP analogs for PET studies of turnover and self-assembly of proteins tagged with ecDHFR mutants. These results establish opportunities for a broad spectrum of previously unattainable PET analyses of mammalian brain circuits at the molecular level.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a category of pervasive disorders of the developing nervous system with few or no recognized biomarkers. A significant portion of the risk for NDDs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is contributed by the environment, and exposure to pyrethroid pesticides during pregnancy has been identified as a potential risk factor for NDD in the unborn child. We recently showed that low-dose developmental exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin in mice causes male-biased changes to ADHD- and NDD-relevant behaviors as well as the striatal dopamine system. Here, we used an integrated multiomics approach to determine the broadest possible set of biological changes in the mouse brain caused by developmental pyrethroid exposure (DPE). Using a litter-based, split-sample design, we exposed mouse dams during pregnancy and lactation to deltamethrin (3 mg/kg or vehicle every 3 days) at a concentration well below the EPA-determined benchmark dose used for regulatory guidance. We raised male offspring to adulthood, euthanized them, and pulverized and divided whole brain samples for split-sample transcriptomics, kinomics, and multiomics integration. Transcriptome analysis revealed alterations to multiple canonical clock genes, and kinome analysis revealed changes in the activity of multiple kinases involved in synaptic plasticity, including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK. Multiomics integration revealed a dysregulated protein-protein interaction network containing primary clusters for MAP kinase cascades, regulation of apoptosis, and synaptic function. These results demonstrate that DPE causes a multimodal biophenotype in the brain relevant to ADHD and identifies new potential mechanisms of action. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we provide the first evidence that low-dose developmental exposure to a pyrethroid pesticide, deltamethrin, results in molecular disruptions in the adult mouse brain in pathways regulating circadian rhythms and neuronal growth (MAP kinase). This same exposure causes a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD)-relevant behavioral change in adult mice, making these findings relevant to the prevention of NDDs.

AB  - The POU2F1 gene, which plays an important role in regulating the mammalian genome and development, has both a ubiquitous (U) and a tissue-specific (L) promoter and is subject to intricate regulation. Regions of POU2F1 gene were found to contain multiple binding sites for its product POU2F1 (Oct-1), a transcription factor. Interspecies homology in these regions was found to exceed 90% among the human, mouse, rat, pig, and dog genomes, almost all of the Oct-1 binding sites being identical. Some of the sites cluster in the vicinity of each of the two alternative promoters, while others are in the 5' noncoding region 6 kb upstream of the transcription start site. The presence of Oct-1 at the sites was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). A POU2F1 knockdown activated the U promoter and downregulated the L promoter in Namalwa cells, while Oct-1 overexpression exerted an opposite effect. Thus, Oct-1 acts via negative feedback to autoregulate the U promoter through low-affinity Oct-1 binding sites and positive feedback to autoregulate the L promoter through high-affinity canonical (oct) sites when increasing in concentration in a natural context.

AB  - -We studied the mutual influence of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSC) isolated from human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly and primary culture of hippocampal cell from transgenic (Tg) 5XFAD mice, a model of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Antibodies to human nuclear antigen were used to identify MMSCs in "chimeric culture"; the cells belonging to neurons or astrocytes were determined by the presence of positive immunoreactivity to marker proteins MAP2 and GFAP. It was shown that the result of the interaction depends on both the cocultivation method and the age of the culture. In indirect (non-contact) cocultivation, the aggressive environment of the transgenic culture affected the survival rate and impaired the adhesive properties of the MMSCs. Pretreatment of these cells with stress proteins YB-1 and HSP70, which possess neuroprotective properties, increased the resistance of MMSCs. In young culture during contact cocultivation, the MMSCs play the role of specific strands that promote grouping of hippocampal cells of transgenic mice and formation of neurospheres. In old transgenic cultures, irrespective of the cocultivation method, the MMSCs differentiated into astrocytes, but during prolonged direct cocultivation, a part of MMSCs became immunopositive to the neuronal marker MAP2. The work shows that the interaction between the MMSCs and the hippocampal cell culture can be carried out with the participation of gap junctions as well as due to the formation of nanotubes. The results obtained indicate the presence of a complex relationship between donor MMSCs and recipient cells, which must be taken into account when introducing cell therapy into the practice of treating AD patients.

AB  - The application of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) to the round window membrane (RWM) is an emerging treatment for inner ear diseases. RWM permeability is the key factor for efficient IGF-1 delivery. Ultrasound microbubbles (USMBs) can increase drug permeation through the RWM. In the present study, the enhancing effect of USMBs on the efficacy of IGF-1 application and the treatment effect of USMB-mediated IGF-1 delivery for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were investigated. Forty-seven guinea pigs were assigned to three groups: the USM group, which received local application of recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1, 10 mu g/mu L) following application of USMBs to the RWM; the RWS group, which received IGF-1 application alone; and the saline-treated group. The perilymphatic concentration of rhIGF-1 in the USM group was 1.95- and 1.67- fold of that in the RWS group, 2 and 24 h after treatment, respectively. After 5 h of 118 dB SPL noise exposure, the USM group had the lowest threshold shift in auditory brainstem response, least loss of cochlear outer hair cells, and least reduction in the number of synaptic ribbons on postexposure day 28 among the three groups. The combination of USMB and IGF-1 led to a better therapeutic response to NIHL. Two hours after treatment, the USM group had significantly higher levels of Akt1 and Mapk3 gene expression than the other two groups. The most intense immunostaining for phosphor-AKT and phospho-ERK1/2 was detected in the cochlea in the USM group. These results suggested that USMB can be applied to enhance the efficacy of IGF-1 therapy in the treatment of inner ear diseases.

AB  - Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A.pp, Gram negative) and Streptococcus (S.) suis (Gram positive) can cause severe diseases in pigs. During infection, neutrophils infiltrate to counteract these pathogens with phagocytosis and/or neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs consist of a DNA-backbone spiked with antimicrobial components. The NET formation mechanisms in porcine neutrophils as a response to both of the pathogens are not entirely clear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether A.pp (serotype 2, C3656/0271/11) and S. suis (serotype 2, strain 10) induce NETs by NADPH oxidase- or CD18-dependent mechanisms and to characterize phenotypes of NETs in porcine neutrophils. Therefore, we investigated NET induction in porcine neutrophils in the presence and absence of NET inhibitors and quantified NETs after 3 h. Furthermore, NETosis and phagocytosis were investigated by transmission electron microscopy after 30 min to characterize different phenotypes. A.pp and S. suis induce NETs that are mainly ROS-dependent. A.pp induces NETs that are partially CD18-dependent. Thirty minutes after infection, both of the pathogens induced a vesicular NET formation with only slight differences. Interestingly, some neutrophils showed only NET-marker positive phagolysosomes, but no NET-marker positive vesicles. Other neutrophils showed vesicular NETs and only NET-marker negative phagolysosomes. In conclusion, both of the pathogens induce ROS-dependent NETs. Vesicular NETosis and phagocytosis occur in parallel in porcine neutrophils in response to S. suis serotype 2 and A.pp serotype 2.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and mitochondrial dysfunction play an important role in the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases. Our studies investigated the effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 on jejunal mitochondria and ER in piglets under the LPS-induced intestinal injury model. Eighteen piglets (male, 21 days old) were randomly assigned to three treatments: CON (basal diet), LPS (basal diet +100 mu g/kg LPS), and SC06 + LPS (basal diet +1 x 108 cfu/kg SC06 + 100 mu g/kg LPS). Compared to the LPS group, administration of SC06 improved jejunal morphology and barrier function. In addition, SC06 reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MDA generation in the jejunum by activating the Nrf2/keap1 pathway, which increased the activity of CAT, GSH and SOD in LPS-challenged pigs. In addition, SC06 reduced LPS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ERS as evidenced by a decrease in ROS, an improvement in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in adenosine triphosphate levels. The results of in vitro IPEC-J2 cell experiments also indicate that SC06 can reduce LPS-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, ERS, and intestinal barrier function damage by activating the Nrf2/keap1 signaling pathway. Finally, treatment with the Nrf2-specific inhibitor ML-385 inhibited the upregulated effect of SC06 on antioxidant capacity and intestinal barrier function in IPEC-J2 cells. In conclusion, SC06 ameliorated intestinal damage and mitochondrial dysfunction and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress via activation of the Nrf2/keap1 signaling pathway in LPS-challenged piglets.

AB  - The Upper Cretaceous Iharkut vertebrate locality (Bakony Mountains, Hungary) provided a diverse lizard fauna. In order to infer their food preference, jaw and tooth morphology, as well as dental macro- and microwear, were analysed. Due to preservation, only specimens of three taxa (Chromatogenys, Bicuspidon, 'Scincomorpha indet. A') were studied. Extant lizards, including omnivores, durophages, insectivores, molluscivores and a herbivore, were used as analogies for interpretation. Based on morphological and dental wear studies, Chromatogenys seems to have consumed and processed hard objects regularly with its enlarged posterior teeth. In contrast, Bicuspidon with its complex bicuspid teeth might have fed on both softer and harder food items, and according to dental wear analysis, its diet can be placed between herbivory and insectivory. The sharply pointed teeth and jaw morphology of 'Scincomorpha indet. A' are comparable to recent insectivorous taxa though tooth crown morphology is most similar to burrowing species. This investigation is considered as a pilot study providing insight into the complexity of food chains of the Late Cretaceous Iharkut terrestrial communities. Furthermore, our results clearly demonstrate that the two-dimensional dental microwear analysis works well on the small (tooth crown diameter less than 1 mm) teeth of both extinct and extant lizards.

AB  - Methamphetamine (Meth), a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant with strong neurotoxicity, causes progressive cognitive impairment with characterized neurodegenerative changes. However, the mechanism underlying Meth-induced pathological changes remains poorly understood. In the current study, Meth elicited a striking accumulation of the pathological proteins hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid beta (A beta) in primary hippocampal neurons, while the activation of autophagy dramatically ameliorated the high levels of these pathological proteins. Interestingly, after the Meth treatment, A beta was massively deposited in autophagosomes, which were remarkably trapped in early endosomes. Mechanistically, syntaxin 17 (Stx17), a key soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein responsible for autophagosome and mature endosome/lysosome fusion, was significantly downregulated and hindered in combination with autophagosomes. Notably, adenovirus overexpression of Stx17 in primary neurons facilitated autophagosome-mature endosome/lysosome fusion, which dramatically reversed the Meth-induced increases in the levels of p-tau, A beta, beta-secretase (Bace-1), and C-terminal fragments (CTFs). Immunofluorescence assays showed that Stx17 retarded the Meth-induced A beta, p-tau, and Bace-1 accumulation in autophagosomes and facilitated the translocation of these pathological proteins to lysosomes, which indicated the importance of Stx17 via enhanced autophagosome-mature endosome/lysosome fusion. Therefore, the current study reveals a novel mechanism involving Meth-induced high levels of pathological proteins in neurons. Targeting Stx17 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for Meth-induced neurodegenerative changes.

AB  - Lead is an environmentally widespread neurotoxic pollutant. Although the neurotoxicity of lead has been found to be closely associated with metabolic disorders, the effects of short-chain fatty acids on the neurotoxicity of lead and its mechanisms have not yet been explored. In this study, the results of open field tests and Morris water maze tests demonstrated that chronic lead exposure caused learning and memory deficits and anxiety-like symptoms in mice. The serum butyric acid content of lead-treated mice decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and oral administration of butyrate significantly improved cognitive memory impairment and anxiety symptoms in lead-exposed mice. Moreover, butyrate alleviated neuroinflammation caused by lead exposure by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling in microglia. Butyrate also promoted the expression of acetyl-CoA synthetase ACSS2 in hippocampal neurons, thereby increasing the content of acetyl-CoA and restoring the expression of both histone H3K9ac and the downstream BDNF. We also found that the median butyric acid concentration in high-lead exposure humans was remarkably lower than that in the low-lead exposure humans (45.16 mu g/L vs. 60.92 mu g/L, P < 0.01), and that butyric acid significantly mediated the relationship of lead exposure with the Montreal cognitive assessment scores, with a contribution rate of 27.57 %. In conclusion, our results suggest that butyrate supplementation is a possible therapeutic strategy for lead-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - An environment friendly and cost-effective approach is a major bottleneck in biofuels production from agriculture waste residue. The present study unravels the enzymatic hydrolytic potential of a designed bacterial consortium (SNH-1) comprised of camel rumen derived B. safensis CRN 13, B. subtilis CRN 16, C. braakii CRN 21, B. circulans CRN 24, and P. dendritiformis CRN18. The consortium SNH-1 was evaluated for exo-glucanase (0.29 U/ml), beta-glucosidase (0.69U/ml), beta-glucuronidase (0.29U/ml), endoxylanase (0.79U/ml), arabinosidase (0.62U/ml), alpha-galactosidase (0.36 U/ml), and endoglucanase (0.51U/ml) activity. Genome analysis of consortium members identified 660 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) responsible for breaking the structural intricacy. These include 296 glycoside hydrolase, 19 auxiliary activity, 186 glycosyl transferases, and 37 carbohydrate-binding modules genes. The designed consortium hydrolyzed sugarcane bagasse, wheat straw, and rice straw effectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the pH, temperature, and substrate concentration, which has resulted in a 23% higher saccharification of wheat straw. Further, 6.2% bioethanol production was estimated from wheat straw hydrolysate using S. cerevisiae. The wheat straw saccharification by the designed consortium is a cost-effective, chemical-free, cleaner, and promising approach for producing lignocellulosic bioethanol. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tongmai granules (TMG) is composed of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge., Radix puerariae Lobata., and Ligusticum chuanxiong hort. TMG is mainly used for ischemic cardiovascular, cerebrovascular diseases, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction and cerebral ischemia. TMG is a kind of traditional compound granule, which has a protective effect on brain injury. However, the potential protective mechanism of the TMG has not been elucidated. Aim of the study: TMG has a good effect on brain injury, but its brain protective mechanism is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to confirm the neuroprotective mechanism of TMG, reveal its target genes and identify the active components of TMG. Materials and methods: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to identify the fingerprint of TMG. UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE was used to analyze the base peak intensity (BPI) chromatograms of TMG. TMG was pre administered for one week, brain injury and edema were induced by injection of glutamate (Glu) into the lateral ventricles of rats. HE staining was used to investigate the pathological damage caused by Glu in the hippocampus of rats, and the RNA-seq was used to analyze the changes of different genes before and after TMG treatment. Finally, changes of related proteins were analyzed by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and other molecular biological methods. Dosage of TMG were set to 0.6 g/kg, 1.2 g/kg and 2.4 g/kg. Results: We found that TMG contained many active components, including salvianolic acid, puerarin, ferulic acid, etc. TMG could improve cerebral edema and brain injury induced by Glu. After TMG treatment, differential gene analysis showed that differential genes were significantly enriched in toll-like receptor signaling pathway. qRTPCR validation results were consistent with RNA-Seq analysis results. Combined with Western blot analysis, we found that TMG ultimately regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines by affecting the TLR4/MyD88/ AP-1 pathway. Conclusions: In this study, we combined TMG with RNA-seq analysis to demonstrate that TMG may play a neuroprotective role by regulating Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and down-regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokine. TMG may become a kind of traditional Chinese medicine with neuroprotective potential.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Fangji Huangqi Decoction (FJHQ), a traditional Chinese medicinal formula outlined in Zhang Zhongjing's "Jin Gui Yao Lue" during the Han Dynasty, is often used to treat conditions characterized by symptoms like edema and dysuria, including membranous nephropathy (MN). Despite its proven clinical effectiveness, the exact mechanisms through which FJHQ acts on MN remain elusive. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate whether FJHQ enhances BNIP3-mediated mitophagy in podocytes by promoting BNIP3 expression and whether this improvement leads to the amelioration of MN. Materials and methods: In this study, by establishing passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) rats, an experimental rat model of MN induced by sheep anti -rat Fx1A serum, we evaluated the effects of FJHQ in vivo. In vitro experiments were carried out by treating primary podocytes with experimental rat serum. Furthermore, the potential mechanism by which FJHQ acts through BNIP3 was further examined by transfecting primary podocytes with the siRNA of BNIP3 or the corresponding control vector. Results: After 4 weeks, significant kidney damage was observed in the rats in the model group, comparatively, FJHQ markedly decreased urine volume, 24-h urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Scr), and increased serum total albumin (ALB). Histology showed that FJHQ caused significant improvements in glomerular hyperplasia, and IgG immune complex deposition in MN rats. JC-1 fluorescence labelling and flow cytometry analysis showed that FJHQ could significantly increase mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo. In the mitochondria of MN model rats, FJHQ was able to down-regulate the expression of P62 and up-regulate the expression of BNIP3, LC3B, and LC3 II/LC3 I, according to Western blot and immunofluorescence studies. Furthermore, FJHQ has been shown to significantly up-regulate mitochondrial membrane potential, downregulate P62 expression in mitochondria, and up-regulate the expression of BNIP3, LC3B, and LC3 II/LC3 I in mitochondria at the cellular level. After the administration of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine, the serum of rats treated with FJHQ further increased the expression of LC3 II/LC3 I in primary podocytes, showing higher autophagy flow. After the interference of BNIP3 in podocytes, the effect of FJHQ on mitochondrial membrane potential and autophagy-related proteins almost disappeared. Conclusion: FJHQ enhanced mitophagy in podocytes by promoting the expression of BNIP3, thereby contributing to the amelioration of MN. This work reveals the possible underlying mechanism by which FJHQ improves MN and provides a new avenue for MN treatment.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in understanding the neural and cognitive dynamics that drive sequential decision making in general and foraging behavior in particular. Due to the intrinsic properties of most sequential decision-making paradigms, however, previous research in this area has suffered from the difficulty to disentangle properties of the decision related to (a) the value of switching to a new patch versus, which increases monotonically, and (b) the conflict experienced between choosing to stay or leave, which first increases but then decreases after reaching the point of indifference between staying and switching. Here, we show how the same problems arise in studies of sequential decision-making under risk, and how they can be overcome, taking as a specific example recent research on the 'pig' dice game. In each round of the 'pig' dice game, people roll a die and accumulate rewards until they either decide to proceed to the next round or lose all rewards. By combining simulation-based dissections of the task structure with two experiments, we show how an extension of the standard paradigm, together with cognitive modeling of decision-making processes, allows to disentangle properties related to either switch value or choice conflict. Our study elucidates the cognitive mechanisms of sequential decision making and underscores the importance of avoiding potential pitfalls of paradigms that are commonly used in this research area.
   Author summary
   A large body of work has investigated how people make sequential decisions under risk. For instance, how people decide whether to continue gambling for potentially greater rewards or to cash in to avoid losing everything. Here, we identify a critical confound in this line of research, between (a) the value of switching and (b) the amount of conflict between choosing to stay or switch. Using a previously proposed paradigm (i.e., the pig dice game) as an example, we replicated behavior from a recent study and showed that switch value is highly correlated with choice conflict. By simulating behavior across hypothetical contexts, we then identified and tested novel variants of this task that allow to deconfound switch value and conflict. However, only by means of sequential sampling modeling we could conclude that it is conflict rather than switch value that drives response times in this task. Sequential sampling modeling also shows how the switch value influences other cognitive components in this task.

AB  - Meat quality seems to be influenced by the dietary regimes applied for animal feeding. Several research studies are aimed at improving meat quality, preserving it from oxidative processes, by the incorporation of antioxidant components in animal feeding. The main part of these studies evaluates meat quality, determining different parameters directly on meat, while few research studies take into account what may happen after meat ingestion. To address this topic, in this study, an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion protocol was applied to two different pork muscles, longissimus dorsi and rectus femoris, obtained from pigs fed with different diets. In detail, two groups of 12 animals each were subjected to either a conventional diet or a supplemented diet with extruded linseeds as a source of omega-3 fatty acids and plant extracts as a source of phenolics antioxidant compounds. The digested meat was subjected to an untargeted metabolomics approach. Several metabolites deriving from lipid and protein digestion were detected. Our untargeted approach allowed for discriminating the two different meat cuts, based on their metabolomic profiles. Nonetheless, multivariate statistics allowed clearly discriminating between samples obtained from different animal diets. In particular, the inclusion of linseeds and polyphenols in the animal diet led to a decrease in metabolites generated from oxidative degradation reactions, in comparison to the conventional diet group. In the latter, fatty acyls, fatty aldehydes and oxylipins, as well as cholesterol and vitamin D3 precursors and derivatives, could be highlighted.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying propofol-induced toxicity in developing neurons are still unclear. The aim of present study was to explore the role of Pink1 mediated mitochondria pathway in propofol-induced developmental neurotoxicity. The primary Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) were isolated from the hippocampus of E15.5 mice embryos and then treated with propofol. The effects of propofol on proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, mitochondria ultrastructure and MMP of NSCs were investigated. In addition, the abundance of Pink1 and a group of mitochondria related proteins in the cytoplasm and/or mitochondria were investigated, which mainly included CDK1, Drp1, Parkin1, DJ-1, Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1. Moreover, the relationship between Pink1 and these molecules was explored using gene silencing, or pretreatment with protein inhibitors. Finally, the NSCs were pretreated with mitochondrial specific antioxidant (MitoQ) or Drp1 inhibitor (Mdivi-1), and then the toxic effects of propofol on NSCs were investigated. Our results indicated that propofol treatment inhibited NSCs proliferation and division, and promoted NSCs apoptosis. Propofol induced significant NSCs mitochondria deformation, vacuolization and swelling, and decreased MMP. Additional studies showed that propofol affected a group of mitochondria related proteins via Pink1 inhibition, and CDK1, Drp1, Parkin1 and DJ-1 are the important downstream proteins of Pink1. Finally, the effects of propofol on proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, mitochondrial ultrastructure and MMP of NSCs were significantly attenuated by MitoQ or Mdivi-1 pretreatment. The present study demonstrated that propofol regulates the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of NSCs via Pink1mediated mitochondria pathway.

AB  - Background: Neurofibrillary tangles comprising hyperphosphorylated tau are vital factors associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The elimination or reduction of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally aggregated tau is a valuable measure in AD therapy. Esculentoside A (EsA), isolated from Phytolacca esculenta, exhibits pharmacotherapeutic efficacy in mice with amyloid beta-induced AD. However, whether EsA affects tau pathology and its specific mechanism of action in AD mice remains unclear.
   Purpose: To investigate the roles and mechanisms of EsA in cognitive decline and tau pathology in a triple transgenic AD (3 x Tg-AD) mouse model.
   Methods: EsA (5 and 10 mg/kg) was administered via intraperitoneal injection to 8-month-old AD mice for eight consecutive weeks. Y-maze and novel object recognition tasks were used to evaluate the cognitive abilities of mice. Potential signaling pathways and targets in EsA-treated AD mice were assessed using quantitative proteomic analysis. The NFT levels and hippocampal synapse numbers were investigated using Gallyas-Braak silver staining and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were used to measure the expression of tau-associated proteins.
   Results: EsA administration attenuated memory and recognition deficits and synaptic damage in AD mice. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation proteomic analysis of the mouse hippocampus revealed that EsA modulated the expression of some critical proteins, including brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3, galectin-1, and Ras-related protein 24, whose biological roles are relevant to synaptic function and autophagy. Further research revealed that EsA upregulated AKT/GSK3 beta activity, in turn, inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation and promoted autophagy to clear abnormally phosphorylated tau. In hippocampus-derived primary neurons, inhibiting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity through dorsomorphin could eliminate the effect of EsA, as revealed by increased tau hyperphosphorylation, downregulated activity AKT/GSK3 beta, and blocked autophagy.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that EsA attenuates cognitive decline by targeting the pathways of both tau hyperphosphorylation and autophagic clearance in an AMPK-dependent manner and it shows a high reference value in AD pharmacotherapy research.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate occlusal parameters in patients with myofascial pain with referral before and after soft tissue mobilization. The study group consisted of 50 people (37 females and 13 males, average age 23.36 +/- 2.14 years) diagnosed with myofascial pain with referral. All patients underwent triplicate soft tissue mobilization. Occlusal parameters were evaluated six times, before and after each treatment, using T-scan III. A decreasing tendency of the occlusion time was observed after the first, second, and third therapy. After the third treatment, the mean occlusion time in the entire study group was 0.119 s. The 1st soft tissue mobilization shortened both right and left disclusion times to 0.181 s and 0.185 s, respectively. After the third treatment, these parameters amounted to 0.159 s and 0.165 s, respectively. The Friedman test for the entire study group indicated that soft tissue mobilization altered the occlusion time and both disclusion times (p < 0.05). In conclusion, soft tissue mobilization affects biotensegrity of the masticatory system, thus modifying occlusal parameters. The occlusion time and both disclusion times cannot be considered as cofactors of the existing temporomandibular disorders-myofascial pain with referral.

AB  - Simple Summary: Antibiotic usage in swine husbandry contributes to the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing a serious threat to public health. Consequently, alternative strategies are required to mitigate this issue. In a previous study, we showed that the replacement of metaphylactic antimicrobials with an administration of Ligilactobacillus salivarius MP100 for two years to sows and piglets changed the fecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acid profiles in an intensive pig farm. In this work, we compared the productivity-related data between a 2-year period of routine metaphylactic antibiotherapy and the first 2 years in which such a practice was replaced by the probiotic strain. Subsequently, the composition of the meat of the animals ingesting the probiotic strain was compared to that of animals with a similar diet but receiving metaphylactic antibiotherapy. This probiotic intake did not negatively alter the composition of the meat and was associated with an increase in the concentration of inosine and a slight tendency for increasing the thickness of the subcutaneour lumbar fat and intramuscular fat content. These factors are considered as biomarkers of meat quality and health. Therefore, the substitution of metaphylactic antimicrobials with a daily administration of the probiotic strain was associated with beneficial productivity and quality outcomes.
   The metaphylactic use of antimicrobials in swine farms contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which constitutes a major challenge for public health. Alternative strategies are required to eradicate their routine use. In a previous study, metaphylactic antimicrobials were replaced by the administration of Ligilactobacillus salivarius MP100 to sows and piglets for two years. This practice positively modified the fecal microbiota and metabolic profiles in the farm. In this work, the farm dataset was used to compare the productivity-related parameters between a 2-year period of routine metaphylactic antibiotherapy and the first 2 years of a replacement with the probiotic strain. The probiotic period improved these productivity-related parameters, from litter size to growth performance. In addition, samples of Longissimus lumborum, including skin and subcutaneous fat, were obtained from the animals ingesting the probiotic strain and controls (metaphylactic antibiotherapy) and analyzed for their pH, water holding capacity, composition, and metabolic profiling. The probiotic intake did not negatively affect the meat composition and was associated with an increase in inosine concentration and a slight tendency for increasing the intramuscular fat content. These factors are considered as biomarkers of meat quality. In conclusion, the substitution of metaphylactic antimicrobials with the administration of the probiotic strain was associated with beneficial productivity and meat quality outcomes.

AB  - Background: Political, social, economic, and health system determinants play an important role in creating an enabling environment for maternal and newborn health. This study assesses changes in health systems and policy indicators for maternal and newborn health across 78 low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) during 2008-2018, and examines contextual factors associated with policy adoption and systems changes.Methods: We compiled historical data from WHO, ILO, and UNICEF surveys and databases to track changes in ten maternal and newborn health systems and policy indicators prioritized for tracking by global partnerships. Lo-gistic regression was used to examine the odds of systems and policy change based on indicators of economic growth, gender equality, and country governance with available data from 2008 to 2018.Results: From 2008 to 2018, many LMICs (44/76; 57.9%) substantially strengthened systems and policies for maternal and newborn health. The most frequently adopted policies were national guidelines for kangaroo mother care, national guidelines for use of antenatal corticosteroids, national policies for maternal death noti-fication and review, and the introduction of priority medicines in Essential Medicines Lists. The odds of policy adoption and systems investments were significantly greater in countries that experienced economic growth, had strong female labor participation, and had strong country governance (all p < 0.05).Conclusions: The widespread adoption of priority policies over the past decade is a notable step in creating an environment supportive for maternal and newborn health, but continued leadership and resources are needed to ensure robust implementation that translates into improved health outcomes.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility and safety of subretinal transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells into the healthy margins and within areas of degenerative retina in a swine model of geographic atrophy (GA). Methods: Well-delimited selective outer retinal damage was induced by subretinal injection of NaIO3 into one eye in minipigs (n = 10). Thirty days later, a suspension of hiPSC-derived RPE cells expressing green fluorescent protein was injected into the subretinal space, into the healthy margins, and within areas of degenerative retina. In vivo follow-up was performed by multimodal imaging. Post-mortem retinas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and histology. Results: In vitro differentiated hiPSC-RPE cells showed a typical epithelial morphology, expressed RPE-related genes, and had phagocytic ability. Engrafted hiPSC-RPE cells were detected in 60% of the eyes, forming mature epithelium in healthy retina extending towards the border of the atrophy. Histological analysis revealed RPE interaction with host photoreceptors in the healthy retina. Engrafted cells in the atrophic zone were found in a patchy distribution but failed to form an epithelial-like layer. Conclusions: These results might support the use of hiPSC-RPE cells to treat atrophic GA by providing a housekeeping function to aid the overwhelmed remnant RPE, which might improve its survival and therefore slow down the progression of GA.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Byur dMar Nyer lNga Ril Bu (BdNlRB) is a classic Tibetan medicine prescription for treating " white vein disease". Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by distinct "white vein disease". In the absence of effective drugs for AD, BdNlRB may be a possible treatment for AD. Aim of the study: To verify the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism of the proved Tibetan medicine BdNlRB on Alzheimer's disease. Materials and methods: 60 APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice (Mt) and 60 Ass1-40 protein-induced AD mice (Mi) were divided into 3 groups according to the dose of BdNlRB: BdNlRB-100, BdNlRB-200 and BdNlRB-400, with 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg*weight, respectively. The mice were administrated by gavage for 8 weeks. The cognitive ability of mice was detected by Morris Water Maze, the expression of Ass protein, p-tau and microglia was detected by immunofluorescent staining, the protein expression in the hippocampus was detected by proteomics, and the abundance of fecal intestinal flora was detected by 16S RNA. Results: The learning ability and memory ability of Mi mice were significantly improved after BdNlRB administration. The learning ability of Mt mice was significantly improved, while the memory ability was not improved after BdNlRB administration. After the treatment with low and medium doses of BdNlRB, the expression of p-tau decreased significantly (the rate of decrease in BdNlRB-100 and BdNlRB-200 groups was 8.05% and 12.7%, respectively), and the number of microglia increased (39.3% and 31.6%, respectively). BdNlRB significantly affected the protein expression in the hippocampus of Mt mice. 382 proteins in different expression in all three groups mainly involved in amino acid synthesis, fatty acid degradation, glutamine metabolism, synaptic vesicular cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, PPAR signaling pathway and Fc gamma-mediated phagocytosis were activated. Meanwhile, the administration of BdNlRB can regulate the intestinal flora of Mt mice, which reduces the abundance of Muribaculum and uncultured bacteroidales bacterium, and improves the abundance of Ruminococcus-1 and Ruminiclostridium-9. Conclusion: The oral administration of BdNlRB significantly improved the cognitive ability of AD mice, and neuroinflammation and intestinal flora regulation were the possible mechanisms.

AB  - Ionic liquids (ILs) are widely used for their physical and chemical properties. Toxicological assessments of ILs could help to avoid their threat to human health, but these are rarely reported, and no assessments of IL neurotoxicity in mammals have been performed. Here, we aimed to evaluate the neurotoxicity of chronic 1-octyl3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C8mim][PF6]) (0, 1 mg/kg) exposure during development on rats. Our results indicated that chronic exposure to low-dose ([C8mim][PF6]) induces behavioural abnormalities, including cognitive deficits, social communication disorders, and sensory gating function impairment. Moreover, rats subjected to chronic ([C8mim][PF6]) exposure showed hypofunction of glutamatergic excitatory synapses, including increased expression of NMDA receptor subunits, increased density and immaturity of dendritic spines, and increased expression of PSD95. Additionally, ([C8mim][PF6]) exposure resulted in hippocampal-specific inflammatory activation, indicated by increased levels of proinflammatory factors, elevated nuclear localisation of NF-kappa B, and activation of microglia and astrocytes. In conclusion, chronic exposure to low-dose ([C8mim][PF6]) induced neurotoxicity, including damage to glutamatergic excitatory synapses and inflammatory activation, which may illuminate the associated behavioural abnormalities. The results presented here may be helpful for the safe use of ILs in the future.

AB  - In this study, metal 3D printing technology was used to create lattice-shaped test specimens of orthopedic implants to determine the effect of different lattice shapes on bone ingrowth. Six different lattice shapes were used: gyroid, cube, cylinder, tetrahedron, double pyramid, and Voronoi. The lattice-structured implants were produced from Ti6Al4V alloy using direct metal laser sintering 3D printing technology with an EOS M290 printer. The implants were implanted into the femoral condyles of sheep, and the animals were euthanized 8 and 12 weeks after surgery. To determine the degree of bone ingrowth for different lattice-shaped implants, mechanical, histological, and image processing tests on ground samples and optical microscopic images were performed. In the mechanical test, the force required to compress the different lattice-shaped implants and the force required for a solid implant were compared, and significant differences were found in several instances. Statistically evaluating the results of our image processing algorithm, it was found that the digitally segmented areas clearly consisted of ingrown bone tissue; this finding is also supported by the results of classical histological processing. Our main goal was realized, so the bone ingrowth efficiencies of the six lattice shapes were ranked. It was found that the gyroid, double pyramid, and cube-shaped lattice implants had the highest degree of bone tissue growth per unit time. This ranking of the three lattice shapes remained the same at both 8 and 12 weeks after euthanasia. In accordance with the study, as a side project, a new image processing algorithm was developed that proved suitable for determining the degree of bone ingrowth in lattice implants from optical microscopic images. Along with the cube lattice shape, whose high bone ingrowth values have been previously reported in many studies, it was found that the gyroid and double pyramid lattice shapes produced similarly good results.

AB  - The need for the development of sustainable control methods of herbivorous insects implies that new molecules are proposed on the market. Among the different effects the new products may have on the target species, the alteration of insect oviposition behaviour might be considered. At the scope, parallel simple behavioural assays can be conducted in arena. Freely available software can be used to track observed events, but they often need intensive customization to the specific experimental design. Hence, integrating such software with, e.g., R environment, can provide a much more effective protocol development for data collection and analysis. Here we present a dataset and protocol for processing data of the oviposition behaviour of the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, when exposed to olive twigs treated with different commercial products. Treatments were rock powder, propolis, a mixture of rock powder and propolis, copper oxychloride, copper sulphate, and water as the experimental control. JWatcher was used to simultaneously collect data from 12 arena assays and ad-hoc developed R code was used to process raw data for data analyses. The procedure described here is novel and represents a valuable and transferable protocol to analyse observational events in B. oleae, as well as other biological systems.

AB  - Despite the antidepressant potency of paroxetine, its side effect of erectile dysfunction is burdensome. Grapefruit peels (GFPs) are underutilized cultivar wastes with wide range of therapeutic potentials which have been attributed to their antioxidant behavior and phenolic contents' abilities to effectively inhibit enzymatic activities and manage endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular disorders. This study aims to investigate the erectogenic potentials of GFP extract in a rat model of paroxetine-induced ED. Experimental rats were sectioned into five groups: [1: control; 2: paroxetine (10 mg/kg); 3: paroxetine + sildenafil (5 mg/kg); 4: paroxetine + GFP (50 mg/kg); 5: paroxetine + GFP (100 mg/kg)] and treated for 28 days. Sexual behavior of rats was assessed and effect of GFP on ecto-5 ' nucleotidases, phosphodiesterase-5, and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities was determined in rats' penile tissues. The levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide (NO) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were also determined. HPLC-DAD analysis showed the presence of naringin, rutin, caffeic acid, quercitrin, quercetin, and kaempferol glycoside. Oral administration of paroxetine reduced erectile response as revealed by their low intromission and mounting numbers as well as high intromission and mounting latencies. Paroxetine caused a significant elevation of ADA and phosphodiesterase-5 activities and malondialdehyde levels with drastic reduction in levels of NO, SOD, and catalase activities in rats' penile tissues. However, GFP extract reversed PDE-5, ADA, and antioxidant activities to normal levels, raised the concentration of NO. These results suggest the erectogenic effects and protective potentials of GFP extract against paroxetine-induced erectile dysfunction. Practical Application Grapefruit peels are an environmental menace in many countries and this study showed that the peels can be used in the prevention / management of erectile dysfunction. The therapeutic potentials of the peels are due to the presence of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and phenolic acids. Therefore, exploring the erectogenic potentials of the peels will translate to conversion of the wastes to therapeutic products.

AB  - Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a highly contagious pathogen causing significant economic losses in the swine industry. Conventional inactivated or attenuated live vaccines for classical swine fever (CSF) are effective but face biosafety concerns and cannot distinguish vaccinated animals from those infected with the field virus, complicating CSF eradication efforts. It is noteworthy that nanoparticle (NP)-based vaccines resemble natural viruses in size and antigen structure, and offer an alternative tool to circumvent these limitations. In this study, we developed an innovative vaccine delivery scaffold utilizing self-assembled mi3 NPs, which form stable structures carrying the CSFV E2 glycoprotein. The expressed yeast E2-fused protein (E2-mi3 NPs) exhibited robust thermostability (25 to 70 degrees C) and long-term storage stability at room temperature (25 degrees C). Interestingly, E2-mi3 NPs made with this technology elicited enhanced antigen uptake by RAW264.7 cells. In a rabbit model, the E2-mi3 NP vaccine against CSFV markedly increased CSFV-specific neutralizing antibody titers. Importantly, it conferred complete protection in rabbits challenged with the C-strain of CSFV. Furthermore, we also found that the E2-mi3 NP vaccines triggered stronger cellular (T-lymphocyte proliferation, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-12p70) and humoral (CSFV-specific neutralizing antibodies, CD4+ T-lymphocytes, and IL-4) immune responses in pigs than the E2 vaccines. To sum up, these structure-based, self-assembled mi3 NPs provide valuable insights for novel antiviral strategies against the constantly infectious agents.

AB  - Life on earth has evolved under the influence of regularly recurring changes in the environment, such as the 24 h light/dark cycle. Consequently, organisms have developed endogenous clocks, generating 24 h (circadian) rhythms that serve to anticipate these rhythmic changes. In addition to these circadian rhythms, which persist in constant conditions and can be entrained to environmental rhythms, light drives rhythmic behavior and brain function, especially in nocturnal laboratory rodents. In recent decades, research has made great advances in the elucidation of the molecular circadian clockwork and circadian light perception. This review summarizes the role of light and the circadian clock in rhythmic brain function, with a focus on the complex interaction between the different components of the mammalian circadian system. Furthermore, chronodisruption as a consequence of light at night, genetic manipulation, and neurodegenerative diseases is briefly discussed.

AB  - Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a prevalent cyanotoxin present in hazardous cyanobacterial blooms, is recognized as a neurotoxic environmental pollutant that induces brain damage and neurobehavioral deficits. However, the mechanisms underlying MC-LR-induced neurotoxicity remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the role of mitophagy in MC-LR-induced neurotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. We found that administration of 10 mu g/kg body weight (intraperitoneally) MC-LR impaired learning and memory abilities and induced neuronal damage and apoptosis in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in rats. Exposure to MC-LR (1 mu M-10 mu M) resulted in cellular damage and apoptosis in PC-12 and HT22 cells. MC-LR induced mitophagy through the PINK1/Parkin pathway but hindered mitophagy progression by repressing Scd2 transcription in neurons. These inhibitory effects were reversed by Scd2 overexpression. Furthermore, MC-LR was found to repress Scd2 transcription by directly binding to type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and competitively inhibiting its activation by Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Overexpression of IGF-1R and administration of exogenous IGF-1 mitigated the MC-LR-induced inhibition of Scd2 and the associated mitophagy defects. These findings indicate that IGF-1R is the direct target of MC-LR in neurons. MC-LR initiates mitophagy defects and apoptosis by inhibiting Scd2 transcription through binding to IGF-1R.

AB  - Near-term acute hypoxia in utero can result in significant fetal brain injury, with some brain regions more vulnerable than others. As mitochondrial dysfunction is an underlying feature of the injury cascade following hypoxia, this study is aimed at characterizing mitochondrial function at a region-specific level in the near-term fetal brain after a period of acute hypoxia. We hypothesized that regional differences in mitochondrial function would be evident, and that prophylactic creatine treatment would mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction following hypoxia; thereby reducing fetal brain injury. Pregnant Border-Leicester/Merino ewes with singleton fetuses were surgically instrumented at 118 days of gestation (dGa; term is ~145 dGA). A continuous infusion of either creatine (n=15; 6 mg/kg/h) or isovolumetric saline (n=16; 1.5 ml/kg/h) was administered to the fetuses from 121 dGa. After 10 days of infusion, a subset of fetuses (8 saline-, 7 creatine-treated) were subjected to 10 minutes of umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) to induce a mild global fetal hypoxia. At 72 hours after UCO, the fetal brain was collected for high-resolution mitochondrial respirometry and molecular and histological analyses. The results show that the transient UCO-induced acute hypoxia impaired mitochondrial function in the hippocampus and the periventricular white matter and increased the incidence of cell death in the hippocampus. Creatine treatment did not rectify the changes in mitochondrial respiration associated with hypoxia, but there was a negative relationship between cell death and creatine content following treatment. Irrespective of UCO, creatine increased the proportion of cytochrome c bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane, upregulated the mRNA expression of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl2, and of PCG1-alpha, a driver of mitogenesis, in the hippocampus. We conclude that creatine treatment prior to brief, acute hypoxia does not fundamentally modify mitochondrial respiratory function, but may improve mitochondrial structural integrity and potentially increase mitogenesis and activity of antiapoptotic pathways.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the effects of the birth weight of crossbred Moo Lath x Duroc (CMD) gilts on their puberty and first mating age, including the body condition and morphology. The litter size and birth weight of their offspring were also evaluated. Eighteen (18) CMD gilts were selected after weaning and kept in an individual pen 1.5 x 2 x 1 m after puberty. The gilts were grouped into three groups based on birth weight: groups A, B, and C (with <0.7, & GE;0.7-0.9 & LE;, and >0.9 kg, respectively). 15 mature purebred Moo Lath (PML) gilts reared by farmers were also involved in this study to compare the morphology between the CMD and PML at first mating. There was no difference in the age and body weight of CMD gilts at puberty and first mating among the studied groups. However, the gilts in group A showed a lower mean age at puberty, and marginally lighter body weight than those in groups B and C. Birth weight showed a significant influence on the backfat thickness at puberty and first mating (P<0.039 and 0.031). The CMD gilts could have their first mating at 193 days, that is at their 3rd and 4th estrous cycle, with approximately 40 kg of body weight, 38 mm of backfat thickness, 90 cm of heart girth, 100 cm of body length, and 51 cm height at wither. The CMD gilts' birth weight did not influence their litter size, but influenced their offspring's birth weight.

AB  - Human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPC) are considered a good candidate in cell therapy for ischemic heart disease, demonstrating capacity to improve functional recovery after myocardial infarction (MI), both in small and large preclinical animal models. However, improvements are required in terms of cell engraftment and efficacy. Based on previously published reports, insulin-growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have demonstrated substantial cardioprotective, repair and regeneration activities, so they are good candidates to be evaluated in large animal model of MI. We have validated porcine cardiac progenitor cells (pCPC) and lentiviral vectors to overexpress IGF-1 (co-expressing eGFP) and HGF (co-expressing mCherry). pCPC were transduced and IGF1-eGFP(pos) and HGF-mCherry(pos) populations were purified by cell sorting and further expanded. Overexpression of IGF-1 has a limited impact on pCPC expression profile, whereas results indicated that pCPC-HGF-mCherry cultures could be counter selecting high expresser cells. In addition, pCPC-IGF1-eGFP showed a higher cardiogenic response, evaluated in co-cultures with decellularized extracellular matrix, compared with native pCPC or pCPC-HGF-mCherry. In vivo intracoronary co-administration of pCPC-IGF1-eGFP and pCPC-HFG-mCherry (1:1; 40 x 10(6)/animal), one week after the induction of an MI model in swine, revealed no significant improvement in cardiac function.

AB  - The precise function of specialized GABAergic interneuron subtypes is required to provide appropriate synaptic inhibition for regulating principal neuron excitability and synchronization within brain circuits. Of these, parvalbumin-type (PV neuron) dysfunction is a feature of several sex-biased psychiatric and brain disorders, although, the underlying developmental mechanisms are unclear. While the transcriptional action of sex hormones generates sexual dimorphism during brain development, whether kinase signaling contributes to sex differences in PV neuron function remains unexplored. In the hippocampus, we report that gephyrin, the main inhibitory post-synaptic scaffolding protein, is phosphorylated at serine S268 and S270 in a developmentally-dependent manner in both males and females. When examining GphnS268A/S270A mice in which site-specific phosphorylation is constitutively blocked, we found that sex differences in PV neuron density in the hippocampal CA1 present in WT mice were abolished, coincident with a female-specific increase in PV neuron-derived terminals and increased inhibitory input onto principal cells. Electrophysiological analysis of CA1 PV neurons indicated that gephyrin phosphorylation is required for sexually dimorphic function. Moreover, while male and female WT mice showed no difference in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks, GphnS268A/S270A mice exhibited sex- and task-specific deficits, indicating that gephyrin phosphorylation is differentially required by males and females for convergent cognitive function. In fate mapping experiments, we uncovered that gephyrin phosphorylation at S268 and S270 establishes sex differences in putative PV neuron density during early postnatal development. Furthermore, patch-sequencing of putative PV neurons at postnatal day 4 revealed that gephyrin phosphorylation contributes to sex differences in the transcriptomic profile of developing interneurons. Therefore, these early shifts in male-female interneuron development may drive adult sex differences in PV neuron function and connectivity. Our results identify gephyrin phosphorylation as a new substrate organizing PV neuron development at the anatomical, functional, and transcriptional levels in a sex-dependent manner, thus implicating kinase signaling disruption as a new mechanism contributing to the sex-dependent etiology of brain disorders.

AB  - Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) has been reported to regulate adipogenesis, but its role in porcine beige adipocyte formation remains unclear. Our data reveal that BMP2 is significantly induced at the early stages of porcine beige adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, supplementing rhBMP2 during the early stages, but not the late stages of differentiation, significantly enhances porcine SVF adipogenesis, thermogenesis, and proliferation. Furthermore, compared to the empty plasmid-transfected-SVFs, BMP2-overexpressed SVFs had the enhanced lipid accumulation and thermogenesis, while knockdown of BMP2 in SVFs exhibited the opposite effect. The RNA-seq of the above three types of cells revealed the enrichment of the annotation of thermogenesis, brown cell differentiation, etc. In addition, the analysis also highlights the significant enrichment of cell adhesion, the MAPK cascade, and PPAR gamma signaling. Mechanistically, BMP2 positively regulates the adipogenic and thermogenic capacities of porcine beige adipocytes by activating PPAR gamma expression through AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways.

AB  - Objective: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) affects 15-25% of surgical patients and causes significant morbidity and mortality. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of propofol reducing POCD in aged rats.
   Method: Rats in Operate group and Propofol group were anesthetized with isoflurane and propofol, respectively, and then underwent cardiac surgery. Rats in Antagomir group were anesthetized with propofol and underwent cardiac surgery with preoperative injection of miR-223-3p antagomir. Barnes maze and Morris water maze (MWM) were used to test spatial learning and memory of rats. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the level of microglial cell marker IBA1. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression of miR-223-3p and inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6. Western blotting was conducted to detect the protein expression of Foxo1, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6.
   Result: Isoflurane-anesthetized rats undergoing cardiac surgery showed significantly reduced spatial learning and memory, promoted microglia activation, decreased miR-223-3p expression and increased inflammatory response in the hippocampus, while isoflurane-anesthetized rats without surgery showed insignificant changes in these indices. Compared to isoflurane anesthesia, propofol anesthesia exhibited less effect on spatial learning and memory of rats with cardiac surgery and contributed to a relative reduction in activated microglia in the hippocampus, a notable increase in miR-223-3p expression, and a decrease in inflammation. The results were reversed after miR-223-3p antagomir was injected into propofol-anesthetized surgical rats. miR-223-3p negatively regulated Foxo1 to suppress the expression of inflammatory factors.
   Conclusion: Propofol reduced inflammation by up-regulating miR-223-3p, thereby reducing POCD in aged rats.

AB  - Aim: Artificial propagation of ring-necked pheasant through semen preservation is of significance, as this species is facing enormous threats in its natural habitat. Semen preservation inevitably induces oxidative stress, and exogenous antioxidants need to be investigated for the preservation of ring-necked pheasant semen. Therefore, the current study was conducted to investigate the role of glutathione (GSH) in extender on the liquid storage of ring-necked pheasant semen.Materials and Methods: Semen was collected from 10 sexually mature males, evaluated for sperm motility, and pooled. Pooled semen was aliquoted for dilution with Beltsville poultry semen extender (1:5) at 37 degrees C having GSH levels of 0.0 mM (Control), 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mM. Extended semen was gradually cooled to 4 degrees C and stored in a refrigerator (4 degrees C) for 48 hours. Semen quality, that is, sperm motility, membrane integrity, viability, acrosomal integrity, and DNA integrity, was assessed at 0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours.Results: Sperm motility (%), plasma membrane integrity (%), viability (%), and acrosomal integrity (%) were recorded higher (p < 0.05), whereas DNA fragmentation (%) was recorded lower in extender supplemented with 0.4 mM GSH up to 48 hours of storage compared with 0.2, 0.6, and 0.8 mM GSH concentrations and control.Conclusion: It is concluded that 0.4 mM GSH in extender improves sperm quality parameters of ring-necked pheasant during liquid storage up to 48 hours at 4 degrees C.

AB  - Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing, holistic, and multisectoral challenge facing contemporary global health. In this study we assessed the associations between socioeconomic, anthropogenic, and environmental indicators and country-level rates of AMR in humans and food-producing animals. Methods In this modelling study, we obtained data on Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, third generation cephalosporins-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium AMR in humans and food-producing animals from publicly available sources, including WHO, World Bank, and Center for Disease Dynamics Economics and Policy. AMR in food-producing animals presented a combined prevalence of AMR exposure in cattle, pigs, and chickens. We used multivariable beta regression models to determine the adjusted association between human and food-producing animal AMR rates and an array of ecological country-level indicators. Human AMR rates were classified according to the WHO priority pathogens list and antibiotic-bacterium pairs. Findings Significant associations were identified between animal antimicrobial consumption and AMR in foodproducing animals (OR 1 center dot 05 [95% CI 1 center dot 01-1 center dot 10]; p=0 center dot 013), and between human antimicrobial consumption and AMR specifically in WHO critical priority (1 center dot 06 [1 center dot 00-1 center dot 12]; p=0 center dot 035) and high priority (1 center dot 22 [1 center dot 09-1 center dot 37]; p<0 center dot 0001) pathogens. Bidirectional associations were also found: animal antibiotic consumption was positively linked with resistance in critical priority human pathogens (1 center dot 07 [1 center dot 01-1 center dot 13]; p=0 center dot 020) and human antibiotic consumption was positively linked with animal AMR (1 center dot 05 [1 center dot 01-1 center dot 09]; p=0 center dot 010). Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii, third generation cephalosporins-resistant Escherichia coli, and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus all had significant associations with animal antibiotic consumption. Analyses also suggested significant roles of socioeconomics, including governance on AMR rates in humans and animals. Interpretation Reduced rates of antibiotic consumption alone will not be sufficient to combat the rising worldwide prevalence of AMR. Control methods should focus on poverty reduction and aim to prevent AMR transmission across different One Health domains while accounting for domain-specific risk factors. The levelling up of livestock surveillance systems to better match those reporting on human AMR, and, strengthening all surveillance efforts, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, are pressing priorities.

AB  - Simple Summary The African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a linear double-stranded DNA virus characterized by a complex immune escape mechanism that has caused substantial economic losses to the global swine industry. An in-depth study of ASFV has revealed that screening for protective antigens and activating cellular immunity is essential for the development of ASF vaccines. In this study, we sought to examine the immunogenicity of the F317L protein of ASFV in mice while also identifying potential active T-cell epitopes in order to provide a basis for the functional study of the F317L protein, in addition to a reference for the subsequent development of ASF vaccines.Abstract The African swine fever virus (ASFV) encodes numerous proteins characterized by complex immune escape mechanisms. At present, the structure and function of these proteins, including the F317L protein, have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the immunogenicity of the F317L protein. Mice were subcutaneously immunized with the F317L protein using initial and subsequent booster doses, and, at the 28th day post-treatment, we assessed the humoral and cellular immune responses of mice. The F317L protein stimulated production of specific antibodies and activated humoral immune responses. In addition, F317L stimulated the production of large amounts of IFN-gamma by splenic lymphocytes, thereby activating cellular immune responses. Using informatics technology, we predicted and synthesized 29 F317L protein T cell epitopes, which were screened using IFN-gamma ELISpot. Among these, the F25 (246SRRSLVNPWT255) peptide was identified as having a stronger stimulatory effect than the full-length protein. Collectively, our findings revealed that the ASFV F317L protein can stimulate both strong humoral and cellular immunity in mice, and that the F25 (246SRRSLVNPWT255) peptide may be a potential active T cell epitope. These findings will provide a reference for further in-depth studies of the F317L protein and screening of antigenic epitopes.

AB  - Traditionally, the supplement of organic manure in tea plantations has been a common approach to improving soil fertility and promoting terroir compounds, as manifested by the coordinated increase in yield and quality for the resulting teas. However, information regarding the effect of organic manure in the metabolome of tea plants is still inadequate. The metabolite profiles of tea shoots applied with cow manure, urea or no fertilizer were studied using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 73 metabolites were detected, and the modulated metabolites included mainly amino acids, organic acids and fatty acids. In particular, glutamine, quinic acid and proline accumulated more in tea shoots in soils treated with cow manure, but octadecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid and eicosanoic acid were drastically reduced. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that organic acids and amino acids in tea shoots were the two major metabolite groups among the three treatments. The analysis of metabolic pathways demonstrated that the cow manure treatment significantly changed the enrichment of pathways related to amino acids, sugars and fatty acids. Sensory evaluation showed that the quality of green teas was higher when the plants used to make the tea were grown in soil treated with cow manure rather than urea during spring and late summer. The results indicated that the application of cow manure in soils changed the metabolic characteristics of tea shoots and improved the qualities of the resulting teas.</p>

AB  - Background: Staphylococcus aureus is and continues to be a leading cause of bacterial infections throughout the world. Given the global dissemination of multi-drug resistant (MDR) S. aureus, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), novel solutions against S. aureus infections are urgently needed. In our study on the in-teractions between commonly used photosensitizers and antibiotics in the clinic, we discovered that MRSA can be dramatically destroyed by a simple combination of amoxicillin and light-activated methylene blue (MB).Methods: To guide the clinical application of this combination therapy, we quantitatively assessed the interaction between light-activated MB and amoxicillin against S. aureus and its treatment order, dosage, and time length dependence. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of this combination therapy in treating and halting the progression of MRSA infections with the catheter biofilm infection model and the pig skin burn infection model. In the end, we disclosed the antimicrobial mechanisms of this combination therapy to further facilitate its clinical translation.Results: Amoxicillin and light-activated MB can mutually boost each other's uptake in S. aureus, producing up to 8 logs of reduction of MRSA infections when they are co-administrated. Such an anti -S. aureus synergy could be triggered with the currently used MB and amoxicillin clinical administration regimens. It is effective against S. aureus pathogens regardless of their antibiotic resistance backgrounds and does not create significant bacterial resistance with five days of continuous applications. It can lead to more than 99% of reduction of S. aureus infections established not only on the medical devices but also on the body surfaces.Conclusions: Possessing a fusion of effectiveness, safety, sustainability, and broad applicability, this simple combination of light-activated MB and amoxicillin can ultimately reform our treatment against MDR S. aureus pathogens including MRSA, significantly alleviating the health and economic burden of S. aureus infections across the world.

AB  - Simple Summary Although it is known that restriction of feed negatively influences the behaviour and welfare of sows, it is widely adopted during the gestation period to counteract nutrient oversupply. Nonetheless, a healthy gut needs its fuel and is a prerequisite for preventing birth-associated health disorders. Including high amounts of fibre in diets around parturition could be the solution for behavioural disorders and health problems in sows and therefore in piglets as well. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of ad libitum access to compound feeds rich in fibre (ante partum and peri partum) and a lactation diet (post partum) on the performance and health of sows. This study indicated that a higher feed intake of a fibre-rich diet ante partum did not interfere with any birth-associated disorders. In addition, ad libitum-fed sows showed higher dry matter (DM) intake throughout lactation, which led to beneficial effects on the body condition scores of sows. Due to the high fibre intake, the excretion of C. perfringens via sows' faeces could be significantly reduced, which could be a helpful tool in reducing the risk of neonatal diarrhoea caused by C. perfringens. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ad libitum access to compound feeds rich in fibre (ante partum (a.p.) and peri partum) on the DM intake, body mass development and performance of sows as well as excretion of Clostridium (C.) perfringens via sows' faeces. From day 109 (d-7) of gestation, 25 of 48 sows (23 considered as control) received access to one of two different high-fibre pellets from d-7 until the second day post partum (p.p.) (d2) (fibre groups (FG) 1 and 2) in additional to a lactation diet. The additional DM intake of the high-fibre pellets a.p. was 2.13 +/- 1.15 kg in FG 1 and 3.14 +/- 0.68 kg in FG 2. This led to higher DM intake in the first lactation week and significantly lower losses of weight and back fat thickness during lactation. The bacterial counts of C. perfringens in sows' faeces directly p.p. were 10 times lower in FG 1 and 100 times lower in FG 2 compared to the controls. High amounts of fibre led to higher DM intake throughout lactation, which had beneficial effects on sows' body conditions. It seems that high fibre intake influenced the excretion of C. perfringens at parturition, which could improve the health of newborns.

AB  - Propolis is a natural mixture of resins, wax, and pollen from plant buds and flowers, enriched with enzymes and bee saliva. It also contains various essential oils, vitamins, mineral salts, trace elements, hormones, and ferments. It has been found that propolis possesses antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. We have studied the antiviral activity of six extracts of Bulgarian propolis collected from six districts of Bulgaria. The study was conducted against structurally different viruses: human coronavirus strain OC-43 (HCoV OC-43) and human respiratory syncytial virus type 2 (HRSV-2) (enveloped RNA viruses), human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (enveloped DNA virus), human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV-14) (non-enveloped RNA virus) and human adenovirus type 5 (HadV-5) (non-enveloped DNA virus). The influence of the extracts on the internal replicative cycle of viruses was determined using the cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition test. The virucidal activity, its impact on the stage of viral adsorption to the host cell, and its protective effect on healthy cells were evaluated using the final dilution method, making them the focal points of interest. The change in viral infectivity under the action of propolis extracts was compared with untreated controls, and & UDelta;lgs were determined. Most propolis samples administered during the viral replicative cycle demonstrated the strongest activity against HCoV OC-43 replication. The influence of propolis extracts on the viability of extracellular virions was expressed to a different degree in the various viruses studied, and the effect was significantly stronger in those with an envelope. Almost all extracts significantly inhibited the adsorption step of the herpes virus and, to a less extent, of the coronavirus to the host cell, and some of them applied before viral infection demonstrated a protective effect on healthy cells. Our results enlarge the knowledge about the action of propolis and could open new perspectives for its application in viral infection treatment.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that erythropoietin (EPO) is an effective neuroprotective and neurotrophic agent for neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease. However, the effectiveness of EPO administration against diabetic cognitive impairments has rarely been examined. In this study, we investigated the effects of EPO on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced male C57BL/6 J mice. Then, we sought to clarify the mechanisms of EPO-mediated neuroprotection in high-glucose (HG)-stimulated HT22 cells. In vivo, we found that STZ-induced diabetic mice showed impaired spatial learning and memory, which was alleviated by EPO treatment. EPO also significantly lowered elevated fasting blood glucose levels, improved pancreatic and hip-pocampal damage, and restored oxidative stress in the STZ-induced diabetic mice. In vitro, EPO markedly increased cell viability, restrained the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax, enhanced the expression of pro-caspase 3, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95), and attenuated the upregulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1, NR2A and NR2B in HG -induced HT22 cells. The protective effects of EPO was obviously abolished by treatment with an NMDA receptor agonist. Our findings revealed that EPO impedes hippocampal and synaptic damage and neuronal apoptosis by regulating BDNF and PSD-95 expression through NMDA receptors, thereby ameliorating cognitive impairments in mice with T1DM.

AB  - Long duration spaceflight poses potential health risks to astronauts during flight and re-adaptation after return to Earth. There is an emerging need for NASA to provide successful and reliable therapeutics for long duration missions when capability for medical intervention will be limited. Clinically relevant, human placenta-derived therapeutic stromal cells (PLX-PAD) are a promising therapeutic alternative. We found that treatment of adult female mice with PLX-PAD near the onset of simulated weightlessness by hindlimb unloading (HU, 30 d) was well-tolerated and partially mitigated decrements caused by HU. Specifically, PLX-PAD treatment rescued HU-induced thymic atrophy, and mitigated HU-induced changes in percentages of circulating neutrophils, but did not rescue changes in the percentages of lymphocytes, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, T-cells and splenic atrophy. Further, PLX-PAD partially mitigated HU effects on the expression of select cytokines in the hippocampus. In contrast, PLX-PAD failed to protect bone and muscle from HU-induced effects, suggesting that the mechanisms which regulate the structure of these mechanosensitive tissues in response to disuse are discrete from those that regulate the immune- and central nervous system (CNS). These findings support the therapeutic potential of placenta-derived stromal cells for select physiological deficits during simulated spaceflight. Multiple countermeasures are likely needed for comprehensive protection from the deleterious effects of prolonged spaceflight.

AB  - Background Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a neurological complication occurring after anesthesia and surgery. Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of POCD, and the activation of the cluster of differentiation 200 (CD200)/CD200R1 axis improves neurological recovery in various neurological disorders by modulating inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact and underlying mechanism of CD200/CD200R1 axis on POCD in aged mice.Methods The model of POCD was established in aged mice. To assess the learning and memory abilities of model mice, the Morris water maze test was implemented. CD200Fc (CD200 fusion protein), CD200R1 Ab (anti-CD200R1 antibody), and 740Y-P (a specific PI3K activator) were used to evaluate the effects of the CD200/CD200R1/PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B signaling pathway on hippocampal microglial polarization, neuroinflammation, synaptic activity, and cognition in mice.Results It was observed that anesthesia/surgery induced cognitive decline in aged mice, increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta and decreased the levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), synaptophysin (SYN) in the hippocampus. Moreover, CD200Fc and 740Y-P attenuated neuroinflammation and synaptic deficits and reversed cognitive impairment via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (Akt)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway, whereas CD200R1 Ab administration exerted the opposite effects. Our results further show that the CD200/CD200R1 axis modulates M1/M2 polarization in hippocampal microglia via the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.Conclusions Our findings indicate that the activation of the CD200/CD200R1 axis reduces neuroinflammation, synaptic deficits, and cognitive impairment in the hippocampus of aged mice by regulating microglial M1/M2 polarization via the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Seabuckthorn Wuwei Pulvis (SWP) is a traditional Mongolian medicine used in China. It is composed of Hippophae rhamnoides (berries, 30 g), Aucklandiae costus Falc. (dry root, 25 g), Vitis vinifera F. Cordifolia (berries, 20 g), Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (dry root, 15 g), and Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis (desiccative ripe fruit, 10 g). It is clinically applied in the treatment of chronic cough, shortness of breath and phlegm, and chest distress. Past studies demonstrated that Seabuckthorn Wuwei Pulvis improved lung inflammation and chronic bronchitis in mice. However, the effect of Seabuckthorn Wuwei Pulvis on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in rats and the underlying action mechanism is not fully understood. Aim of the study: To evaluate the anti-COPD effect of Seabuckthorn Wuwei Pulvis and investigate whether its ameliorative effect is correlated with the composition of gut microbiota and its metabolites. Materials and methods: The effects of Seabuckthorn Wuwei Pulvis on a COPD rat model were established by exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and smoking. These effects were then evaluated by monitoring the animal weight, pulmonary function, lung histological alteration, and the levels of inflammatory factors (tumor necrotic factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-8, IL-6, and IL-17). Furthermore, the serum LPS and fluorescein isothiocyanatedextran levels were detected by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fluorescence microplate reader, respectively. Tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin-1) in the small intestine were detected by performing real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions and Western blotting to evaluate the intestinal barrier function. The contents of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the feces of rats were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 16S rDNA high throughput sequencing was used to investigate the effect of SWP on the gut microbiota of COPD rats. Results: Treatment with low and median doses of SWP significantly increased the pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume [FEV] 0.3, forced vital capacity [FVC], and FEV0.3/FVC), decreased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-6, and IL-17 in the lung, and attenuated the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lung. The low and median doses of SWP shaped the composition of gut microbiota, which increased the abundances of Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae, and Aerococcaceae, increased the productions of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, and upregulated the expression of ZO-1 and occludin-1 in the small intestine of COPD rats. Conclusion: SWP improved pulmonary functions and inhibited the inflammatory response by shaping the gut microbiota, increasing SCFA production, and strengthening the intestinal barrier function in rats with COPD induced by LPS and smoking.

AB  - A promising strategy for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hippocampal neurogenesis enhancement. Tenuigenin (TEN) is a bioactive compound extracted from Polygala tenuifolia that is widely used for treating amnesia in Chinese medicine. However, whether TEN is effective in treating AD through hippocampal neurogenesis is not fully clear. This study aimed to explore the pharmacologic effect and underlying mechanism of TEN on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive deficit amelioration in AD. In an in vivo study, TEN administration significantly ameliorated the cognitive decline in APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice via enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis, which might be attributed to activation of the GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin pathway. Furthermore, an in silico study suggested that TEN might be directly targeted to GSK-3 beta. Overall, TEN enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis and consequently ameliorated cognitive deficits via GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin pathway activation, indicating that TEN might be a promising novel agent for AD treatment.

AB  - Background. Gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy in rats compensated irremovable occlusion of various vessels and counteracted the consequent multiorgan dysfunction syndromes by activation of the corresponding collateral bypassing loops. Thus, we used BPC 157 therapy against the irremovable occlusion of the end of the superior mesenteric vein. Methods. Assessments, for 30 min (gross recording, venography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry, and oxidative stress) include the portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, and centrally, the superior sagittal sinus hypertension, systemic arterial and venous thrombosis, ECG disturbances, MDA-tissue increase, and heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, and brain (cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus) lesions. Rats received BPC 157 medication (10 mu g/kg, 10 ng/kg) intraperitoneally at 1 or 15 min ligation time. Results. BPC 157 rapidly activated the superior mesenteric vein-inferior anterior pancreati-coduodenal vein-superior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein-pyloric vein-portal vein pathway, reestablished superior mesenteric vein and portal vein connection and reestablished blood flow. Simultaneously, toward inferior caval vein, an additional pathway appears via the inferior mesenteric vein united with the middle colic vein, throughout its left colic branch to ascertain alternative bypassing blood flow. Consequently, BPC 157 acts peripherally and centrally, and counteracted the intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, ECG disturbances attenuated, abolished progressing venous and arterial thrombosis. Additionally, BPC 157 counteracted multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, and brain lesions, and oxidative stress in tissues. Conclusion. BPC 157 therapy may be specific management also for the superior mesenteric vein injuries.

AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) is a global pollutant with established toxic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). However, early events and early-warning biomarkers of CNS damage following exposure to low-dose MeHg are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate whether subchronic low-dose MeHg exposure had adverse effects on the cerebral telomere length, as well as serum melatonin and its urinary metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) in rats. Sixteen male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into two groups. Group I was the control group. In group II, rats were exposed to MeHg by gavage at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day for 3 months. This study revealed that MeHg exposure resulted in impairment of learning and memory ability, a slightly reduced number of neurons and an irregular arrangement of neurons in the hippocampus. It also significantly accelerated telomere shortening in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Moreover, MeHg exposure decreased the levels of melatonin in serum and aMT6s in urine, partly by suppressing the synthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the brain but promoted the expression of melatonin-catalyzing AANAT and ASMT. Importantly, cerebral telomere length was positively correlated with MT and aMT6s after MeHg exposure. These results suggested that the shortened telomere length in the brain may be an early event in MeHg-induced CNS toxicity, and the level of aMT6s in urine may serve as an early-warning biomarker for MeHg-induced CNS damage.

AB  - Simple Summary Movement disorders can have different origins and certain causes require a particular intervention management. In rhinoceroses, lesions affecting the extremities per se are typical causes. A 3-year-old, male Greater one-horned rhinoceros born in captivity developed progressive lameness, ataxia with dragging of its right, hind hoof. Prior, the animal was housed together with his dam, which was repeatedly aggressive against her offspring. Despite therapy, the symptoms aggravated and the animal died spontaneously. At necropsy, a large abscess in the abdomen under the spine and a thrombus of the artery of the right hind limb were diagnosed as the cause of lameness. The pyogenic bacterium Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis was isolated from the abscess and from mucous membranes of the healthy mother. Such an unusual origin for lameness should be considered in rhinoceroses in the future. In rhinoceroses, lameness is an occasionally seen symptom primarily caused by lesions affecting the feet and interdigital space. A 3-year-old male Greater one-horned rhinoceros developed a progressive, severe movement disorder of the right hind limb with subsequent death. The pathological analysis diagnosed a severe, retroperitoneal abscess and chronic thrombosis of the right iliac artery. Streptococci detected in the abscess were further identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis by culture and molecular techniques. The identical isolate was also identified in a vaginal swab of the dam. The list of differential diagnoses for lameness in rhinoceroses must be expanded by processes affecting other than the extremities per se.

AB  - Some discoveries resulted from 2-dimensional (2D) cultured cardiac cells have been disqualified in animal testing and later clinical trials. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a vital role in cardiac homeostasis, cardiac ECM (cECM)-based 3D cell cultures can mimics the physiological and pathological conditions in vivo closely, it is hopeful of addressing this challenge. Construction of cECM-based 3-dimensional (3D) hydrogel (cECM3DH) and its effects on cell behaviors were studied here. The results indicated that cellular compartments could be efficiently removed from heart tissue via sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS)- and Triton X-100-mediated decellularization, remaining the natural fibrous network structure and major proteins. 3D hydrogel consisted of 1 x 10(7) cells/mL cells and 75% cECM could promote the proliferation and anti-apoptosis ability of human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells. 0.25% trypsin or 0.20% collagenase was suitable to retrieve these cells from 3D hydrogel for further researches. Compared with 2D culture system, cECM3DH could significantly increase the proportion of GATA 4(+) cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from heart tissue of neonatal mouse or induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (P < 0.05) The expression levels of mature genes including cTnT, JCN, CaV1.2, MYL2, CASQ2, NCX1, and Cx43 of these CMs in adult pig cECM-based 3D hydrogel (APcECM3DH) were significantly higher than that in 2D culture system and in newborn piglet cECM-based 3D hydrogel (NPcECM3DH), respectively (P < 0.05). Therefore, cECM3DH supports the generation of primary CMs and ESC-derived CMs, APcECM3DH was more conducive to promoting CM maturation, which contributes to building 3D model for pathogenesis exploration, drug screening, and regenerative medicine of heart diseases.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Huangqi baihe Granules (HQBHG), which is a key Chinese medical prescription, has a remarkable efficacy in oxidative stress and inflammation. Nevertheless, the therapeutic effect on Radiation brain injury (RBI) has rarely been studied.Aim of the study: The study aimed to verify the effect of HQBHG against RBI and explore its potential mechanism. Methods: The potential targets and mechanisms of HQBHG against RBI were predicted by network pharmacology and verified by established rat model of RBI Firstly, the therapeutic effect of HQBHG in RBI was confirmed by water maze test, HE staining and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Secondly, the potential critical anti-RBI pathway of HQBHG was further explored by water maze, HE staining, immunofluorescence assays, ELISA and western blot. Results: A total of 43 HQBHG anti-RBI targets were obtained. Gene Ontology (Go) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional annotations showed that the treatment of HQBHG in RBI might be mainly related to oxidative stress, inflammation and PI3K/AKT pathway. Experimental studies have indicated that HQBHG can improve spatial learning and memory ability, alleviate pathological damage of brain tissue in RBI of rats. HQBHG also can down-regulate the levels of IL-1 & beta;, TNF-& alpha;, ROS and MDA, meanwhile, GSH was significantly up-regulated. In addition, the HQBHG can increase the protein expression phosphorylations PI3K (p-PI3K), phosphorylations AKT(p-AKT) and Nrf2 in the brain tissue of RBI. Conclusion: HQBHG may alleviated RBI by regulated oxidative stress and inflammatory response through PI3K/ AKT/Nrf2 pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary The research focuses on the development and evaluation of a new immunocastration vaccine for beef cattle. Controlled and on-farm trials were conducted to evaluate safety, immunogenicity, immunocastration efficacy, and production parameters. The vaccine demonstrated safety and efficacy in inducing specific anti-GnRH antibodies, reducing estrus presentation and progesterone concentration, and improving production parameters. This research presents promising results for the efficacy and safety of the immunocastration vaccine, highlighting the potential benefits for reproductive management of beef cattle.Abstract Reproductive control in mammals, particularly in beef production systems, is crucial for managing behaviors driven by sex steroids, which can cause biosecurity issues, reduced weight gain, and decreased meat quality. Additionally, controlling sexual activity in females prevents unwanted pregnancies when both sexes are housed together for fattening. Surgical castration in cattle, commonly performed under field conditions, is associated with significant welfare concerns due to pain and infection risks. Furthermore, castrating female cattle in the field is often impractically expensive. Hence, new reproductive control methods that prioritize animal welfare and are suitable for both sexes are essential. Immunocastration (IC), which involves vaccination against the GnRH-I hormone, has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating efficacy and safety in various species. Immunocastration has proven to be an effective alternative to surgical castration in controlling reproduction and promoting animal welfare in several species. This study aims to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, immunocastration effect, and productive impact of a novel IC vaccine developed in Chile for female cattle. Two consecutive trials were conducted, the first under controlled conditions and the second under field conditions. The results demonstrated that the new vaccine is safe and effective for use in beef cattle, inducing specific immunity against GnRH-I, reducing gonadal functionality, and improving productive parameters. These findings suggest that this new IC vaccine can significantly benefit the beef cattle industry by providing a welfare-friendly and efficient method of reproductive control.

AB  - The strategies found by animals facing a new task are determined both by individual experience and by struc-tural priors evolved to leverage the statistics of natural environments. Rats quickly learn to capitalize on the trial sequence correlations of two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks after correct trials but consistently deviate from optimal behavior after error trials. To understand this outcome-dependent gating, we first show that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained in the same 2AFC task outperform rats as they can readily learn to use across-trial information both after correct and error trials. We hypothesize that, although RNNs can optimize their behavior in the 2AFC task without any a priori restrictions, rats' strategy is constrained by a structural prior adapted to a natural environment in which rewarded and non-rewarded actions provide largely asymmetric information. When pre-training RNNs in a more ecological task with more than two possible choices, networks develop a strategy by which they gate off the across-trial evidence after errors, mimicking rats' behavior. Population analyses show that the pre-trained networks form an accurate repre-sentation of the sequence statistics independently of the outcome in the previous trial. After error trials, gating is implemented by a change in the network dynamics that temporarily decouple the categorization of the stimulus from the across-trial accumulated evidence. Our results suggest that the rats' suboptimal behavior reflects the influence of a structural prior that reacts to errors by isolating the network decision dy-namics from the context, ultimately constraining the performance in a 2AFC laboratory task.

AB  - Background: Studies showed that thyroid function plays an important role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, changes in brain thyroid hormone and related receptors in the early stage of AD were rarely reported. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the early stage of AD and local thyroid hormone and its receptors in the brain.Methods: The animal model was established by stereotactic injection of okadaic acid (OA) into hippocampal region for the experiment, and 0.9% NS for the control. Blood sample from each mouse was collected and then the mice were sacrificed and the brain tissue was collected for detecting free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroid hormone (FT4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and phosphorylated tau, amyloid-l3 (Al3) and thyroid hormone receptors (THRs) in the hippocampus of the mice were detected as well.Results: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that compared with the control, FT3, FT4, TSH and TRH in brain were significantly increased in the experimental group; in the serum, FT4, TSH and TRH were increased, while FT3 had no change; western blot analysis indicated that the expression of THR a and l3 in the hippocampus of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, a mouse AD model can be established successfully by injecting a small dose of OA into the hippocampus. We speculate that early AD brain and circulating thyroid dysfunction may be an early local and systemic stress repair response.

AB  - Sleep disruptions promote increases of amyloid beta (A beta) and tau in the brain and increase Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but the precise mechanisms that give rise to sleep disturbances have yet to be defined. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is essential for sleep maintenance and for the regulation of slow-wave sleep (SWS). We examined the TRN in transgenic mice that express mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and found reduced neuronal activity, increased sleep fragmentation, and decreased SWS time as compared to nontransgenic littermates. Selective activation of the TRN using excitatory DREADDs restored sleep maintenance, increased time in SWS, and reduced amyloid plaque load in both hippocampus and cortex. Our findings suggest that the TRN may play a major role in symptoms associated with AD. Enhancing TRN activity might be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION What is the effect of the chemical in vitro activation (cIVA) protocol compared with fragmentation only (Frag, also known as mechanical IVA) on gene expression, follicle activation and growth in human ovarian tissue in vitro? SUMMARY ANSWER Although histological assessment shows that cIVA significantly increases follicle survival and growth compared to Frag, both protocols stimulate extensive and nearly identical transcriptomic changes in cultured tissue compared to freshly collected ovarian tissue, including marked changes in energy metabolism and inflammatory responses. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Treatments based on cIVA of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in ovarian tissue followed by auto-transplantation have been administered to patients with refractory premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and resulted in live births. However, comparable effects with mere tissue fragmentation have been shown, questioning the added value of chemical stimulation that could potentially activate oncogenic responses. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Fifty-nine ovarian cortical biopsies were obtained from consenting women undergoing elective caesarean section (C-section). The samples were fragmented for culture studies. Half of the fragments were exposed to bpV (HOpic)+740Y-P (Frag+cIVA group) during the first 24 h of culture, while the other half were cultured with medium only (Frag group). Subsequently, both groups were cultured with medium only for an additional 6 days. Tissue and media samples were collected for histological, transcriptomic, steroid hormone, and cytokine/chemokine analyses at various time points. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Effects on follicles were evaluated by counting and scoring serial sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin before and after the 7-day culture. Follicle function was assessed by quantification of steroids by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry at different time points. Cytokines and chemokines were measured by multiplex assay. Transcriptomic effects were measured by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the tissue after the initial 24-h culture. Selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence in cultured ovarian tissue as well as in KGN cell (human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line) culture experiments. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Compared to the Frag group, the Frag+cIVA group exhibited a significantly higher follicle survival rate, increased numbers of secondary follicles, and larger follicle sizes. Additionally, the tissue in the Frag+cIVA group produced less dehydroepiandrosterone compared to Frag. Cytokine measurement showed a strong inflammatory response at the start of the culture in both groups. The RNA-seq data revealed modest differences between the Frag+cIVA and Frag groups, with only 164 DEGs identified using a relaxed cut-off of false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1. Apart from the expected PI3K-protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, cIVA also regulated pathways related to hypoxia, cytokines, and inflammation. In comparison to freshly collected ovarian tissue, gene expression in general was markedly affected in both the Frag+cIVA and Frag groups, with a total of 3119 and 2900 DEGs identified (FDR < 0.001), respectively. The top enriched gene sets in both groups included several pathways known to modulate follicle growth such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1 signaling.
   Significant changes compared to fresh tissue were also observed in the expression of genes encoding for steroidogenesis enzymes and classical granulosa cell markers in both groups. Intriguingly, we discovered a profound upregulation of genes related to glycolysis and its upstream regulator in both Frag and Frag+cIVA groups, and these changes were further boosted by the cIVA treatment. Cell culture experiments confirmed glycolysis-related genes as direct targets of the cIVA drugs. In conclusion, cIVA enhances follicle growth, as expected, but the mechanisms may be more complex than PI3K-Akt-mTOR alone, and the impact on function and quality of the follicles after the culture period remains an open question. LARGE SCALE DATA Data were deposited in the GEO data base, accession number GSE234765. The code for sequencing analysis can be found in https://github.com/tialiv/IVA_project. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Similar to the published IVA protocols, the first steps in our study were performed in an in vitro culture model where the ovarian tissue was isolated from the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Further in vivo experiments will be needed, for example in xeno-transplantation models, to explore the long-term impacts of the discovered effects. The tissue collected from patients undergoing C-section may not be comparable to tissue of patients with POI. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The general impact of fragmentation and short (24 h) in vitro culture on gene expression in ovarian tissue far exceeded the effects of cIVA. Yet, follicle growth was stimulated by cIVA, which may suggest effects on specific cell populations that may be diluted in bulk RNA-seq. Nevertheless, we confirmed the impact of cIVA on glycolysis using a cell culture model, suggesting impacts on cellular signaling beyond the PI3K pathway. The profound changes in inflammation and glycolysis following fragmentation and culture could contribute to follicle activation and loss in ovarian tissue culture, as well as in clinical applications, such as fertility preservation by ovarian tissue auto-transplantation.

AB  - Hydrogels are substances designed to retain significant quantities of water and slowly release it to support plant growth. This study produced and evaluated the use of a test hydrogel (TH), a natural polymer derived from cashew gum (Anacardium occidentale), on the growth, chemical composition, and mineral content of cactus pear genotypes. The TH was compared to a negative control (no hydrogel; NH), and to a positive control or commercial hydrogel (CH). The CH was a synthetic polyacrylamide-based hydrogel. The study was carried out in a completely randomized design with a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement (n = 36), involving three hydrogel types x three cactus pear genotypes [Elephant Ear (Opuntia stricta); Giant (Opuntia ficus-indica); and Sweet (Nopalea cochenillifera)]. There was a significant effect of interaction (p <= 0.05) between genotypes and hydrogel types on cladode area, plant height, dry biomass of cladodes, and macro- and micromineral content. The use of TH promoted greater growth and improved chemical and mineral composition (p <= 0.05) to cactus genotypes. The Sweet genotype hydrated with TH presented the highest crude protein accumulation (p <= 0.05). Cashew gum-based hydrogel improved both growth and chemical composition of the cactus genotypes, and it is an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic polymers.

AB  - Inflammation in the reproductive tract has become a serious threat to animal fertility. Recently, the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in the context of reproduction and the inflammatory response has been highlighted, but the role of PPAR beta/delta has not been fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro effect of PPAR beta/delta ligands (agonist: L-165,041 and antagonist: GSK 3787) on the transcriptome profile of porcine endometrium during LPS-induced inflammation in the mid-luteal and follicular phases of the oestrous cycle (days 10-12 and 18-20, respectively) using the RNA-Seq method. During the mid-luteal phase of the oestrous cycle, the current study identified 145 and 143 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after treatment with an agonist or antagonist, respectively. During the follicular phase of the oestrous cycle, 55 and 207 DEGs were detected after treatment with an agonist or antagonist, respectively. The detected DEGs are engaged in the regulation of various processes, such as the complement and coagulation cascade, NF-xB signalling pathway, or the pathway of 15-eicosatetraenoic acid derivatives synthesis. The results of the current study indicate that PPAR beta/delta ligands are involved in the control of the endometrial inflammatory response.

AB  - Purpose: Ranibizumab (Novartis, Copenhagen, Denmark) is a frequently used inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the treatment of macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Studying proteins that mediate the beneficial effects of ranibizumab in CRVO can potentially lead to the improved management of macular edema. Methods: In 14 Danish Landrace pigs, experimental CRVO was induced in the right eyes and treated with either intravitreal ranibizumab (n=6) or an intravitreal sodium chloride 9 mg/mL solution as a sham injection (n=8). Successful CRVO was confirmed by fluorescein angiography. Retinal samples were collected 15 days after induced CRVO and analyzed with label-free, quantification, nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Validation was performed with western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: CRVO was successfully induced and confirmed by fluorescein angiography. A total of 28 proteins were upregulated, and 31 proteins were downregulated following ranibizumab treatment. A high concentration of the ranibizumab component immunoglobulin kappa chain C region was observed in retinas treated with ranibizumab. Complement C3, the Ig lambda chain C region, and nucleobindin-2 were downregulated following ranibizumab intervention. The downregulation of complement C3 was confirmed by western blotting. The Ig lambda chain C region and nucleobindin-2 were downregulated following ranibizumab intervention. Modest changes were observed in the remaining significantly regulated proteins. Conclusions: Retinal complement C3 was downregulated following ranibizumab intervention in CRVO. The decrease in complement C3 may potentially downregulate the inflammatory response in CRVO. A high retinal concentration of ranibizumab was reached 15 days after injection of the compound.

AB  - Plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCA) are key proteins in the maintenance of calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. Dysregulation of PMCA function is associated with several human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, and, therefore, these proteins are potential drug targets to counteract those diseases. Gold compounds, namely of Au(I), are well-known for their therapeutic use in rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases for centuries. Herein, we report the ability of dichloro(2-pyridinecarboxylate)gold(III) (1), chlorotrimethylphosphinegold(I) (2), 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidenegold(I) chloride (3), and chlorotriphenylphosphinegold(I) (4) compounds to interfere with the Ca2+-ATPase activity of pig brain purified PMCA and with membranes from SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell cultures. The Au(III) compound (1) inhibits PMCA activity with the IC50 value of 4.9 mu M, while Au(I) compounds (2, 3, and 4) inhibit the protein activity with IC50 values of 2.8, 21, and 0.9 mu M, respectively. Regarding the native substrate MgATP, gold compounds 1 and 4 showed a non-competitive type of inhibition, whereas compounds 2 and 3 showed a mixed type of inhibition. All gold complexes showed cytotoxic effects on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, although compounds 1 and 3 were more cytotoxic than compounds 2 and 4. In summary, this work shows that both Au (I and III) compounds are high-affinity inhibitors of the Ca2+-ATPase activity in purified PMCA fractions and in membranes from SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Additionally, they exert strong cytotoxic effects.

AB  - Myocardial fibrosis and inflammation cause cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and heart failure in diabetics, a leading cause of mortality. Since it's complicated, no drug treats diabetic cardiomyopathy. This research examined the effects of artemisinin and allicin on heart function, myocardial fibrosis, and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B) signaling pathway in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats. A total of 50 rats were separated into 5 groups, 10 of which were the control group. 40 rats received 65 pig/g streptozotocin intraperitoneally. 37 of 40 animals fit the investigation. The artemisinin, allicin, and artemisinin/allicin groups each included nine animals. The artemisinin group received 75 mg/kg of artemisinin, the allicin group received 40 mg/kg of allicin, and the combination group received equal dosages of artemisinin and allicin gavage for four weeks. After the intervention, in each group cardiac functions, myocardial fibrosis, and NF-?B signaling pathway protein expression were assessed. All of the examined groups had greater levels of LVEDD, LVESD, LVEF, FS, E/A, and the NF-?B pathway proteins: NF-?B p65 and p-NF-?B p65 than the normal group, except for the combination group. Artemisinin and allicin did not vary statistically. Compared to the model group, the artemisinin, allicin, and combined groups showed various degrees of improvement from the pathological pattern, with more intact muscle fibers, neater arrangement, more normal cell morphology, artemisinin and allicin alleviated cardiac dysfunction and decreased myocardium fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats by inactivating the NF-?B signaling cascade.

AB  - ObjectiveEcstasy can damage the hippocampus, which impairs memory and learning. Using anti-inflammatory compounds such as curcumin may improve the side effects of ecstasy. In this study, we investigated the effect of curcumin on spatial learning and expression of NF-kB and GFAP genes in the hippocampus of rats.MethodsMale Wistar rats were divided into five groups: (1) control, (2) sham receiving saline, (3) sham receiving DMSO, (4) received ecstasy (15 mg/kg dose twice daily for four days), and (5) ecstasy receiving curcumin (200 mg/kg daily for one week). Spatial memory was estimated by Morris water maze, and GFAP and NF-kB levels in the hippocampus were assessed by qRT-PCR.ResultsMorris water maze results showed that the time spent finding the platform in the ecstasy group increased compared to the control (p < 0.001), while this time decreased in the ecstasy-curcumin group compared to the ecstasy group (p < 0.01). QRT-PCR results showed that the expression of GFAP and NF-kB is increased in the ecstasy group compared to the controls (p < 0.01). Curcumin increased the expression level of the NF-kB gene (p < 0.001), while the expression level of GFAP decreased and approached the level of the control group.ConclusionsThis study showed that ecstasy exposure leads to memory impairment. Co-administration of curcumin provided partial protection against memory impairment caused by ecstasy. It seems that the increase in NF-kB in the hippocampus following the administration of curcumin is a sign of cell regeneration and preserves cell life.

AB  - Anxiety plays a key role in guiding behavior in response to potential threats. Anxiety is mediated by the activation of pyramidal neurons in the ventral hippocampus (vH), whose activity is controlled by GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. However, how different vH interneurons might contribute to anxiety -related processes is unclear. Here, we investigate the role of vH parvalbumin (PV) -expressing interneurons while mice transition from safe to more anxiogenic compartments of the elevated plus maze (EPM). We find that vH PV interneurons increase their activity in anxiogenic EPM compartments concomitant with dynamic changes in inhibitory interactions between PV interneurons and pyramidal neurons. By optogenetically inhibiting PV interneurons, we induce an increase in the activity of vH pyramidal neurons and persistent anxiety. Collectively, our results suggest that vH inhibitory microcircuits may act as a trigger for enduring anxiety states.

AB  - This study aimed to elucidate the effects and biological targets sensitive to simultaneous 1.5 and 4.3 GHz mi-crowave exposure in rats. A total of 120 male Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups: the sham (S group), 1.5 GHz microwave exposure (L group), 4.3 GHz microwave exposure (C group) and simultaneous 1.5 and 4.3 GHz microwave exposure (LC group) groups. Spatial learning and memory, cortical electrical activity, and hippocampal ultrastructure were assessed by the Morris Water Maze, electroencephalography, and trans-mission electron microscopy, respectively. Additionally, serum exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and assessed by Western blotting, nanoparticle tracking and transmission electron microscopy. The serum exosome protein content was assessed by label-free quantitative proteomics. Impaired spatial learning and memory decreased cortical excitability, and damage to the hippocampal ultrastructure were observed in groups exposed to microwaves, especially the L and LC groups. A total of 54, 145 and 296 exosomal proteins were differentially expressed between the S group and the L, C and LC groups, respectively. These differentially expressed proteins were involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and SNARE interactions during vesicular transport. Additionally, VAMP8, Syn7 and VMAT are potential serum markers of simultaneous microwave exposure. Thus, exposure to 1.5 and 4.3 GHz microwaves induced impairments in spatial learning and memory, and simultaneous microwave exposure had the most severe effects.

AB  - The role of astroglial and microglial cells in the pathogenesis of epilepsy is currently under active investigation. It has been proposed that the activity of these cells may be regulated by the agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptors (PPARs). This study investigated the effects of a seven-day treatment with the PPAR beta/delta agonist GW0742 (Fitorine, 5 mg/kg/day) on the behavior and gene expression of the astroglial and microglial proteins involved in the regulation of epileptogenesis in the rat brain within a lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). TLE resulted in decreased social and increased locomotor activity in the rats, increased expression of astro- and microglial activation marker genes (Gfap, Aif1), pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes (Tnfa, Il1b, Il1rn), and altered expression of other microglial (Nlrp3, Arg1) and astroglial (Lcn2, S100a10) genes in the dorsal hippocampus and cerebral cortex. GW0742 attenuated, but did not completely block, some of these impairments. Specifically, the treatment affected Gfap gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus and Aif1 gene expression in the cortex. The GW0742 injections attenuated the TLE-specific enhancement of Nlrp3 and Il1rn gene expression in the cortex. These results suggest that GW0742 may affect the expression of some genes involved in the regulation of epileptogenesis.

AB  - Goal-directed navigation requires the hippocampus to process spatial information in a value-dependent manner, but its underlying mechanism needs to be better understood. Here, we investigated whether the dorsal (dHP) and intermediate (iHP) regions of the hippocampus differentially function in processing place and its associated value information. Rats were trained in a place-preference task involving reward zones with different values in a visually rich virtual reality environment where two-dimensional navigation was possible. Rats learned to use distal visual scenes effectively to navigate to the reward zone associated with a higher reward. Inactivation of both dHP and iHP with muscimol altered the efficiency and precision of wayfinding behavior, but iHP inactivation induced more severe damage, including impaired place preference. Our findings suggest that the iHP is more critical for value-dependent navigation toward higher-value goal locations.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have reported that puerarin possesses cardioprotective, vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and hypoglycemic properties. However, the impact of puerarin on sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) remains unexplored. In this study, we explored whether puerarin can modulate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation for the treatment of SAE and delved into the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: We established a murine model of SAE through intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The puerarin treatment group received pretreatment with puerarin. For in vitro experiments, BV2 cells were pre incubated with puerarin for 2 h before LPS exposure. We employed network pharmacology, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test, immunofluorescence staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to elucidate the molecular mechanism of underlying puerarin's effects in SAE treatment.
   Results: Our findings demonstrate that puerarin significantly reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) in the peripheral blood of LPS-treated mice. Moreover, puerarin treatment markedly ameliorated sepsis-associated cognitive impairment. Puerarin also exhibited inhibitory effects on the release of TNF-alpha and IL-6 from microglia, thereby preventing hippocampal neuronal cell death. Network pharmacology analysis identified AKT1 as a potential therapeutic target for puerarin in SAE treatment. Subsequently, we validated these results in both in vitro and in vitro experiments. Our study conclusively demonstrated that puerarin reduced LPS-induced phosphorylation of AKT1, with the AKT activator SC79 reversing puerarin's anti-inflammatory effects through the activation of the AKT1 signaling pathway.
   Conclusion: Puerarin exerts an anti-neuroinflammatory effect against SAE by modulating the AKT1 pathway in microglia.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that typically arises from spontaneous germline mutations in the X-chromosomal methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. For the first 6-18 months of life, the development of the mostly female patients appears normal. Subsequently, cognitive impairment, motor disturbances, hand stereotypies, epilepsy, and irregular breathing manifest, with previously learned skills being lost. Early mitochondrial impairment and a systemic oxidative burden are part of the complex pathogenesis, and contribute to disease progression. Accordingly, partial therapeutic merits of redox-stabilizing and antioxidant (AO) treatments were reported in RTT patients and Mecp2-mutant mice. Pursuing these findings, we conducted a full preclinical trial on male and female mice to define the therapeutic value of an orally administered AO cocktail composed of vitamin E, N-acetylcysteine, and alpha-lipoic acid. AO treatment ameliorated some of the microcephaly-related aspects. Moreover, the reduced growth, lowered blood glucose levels, and the hippocampal synaptic plasticity of Mecp2(-/y) mice improved. However, the first-time detected intensified oxidative DNA damage in Mecp2-mutant cortex persisted. The behavioral performance, breathing regularity, and life expectancy of Mecp2-mutant mice did not improve upon AO treatment. Long-term-treated Mecp2(+/-) mice eventually became obese. In conclusion, the AO cocktail ameliorated a subset of symptoms of the complex RTT-related phenotype, thereby further confirming the potential merits of AO-based pharmacotherapies. Yet, it also became evident that long-term AO treatment may lose efficacy and even aggravate the metabolic disturbances in RTT. This emphasizes the importance of a constantly well-balanced redox balance for systemic well-being.

AB  - Simple Summary Ocean noise pollution from marine traffic may affect the behavioral, ecological and biochemical parameters of marine fish species. Most studies have focused on behavioral changes and hearing damage in fishes, but the molecular mechanism of noise exposure in the impairment of the brain has rarely been reported. In this study, using small yellow croaker (L. polyactis) as a model, we used RNA-seq methods to characterize differently expressed genes between the control group and the noise exposure group. GO and KEGG pathway analysis found that synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter transport, endocytosis procession, cell adhesion molecules and the extracellular matrix receptor interaction pathway were over-represented in the DEGs. In addition, behavioral studies revealed that L. polyactis kept motionless on the surface of the water and lost the ability to keep their balance after noise exposure. Collectively, our results indicate that exposure to noise stressors contributes to neurological dysfunction in the brain and impaired locomotor ability in L. polyactis. Noise has the potential to induce physiological stress in marine fishes, which may lead to all sorts of ecological consequences. In the current study, we used the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) method to sequence the whole transcriptome of the brain in small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis). The animals were exposed to a mix of noises produced by different types of boat played back in a tank, then the brain tissues were collected after the fish had been exposed to a 120 dB noise for 0.5 h. In total, 762 differently expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups were identified, including 157 up regulated and 605 down regulated genes in the noise exposure group compared with the control group. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that the most up regulated gene categories included synaptic membranes, receptor-mediated endocytosis and the neurotransmitter secretion process. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways found that endocytosis, cell adhesion molecules and the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction pathway were over-represented. Specifically, ECM-related genes, including lamin2, lamin3, lamin4, coll1a2, coll5a1 and col4a5 were down regulated in the noise exposure group, implying the impaired composition of the ECM. In addition, the behavioral experiment revealed that L. polyactis exhibited avoidance behaviors to run away from the noise source at the beginning of the noise exposure period. At the end of the noise exposure period, L. polyactis kept motionless on the surface of the water and lost the ability to keep their balance. Taken together, our results indicate that exposure to noise stress contributes to neurological dysfunction in the brain and impaired locomotor ability in L. polyactis.

AB  - How can words shape meaning? Shared labels highlight commonalities between concepts whereas contrasting labels make differences apparent. To address such findings, we propose a deep learning account that spans perception to decision (i.e. labelling). The model takes photographs as input, transforms them to semantic representations through computations that parallel the ventral visual stream, and finally determines the appropriate linguistic label. The underlying theory is that minimising error on two prediction tasks (predicting the meaning and label of a stimulus) requires a compromise in the network's semantic representations. Thus, differences in label use, whether across languages or levels of expertise, manifest in differences in the semantic representations that support label discrimination. We confirm these predictions in simulations involving fine-grained and coarse-grained labels. We hope these and allied efforts which model perception, semantics, and labelling at scale will advance developmental and neurocomputational accounts of concept and language learning.

AB  - We addressed the question of why juvenile R. ferrumequinum that are born early (May to early June) in the nursery roost at Stackpole, West Wales, tend to have a higher forearm growth rate than individuals born later (late June to July). An appropriate non-linear growth equation (either logistic, Gompertz, von-Bertalanffy, or asymptotic regression) was identified to fit the measurements of the forearms of juvenile R. ferrumequinum collected from marked individuals at the roost between 1994 and 2013. The logistic growth model provided the best line of fit to the changes in the forearm lengths, indicated by the lowest standard error. Over the 20-year study period, the mean values of the logistic growth parameters were asymptotic length (L-infinity) = 55.10 mm and growth constant (K) = 0.11 day(-1). Multiple regression analysis indicated that the most significant predictors of the variance in L infinity and K (R-2 = 58.7% and 54.3%, respectively) were the nursery roost temperatures at midnight, and the total foraging times of the adult bats during the night. If the juveniles were born early, when the roost temperature was colder, and the foraging times of the adults were shorter, then a lower value of K produced forearms that grew toward a longer L infinity. If the juveniles were born late, when the roost temperature was warmer, and the foraging times of the adults were longer, then a higher value of K produced forearms that grew toward a shorter L infinity. Reasons are proposed to explain the differences between the growth of early and late born individuals, including the effect of increased body mass associated with warmer roost temperatures and possible causes of longer foraging times.

AB  - Students and educators spend significant time in learning spaces on university campuses. Energy efficiency has become a concern among facility managers, given the need to maintain acceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) levels during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates the relationship between control and extraneous variables in a university classroom's total mechanical ventilation (kWh). The model is built using Grasshopper software on Rhino Version 7. Our methodology encompasses (1) an extensive review of recent trends for studying IAQ and energy, (2) selecting parameters for simulation, (3) model configuration on Grasshopper, and finally, (4) a formulation of a pertinent equation to consolidate the relationship between the studied factors and the total mechanical ventilation energy (kWh). Central to this study are two key research questions: (1) What correlations exist between various parameters related to occupancy and IAQ in educational spaces? And (2) how can we optimize energy efficiency in university classrooms? The main contribution of this research is a generated equation representing the annual mechanical ventilation energy consumption based on selected parameters of classroom height, area, occupancy, window location, and ventilation rate of HVAC systems. We find that occupancy and class volume are the two most influential factors directly affecting mechanical ventilation energy consumption. The equation serves as a valuable estimation tool for facility managers, designers, and campus operations to investigate how fluctuations in occupancy can influence ventilation energy consumption in the physical attributes of a university classroom. This enables proactive decision-making, optimizing energy efficiency and resource allocation in real-time to promote sustainable and cost-effective campus operations.

AB  - TEAD transcription factors play a central role in the Hippo signaling pathway. In this study, we focused on transcriptional enhancer factor TEF-3 (TEAD4), exploring its regulation by the deubiquitinase OTU domain-containing protein 6A (OTUD6A). We identified OTUD6A as a TEAD4-interacting deubiquitinase, positively influencing TEAD-driven transcription without altering TEAD4 stability. Structural analyses revealed specific interaction domains: the N-terminal domain of OTUD6A and the YAP-binding domain of TEAD4. Functional assays demonstrated the positive impact of OTUD6A on the transcription of YAP-TEAD target genes. Despite no impact on TEAD4 nuclear localization, OTUD6A selectively modulated nuclear interactions, enhancing YAP-TEAD4 complex formation while suppressing VGLL4 (transcription cofactor vestigial-like protein 4)-TEAD4 interaction. Critically, OTUD6A facilitated YAP-TEAD4 complex binding to target gene promoters. Our study unveils the regulatory landscape of OTUD6A on TEAD4, providing insights into diseases regulated by YAP-TEAD complexes.<br />

AB  - BACKGROUNDAccurate discrimination of the country of origin of teas is critical to determine their actual commercial value, to meet consumer preferences, and to ensure compliance with labeling regulations. Therefore, in this study, we developed a new approach to accurately discriminate the country of origin of teas in the Turkish market.RESULTSA thermal desorption/gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (TD/GC-MS) method combined with optimizable neural networks (ONN) was developed to analyze the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of tea samples subjected to infusion or grinding pretreatments. Prior to GC-MS analysis, the conventional thermal desorption method was applied to VOCs in the powdered teas, while VOCs in the infused teas were adsorbed on Tenax-TA sorbent tubes attached to a micro-chamber/thermal extractor (mu-CTE) and then thermally desorbed. Using a feature selection technique, a total of 11 VOCs from infused tea samples, 21 VOCs from ground tea samples, and 18 VOCs from both groups were identified as specific VOCs that critically affect the classification of the teas. As a result of ONN classification of selected VOCs from only ground tea samples and infused tea samples, 95.51% and 96.7% accuracy was obtained, respectively, while 100% classification accuracy was achieved by ONN classification of VOCs from both sample groups.CONCLUSIONThe results showed that different pretreatments applied to Turkish and Ceylon teas caused the release of different volatile compounds, resulting in more specific VOC profiles. In addition, the developed mu-CTE/TD/GC-MS method allowed a more accurate classification of the black tea samples than the TD/GC-MS system alone. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension of newborns (PAHN) constitutes a critical condition involving both severe cardiac remodeling and right ventricle dysfunction. One main cause of this condition is perinatal hypoxia and oxidative stress. Thus, it is a public health concern for populations living above 2500 m and in cases of intrauterine chronic hypoxia in lowlands. Still, pulmonary and cardiac impairments in PAHN lack effective treatments. Previously we have shown the beneficial effects of neonatal melatonin treatment on pulmonary circulation. However, the cardiac effects of this treatment are unknown. In this study, we assessed whether melatonin improves cardiac function and modulates right ventricle (RV) oxidative stress. Ten lambs were gestated, born, and raised at 3600 m. Lambs were divided in two groups. One received daily vehicle as control, and another received daily melatonin (1 mg & BULL;kg(-1)& BULL;d(-1)) for 21 days. Daily cardiovascular measurements were recorded and, at 29 days old, cardiac tissue was collected. Melatonin decreased pulmonary arterial pressure at the end of the experimental period. In addition, melatonin enhanced manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase (CAT) expression, while increasing CAT activity in RV. This was associated with a decrease in superoxide anion generation at the mitochondria and NADPH oxidases in RV. Finally, these effects were associated with a marked decrease of oxidative stress markers in RV. These findings support the cardioprotective effects of an oral administration of melatonin in newborns that suffer from developmental chronic hypoxia.

AB  - Daqinjiao decoction (DQJD), an ancient traditional Chinese medicine formula, is clinically used in the treatment of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which DQJD exerts its therapeutic effects on CSVD remain elusive. A Sprague Dawley rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) was established using bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) surgery. The effects of DQJD administered via intragastric gavage (i.g.) were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), haematoxylin eosin (HE) staining, and transmission electron microscopy. A combined strategy of transcriptomics and network pharmacology was innovatively applied to study the active ingredients, gene targets, and mechanisms of DQJD in treating CSVD. Molecular docking, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and Western blot analysis were applied to confirm the above results further. DQJD improved the pathological damage in cortical and hippocampal tissue by reducing the release of inflammatory factors in CCH rats. RNA-seq technology identified 46 DEGs between DQJD treatment and the model group. Network pharmacology and pathway analysis of DEGs revealed that the PPAR/VEGF signalling pathway was predicted to be significantly affected. Consistently, validation experiments confirmed that activation of the RXR-gamma/PPAR-gamma/VEGF-alpha signalling pathway represents a key mechanism underlying DQJD's therapeutic effects against CSVD. DQJD dampened inflammation and ameliorated pathological damage in the hippocampus and cortex, and these beneficial effects were associated with neurovascular protection via activating the RXR-gamma/PPAR-gamma/VEGF-alpha pathway.

AB  - Inorganic arsenic [As(III) and As(V)] is a pervasive environmental contaminant in groundwater systems, early-life exposure to which is associated with an impaired cognitive ability and an increased risk of neurobehavioral disorders. Although the effect of As(III) on the neurons is well studied, the involvement of the microglia remains unclear. In this study, the effects of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) on microglial activation and the underlying NLRP3 inflammasome mechanism were determined. Pregnant rats were gavaged with NaAsO2 (0, 1, 4, and 10 mg/kg body weight), which dissociates in aqueous solutions into bioactive arsenite species [As(OH)3], from gestational day 1 (GD1) to postnatal day 21 (PND21). The results showed that As(III) induces learning and memory impairments and microglial activation in the hippocampus of offspring rats (PND21). Increased expression of NLRP3, the activation of caspase-1, and the production of interleukin-1 beta were observed in both the hippocampus of As(III)-exposed offspring rats and As(III)-exposed microglial BV2 cells under culture conditions. Interestingly, blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome using MCC950 mitigated its activation. Furthermore, inhibition of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) using apocynin or specific siRNA significantly reduced As(III)-induced microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, inactivation of the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome or NOX2 markedly rescued As(III)-induced neurotoxicity in the hippocampal HT22 cells. Taken together, this study reveals that NOX2/NLRP3-inflammasome-dependent microglial activation promotes As(III)-induced learning and memory impairments in developmental rats.

AB  - Tendinopathy is a common tendon disorder characterized by pain, swelling, and dysfunction. Current evidence has demonstrated that the depletion of stem cell pool and non-tenogenic differentiation of tendon-derived stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) might account for the pathogenesis of tendinopathy. FNDC5/Irisin, as a novel exercise-induced myokine, is proved to be involved in the exercise-induced protective effects on musculoskeletal disorders. However, whether irisin can affect TSPCs fate is still unknown. To ascertain the roles of irisin on the proliferation and tenogenic differentiation of TSPCs, rat TSPCs were isolated and incubated with irisin. Cell viability, phenotypic changes, and related signaling pathways were evaluated by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, and proteasome activity assay. We found that irisin treatment increased the proliferative and colony-forming abilities, and promoted the tenogenic differentiation of TSPCs by upregulating the expression of YAP/TAZ. In conclusion, our work showed for the first time that irisin promotes the proliferation and tenogenic differentiation of rat TSPCs in vitro by activating YAP/TAZ, and the process was associated with a ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway. In conclusion, irisin and agents targeting YAP/TAZ may be promising therapeutic options for tendinopathy.

AB  - Social behavioral changes, including social isolation or loneliness, increase the risk for stress-related disorders, such as major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicide, which share a strong neuroinflammatory etiopathogenetic component. The peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, a newly discovered target involved in emotional behavior regulation, is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor and a transcription factor that, following stimulation by endogenous or synthetic ligands, may induce neuroprotective effects by modulating neuroinflammation, and improve anxiety and depression-like behaviors by enhancing neurosteroid biosynthesis. How stress affects epigenetic mechanisms with downstream effects on inflammation and emotional behavior remains poorly understood. We studied the effects of 4-week social isolation, using a mouse model of PTSD/suicide-like behavior, on hippocampal PPAR-alpha epigenetic modification. Decreased PPAR-alpha expression in the hippocampus of socially isolated mice was associated with increased levels of methylated cytosines of PPAR-alpha gene CpG-rich fragments and deficient neurosteroid biosynthesis. This effect was associated with increased histone deacetylases (HDAC)1, methyl-cytosine binding protein (MeCP)2 and decreased ten-eleven translocator (TET)2 expression, which favor hypermethylation. These alterations were associated with increased TLR-4 and pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-alpha,), mediated by NF-kappa B signaling in the hippocampus of aggressive mice. This study contributes the first evidence of stress-induced brain PPAR-alpha epigenetic regulation. Social isolation stress may constitute a risk factor for inflammatory-based psychiatric disorders associated with neurosteroid deficits, and targeting epigenetic marks linked to PPAR-alpha downregulation may offer a valid therapeutic approach.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs), as a therapeutic agent, have shown great promise in the treatment of neurological diseases. To date, the neurorestorative effects and underlying mechanism of MSC-EVs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not well known. Herein, we aimed to investigate the action of MSC-EVs on the neuronal deficits in beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-stimulated hippocampal neurons, or AD cell (SHSY5Y cell lines) and animal (APPswe / PS1dE9 mice) models. In the present study, the cell and AD models received a single-dose of MSC-EVs, and were then assessed for behavioral deficits, pathological changes, intracellular calcium transients, neuronal morphology alterations, or electrophysiological variations. Additionally, the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2, a key mediator of neuronal injury in AD) signaling pathway was probed by western blotting in vitro and in vivo models of AD. Our results showed that MSC-EVs therapy improved the cognitive impairments and reduced the hippocampal A beta aggregation and neuronal loss in AD mice. Markedly, EV treatment restored the calcium oscillations, dendritic spine alterations, action potential abnormalities, or mitochondrial changes in the hippocampus of AD models. Also, we found that the Nrf2 signaling pathway participated in the actions of MSC-EVs in the cell and animal models. Together, these data indicate that MS-EVs as promising nanotherapeutics for restoration of hippocampal neuronal morphology and function in APP / PS1 mice, further highlighting the clinical values of MSC-EVs in the treatment of AD.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a multifaceted intestinal hormone with diverse physiological functions throughout the body. Previously, we demonstrated that the steviol glycoside rebaudioside A (rebA) from Stevia rebaudiana stimulates the release of GLP-1 from mouse intestinal organoids and pig intestinal segments. To further unravel the underlying mechanisms, we examined the involvement of sweet- and bitter taste receptors and their associated signal transduction pathways. Experiments with mouse and human intestinal enteroendocrine cell lines (STC-1 and HuTu-80, respectively) confirmed that rebA stimulates GLP-1 release in a concentration-dependent manner. Experiments with selective inhibitors of sweet signalling in both the murine as well as the human enteroendocrine cells showed that the GLP-1-induced release by rebA occurs independently of the sweet taste receptor. Functional screening of 34 murine bitter taste receptors (Tas2rs) revealed an activation response with Tas2r108, Tas2r123 and Tas2r134. Moreover, we found evidence in human HuTu-80 cells, that TAS2R4 and TRPM5 are involved in rebA-induced GLP-1 secretion, suggesting a role for bitter taste signaling in gut hormone release. Interestingly, the rebA-dependent GLP-1 release may be modulated by GABA and 6-methoxyflavanone present in the diet. Together, our findings warrant further characterization of the specific metabolic effects of rebA among the non-caloric sweeteners.

AB  - Proteomics in the hippocampal dentate gyri reveal that behavioural impairments in THRSP-overexpressing mice could be regulated by Wnt signalling.
   Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often struggle with impaired executive function, temporal processing, and visuospatial memory, hallmarks of the predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-PI), subserved by the hippocampus. However, the specific genes/proteins involved and how they shape hippocampal structures to influence ADHD behavior remain poorly understood. As an exploratory tool, hippocampal dentate gyri tissues from thyroid hormone-responsive protein overexpressing (THRSP OE) mice with defining characteristics of ADHD-PI were utilized in proteomics. Integrated proteomics and network analysis revealed an altered protein network involved in Wnt signaling. Compared with THRSP knockout (KO) mice, THRSP OE mice showed impaired attention and memory, accompanied by dysregulated Wnt signaling affecting hippocampal dentate gyrus cell proliferation and expression of markers for neural stem cell (NSC) activity. Also, combined exposure to an enriched environment and treadmill exercise could improve behavioral deficits in THRSP OE mice and Wnt signaling and NSC activity. These findings show new markers specific to the ADHD-PI presentation, converging with the ancient and evolutionary Wnt signaling pathways crucial for cell fate determination, migration, polarity, and neural patterning during neurodevelopment. These findings from THRSP OE mice support the role of Wnt signaling in neurological disorders, particularly ADHD-PI presentation.

AB  - Theta oscillations generated in hippocampal (HPC) and cortical neuronal networks are involved in various aspects of brain function, including sensorimotor integration, movement planning, memory formation and attention. Disruptions of theta rhythms are present in individuals with brain disorders, including epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Theta rhythm generation involves a specific interplay between cellular (ion channel) and network (synaptic) mechanisms. HCN channels are theta modulators, and several medications are known to enhance their activity. We investigated how different doses of lamotrigine (LTG), an HCN channel modulator, and antiepileptic and neuroprotective agent, would affect HPC theta rhythms in acute HPC slices (in vitro) and anaesthetized rats (in vivo). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed that LTG decreased GABA(A)-fast transmission in CA3 cells, in vitro. In addition, LTG directly depressed CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neuron excitability. These effects were partially blocked by ZD 7288, a selective HCN blocker, and are consistent with decreased excitability associated with antiepileptic actions. Lamotrigine depressed HPC theta oscillations in vitro, also consistent with its neuronal depressant effects. In contrast, it exerted an opposite, enhancing effect, on theta recorded in vivo. The contradictory in vivo and in vitro results indicate that LTG increases ascending theta activating medial septum/entorhinal synaptic inputs that over-power the depressant effects seen in HPC neurons. These results provide new insights into LTG actions and indicate an opportunity to develop more precise therapeutics for the treatment of dementias, memory disorders and epilepsy.

KW  - HIPPO SIGNALING PATHWAY
KW  - THERAPY
AB  - The dysregulation of Hippo signaling is a crucial factor driving the progression of gastric cancer, making the targeting of the Hippo pathway a promising therapeutic strategy. However, effective drugs targeting the Hippo/YAP axis remain unavailable. Thus, identifying potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms that inhibit the activity of the Hippo/YAP axis in gastric cancer is of paramount importance. The ubiquitination modification of the Hippo/YAP pathway plays a significant role in signaling transduction and cancer progression. In an effort to shed light on effective therapeutic targets, we conducted a screening using a deubiquitinase small interfering RNA library, leading to the identification of USP12 as an important deubiquitinase in the context of Hippo/YAP axis and the progression of gastric cancer. Our bioinformatic analysis further demonstrated a correlation between USP12 and poor survival, as well as a positive association with classical YAP target genes in gastric cancer samples. Notably, USP12 depletion was found to inhibit gastric cancer progression via the Hippo/YAP axis, whereas USP12 overexpression exhibited the opposite effect, promoting gastric cancer growth and enhancing YAP activity. Further studies through immuno-staining and immuno-precipitation assays indicated the nuclear localization of USP12 and its association with YAP to enhance YAP stability. Specifically, our findings revealed that USP12 could inhibit K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of YAP, predominantly at the K315 site. As a result, we have identified a novel regulatory mechanism involving USP12 and Hippo signaling in the progression of gastric cancer, with the potential for blockade of USP12 to materialize as a promising strategy for combating gastric cancer.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. In particular, neuroinflammation, mediated by microglia cells but also through CD8+ T-cells, actively contributes to disease pathology. Leukotrienes are involved in neuroinflammation and in the pathological hallmarks of AD. In consequence, leukotriene signaling-more specifically, the leukotriene receptors-has been recognized as a potential drug target to ameliorate AD pathology. Here, we analyzed the effects of the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast (MTK) on hippocampal gene expression in 5xFAD mice, a commonly used transgenic AD mouse model. We identified glial activation and neuroinflammation as the main pathways modulated by MTK. The treatment increased the number of Tmem119+ microglia and downregulated genes related to AD-associated microglia and to lipid droplet-accumulating microglia, suggesting that the MTK treatment targets and modulates microglia phenotypes in the disease model compared to the vehicle. MTK treatment further reduced infiltration of CD8+T-cells into the brain parenchyma. Finally, MTK treatment resulted in improved cognitive functions. In summary, we provide a proof of concept for MTK to be a potential drug candidate for AD and provide novel modes of action via modulation of microglia and CD8+ T-cells. Of note, 5xFAD females showed a more severe pathology, and in consequence, MTK treatment had a more pronounced effect in the females compared to the males. The effects on neuroinflammation, i.e., microglia and CD8+ T-cells, as well as the effects on cognitive outcome, were dose-dependent, therefore arguing for the use of higher doses of MTK in AD clinical trials compared to the approved asthma dose.

AB  - Sleep duration, psychiatric disorders and dementias are closely interconnected in older adults. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms and brain structural changes are unknown. Using data from the UK Biobank for participants primarily of European ancestry aged 38-73 years, including 94% white people, we identified a nonlinear association between sleep, with approximately 7h as the optimal sleep duration, and genetic and cognitive factors, brain structure, and mental health as key measures. The brain regions most significantly underlying this interconnection included the precentral cortex, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Longitudinal analysis revealed that both insufficient and excessive sleep duration were significantly associated with a decline in cognition on follow up. Furthermore, mediation analysis and structural equation modeling identified a unified model incorporating polygenic risk score (PRS), sleep, brain structure, cognition and mental health. This indicates that possible genetic mechanisms and brain structural changes may underlie the nonlinear relationship between sleep duration and cognition and mental health.

AB  - Awka and Nnewi metropolises are known for intensive socioeconomic activities that could predispose the available groundwater to pollution. In this paper, an integrated investigation of the drinking water quality and associated human health risks of contaminated groundwater was carried out using geochemical models, numerical water quality models, and the HHRISK code. Physicochemical analysis revealed that the groundwater pH is acidic. Predicted results from PHREEQC model showed that most of the major chemical and trace elements occurred as free mobile ions while a few were bounded to their various hydrated, oxides and carbonate phases. This may have limited their concentration in the groundwater; implying that apart from anthropogenic influx, the metals and their species also occur in the groundwater as a result of geogenic processes. The PHREEQC-based insights were also supported by joint multivariate statistical analyses. Groundwater quality index, pollution index of groundwater, heavy metal toxicity load, and heavy metal evaluation index revealed that 60-70% of the groundwater samples within the two metropolises are unsuitable for drinking as a result of anthropogenic influx, with Pb and Cd identified as the priority elements influencing the water quality. The HHRISK code evaluated the ingestion and dermal exposure pathway of the consumption of contaminated water for children and adult. Results revealed that groundwater from both areas poses a very high chronic and carcinogenic risk from ingestion than dermal contact with the children population showing greater vulnerability. Aggregated and cumulative HHRISK coefficients identified Cd, Pb, and Cu, to have the highest health impact on the groundwater quality of both areas; with residents around Awka appearing to be at greater risks. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the adoption of a state-of-the-art waste management and water treatment strategies to ensure safe drinking water for the public.

AB  - The rapid increase in urbanization is altering the natural composition of the day-night light ratio. The light/dark cycle regulates animal learning, memory, and mood swings. A study was conducted to examine the effect of different quantity and quality of light at night on the daily clock, learning, memory, cognition, and expression of transcripts in key learning centers. Treatment was similar for experiments one to three. Rats were exposed for 30 days to 12 h light and 12 h dark with a night light of 2 lx (dLAN group), 250 lx (LL), or without night light (LD). In experiment one, after 28 days, blood samples were collected and 2 days later, animals were exposed to constant darkness. In experiment two, after 30 days of treatment, animals were subjected to various tests involving learning, memory, and cognition. In experiment three, after 30 days of treatment, animals were sampled, and transcript levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tyrosine kinase, Growth-Associated Protein 43, Neurogranin, microRNA-132, cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein, Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, and Tumor necrosis factor a were measured in hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex tissues. In experiment four, animals were exposed to night light of 0.019 W/m(2) but of either red (640 nm), green (540 nm), or blue (450 nm) wavelength for 30 days, and similar tests were performed as mentioned in experiment 2. While in experiment five, after 30 days of respective wavelength treatments, all animals were sampled for gene expression studies. Our results show that exposure to dLAN and LL affects the daily clock as reflected by altered melatonin secretion and locomotor activity, compromises the learning, memory, and cognitive ability, and alterations in the expression levels of transcripts in the hypothalamus, cortex, and thalamus. The effect is night light intensity dependent. Further, blue light at night has less drastic effects than green and red light. These results could be of the potential use of framing the policies for the use of light at night.

AB  - Lay Summary We investigated the evolution of brain volume changes in different regions among HIV-negative and non-transplant cryptococcal meningitis (CM) patients within 1 year after initial therapy. To assess whether brain atrophy occurs among HIV-negative and non-transplant CM patients.
   To explore the brain volume (BV) changes of HIV-negative and non-transplant cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in 1 year after initial therapy. Case data were collected from 78 CM patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning at least 3 times in 1-year interval after initial therapy. The assessment of BV was measured by a non-commercial software, uAI Research Portal. Linear mixed model was used to investigate the association between clinical characteristics and the changes in BV. Longitudinal study showed a decrease in total brain volume (-4.65 cm(3), P = .005), regional brain volume including white matter (-2.86 cm(3), P = .031) and basal ganglia (-0.25 cm(3), P = .007), and increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume (3.58 cm(3), P = .013) in CM patients in 1 year after initial therapy. Ventricular volume in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS) was lower than that in patients without VPS (-7.5 cm(3), P < .05). Ventricular volume in patients with post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome (PIIRS) was larger than that in patients without PIIRS (7.1 cm(3), P < .01). In addition, temporal lobe atrophy was associated with corticosteroid therapy (-6.8 cm(3), P < .01). The present study suggested that brain atrophy, especially regional BV decrease, could happen in HIV-negative and non-transplant CM patients over a 1-year interval.

AB  - Proanthocyanidins are major UV-absorbing compounds. To clarify the effect of enhanced UV-B radiation on the proanthocyanidin synthesis and antioxidant capacity of traditional rice varieties in Yuanyang terraced fields, we studied the effects of enhanced UV-B radiation (0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 kJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1)) on the rice grain morphology, proanthocyanidins content, and synthesis. The effects of UV-B radiation on the antioxidant capacity of rice were evaluated by feeding aging model mice. The results showed that UV-B radiation significantly affected the grain morphology of red rice and increased the compactness of starch grains in the starch storage cells of central endosperm. The content of proanthocyanidin B2 and C1 in the grains was significantly increased by 2.5 and 5.0 kJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) UV-B radiation. The activity of leucoanthocyanidin reductase was higher in rice treated by 5.0 kJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) than other treatments. The number of neurons in the hippocampus CA1 of mice brain fed red rice increased. After 5.0 kJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) treatment, red rice has the best antioxidant effect on aging model mice. UV-B radiation induces the synthesis of rice proanthocyanidins B2 and C1, and the antioxidant capacity of rice is related to the content of proanthocyanidins.

AB  - Fat deposition, especially the intramuscular (IM) fat deposition, is directly associated with meat quality. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding-protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 3 (CRTC3) plays an important role in energy metabolism and various biological processes. The expression of porcine CRTC3 in skeletal muscle is positively associated with intramuscular fat deposition and possesses the capacity to control the intramuscular (IM) adipocyte morphology. However, the metabolic effects and transcriptional mechanism of CRTC3 in porcine intramuscular (IM) adipocytes as well as the regulatory mechanism of CRTC3 on porcine adipocyte differentiation have not been studied. Here, we utilized metabolomics and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to determine the metabolic and transcriptome profiles of CRTC3-overexpressing IM adipocytes. Moreover, the effect and regulation mechanism of CRTC3 on porcine IM and subcutaneous (SC) adipocyte differentiation were also studied. Our results showed that CRTC3 overexpression dramatically altered the metabolites in IM adipocytes. Glycerophospholipid (GP) metabolism and related genes were significantly changed in CRTC3-overexpressing IM adipocytes. Moreover, we demonstrated that CRTC3 overexpression promotes adipogenic differentiation by upregulating the Ca2+-cAMP signaling pathway in IM and SC adipocytes. We showed alterations in metabolites and in the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in CRTC3-overexpressing adipocytes and demonstrated the regulatory mechanism of CRTC3 on the adipogenic differentiation of porcine adipocytes. These results provide new insights into the regulatory roles of CRTC3 in porcine adipocytes, which could be an important target to regulate fat deposition in animals.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a prevalent industrial and environmental contaminant that accumulates in the tissues of animals and humans. In particular, one of the regions most affected by Cd-induced neurodegeneration is the hippocampus. Linalool (Lin) is a monoterpene capable of traversing the blood-brain barrier owing to its low molecular weight and high lipophilicity. This study sought to establish the possible neuroprotective effects of Lin against Cd-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration by focusing on the 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)/Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway. The 28 male rats used in the experiment were randomly (n = 7) distributed into four groups. The control group was not administered. The Cd group received CdCl2 at a dose of 3 mg/kg (cumulative 21 mg/kg) for the first 7 days of the experiment. The Cd + Lin group was given 3 mg/kg CdCl2 for the first 7 days of the experiment and 100 mg/kg Lin for 14 days throughout the experiment. The Lin group was administered Lin at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day. After all treatments were finished, the rats' brain tissues were taken out on the 15th day of the experiment. In this study, Cd increased oxidative stress parameters and decreased antioxidant enzyme levels in hippocampus tissue. In addition, Cd caused an increase in NF-kappa B and pro-apoptotic Caspas3 levels, which play an important role in inflammation in the hippocampus. Lin treatment against Cd exposure showed a therapeutic effect by suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Lin may exert a neuroprotective effect by regulating the 4-HNE/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in Cd exposure-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration.

AB  - Induction of BDNF-TrkB signaling is associated with the action mechanisms of conventional and fast-acting antidepressants. GSB-106, developed as a small dimeric dipeptide mimetic of BDNF, was previously shown to produce antidepressant-like effects in the mouse Porsolt test, tail suspension test, Nomura water wheel test, in the chronic social defeat stress model and in the inflammation-induced model of depression. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of chronic per os administration of GSB-106 to Balb/c mice under unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). It was observed for the first time that long term GSB-106 treatment (1 mg/kg, 26 days) during ongoing UCMS procedure ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors in mice as indicated by the Porsolt test. In addition, chronic per os administration of GSB-106 resulted in an increase in BDNF levels, which were found to be decreased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice after UCMS. Furthermore, prolonged GSB-106 treatment was accompanied by an increase in the content of pTrkB(706/707) in the prefrontal cortex and by a pronounced increase in the level of pTrkB(816) in both studied brain structures of mice subjected to UCMS procedure. In summary, the present data show that chronic GSB-106 treatment produces an antidepressant-like effect in the unpredictable chronic mild stress model, which is likely to be associated with the regulation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling.

AB  - Neuronal Tau protein hyperphosphorylation (PPtau) is a hallmark of tauopathic neurodegeneration. However, a reversible brain PPtau occurs in mammals during either natural or "synthetic" torpor (ST), a transient deep hypothermic state that can be pharmacologically induced in rats. Since in both conditions a high sleep pressure builds up during the regaining of euthermia, the aim of this work was to assess the possible role of post-ST sleep in PPtau dephosphorylation. Male rats were studied at the hypothermic nadir of ST, and 3-6 h after the recovery of euthermia, after either normal sleep (NS) or total sleep deprivation (SD). The effects of SD were studied by assessing: (i) deep brain temperature (Tb); (ii) immunofluorescent staining for AT8 (phosphorylated Tau) and Tau-1 (non-phosphorylated Tau), assessed in 19 brain structures; (iii) different phosphorylated forms of Tau and the main cellular factors involved in Tau phospho-regulation, including pro- and anti-apoptotic markers, assessed through western blot in the parietal cortex and hippocampus; (iv) systemic factors which are involved in natural torpor; (v) microglia activation state, by considering morphometric variations. Unexpectedly, the reversibility of PPtau was more efficient in SD than in NS animals, and was concomitant with a higher Tb, higher melatonin plasma levels, and a higher frequency of the microglia resting phenotype. Since the reversibility of ST-induced PPtau was previously shown to be driven by a latent physiological molecular mechanism triggered by deep hypothermia, short-term SD soon after the regaining of euthermia seems to boost the possible neuroprotective effects of this mechanism.

AB  - Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a class of transcription factors consisting of NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC subunits, which are widely distributed in eukaryotes. The NF-YC subunit regulates plant growth and development and plays an important role in the response to stresses. However, there are few reports on this gene subfamily in tea plants. In this study, nine CsNF-YC genes were identified in the genome of 'Longjing 43'. Their phylogeny, gene structure, promoter cis-acting elements, motifs and chromosomal localization of these gene were analyzed. Tissue expression characterization revealed that most of the CsNF-YCs were expressed at low levels in the terminal buds and at relatively high levels in the flowers and roots. CsNF-YC genes responded significantly to gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. We further focused on CsNF-YC6 because it may be involved in the growth and development of tea plants and the regulation of response to abiotic stresses. The CsNF-YC6 protein is localized in the nucleus. Arabidopsis that overexpressed CsNF-YC6 (CsNF-YC6-OE) showed increased seed germination and increased root length under ABA and GA treatments. In addition, the number of cauline leaves, stem lengths and silique numbers were significantly higher in overexpressing Arabidopsis lines than wild type under long-day growth conditions, and CsNF-YC6 promoted primary root growth and increased flowering in Arabidopsis. qPCR analysis showed that in CsNF-YC6-OE lines, flowering pathway-related genes were transcribed at higher levels than wild type. The investigation of the CsNF-YC gene has unveiled that CsNF-YC6 plays a pivotal role in plant growth, root and flower development, as well as responses to abiotic stress.

AB  - The aim of this work was to compare the effectiveness of ultra-rapid freezing (UF) and conventional slow freezing (CF) to cryopreserve buck sperm throughout the year. During 1 year, semen from 10 adult Gabon bucks was collected by electroejaculation every 2 weeks. Before and after freezing, samples were selected by density gradient centrifugation, and after sperm selection, the sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was CF with an extender based on Tris, citric acid, and glucose (TCG) +6% yolk +5% glycerol, and maintained at 5 degrees C for 3 hours of equilibration before freezing. The other aliquot was frozen using an UF method with an extender based on TCG +6% yolk +100 mM sucrose, and maintained at 5 degrees C for 30 minutes. The evaluations included the percentages of motile sperm, sperm with progressive motility, quality of sperm motility, and the percentages of sperm with functional membrane, live sperm, sperm with morphoabnormalities, and sperm with intact acrosome. The percentage of sperm with intact acrosome was higher using the conventional freezing method (p < 0.05). After thawing and at pre- and postselection stages, the quality of motility, and the percentages of motile sperm, progressive motile sperm, sperm with functional membrane, and with intact acrosome were greater using CF than UF (p < 0.005). Conventional freezing was more effective than UF to cryopreserve sperm from Gabon bucks, at least in our experimental conditions. Most differences in favor of CF were observed in the quality of motility, and the percentages of motile sperm, progressive motile sperm, sperm with functional membrane, and with intact acrosome during long periods of the year, or even remained throughout it.

AB  - Increased stemness of cancer cells exacerbates radioresistance, thereby greatly limiting the efficacy of radiotherapy. In order to study the changes in cancer cell stemness during radiotherapy, we established a radioresistance model of human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells and obtained A549 radioresistant cells (A549-RR). We sampled the cells at different time points during the modeling process and investigated the heterogeneity of each group of cells using single-cell sequencing. Cells in the early stages of fractionated irradiation were found to be significantly up-regulated in stemness, and a subpopulation of cells producing this response was screened and referred to as "radiation-induced stemness-responsive cancer cells". They were undergoing stemness response, energy metabolism reprogramming, and progressively differentiating into cells with more diverse and malignant phenotypes in order to attenuate the killing effect of radiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that such responses might be driven by the activation of the EGFR-Hippo signaling pathway axis, which also plays a crucial role in the development of radioresistance. Our study reveals the dynamic evolution of cell subpopulation in cancer cells during fractionated radiotherapy; the early stage of irradiation can determine the destiny of the radiation-induced stemness-responsive cancer cells. The activation of stemness-like phenotypes during the development of radioresistance is not the result of dose accumulation but occurs during the early stage of radiotherapy with relatively low-dose irradiation. The degree of the radiation-induced stemness response of cancer cells mediated by the EGFR-Hippo signaling pathway might be a potential predictor of the efficacy of radiotherapy and the development of radioresistance.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we investigated the critical process of cell fate determination in mouse embryos, focusing on the transition from embryonic stem cells (ESC) to trophoblast stem-like cells (TSLC). As ESCs and TSCs have distinct lineage differences and functional boundaries, the natural conversion between them is hindered. Through the inhibition of LATS kinase, we not only facilitated the conversion of inner cell mass (ICM) to trophectoderm (TE), but also successfully transformed ESC into stable self-renewing TSLC. Our findings highlighted the distinct molecular properties of TSLC, including the high expression of marker genes, such as Cdx2 and Eomes, closely resembling those of trophoblast stem cells (TSC). Furthermore, TSLC demonstrated the ability to differentiate into mature trophoblast cells in vitro and actively participated in placenta formation in vivo.Abstract Mouse zygotes undergo multiple rounds of cell division, resulting in the formation of preimplantation blastocysts comprising three lineages: trophectoderm (TE), epiblast (EPI), and primitive endoderm (PrE). Cell fate determination plays a crucial role in establishing a healthy pregnancy. The initial separation of lineages gives rise to TE and inner cell mass (ICM), from which trophoblast stem cells (TSC) and embryonic stem cells (ESC) can be derived in vitro. Studying lineage differentiation is greatly facilitated by the clear functional distinction between TSC and ESC. However, transitioning between these two types of cells naturally poses challenges. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibiting LATS kinase promotes the conversion of ICM to TE and also effectively reprograms ESC into stable, self-renewing TS-like cells (TSLC). Compared to TSC, TSLC exhibits similar molecular properties, including the high expression of marker genes such as Cdx2, Eomes, and Tfap2c, as well as hypomethylation of their promoters. Importantly, TSLC not only displays the ability to differentiate into mature trophoblast cells in vitro but also participates in placenta formation in vivo. These findings highlight the efficient reprogramming of ESCs into TSLCs using a small molecular inducer, which provides a new reference for understanding the regulatory network between ESCs and TSCs.

AB  - There is growing evidence showing that adiponectin (APN) can improve Alzheimer's disease(AD)-like pathological changes by improving insulin resistance. However, the role of AdipoRon (an Adiponectin receptor agonist) on synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunction in the early stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect and the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of AdipoRon in T2DM mice. We found that AdipoRon significantly restored the cognitive deficits in T2DM mice, including shorter escape latency, more crossing times, increased distances, and percentage of time in the target quadrant. In addition, AdipoRon treatment up-regulated synaptic proteins (PSD95, SYN, GAP43, and SYP), increased the number of hippocampal synapses and attenuated synaptic damage, including the length, the number and the density of dendritic spines in CA1 and DG regions. Furthermore, AdipoRon attenuated Tau phosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites (p-tau 205, p-tau 396, p-tau 404) by promoting AdipoR expression and activating the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Our data suggests that AdipoRon exerts neuroprotective effects on the T2DM mice, which may be mediated by the activation of the AdipoR/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the effects of moderate overfeeding of different sources of metabolizable energy (ME) and protein (MP) on inflammatory status of sheep in late gestation and short-term growth performance of the offspring. A total of 32 healthy pregnant Zell ewes (2.5 +/- 1 years old, 42.19 +/- 1.65 kg body weight [BW]) were selected 7 weeks before lambing. After receiving a ten-day adaptation diet, eight ewes were randomly allocated to each of the four treatments including: 1) The adaptation diet that fulfills ME and MP requirements, according to the National Research Council's (NRC, 2007) recommen-dations for late pregnant ewes (CON); 2) A diet with 10% higher levels of ME than CON, using corn grain for extra ME (HEC); 3) A diet with 10% higher level of ME compared to CON, using flaxseed for additional ME (HEF); and 4) A diet with a 10% higher level of MP than CON, using a rumen-protected lysin and methionine supplement (RP-Lys & Met) to supply extra MP (PRO). After lambing, ewes continued their dietary treatments until 30 days postpartum; however, the content of ingredients were proportionally increased to meet the recommended levels of energy and protein for lactating ewes (NRC, 2007). Blood samples from the ewes were taken on days-21,-14, and-7 before parturition. Colostrum yield and components were determined, and lamb's BW and milk intake (MI) were measured weekly until 28 days of age. Other growth performance indexes were computed accordingly. Blood samples from the offspring were taken on days 15 and 30 of life. The data was analyzed using SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., 9.4). Compared with the CON, HEF-fed ewes were the only group that had lower levels of oxidative stress and blood inflammatory markers at-7 d before parturition (P < 0.05). Concentrations of aminotransferases in CON-fed ewes were greater than other groups in late gestation (P < 0.05). Offspring of HEF-and PRO-fed ewes had higher birth BW than lambs of the CON-fed group (3.71 and 4.11 vs. 3.01 +/- 0.24, Kg for HEF, PRO, and CON, respectively). Except for week 2, lambs of CON-fed ewes had lower BW gain compared with the other offspring (P < 0.01). Lambs of PRO-fed ewes had greater levels of plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG, days 15 and 30 of life; P < 0.05) and MI (from week 2; P < 0.001) than other groups. In conclusion, regardless of the source, moderate overfeeding of ME/MP was more beneficial for the immune status of late pregnant dams and the offspring's performance than non-overfed ones.

AB  - Cognitive impairment (CI) can seriously affect people's mental and physical health. Yuanzhi San (YZS) is a classic prescription for treating CI, but the mechanisms need further exploration. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of YZS on promoting the learning and memory ability of CI rats induced by D-galactose combined with aluminum chloride. Behavioral experiments had been used to comprehensively evaluate the established CI model. Brain histological morphology and the expressions of calcium ion signaling pathway related factors in serum were used to evaluate the effect of YZS against CI. Lipids in rat serum were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) and chemical pattern recognition methods. Network pharmacology was used to find potential chemical compounds, targets, and related signaling pathways against CI with treatment of YZS. The integrated lipidomics and network pharmacology analysis were conducted by Cytoscape software. The results showed that YZS could alleviate neurodegenerative impairment. It was verified that model rats had longer latency time, shorter exploration paths, lower new objects recognition indexes, and shorter exercise time and distances compared with the normal rats in behavioral experiments, indicating that the model rats were successfully established. Rats of YZS 6.67 had significant differences in retention time (p < 0.05), number of entrances (p < 0.01), new object recognition indexes (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), exercise time (p < 0.05), and content of Ca [2]+, CAM, APP, CREB (p < 0.01), CAMK2 (p < 0.05). Rats of YZS 6.67 had five cell layers in hippocampus histological morphology. Behavioral experiments results showed that YZS had an active effect on CI rats. From lipidomics analysis, 129 lipids were screened out by conditions of VIP > 1 and p < 0.05, and 17 lipid markers were identified from the databases, which were divided mainly into five types. Pathway analysis indicated that linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolisms were potential target pathways closely involved in the mechanism YZS's effects against CI. Network pharmacology focused on 84 chemical compounds, 130 intersection targets, and 10 hub genes of YZS's effects against CI. Six hub genes and four lipid compounds had intrinsic contact with arachidonic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism and linoleate metabolism. The study revealed that YZS could improve animal cognitive behaviors, the expression of factors associated with memory in serum and the histological morphology of hippocampus. Four lipid compounds, three metabolic pathways, and six hub genes of YZS could effectively modulated CI. These results collectively suggest that the main mechanism of YZS in improving CI involves lipid metabolism, which affects biological processes and targets of action in the body.

AB  - External electric fields (E), used for cardiac pacing and defibrillation/cardioversion, induce a spatially variable change in cardio-myocyte transmembrane potential (?V-m) that depends on cell geometry and E orientation. This study investigates E-induced ?V-m in cardiomyocytes from rats at different ages, which show marked size/geometry variation. Using a tridimensional numerical electro-magnetic model recently proposed (NM3D), it was possible: (a) to evaluate the suitability of the simpler, prolate spheroid analytical model (PSAM) to calculate amplitude and location of ?V-m maximum (?V-max) for E= 1 V.cm(-1); and (b) to estimate the ?V-max required for excitation (?V-T) from experimentally determined threshold E values (E-T). Ventricular myocytes were isolated from neonatal, weaning, adult, and aging Wistar rats. NM3D was constructed as the extruded 2D microscopy cell image, while measured minor and major cell dimensions were used for PSAM. Acceptable ?V-m estimates can be obtained with PSAM from paralelepidal cells for small ?. ET, but not ?V-T, was higher for neonate cells. ?V-T was significantly greater in the cell from older animals, which indicate lower responsiveness to E associated with aging, rather than with altered cell geometry/dimensions. ?V-T might be used as a non-invasive indicator of cell excitability as it is little affected by cell geometry/size.

AB  - Following inhalation exposure to organophosphorus nerve agents, symptoms rapidly develop and severe respiratory symptoms, such as bronchorrhea and bronchoconstriction are the leading causes of lethality. Nerve agentinduced lung injury is little investigated and the standard treatment for symptomatic relief targets the enzyme acetylcholinesterase and muscarinic acetylcholine and GABAergic receptors. In the present study, cellular responses in lung tissue during the acute (40 min) and extended phase (24 h) following severe exposure to the nerve agent VX have been investigated using an ex vivo rat precision-cut lung slice model including electrostimulation to induce a cholinergic response. Changes in protein amount, cell viability, together with, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers have been determined in both the lung tissue and incubation medium. During the acute phase, VX caused significantly increased airway contraction and decreased airway relaxation. Five micromolar of VX did not affect the sample protein levels and cell viability in lung tissue. Among seven markers of cellular responses investigated in the lung tissue, increased levels of heme oxygenase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 together with decreased levels of glutathione in the incubation medium were observed in the acute phase following VX-exposure compared to electrostimulation only. No difference in cellular response was observed following VX-exposure for 24 h compared to the air control. In comparison, LPS-exposure resulted in time-dependent changes in all markers of inflammation and oxidative response. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated VX-specific patterns of oxidative responses in the lung, as well as, signs of inflammatory response and remodelling of extracellular matrix. These potential mechanisms of tissue injury should be further investigated for their potential as additional therapeutic targets during the acute phase of intoxication.
