AB  - Restoration of keystone species, such as large herbivores, is crucial in repairing natural process in ecosystems and responding to the global biodiversity loss. These efforts however face many ecological, social and political challenges. In the context of the on-going update of the IUCN European Bison Action Plan this paper examines conservation discourses that are crucial for understanding challenges and opportunities in bison reintroduction and species restoration in general. The European bison was almost exterminated before many organizations' efforts to save it in the 20th century. Although the history of bison has been a conservation success story, currently there is an urgent need for innovative solutions to accommodate its growing population on the densely populated continent. There are numerous points of disagreements among bison conservationists, such as the degree of human intervention, ethical consideration regarding hunting, the uses of various types of knowledge in decision-making, and finding conflict-free spaces for bison in contemporary European landscapes. This study systematically explores the various perspectives of experts from 18 countries regarding the priorities for European bison conservation. To this end, we applied Q-method online survey targeting scientists and wildlife managers. We identified three perspectives on the bison conservation: 'participatory conservation of an iconic species', 'stewardship and control of vulnerable bison', and 'hands-off approach for restoring bison ecology'. The identified discourses show how bison conservation is evolving from traditional conservation narratives based on distinction between intrinsic and instrumental values towards innovative ideas inspired by rewilding narratives. However, the dilemmas of human-bison coexistence remain.

AB  - Insects, when harnessed as part of an agricultural sustainability initiative, can reduce reliance on chemical pesticides and fertilizers. However, their full potential has yet to be realized. Understanding the impact of these factors on insect communities is imperative for agricultural systems. The task gets complicated because of changing weather patterns, which can increase and decrease abiotic variables (e.g., climate), and biotic variables (e.g., food resources). These factors, and their effect on insect diversity, must be understood before insects can be widely used in agricultural operations. This study, conducted in Faisalabad, Pakistan, aims to add to existing knowledge of insect assemblage in an agricultural setting. Insects were collected on a monthly basis over a period of one year using yellow sticky traps, pitfall traps, sweep nets, forceps, and by direct handpicking. A total of 1503 insect specimens were collected, representing 91 species, 74 genera, and 36 families. We assessed variations in abundance, diversity, and species richness over the different months of study. We evaluate the effects of environmental factors on insects' composition using a Principal Component Analysis. In our samples, pest species were the most abundant and they were strongly influenced by temperature. There was a significant negative association of richness with wind speed, and relative humidity for herbivore insects. Overall, insect diversity mostly varied in April and October. The results revealed that relative humidity had a significant effect on the composition of insect assemblages in January, November, and December; whereas temperature had a significant effect on insects examined in May and June. The findings of this research will contribute to the further development of agricultural management systems aimed at reducing pernicious species through biological control elements.

AB  - Tree climbing is an extremely rare behavior among ungulates and has rarely been reported in forest-dwelling ungulates. We collected 15 tree-climbing records of Formosan serows, mainly from social media platforms. They climbed trees to forage throughout the year in many locations in Taiwan. This is the first report of tree-climbing behavior in the Formosan serow, which is typically a forest dweller. Ungulates are terrestrial herbivores, basically adapted to running fast on the ground; tree-climbing behavior has been reported only in seven species, and five of them live in open habitats (Capra hircus, C. aegagrus, C. falconeri, C. cylindricornis, Oreotragus oreotragus). Tree-climbing behavior may also be evolved in ungulates inhabiting dense forests with abundant trees; however, this has rarely been reported in such species (Moschus leucogaster, M. moschiferus), probably due to the difficulty of observing in the wild. The numerous publicly available records in social networks hold potentially valuable information on the atypical behaviors of wild ungulates. Here, we explored the tree-climbing behavior of a forest-dwelling ungulate, the Formosan serow in Taiwan, a subtropical island, by extracting information from online social media platforms. We researched images and videos of Formosan serows through Facebook and YouTube and collected a total of 15 tree-climbing events. In these materials, Formosan serows climbed 10 tree species, including evergreen coniferous and broad-leaved trees, and a variety of parts, ranging in height from 0.6 to 4 m, and from branches of shrubs to trunks of tall trees. Tree-climbing behavior was recorded throughout Taiwan and from lowlands to subalpine zones, suggesting that tree climbing may be a common behavior in this species. Foraging while climbing trees was frequently observed (53.3%), suggesting that the purpose or benefit for climbing is to obtain additional food other than plants growing near the ground surface. In contrast to other tree-climbing ungulates, Formosan serows climbed trees not only in winter, but also in other seasons, when food is relatively abundant. This is the first scientific report of tree-climbing behavior in the Formosan serow that is typically a forest dweller.

AB  - Dietary variation within species has important ecological and evolutionary implications. While theoreticians have debated the consequences of trait variance (including dietary specialization), empirical studies have yet to examine intraspecific dietary variability across the globe and through time. Here, we use new and published serial sampled delta C-13(enamel) values of herbivorous mammals from the Miocene to the present (318 individuals summarized, 4134 samples) to examine how dietary strategy (i.e. browser, mixed-feeder, grazer) affects individual isotopic variation. We find that almost all herbivores, regardless of dietary strategy, are composed of individual specialists. For example, Cormohipparion emsliei (Equidae) from the Pliocene of Florida (approx. 5 Ma) exhibits a delta C-13(enamel) range of 13.4 parts per thousand, but all individuals sampled have delta C-13(enamel) ranges of less than or equal to 2 parts per thousand (mean = 1.1 parts per thousand). Most notably, this pattern holds globally and through time, with almost all herbivorous mammal individuals exhibiting narrow delta C-13(enamel) ranges (less than or equal to 3 parts per thousand), demonstrating that individuals are specialized and less representative of their overall species' dietary breadth. Individual specialization probably reduces intraspecific competition, increases carrying capacities, and may have stabilizing effects on species and communities over time. Individual specialization among species with both narrow and broad dietary niches is common over space and time-a phenomenon not previously well recognized or documented empirically.

AB  - Finding more efficient ways to monitor and estimate the diversity of mammalian communities is a major step towards their management and conservation. Environmental DNA (eDNA) from river water has recently been shown to be a viable method for biomonitoring mammalian communities. Most of the studies to date have focused on the potential for eDNA to detect individual species, with little focus on describing patterns of community diversity and structure. Here, we first focus on the sampling effort required to reliably map the diversity and distribution of semi-aquatic and terrestrial mammals and allow inferences of community structure surrounding two rivers in southeastern England. Community diversity and composition was then assessed based on species richness and beta-diversity, with differences between communities partitioned into nestedness and turnover, and the sampling effort required to rapidly detect semi-aquatic and terrestrial species was evaluated based on species accumulation curves and occupancy modelling. eDNA metabarcoding detected 25 wild mammal species from five orders, representing the vast majority (82%) of the species expected in the area. The required sampling effort varied between orders, with common species (generally rodents, deer and lagomorphs) more readily detected, with carnivores detected less frequently. Measures of species richness differed between rivers (both overall and within each mammalian order) and patterns of beta-diversity revealed the importance of species replacement in sites within each river, against a pattern of species loss between the two rivers. eDNA metabarcoding demonstrated its capability to rapidly detect mammal species, allowing inferences of community composition that will better inform future sampling strategies for this Class. Importantly, this study highlights the potential use of eDNA data for investigating mammalian community dynamics over different spatial scales. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is urgent to explore new ways to protect endangered wild animals and develop sustainable animal husbandry on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau due to its fragile ecological environment. Ruminants, raised in captivity and free-range, have important niches in the Plateau and are the best models to analyze the effects of different feeding modes on their health. In this study, two ruminants, yaks and goats in free-range and captive modes, respectively, were selected to study the relationship between gut microbes and ruminant health. The results showed that the gut microbial diversity of free-range ruminants was higher than those of captive ruminants. Principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that there were significant differences in the gut microbial communities in different breeding modes. Both the captive ruminants enriched the Succinivibrionaceae family, which had a strong potential to synthesize lipopolysaccharide, and the low exercise amount of the captive animals was significantly related to this function. Meanwhile, free-range ruminants enriched Oscillospiraceae, which had the potential to degrade benzoic acid, and this potential had a significant positive correlation with resistance to parasitic infections. We offer other possibilities, such as adding benzoic acid to feed or increasing the exercise time of captive ruminants to make them healthier.

AB  - Phenolic compounds are key to plant defence, offering protection as antioxidants, UV shields, and antimicrobials. Their production is largely shaped by environmental conditions. It is believed that plants at lower elevations increase phenolic content to counter herbivory, while those at higher elevations rely on phenolics to manage abiotic stresses, such as climate variability. Microhabitat warming also affects phenolic levels, but responses differ, depending on broader climatic contexts: plants in warmer, lower-elevation environments show limited adaptability, whereas high-elevation plants demonstrate greater plasticity. Despite the importance of these environmental interactions, many small-scale abiotic studies lack sufficient spatial replication across broader gradients like elevation or latitude, while large-scale studies frequently overlook microscale factors. This study investigated the effects of macroclimate factors and microhabitat warming on phenolic production in Nardus stricta across five semi-natural grassland sites (1546-1875 m a.s.l.) in Portugal's Serra da Estrela. Warming was simulated using open-top chambers over two growing seasons, after which leaf samples were analysed for phenolic compounds, and soil nutrients were measured. The N. stricta plants at the highest elevation site contained significantly higher leaf flavonoid concentrations. Microhabitat warming led to a significant decrease in flavonoid concentrations, but only at the highest elevation site. These effects occurred independently of soil nutrient levels, suggesting direct thermal effects or stress responses might be involved. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between macro- and microenvironmental factors in shaping plant chemistry, underscoring critical considerations for plant resilience in the face of climate change. This understanding is essential for developing strategies to support plant and ecosystem adaptation to changing climates.

AB  - Simple Summary Studies have shown that providing concentrate and bypass fat as feed supplements resulted in better performance of large ruminants. However, there is limited information about the effects of these supplements on the performance of buffaloes. This study evaluates the effects of concentrate and bypass fat supplementations on the growth performance, blood metabolites, and feeding cost of Murrah cross and Swamp buffaloes. Following diet supplementation, the feed intake, body weight, and body condition score were significantly improved without any side effects on the blood metabolites of both buffalo breeds. Although the mixture of concentrate and bypass fat supplement (26:4) used in this study was found to increase the cost of feed, overall, it resulted in a greater return. This study investigates the effects of supplementation of the basal diet with concentrate and rumen bypass fat on the dry matter intake (DMI), growth performance, blood metabolites and hormonal changes, and the feeding cost of feedlot water buffaloes. Thirty-six healthy, three- to four-month-old male Murrah crossbred (n = 18) and Swamp (n = 18) buffaloes with a similar average initial body weight of 98.64 +/- 1.93 kg were each randomly allocated into three dietary experimental groups. Buffaloes were fed with Diet A, which consisted of 100% Brachiaria decumbens, Diet B, consisting of 70% Brachiaria decumbens and 30% concentrate, and Diet C, consisting of 70% Brachiaria decumbens, 26% concentrate, and 4% rumen bypass fat for a period of 730 days. Feed intake was measured daily, while blood samples were collected for every eight months. Furthermore, body scores were noted prior to and at the end of the experimental period. The results showed that the average daily gain for buffaloes fed with Diet C was the highest. The DMI, BCS, FI, and FCR for the three groups showed significant (p < 0.05) differences, in the following order: Diet C > Diet B > Diet A. At the end of the two-year feeding trial, buffaloes fed with Diet B had significantly (p < 0.05) higher cholesterol levels than Diet A and Diet C. In addition, buffaloes fed with Diet C had significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of serum total protein, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-I hormone compared to Diet A and Diet B. On the other hand, buffaloes fed with Diet B and Diet C showed significant (p < 0.05) decrease in glucose levels. Supplemented diet improved the buffalos' weight gain to achieve the market weight in a shorter period of time, thus, giving farmers a greater return. In conclusion, concentrate and bypass fat supplementations in the diet of water buffaloes improved the growth performance without adverse effect on the blood metabolites, which enabled better farmer profitability.

AB  - This study assessed the effect of heat stress mitigations on the physiological, behavioural, and hormonal responses of buffalo during the hot summer season. Twenty Murrah buffalo male calves were distributed randomly into controlled (C, n= 10) and treatment groups (T, n= 10). The buffalo calves in the C group were housed in the existing shed (10-12-ft height and 10-ft width). Buffalo calves of the T group were allocated in the modified shed: 15-ft height and 20-ft width along with time-controlled pressure mist with fans and rubber mats on the floor. Fans were running all days. The cool water was misted on calves at the rate of 1 min in 5 min, from 11:00 to 18:00 h. The water misting system was installed below the roof, but at 3.5 m above the floor. The calves' body weight, rectal temperature, infrared temperature of the eye, blood samples, respiration rate, and pulse rate were recorded fortnightly for two consecutive months. In one-way ANOVA, rectal temperature, eye temperature, cortisol level, and afternoon's respiration and pulse rate were higher in the calves of C group than that of T group (P < 0.05). Conversely, eating and resting time (min/day) and triiodothyronine were lower in the calves of C group than that of T group (P < 0.05). Therefore, an increase in shed's height and width, using rubber mats on the floor, and cool water misting to buffaloes during the hot summer seasons positively influence their physiological, hormonal, and behavioural responses.

AB  - Managed forests are a significant contributor to Canada's economic wealth. However, forestry activities increase landscape fragmentation and impact wildlife species, such as Canada's woodland caribou, that depend on large areas of undisturbed habitat. Proposed conservation policies for caribou in Canada aim to retain 65% or more of caribou ranges as undisturbed landscapes, which would help achieve a 60% likelihood of self-sufficiency of caribou populations. This level of habitat protection may require moving some forest areas out of industrial forestry use and into habitat protection. We have assessed the extent to which this level of range protection would affect timber supply to forest mills in Canada at present-day harvest levels. For the six largest Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec), we solved an optimization problem that allocated harvest sites across the industrial forestry zone to forest mills at present-day harvest levels with and without caribou conservation and under present and future climate conditions. Retaining 65% of each caribou range area under protection generated moderate timber supply reductions in Quebec and Alberta, with smaller reductions in British Columbia. Sensitivity analyses revealed modest timber supply shortages in Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba at range retention levels as high as 75%-80%. The estimated timber supply shortages from implementing caribou conservation measures were similar to, or smaller than, those resulting from climate change.

AB  - Insect herbivore pests have been identified as a significant threat to the health and survival of urban trees. In the future, these pest-tree interactions in urban areas may be altered by the increased variability in environmental conditions projected under climate change. However, our understanding of how this may occur is limited. In this short communication, we discuss the factors that increase urban forest vulnerability to insect pests and how climate change will alter these factors. We then discuss how we can help to reduce the negative effects of these factors through actions such as diversifying our urban forests, reducing plant stress and increasing our capacity for early detection of insect pests using emerging biosurveillance technologies. In a time with increasing globalisation aiding in the transport of pests between urban areas, it is important that we remain vigilant to the everincreasing threats that can compromise our urban green assets and the benefits they provide.

AB  - PremiseUnderstanding relationships among grass traits, fire, and herbivores may help improve conservation strategies for savannas that are threatened by novel disturbance regimes. Emerging theory, developed in Africa, emphasizes that functional traits of savanna grasses reflect the distinct ways that fire and grazers consume biomass. Specifically, functional trade-offs related to flammability and palatability predict that highly flammable grass species will be unpalatable, while highly palatable species will impede fire. MethodsWe quantified six culm and leaf traits of 337 native grasses of Texas-a historical savanna region that has been transformed by fire exclusion, megafaunal extinctions, and domestic livestock. ResultsMultivariate analyses of traits revealed three functional strategies. "Grazer grasses" (N = 50) had culms that were short, narrow, and horizontal, and leaves with high width to length (W:L) and low C to N ratios (C:N)-trait values that attract grazers and avoid fire. "Fire grasses" (N = 104) had culms that were tall, thick, and upright, and leaves that were thick, with low W:L, and high C:N-trait values that promote fire and discourage grazers. "Generalist tolerators" and "generalist avoiders" (N = 183) had trait values that were intermediate to the other groups. ConclusionsOur findings confirm that the flammability-palatability trade-offs that operate in Africa also explain correlated suites of traits in Texas grasses and highlights that the grass flora of Texas bears the signature of Pleistocene megafauna and the influence of fires that predate human arrival. We suggest that grass functional classifications based on fire and grazer traits can improve prescribed fire and livestock management of savannas of Texas and globally.

AB  - Fencing wildlife populations can aid wildlife management goals, but potential benefits may not always outweigh costs of confinement. Population isolation can erode genetic diversity and lead to the accumulation of inbreeding, reducing viability and limiting adaptive potential. We used microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data collected from 640 white-tailed deer confined within a 1184 ha fence to quantify changes in genetic diversity and inbreeding over the first 12 years of confinement. Genetic diversity was sustained over the course of the study, remaining comparable to unconfined white-tailed deer populations. Uneroded genetic diversity suggests that genetic drift is mitigated by a low level of gene flow, which supports field observations that the fence is not completely impermeable. In year 9 of the study, we observed an unexpected influx of mtDNA diversity and drop in inbreeding as measured by F-IS. A male harvest restriction imposed that year increased male survival, and more diverse mating may have contributed to the inbreeding reduction and temporary genetic diversity boost we observed. These data add to our understanding of the long-term impacts of fences on wildlife, but also highlight the importance of continued monitoring of confined populations.

AB  - Plasticity in plant traits, including secondary metabolites, is critical to plant survival and competitiveness under stressful conditions. The ability of a plant to respond effectively to combined stressors can be impacted by crosstalk in biochemical pathways, resource availability and evolutionary history, but such responses remain underexplored. In particular, we know little about intraspecific variation in response to combined stressors or whether such variation is associated with the stress history of a given population.Here, we investigated the consequences of combined water and herbivory stress for plant traits, including relative growth rate, leaf morphology and various measures of phytochemistry, using a common garden of Asclepias fascicularis milkweeds. To examine how plant trait means and plasticities depend on the history of environmental stress, seeds for the experiment were collected from across a gradient of aridity in the Great Basin, United States. We then conducted a factorial experiment crossing water limitation with herbivory.Plants responded to water limitation alone by increasing the evenness of UV-absorbent secondary metabolites and to herbivory alone by increasing the richness of metabolites. However, plants that experienced combined water and herbivory stress exhibited similar phytochemical diversity to well-watered control plants. This lack of plasticity in phytochemical diversity in plants experiencing combined stressors was associated with a reduction in relative growth rates.Leaf chemistry means and plasticities exhibited clinal variation corresponding to seed source water deficits. The total concentration of UV-absorbent metabolites decreased with increasing water availability among seed sources, driven by higher concentrations of flavonol glycosides, which are hypothesized to act as antioxidants, among plants from drier sites. Plants sourced from drier sites exhibited higher plasticity in flavonol glycoside concentrations in response to water limitation, which increased phytochemical evenness, but simultaneous herbivory dampened plant responses to water limitation irrespective of seed source.Synthesis. These results suggest that climatic history can affect intraspecific phytochemical plasticity, which may confer tolerance to water limitation, but that co-occurring herbivory disrupts such patterns. Global change is increasing the frequency and intensity of stress combinations, such that understanding intraspecific responses to combined stressors is critical for predicting the persistence of plant populations.

AB  - In the North Central USA, intersowing cover crops into standing maize (Zea mays L.) is required to establish plants large enough to afford the benefits of a cover since there is limited favorable weather for cover crop growth after maize harvest. The objective of this study was to quantify the impacts of the planting method and time of planting of three cover crop species when grown with or without maize competition on their establishment. Experiments were conducted in three environments during 2018 and 2019. Experiments consisted of a factorial combination of timing of cover crop planting (V7 and R4 growth stage of maize), cover crop species (camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz), rye (Secale cereale L.), or radish (Raphanus sativus L.), method of sowing (drilled or broadcast), and maize removal. Initial cover crop populations were similar regardless of maize removal or stage of maize when sown, but intersown cover crops produced only 3% of the fall biomass, compared with treatments with maize-removed when sown at the V7 stage of maize and 14% when sown at the R4 stage. Limited light intensity (less than 20%) under the maize canopy was the main factor affecting interseeded cover crop development. Radish was more sensitive to shading than the other cover crops. Camelina and rye sown at the R4 stage of corn produced similar spring biomass as earlier-sown cover crops. Intersown cover crops had no negative effect on maize grain yield.

AB  - Understanding patterns of home range size and selection are critical to protect vulnerable wild populations, particularly in semi-arid regions with increasing land use pressures. Using movement data from 64 GPS-collared southern mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus fulinginatus), monitored over two years in San Diego County, we assessed patterns and drivers of home range following a two-step approach. First, we implemented seasonal home range selection functions to examine variation in selection and avoidance of environmental factors. We then used these results to evaluate the relative impact of environmental factors in combination with intrinsic factors on home range size. We found that deer use of high-quality forage and water sources varied seasonally. These variations in resource use, along with sex and age, played a role in determining home range size of the southern mule deer. Home range size was larger for male deer, and smaller among older females. Home ranges for both sexes were smaller when forage quality increased and larger with greater variability in water proximity. The limited resources of semi-arid environments, like water and forage, affect southern mule deer populations and highlight the importance of evaluating combined intrinsic and extrinsic factors of home range size and composition to inform management practices.

AB  - Roads can negatively impact the wildlife communities they transect. Road mortalities from wildlife-vehicle collisions are one direct effect, but roads may also indirectly affect wildlife behavior, movement, or local distribution. Quantifying the spatial extent of these road-effects is important for understanding how roads indirectly affect species of concern, identifying potential sources of disturbance, and for estimating the effectiveness of road mitigation structures. Farm-to-Market Road (FM)106, which transects part of the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge in Cameron County, Texas, has been identified as a potential source of wildlife road mortalities, particularly for one of the two remaining breeding populations of ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) in the United States. Wildlife crossing structures (WCS) have been constructed on FM106 to mitigate these losses, however, the indirect effects of FM106 on wildlife have not yet been investigated. This study used camera trap arrays to quantify activity surrounding FM106 for four mammal species. Within each species, activity patterns were compared at roadside versus habitat reference sites to identify if proximity to the road significantly impacted the temporal distribution of target species throughout a typical day-night cycle. Temporal road avoidance, quantified as shifts towards more nocturnal activity at roadside sites, was seen for bobcat (Lynx rufus; p=0.04), coyote (Canis latrans; p=0.01), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; p<0.001), but not for striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Spatial distribution was also quantified for each of these species by modeling detection data at varying distances to FM106 while also considering the influence of vegetation and other landscape factors. Bobcats and coyotes displayed a limited degree of attractance to the roadside whereas white-tailed deer and skunks seemed unaffected by proximity to the road. These results indicate that while there may be advantages to accessing roadside sites (e.g., scavenging, hunting, or travel opportunities), certain species tend to modify their daily movement behavior to selectively use these areas at times when vehicular traffic is at its lowest.

AB  - As a contribution to improving management of the Japanese wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax), which has recently expanded its range and is having some negative effects on the ecosystem, we conducted a landscape genetic study using individual-based genetic analysis and multiple landscape elements to elucidate its dispersal patterns in the early stage of its expansion. Microsatellite DNA analysis of Japanese wild boars in the Hokuriku region of Japan revealed the existence of two ancestral genetic clusters, that they had migrated via different pathways, and that they were inadequately admixed. We also inferred the most suitable habitats for Japanese wild boar using MaxEnt and concluded that lower elevation and snowfall may favor the occurrence of wild boar individuals. Landscape genetic analysis indicated regional differences in Japanese wild boar dispersal patterns, according to the spatial heterogeneity of genetic features and landscape elements. On the western side of the study area, where individuals with a high frequency of one of two ancestral clusters were more abundant, significant effects of isolation by distance and resistance due to the above two landscape factors were detected, suggesting unidirectional dispersion influenced by the alpine landscape. In contrast, on the eastern side, there was indication of resistance to dispersal of individuals predominantly possessing another ancestral cluster, suggesting the influence of irregularly arranged suitable habitats due to the complexity of the mountainous terrain. Based on our findings, we conclude that Japanese wild boar dispersal patterns may be influenced by landscape elements, such as alpine mountains.

AB  - African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are megaherbivores of the African savannas requiring extensive ranges that can provide critical resources for their survival and reproduction at different spatiotemporal scales. We studied seasonal differences in home range sizes and daily distance to the nearest surface water sources by five male and 10 female African elephants in the eastern Okavango Panhandle in northern Botswana between 2014 and 2017. We hypothesized that (i) elephant home ranges would be larger in the wet than in the dry season (because critical resources tend to be less localized in the wet than in the dry season), (ii) the daily distance of the elephants to the nearest ephemeral surface water sources would be larger in the dry than in the wet season because many of the ephemeral water sources would be dry in the dry season and elephants would start moving towards permanent water sources such as rivers, and lastly (iii) that the differences in elephant home ranges and daily distance to water would differ between sexes. Our results showed that elephant home ranges were larger in the wet than in the dry season, and that they differed between sexes with female elephants having smaller home ranges in the late wet season. The mean daily distance to the nearest ephemeral surface water sources was larger in the dry than in the wet season. There was an inverse relationship between elephants' daily distance to permanent surface water and to ephemeral water sources. The findings indicate the need for large conservation areas and functional connectivity between landscapes to enable the highly mobile savanna elephants to access critical seasonal resources such as water and forage in semi-arid savannas. Such landscapes are critical, especially in the face of climate change, when high air temperatures and droughts may exacerbate forage and water shortage and intensify human-elephant interactions in surrounding agroecosystems.

AB  - The Arabian sand gazelle (Gazella marica) is a native and highly adaptable species of the Arabian Peninsula. Due to drastic population declines, the species is listed as globally vulnerable. Very little is known about the behavioral ecology of this species in captivity; therefore, this study was designed to investigate the seasonal variations in the activity patterns of Arabian sand gazelles at Al Reem Biosphere Reserve, Qatar. Data were collected in two phases, i.e., summer (September-October 2021) and winter (December 2021-January 2022), for a total of 16 days. Results revealed that feeding and walking (p = 0.001) were the dominant activities in both seasons, yet these were higher in summer compared to winter. Likewise, standing, lying down and other activities (social interactions, defecating, maintenance, sexual behaviors) were also higher in summer compared to winter. All these findings suggest that Arabian sand gazelles are adaptable to harsh environments. However, we strongly recommend a year-round investigation on the impacts of humans, feed types and Arabian Oryx on the behavioral activities of Arabian sand gazelles. In addition, we suggest studying the behavior ecology of the wild scattered populations of Arabian sand gazelles for better management of captive breeding stocks.

AB  - Sheep and goats are among other herbivorous animals that serve as intermediate hosts (containing the larval stage Cysticercus tenuicollis) of Taenia hydatigena tapeworm. This infection can lead to serious complications or cause death. The genetic diversity and epidemiological significance of cysticercosis due to T. hydatigena is poorly understood. We examined 11,651 goats and 23,542 sheep slaughtered at the municipal abattoir in Makkah, for C. tenuicollis infection. The resulted DNA sequences were compared with previously available sequences from different hosts. Phylogenetic analysis and Pairwise nucleotide variations of cox1 gene were performed. Sheep and goats revealed infection rates of (4.95%) and (4.75%) respectively. DNA sequence analysis of all isolates from both sheep and goats showed that the total haplotypes number was 7. T. hydatigena population with high haplotypes diversity values. The nucleotide diversity was low, while Tajima's D and Fu's tests were negative (with no statistical significance). The present work will give valuable information regarding the prevalence and implementation of control and prevention measures of C. tenuicollis. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Invasive species often exhibit disproportionately strong negative effects in their introduced range compared to their native range, and much research has been devoted to understanding the role of shared evolutionary history, or lack thereof, in driving these differences. Less studied is whether introduced species, particularly those that are important as facilitators in their native range, have persistent positive effects in their invaded range despite a lack of a shared evolutionary history with the invaded community. Here, we manipulated the density of a habitat-forming facilitator, the high intertidal acorn barnacle Balanus glandula, factorially with herbivore density in its native range (Bluestone Point, British Columbia, Canada) and invaded range (Punta Ameghino, Chubut Province, Argentina) to determine how this facilitator differentially affects associated species at these two locations. Given that high intertidal species at Punta Ameghino (PA) are evolutionarily naive to barnacles, we predicted that the positive effects of B. glandula at PA would be absent or weak compared to those at Bluestone Point (BP). However, we found that B. glandula had an equally positive effect on herbivore biomass at PA compared to BP, possibly because the moisture-retaining properties of barnacle bed habitats are particularly important in seasonally dry Patagonia. Barnacle presence indirectly decreased ephemeral algal cover at BP by increasing grazer pressure, but barnacles instead facilitated ephemeral algae at PA. In contrast, B. glandula increased perennial algal cover at BP, but generally decreased perennial algal cover at PA, likely due to differences in dominant algal morphology. Though our experiment was limited to one location on each continent, our results suggest that shared evolutionary history may not be a prerequisite for strong facilitation to occur, but rather that the nature and strength of novel species interactions are determined by the traits of associated species and the environment in which they occur.

AB  - Ecologists have long debated the relative importance of biotic interactions versus species-specific habitat preferences in shaping patterns of ecological dominance. In western North America, cycles of fire disturbance are marked by transitions between North American deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus), which predominate after wildfires, and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi), which gradually replace deermice 3-4 years postfire and maintain dominance as forests mature. While this shift has been frequently documented, the processes that mediate this turnover are debated. One possibility is competitive release, which predicts a reduction in vole competition may contribute to niche expansion and population growth in deermice. Alternatively, turnover in both species may be shaped by differences in their preferred habitat and resource base, as predicted by optimum foraging theory. We evaluate these hypotheses using stable isotopes and spatial mark-recapture of deermouse and vole populations sampled prior to and following a fire as part of a longitudinal study in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Fire disturbance was associated with a 94% decrease in vole abundance but a 102% increase in deermice. Even after accounting for microhabitat, vole and deermouse populations were negatively correlated spatially and temporally (R = -0.45), and competitor abundance was more important prefire than postfire. When vole abundance was high (prefire), vole dietary niche space was seven times broader than that of deermice. Postfire, deermouse dietary niche nearly tripled and was enriched in C-13 (i.e., more C-4 plants), while voles occupied a slightly reduced dietary niche (79% of prefire breadth). Our results suggest deermice are experiencing ecological release due to a reduction in vole competition but vole shifts are largely driven by habitat preferences.

AB  - Research on use of foraging patches has focused on why herbivores visit or quit patches, yet little is known about visits to patches over time. Food quality, as reflected by higher nutritional quality and lower plant defenses, and physical patch characteristics, which offer protection from predators and weather, affect patch use and hence should influence their revisitation. Due to the potentially high costs of moving between patches, fragmented habitats are predicted to complicate foraging decisions of many animals. We aimed to determine how food quality, shelter availability and habitat fragmentation influence tree reuse by a specialist folivore, the koala, in a fragmented agricultural landscape. We GPS-tracked 23 koalas in northern New South Wales, Australia and collated number of revisits, average residence time, and average time-to-return to each tree. We measured tree characteristics including food quality (foliar nitrogen and toxic formylated phloroglucinol compounds, FPCs concentrations), tree size, and tree connectedness. We also modeled the costs of locomotion between trees. Koalas re-visited isolated trees with high leaf nitrogen disproportionately often. They spent longer time in trees with high leaf nitrogen, and in large trees used for shelter. They took longer to return to trees with low leaf nitrogen. Tree connectivity reduced travel costs between patches, being either individual or groups of trees. FPC levels had no detectable effect on patch revisitation. We conclude that food quality and shelter drive koala tree re-visits. Scattered, isolated trees with nutrient-rich leaves are valuable resource patches for koalas despite movement costs to reach them.
   We GPS-tracked Australia's iconic koalas within a fragmented agricultural landscape to determine why they would return to the same trees or groups of trees. We found that they selected trees with high nitrogen, and larger trees that provided shelter from the heat. This often involved moving large distances across a hostile cleared landscape. Hence, scattered trees on farms, especially when the trees are of high quality, are essential for arboreal animals.

AB  - Fencing is a major anthropogenic feature affecting wildlife distributions and movements, but its impacts are difficult to quantify due to a widespread lack of spatial data. We created a fence model and compared outputs to a fence mapping approach using satellite imagery in two counties in southwest Montana, USA to advance fence data development for use in research and management. The model incorporated road, land cover, ownership, and grazing boundary spatial layers to predict fence locations. We validated the model using data collected on randomized road transects (n = 330). The model predicted similar to 34,700 km of fences with a mean fence density of 0.93 km/km(2) and a maximum density of 14.9 km/km(2). We also digitized fences using Google Earth Pro in a random subset of our study area in survey townships (n = 50). The Google Earth approach showed greater agreement (K = 0.76) with known samples than the fence model (K = 0.56) yet was unable to map fences in forests and was significantly more time intensive. We also compared fence attributes by land ownership and land cover variables to assess factors that may influence fence specifications (e.g., wire heights) and types (e.g., number of barbed wires). Private land fences had bottom wires that were closer to the ground and top wires higher from the ground when compared to fences on public lands, with sample means at similar to 22 cm and similar to 26 cm, and similar to 115 cm and similar to 111 cm, respectively. Both bottom wire means were well below recommended heights for ungulates navigating underneath fencing (>= 46 cm), while top wire means were closer to the 107 cm maximum fence height recommendation. We found that both fence type and land ownership were correlated (chi(2) = 45.52, df = 5, p = 0.001) as well as fence type and land cover type (chi(2) = 140.73, df = 15, p = 0.001). We provide tools for estimating fence locations, and our novel fence type assessment demonstrates an opportunity for updated policy to encourage the adoption of "wildlife-friendlier" fencing standards to facilitate wildlife movement in the western U.S. while supporting rural livelihoods.

AB  - Although rarely experimentally tested, biotic interactions have long been hypothesised to limit low-elevation range boundaries of species. We tested the effects of herbivory on three alpine-restricted plant species by transplanting plants below (novel), at the edge (limit), or in the centre (core) of their current elevational range and factorially fencing-out above- and belowground mammals. Herbivore damage was greater in range limit and novel habitats than in range cores. Exclosures increased plant biomass and reproduction more in novel habitats than in range cores, suggesting demographic costs of novel interactions with herbivores. We then used demographic models to project population growth rates, which increased 5-20% more under herbivore exclosure at range limit and novel sites than in core habitats. Our results identify mammalian herbivores as key drivers of the low-elevation range limits of alpine plants and indicate that upward encroachment of herbivores could trigger local extinctions by depressing plant population growth.

AB  - Unlike most feral domestic animals, ranging behavior, diet dependence, and human socialization have been used as criteria to define feral dogs. These criteria can obstruct wildlife conservation if decisions depend on identifying ferality in dogs. We argue that diet dependence and human socialization are unnecessary to define ferality in situations where dogs constitute a threat to wildlife. Human-dependent diet and sociability are not exclusive to house dogs; thus, they do not differentiate ferality with certainty, and they have no established testing methods or thresholds. Most notably, they obstruct management by complicating feral dog identification. As a case study, legislation in Chile surrounding dog management does not recognize the existence of feral dogs and bans the application of lethal methods on dogs. This impairs conservation because the current definition makes it impossible to distinguish if a dog is feral at first sight. This is a problem in the small-scale livestock industry, where goat and sheep losses are mainly caused by dogs. Stakeholders could kill attacking dogs to defend their livestock, risking a lawsuit if those dogs were owned, or continue to lose their livelihood. Neither option benefits livestock owners. To not hinder conservation, we propose feral dogs be defined based only on ownership status, ranging behavior, and location in the context of management, and offer a classification based on these criteria. However, we contend that whether a dog is feral is not important for decision-making. Instead, dogs should be controlled if they are found on any public space unaccompanied by humans.

AB  - Species potential habitat modeling and quality assessment are useful tools for effective conservation of endangered animals. Species distributions are influenced by environmental variables such as topography, climate, and anthropogenic disturbance. In recent years, global environmental changes have led to shrinking ranges for a variety of species. This study synthesizes records of the historical distribution of 3 musk deer species (Moschus berezovskii, M. chrysogaster, and M. moschiferus) from the 1970s to the 2010s, utilizing multiple data sources to reconstruct suitable distribution areas with BIOMOD2. We analyzed historical changes in distribution and used FRAGSTATS to explore the relationship between habitat fragmentation and the contraction of suitable habitats. The results show that suitable habitats for these species have decreased significantly over the past 50 yr (contraction rates: M. berezovskii 33.5%; M. moschiferus 48.9%; M. chrysogaster 59.1%). Among the environmental variables, climatic td (continentality) and dd<18 (degree-days below 18 degrees C, heating degree-days) were the main factors responsible for the contraction of musk deer distribution. Results show significant differences in patch characteristics between contraction and non-contraction areas for M. berezovskii and M. moschiferus, suggesting that habitat fragmentation is another important cause of the reduced distribution. In order to better protect and manage the musk deer species, we recommend increasing connectivity between existing suitable habitats and enhancing the conservation of their potential habitats.

AB  - Introduction Pencil pine (Athrotaxis cupressoides) is an iconic, paleoendemic tree restricted to historic fire refugia in Tasmania's western mountains. Anthropogenic climate change is increasingly exposing these areas to wildfire. Given that pencil pines have little capacity to recover from fire, and show scarce natural recruitment across their core range, they will be lost from many areas without interventions to restore population viability to burnt stands.Methods We conducted a large-scale field study targeting pencil pine stands burnt in recent (2016) and historic (1960) fires. Using small (0.5 m2) experimental plots distributed across a range of topography and vegetation, we trialled three interventions: i) protecting groups of naturally germinated seedlings from herbivores in situ (35 plots); ii) introducing seeds via multiple sowing methods (300 plots); and iii) transplanting tube stock propagated from seed or cutting material, with and without herbivore protection (1007 plots).Results We found that protecting natural germinants from herbivores did not prevent seedling mortality over 2.5 years, and sowing interventions largely failed. Most transplants exposed to herbivores failed to establish after 1.5 years, but establishment rates were high with herbivore exclusion, indicating strong predation by native macropod herbivores. Transplant establishment also varied with fine-scale topography, with the best outcomes in well-drained and Sphagnum dominated positions, and the worst outcomes in poorly-drained positions, suggesting young pencil pines are sensitive to waterlogging. Transplant establishment rates varied little between recently and historically burnt sites, and were insensitive to how plants were propagated.Discussion In summary, transplanting tube stock with herbivore protection is a promising method for restoring burnt pencil pine stands, and establishment rates can be improved by selecting favourable planting positions at fine scales. Our findings suggest pencil pine stands burnt decades previously are suitable for restoration. Managers seeking to conserve pencil pines may begin restoring both historically and recently burnt stands, alongside protecting unburned stands from fire. Interventions should be refined through adaptive management, including re-surveys of this long-term trial.

AB  - An ecological study to evaluate necrophagous species richness, abundance, and diversity was conducted in four contrasting ecoregions of Los Angeles County, California, United States: a highly anthropized area, two moderately populated areas, and a sparsely populated area. Our hypothesis states that there will be higher abundance of exotic species in greatly anthropized ecoregions and higher diversity of native calliphorid flies in sparsely populated sites. A total of 2,883 blow flies belonging to 12 species were captured from the four ecoregions. The exotic Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) was the most abundant species, representing 72.84% of all Calliphoridae collected. The highest abundance was in the highly anthropized ecoregion. Differences of the blow fly assemblages across environmentally and anthropically different ecoregions were found, and that the relative abundance of the exotic species increased with anthropization. Our results suggest that both anthropization and elevation alter the structure of blow fly assemblages, modifying the abundance and species richness of Calliphoridae. The results of this study support the hypothesis of biotic homogenization, since we found a higher proportional abundance of exotic species and lower diversity of native blow flies in ecoregions heavily modified by human action. Additionally, the hypothesis of intermediate disturbance was supported as the highest diversity was found in the ecoregion with moderate anthropization mixed with natural elements. This is the first study to conduct an intensive survey of the Calliphoridae assemblages in Los Angeles County, which can be potentially used as a tool in human and veterinary health and forensic sciences.

AB  - ContextThe relationship between slope and terrestrial animal locomotion is key to landscape ecology but underexplored across species. This is partly due to a lack of scalable methodology that applies to a diversity of wildlife.ObjectivesThis study investigates the slope-speed relationship for two species, Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), through the combined application of remote sensing, GPS tracking, behavior models, and parametric distribution. While using readily available Digital Elevation Models (DEM) for pronghorn, we explore the use of very high-resolution lidar Digital Terrain Models (DTM) from Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS) to characterize tortoise movements at micro-scales.MethodsAfter classifying animal behavior with GPS tracking data and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), we analyzed the relationship between the speed of the animals and the slope of the terrain using a 30-m DEM for pronghorn, and a fine-scale UAS DTM for Texas tortoise, and three nonlinear models: Laplace, Gauss, and Lorentz.ResultsHigh-resolution DTM, coupled with GPS tracking, accurately models the relationship of speed and slope at a micro-scale, while a DEM is suitable for a larger scale. Laplace models best predicted the speed of both the Texas tortoise and pronghorn. Models showed tortoises, which are not known for rapid and agile movement like the pronghorn, have a broader tolerance for varying slopes at a fine scale.ConclusionsThese findings enhance understanding of species-specific movement offering valuable insights for habitat management and conservation tailored to species' behaviors and capabilities.

AB  - Despite being structurally limited due to their latitudinal distribution and local climatic conditions, mangroves of the southwest Gulf of California present productivity and carbon storage rates similar or higher than that of tropical mangroves. Despite the importance of their contribution to marine and atmospheric dynamics, few studies exist focused on food web structures in such ecosystems. In order to analyze trophic structure and dy-namics of a mangrove system in the Gulf of California, the isotopic composition, trophic position, isotopic niche, and trophic pathways were studied using the statistical packages TrophicPosition (TP), SIBER, and Simmr. Isotopic values of C and N were obtained for 244 samples of carbon sources and invertebrate consumers which were classified into six trophic guilds. The delta 13C values of carbon sources varied from-30.7 (Rhizophora mangle) to -15.6%0 (Caulerpa sertularioides) and for consumers varied from -22.3%0 (Aratus sp) to-13.2 (Callinectes arcuatus). Herbivores generally had depleted 13C values related to those of the other trophic guilds. The mac-roinvertebrate communities' mean TP values (2.6: 2.0-3.5) indicate a composition of primary and secondary consumers, exhibiting a clear separation between trophic guilds. Isotopic niche width (TA) of the community (14.1) suggests niche segregation, specially between herbivores and deposit feeders. Those trophic guilds are the first consumers and intermediaries for two distinct trophic pathways, one derived from detritus and mangroves and the other from microphytobenthos (MPB). Three groups of primary sources were identified contributing >70% of carbon, representing the primary base of several trophic pathways that sustain different consumer guilds: (1) mangrove-detritus, herbivorous crabs, (2) MPB-Sedimentary organic carbon, supporting mainly de-posit feeders and filter feeders, and (3) Seston-MPB, supporting mainly omnivorous shrimp. Overall, the iden-tified pathways potentially sustain fish communities, which due to their movement export energy from mangroves to coastal food webs.

AB  - Wildlife activity patterns, which reveal the daily allocation of time and energy, are crucial for understanding survival pressures, adaptive strategies, and behavioral characteristics in different environments. Among ungulates, grouping behavior is a prevalent adaptive trait that reflects the population structure, mating systems, and life history strategies formed over long-term evolutionary processes. This study aimed to elucidate the daily activity patterns and grouping characteristics of the rare goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) in the Helan Mountains of western China from 2022 to 2023 using camera trap monitoring. With a total of 3869 camera days of effective trapping, we recorded 442 independent detections of goitered gazelles. The results revealed the following: (1) Goitered gazelle is primarily active during the day, showing an activity pattern similar to crepuscular animals, with two activity peaks occurring after dawn and before dusk. (2) Daily activity patterns showed both seasonal and sex differences. In the warm season, morning activity peaks occurred earlier, and afternoon peaks occurred later compared to the cold season. The overlap in daily activity patterns between females and males in the warm season was lower than that in the cold season, and this trend persisted throughout the year. (3) The number of times different types of groups were observed varied significantly, with single males and single females accounting for a larger proportion of all observed groups. There was no significant difference in group size across seasons, with groups typically consisting of 1-2 individuals. Our study provides detailed insights into the temporal ecology and population structure of goitered gazelles in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. This information will guide the identification of future conservation priorities and the development of management plans for the reserve.

AB  - Context In the vicinity of the western Rajaji Tiger Reserve, a significant rise in conflicts between humans and leopards has occurred. These conflicts have resulted in a substantial number of human deaths, with 60% attacks resulting in deaths over a 4-year period. Aims. This study aims to examine any potential connection among the non-breeding tigers, leopards, prey, humans and the increased occurrence of conflicts. Methods. To address this objective, we conducted an analysis to evaluate the density of leopards, as well as their spatial and temporal behaviour with respect to tigers, prey and humans through on-site habitat use, circular statistics, diel-overlap as well spatial niche breadth and spatial-niche overlap. Key results. Our findings showed one of the highest leopard-density estimates (excluding cubs) (mean +/- s.e.) of 23.7 +/- 4.8 per 100 km(2). When examining on-site habitat use by leopards, we found three variables that had a negative influence, namely, human presence, slope, and the presence of tigers. The presence of a large prey (sambar) had a positive influence. Leopards, exhibiting the highest spatial-niche breadth, demonstrated a small overlap with both tigers and humans, while displaying a significant diel overlap with sambar. The niche overlap was notably high with sambar, but very low with humans and tigers. Conclusions. Although tigers locally created a zone of spatial and temporal avoidance, at the population level the leopards experienced a surge in numbers in response to the reduced tiger numbers, indicated by their high density. This could be a cause of high leopard movement into nearby human settlements. This unique scenario could have contributed to conflict. Implications. Understanding the coexistence among different species and the impact of transient animals is crucial to develop effective management strategies to mitigate conflict. This approach would facilitate and ensure the long-term survival of diverse large carnivores in the tropical forests of southern Asia through sustained support for conservation from local communities.

AB  - Bottom-up effects from host plants and top-down effects from predators on herbivore abundance and distribution vary with physical environment, plant chemistry, predator and herbivore trait and diversity. Tri-trophic interactions in tropical ecosystems may follow different patterns from temperate ecosystems due to differences in above abiotic and biotic conditions. We sampled leaf-chewing larvae of Lepidoptera (caterpillars) from a dominant host tree species in a seasonal rainforest in Southwest China. We reared out parasitoids and grouped herbivores based on their diet preferences, feeding habits and defence mechanisms. We compared caterpillar abundance with leaf numbers ('bottom-up' effects) and parasitoid abundance ('top-down' effects) between different seasons and herbivore traits. We found bottom-up effects were stronger than top-down effects. Both bottom-up and top-down effects were stronger in the dry season than in the wet season, which were driven by polyphagous rare species and host plant phenology. Contrary to our predictions, herbivore traits did not influence differences in the bottom-up or top-down effects except for stronger top-down effects for shelter-builders. Our study shows season is the main predictor of the bottom-up and top-down effects in the tropics and highlights the complexity of these interactions.

It uses Pearson correlation analysis to assess the relationships between rainfall metrics, drought, vegetation and livestock. Trends were analysed using Mann-Kendal and Sen's slope analysis.ResultsIt was found that rainfall variability and drought frequently occur in Central District, with continuing effects on vegetation and livestock. From 1990 to 2020, the district experienced moderate droughts on cycles of approximately alternating years. Severe drought occurred in 2003, and 2000 was a wet year. No significant trend was observed in rainfall metrics. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the number of cattle and goats significantly declined. Annual NDVI shows a significant relationship with the number of rainy days, drought and consecutive wet days; cattle numbers are negatively correlated with consecutive dry days. Seasonal results show that NDVI is highly correlated to the number of rainy days in April-June (AMJ) and October-December, and NDVI is correlated to the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) during AMJ and July-September.ConclusionsThe study findings revealed a seasonal and annual relationship between rainfall metrics, SPEI 12, livestock (goats, sheep and cattle population) and NDVI in the Central District of Botswana.

AB  - Cardiac glycosides are chemical defence toxins known to fatally inhibit the Na,K-ATPase (NKA) throughout the animal kingdom. Several animals, however, have evolved target-site insensitivity through substitutions in the otherwise highly conserved cardiac glycoside binding pocket of the NKA. The large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, shares a long evolutionary history with cardiac glycoside containing plants that led to intricate adaptations. Most strikingly, several duplications of the bugs' NKA1a gene provided the opportunity for differential resistance-conferring substitutions and subsequent sub-functionalization of the enzymes. Here, we analysed cardiac glycoside resistance and ion pumping activity of nine functional NKA alpha/beta-combinations of O. fasciatus expressed in cell culture. We tested the enzymes with two structurally distinct cardiac glycosides, calotropin, a host plant compound, and ouabain, a standard cardiac glycoside. The identity and number of known resistance--conferring substitutions in the cardiac glycoside binding site significantly impacted activity and toxin resistance in the three alpha-subunits. The beta-subunits also influenced the enzymes' characteristics, yet to a lesser extent. Enzymes containing the more ancient aC-subunit were inhibited by both compounds but much more strongly by the host plant toxin calotropin than by ouabain. The sensitivity to calotropin was diminished in enzymes containing the more derived alpha B and alpha A, which were only marginally inhibited by both cardiac glycosides. This trend culminated in alpha A beta 1 having higher resistance against calotropin than against ouabain. These results support the coevolutionary escalation of plant defences and herbivore tolerance mechanisms. The possession of multiple paralogs additionally mitigates pleiotropic effects by compromising between ion pumping activity and resistance.

AB  - The increase in wild ungulate population density harms the dynamics of forest ecosystems. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the initial degree of damage, as a key factor in the secondary spread of fungal pathogens, and other parameters as a result of bark stripping caused by red deer (Cervus elaphus L.). The research focused on young Norway spruce (Picea aries [L.] Karst.) stands (7-26 years) in a total of 20 permanent research plots at four locations in the Klasterec nad Ohri and Rumburk Forest Service, each with an area of 100 m2 (10 m x 10 m). From the assessment of 783 spruce individuals, it follows that damage by bark stripping in particular stands amounted to 23.4-58.3%. Average circumferential damage ranged between 20.2-32.1% with a trunk wound length of 38.5-77.0 cm. Overall, a significant (p < 0.05) difference in dendrometric parameters (DBH and tree height) was found between undamaged "healthy" trees, and individuals with new and old damage in terms of attractiveness to game. The average DBH of undamaged trees varies between 2.0 and 3.7 cm, which is the size that wildlife prefers for initial damage. The lowest dimension of newly damaged trees starts from a DBH of 1.5 cm, and trees with a DBH > approx. 9 cm were no longer searched for wildlife. Effective hunting management and regulation of the abundance of ungulates to ecologically acceptable levels are the key to the protection of forest stands.

AB  - A faunal assemblage was recently recovered from the Krosinko site in Poland, marking a new site in the War-saw-Berlin ice-marginal valley. Analysis and radiocarbon dating of the remains revealed the presence of two subassemblages: one Late Pleistocene (at least MIS 3-2) and one Holocene (MIS 1), with the former being taxonomically highly diverse. By referring to previous Polish studies, the Pleistocene mammal bone assemblage allowed us to reconstruct the biogeography of its individual components: woolly mammoths, woolly rhinoceri, horses, giant deer, red deer, fallow deer, reindeer, steppe bison, aurochses, bears, and cave lions. The bioge-ography was later combined with radiocarbon chronology using 21 dates from Krosinko. The wide range of radiocarbon dates (48.4-26.4 ka BP) probably reflects different chronological distributions of species resulting from the changing climate and environment as well as the diverse original sources of the bones. The remains, which constituted a single, compact geological horizon, was possibly deposited in a single geological event around 26 ka BP, as inferred from the most recently produced radiocarbon date. Radiocarbon datings of woolly rhinoceros remains have shown the species to have been present around 38 ka BP, a time that it had previously been considered to have been non-existent in Europe (with no evidence having been discovered for the period 40-34 ka BP). This result alters the stratigraphic gap range for the woolly rhinoceros in Europe to 40-38 ka BP. The clear dominance of woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros specimens reflects the structure of the Mam-muthus-Coelodonta faunal complex. The main representatives of this complex preferred the dry and cold con-ditions that characterized the palaeoenvironmental conditions in Krosinko in MIS 2 and thus in Central Europe, as shown by the integration of the results of the fauna and those of the sediments in which they were deposited. These palaeoenvironmental features are related to the mammoth steppe, which was a long-lived biome in Eurasia and whose diversity influenced the faunal distribution. Thus, the species-by-species review of taxa performed in this paper, against the background of previous results from Poland, illuminates the individual responses of taxa to changing environmental conditions in response to climatic ones. These changes led to the disappearance of the mammoth steppe and near or total extinction of the fauna species inhabiting it.

AB  - Worldwide, open grass areas of savannah ecosystems are being transformed into shrubland. This woody plant encroachment is likely a result of factors such as rainfall, fire and secondary dispersal by ungulate herbivory. However, few experiments have been conducted to disentangle and quantify the role of these factors for seed germination in savannahs. We assessed in situ germination success of Vachellia drepanolobium seeds under simulated rainfall variability patterns, fire treatments and dung experiments in Maswa Game Reserve, Tanzania. Fire reduced seed germination by more than 13%, whereas germination in buffalo and elephant dung increased by 1% and 3% respectively. Additionally, intermediate simulated rainfall was more beneficial for seedling emergence success than large, infrequent simulated rainfall amounts, while shoot growth was twice as high under frequent and intermediate simulated rainfall treatments than under large infrequent simulated rainfall. Our results provide insights that bush fires, drought stress, and large rainfall events can suppress V. drepanolobium seedling emergence and growth. Hence, bush encroachment may be linked to management practices such as fire regimes and climatic conditions, i.e., frequent low rainfall conditions. Our results can help predict future patterns of encroachment under varying rainfall and fire events.

AB  - Understanding drivers of space use by African elephants is critical to their conservation and management, particularly given their large home-ranges, extensive resource requirements, ecological role as ecosystem engineers, involvement in human-elephant conflict and as a target species for ivory poaching. In this study we investigated resource selection by elephants inhabiting the Greater Mara Ecosystem in Southwestern Kenya in relation to three distinct but spatially contiguous management zones: (i) the government protected Maasai Mara National Reserve (ii) community-owned wildlife conservancies, and (iii) elephant range outside any formal wildlife protected area. We combined GPS tracking data from 49 elephants with spatial covariate information to compare elephant selection across these management zones using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, providing insight regarding how human activities structure elephant spatial behavior. We also contrasted differences in selection by zone across several data strata: sex, season and time-of-day. Our results showed that the strongest selection by elephants was for closed-canopy forest and the strongest avoidance was for open-cover, but that selection behavior varied significantly by management zone and selection for cover was accentuated in human-dominated areas. When contrasting selection parameters according to strata, variability in selection parameter values reduced along a protection gradient whereby elephants tended to behave more similarly (limited plasticity) in the human dominated, unprotected zone and more variably (greater plasticity) in the protected reserve. However, avoidance of slope was consistent across all zones. Differences in selection behavior was greatest between sexes, followed by time-of-day, then management zone and finally season (where seasonal selection showed the least differentiation of the contrasts assessed). By contrasting selection coefficients across strata, our analysis quantifies behavioural switching related to human presence and impact displayed by a cognitively advanced megaherbivore. Our study broadens the knowledge base about the movement ecology of African elephants and builds our capacity for both management and conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary: Huangshan, a famous mountainous scenic area and biodiversity hotspot in East China, is particularly vulnerable to human activities and habitat fragmentation, more so than designated nature reserves. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant global shifts in human activity, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on wildlife survival. Camera data from before and during the pandemic were analyzed to explore the changes in population size, habitat use, and temporal activity of the local species. This study highlights the negative impacts of human activity on wildlife, providing essential data to support conservation and management in the Huangshan Scenic Area. Human activities impact ecosystems globally, and understanding human-wildlife coexistence is crucial for species conservation. This study analyzed trends in local wildlife populations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess their response to human disturbance. From 2017 to 2022, 60 camera sites were monitored, and seven species with the largest population size-excluding rodents-were selected for analysis. The results revealed that the presence of humans (p = 0.025) and domesticated animals (cats and dogs, p = 0.002) significantly decreased during the pandemic. Conversely, five species (except the Tibetan macaque and mainland serow) showed habitat expansion and population growth (p < 0.05), which may be related to their avoidance of human presence or artificial structures such as roads and tourism facilities. In addition, the analysis showed that most species, except the Tibetan macaque and wild boar, adjusted their activity patterns, showing increased diurnal activity when human disturbances were reduced (RR > 0). These findings suggest that species may adapt their behaviors to avoid human presence. This study highlights the negative impacts of human activities on local wildlife and emphasizes the need for stronger conservation and management efforts to mitigate human disturbances in scenic areas.

AB  - Genome-wide evaluations of genetic diversity and population structure are important for informing management and conservation of trailing-edge populations. North American moose (Alces alces) are declining along portions of the southern edge of their range due to disease, species interactions, and marginal habitat, all of which may be exacerbated by climate change. We employed a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach in an effort to collect baseline information on the genetic variation of moose inhabiting the species' southern range periphery in the contiguous United States. We identified 1920 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 155 moose representing three subspecies from five states: A. a. americana (New Hampshire), A. a. andersoni (Minnesota), and A. a. shirasi (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Molecular analyses supported three geographically isolated clusters, congruent with currently recognized subspecies. Additionally, while moderately low genetic diversity was observed, there was little evidence of inbreeding. Results also indicated > 20% shared ancestry proportions between A. a. shirasi samples from northern Montana and A. a. andersoni samples from Minnesota, indicating a putative hybrid zone warranting further investigation. GBS has proven to be a simple and effective method for genome-wide SNP discovery in moose and provides robust data for informing herd management and conservation priorities. With increasing disease, predation, and climate related pressure on range edge moose populations in the United States, the use of SNP data to identify gene flow between subspecies may prove a powerful tool for moose management and recovery, particularly if hybrid moose are more able to adapt.

AB  - Nature's contributions to people diminish when people are alienated from nature. We developed a framework to help support more sustainable people-nature interactions in the context of the conservation of African elephants (Loxodonta africana and L. cyclotis). Elephants are iconic, and ecologically, culturally, and socio-economically important, but are also competing and in conflict with people who still benefit little from elephant conservation. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to address challenges over elephant conservation and management, and help achieve human-elephant coexistence, by (i) balancing integrity of nature with social cohesion and human wellbeing, and (ii) moderating the use of nature through widely accepted values, aspirations, and rights. The framework provides mechanisms for policymakers and managers to improve existing community-based conservation initiatives, promotes equitable policies for elephant conservation, and can be applied to the conservation of other iconic species that pose management challenges.

AB  - Conserving species relies upon acquiring an understanding of their use of habitat, yet our understanding of the use of habitat by co-existing species of different guilds at microgeographic scales remains poor. In particular, the use of habitat by woodland species is of conservation concern because of widespread declines in woodland biodiversity. Woodland bird declines have been ascribed, in part, to high deer densities because their browsing reduces the availability of nesting sites and food. We quantify the microgeographic use of habitat by Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus) and of Great Tits (Parus major), Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in a heterogenous woodland landscape. We examined the use of habitat at microgeographic scales by the deer and the three bird species in relation to whether the local habitat was flat or wet or had a path, fence or wall within a 25-m radius of 206 randomly selected locations. We first examined if the occupancy rates of nestboxes in those locations were correlated with the number of Roe Deer lays and second, examined if the use of habitat by the Roe Deer and the bird species were associated with each of the habitat features that we quantified. We begin by showing that the use of habitat by Roe Deer is incongruent with the use of habitat by Great Tits, Blue Tits and Pied Flycatchers during the breeding season. Also, whilst all three bird species showed no, or weak, habitat preferences, the Roe Deer preferred daytime lay sites that were in flat areas of wet woodland close to paths, whilst there were no significant effects of the presence of fences and walls. These findings show that the Roe Deer and the three bird species differ in the use of habitat within a heterogenous woodland landscape, meaning that their use of habitat did not overlap at microgeographic scales. Meanwhile, the deer showed preferences for flat areas of wet woodland, whilst none of the bird species exhibited such preferences, and we discuss the implications of our findings for the management of woodlands.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interactions are pivotal in shaping terrestrial ecosystems, influencing plant populations and insect diversity; however, little is known about how anthropogenic impacts affect the beta diversity of these interactions. In our study, we investigated plant-herbivore networks across an urbanization gradient in Brazilian Cerrado. We tested two hypotheses: (1) urbanization decreases interaction dissimilarity, and (2) herbivorous insects show greater dissimilarity than plants. To test these hypotheses, we conducted data collection across 16 sites, representing different urbanization levels-urban, rural, and wild. We sampled plant-herbivore interactions for 310 insect herbivore species and 97 host plant species. Our analysis revealed that beta diversity of interactions was consistently high across all environments studied. However, we did not find any significant differences in total interaction dissimilarity among the different levels of urbanization. We found that the primary driver of dissimilarity was species composition turnover, with herbivorous insects contributing more to dissimilarity. Our findings challenge the conventional wisdom that urbanization significantly alters plant-herbivore interactions. Instead, we observed consistent interaction dissimilarity, highlighting the resilience of ecological networks in the face of anthropogenic impacts. Our results underscore the complexity of these interactions and emphasize that plant-herbivore interactions can exhibit a high degree of dissimilarity even in urban environments.

AB  - This multi-disciplinary science and Indigenous knowledge assessment paper reviews over 20 years of research materials, oral histories and Indigenous views on climate change affecting Unalakleet, Alaska, USA and Norton Sound. It brings a historical review, statistical analysis, community-based observations and wisdom from Unalakleet Inupiaq knowledge holders into a critical reading of the current state of climate change impacts in the region. Through this process, two keystone species, Pacific salmon and caribou, are explored as indicators of change to convey the significance of climate impacts. We rely on this historical context to analyse the root causes of the climate crisis as experienced in Alaska, and as a result we position Indigenous resurgence, restoration and wisdom as answers.

AB  - Quantifying unique morphological characteristics of an animal is important to create a record as conditions change over time, as well as to characterize adaptations that may be unique to specific populations, particularly those that are rare or endangered. We investigated morphologic differences among bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in California. There are three geographically distinct populations of bighorn sheep in California that are currently recognized and managed under different conservation strategies: Sierra Nevada bighorn (O. c. sierrae), desert bighorn (O. c. nelsoni), and Peninsular bighorn (O. c. nelsoni). We analyzed morphologic measurements recorded for these populations between 1978 and 2016 to quantify their physical characteristics and determine if there are differences among them. Body and horn characteristics were unique for each population. Sierra bighorn tended to have larger body size and smaller horns than Peninsular and desert bighorn, and Peninsular bighorn tended to weigh more and have larger horns than desert bighorn (Sierra males weighed 22% more than desert males; Peninsular males weighed 14% more than desert males). Distinctions among rare and endangered populations, like Sierra Nevada and Peninsular bighorn sheep, have important implications for wildlife managers.

AB  - Surveying and quantifying the bushmeat crisis in Africa requires up-front, reliable species-level identification. We conducted a comprehensive survey of 31 trading places where bushmeat are sold in Cote d'Ivoire (West Africa) and two seizures from Europe, using a multi-gene DNA-typing approach and a dedicated species-assignment pipeline (DNAbushmeat). We identified 47 wild and five domestic species-level taxa from 348 collected carcasses, including mammals (15 Cetartiodactyla, 10 Rodentia, seven Carnivora, seven Primates, two Pholidota, two Lagomorpha, one Hyracoidea, one Chiroptera), reptiles (two Squamata), birds (one Bucerotiformes, one Galliformes, one Otidiformes) and fish (one Perciformes). Our DNA-based approach allowed the detection of two separate lineages of red-flanked duikers (Cephalophus rufilatus), a yet unreferenced cane rat (but possibly Thryonomys gregorianus) and two cryptic species of Gambian rat (Cricetomys). We also observed important levels of intraspecific diversity in several mammals and squamates, suggesting additional cryptic diversity within bushmeat species from Cote d'Ivoire. More than half of the bushmeat carcasses were inaccurately identified, with European customs peaking at 100% inaccuracy. Our study also explored the use of diversity indices among bushmeat markets to identify 'hotspot' market places where biodiversity would be the most impacted. Overall, 12 protected species (including pangolins, crocodiles, primates and antelopes) were impacted by the bushmeat trade in Cote d'Ivoire, indicating weak law enforcement related to game protection. We suggest that the recognition of the bushmeat sector by the state and its DNA-based surveillance is necessary to reach a sustainable management of the bushmeat trade in Cote d'Ivoire.

AB  - Questions Forest-grassland boundaries in the tropics are primarily interpreted as driven by fire and herbivory. So far, frost has received little attention as driver of tropical vegetation boundaries. Here, we study mid-altitudes in south-central Africa and ask the following questions: (a) is there a lower treeline between grasslands and forests on the Angolan Plateau; (b) if so, do topoclimatic differences play a role in it; and (c) what do our results imply for tropical highlands globally? Location The Angolan Plateau (10 degrees-16 degrees S and 13 degrees-21 degrees E). Methods We mapped vegetation by applying a supervised support vector machine-based classification on a Landsat satellite image. We used a 1,000-m spaced point grid to extract the mean vertical distribution of the vegetation units from a digital elevation model. The topographic position of each point was calculated using a channel network approach. Microclimatic data were collected across topographic gradients at two sites along the Plateau. Analyses focussed on the number of nights where temperature dropped below 0celcius, median and minimum temperatures, and diurnal temperature ranges. Results Lower treelines separate Miombo forests from geoxyle grasslands in all major valley systems. Treelines are located 150-200 m below the headwater divides. Nocturnal outgoing net long-wave radiation and resulting cold-air pooling cause frequent frosts in the valleys during the dry season. Topography controls frost patterns, with minima of down to -7.5celcius and diurnal temperature amplitudes up to 40celcius. Conclusions The results show that vegetation patterns in central Angola are shaped by frost. The processes causing frost depend on air humidity. Drier atmosphere and lower global temperatures indicate a longer frost season, lower minima and frost extending to lower elevations and latitudes for the Pleistocene. Pleistocene forest fragmentations and the rise of endemism-rich grasslands in comparable tropical highlands worldwide may be explained by crossing thermic thresholds via increasing seasonal aridity.

AB  - Terrestrial mammal communities in the mangrove forests of Borneo are generally poorly studied due to the access difficulties associated with wetland habitats. We used camera-trapping methods to conduct a survey from June 2015 to May 2018 to produce baseline data on the species richness and community composition of terrestrial mammal fauna in a mixed-mangrove forest. This survey was conducted in Kuala Abai, which is located in the Lower Kinabatangan floodplain of eastern Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. A total of 3,742 camera trap-days were recorded from five camera trap locations, which resulted in 797 independent photographs of nine terrestrial mammal species from six families and four orders. The most frequently detected species was the bearded pig (Sus barbatus) followed by the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis), Sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) and Bornean sun bear (Helarctos malayanus). Seven of the species recorded were of global or regional conservation significance according to the IUCN Red-list (2020). Six of the species were additionally listed as locally protected species under the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment (1997). Of particular importance was the detection of the extremely rare and endangered otter civet (Cynogale bennettii), which is likely a new locality record in a mixed-mangrove forest in the eastern part of Sabah. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of the Kuala Abai mixed-mangrove forest to fauna conservation in Sabah and the effectiveness of camera-trapping techniques for studying terrestrial mammals in wetland habitats.

AB  - Grazing fishes farm algae, and consume algae, detritus and sediment and consequently differentially modify benthic communities. Manipulations of cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus on reefs show that cleaners affect fish abundance differently according to grazer functional group. Accordingly, whether reefs are grazed differently, with consequences for the benthos (fouling material tile(-1)), was tested using reefs kept free of L. dimidiatus for 10 years compared with undisturbed control reefs. We recorded on video the grazing density (bites tile(-1) h(-1) reef(-1)) on settlement tiles and the natural benthos (roving fishes only), according to territorial algal farmer (Pomacentridae) and roving grazer (Acanthuridae, Labridae, Siganidae) functional groups, and measured the accumulation of fouling material tile(-1) after 10 months. Grazing density on tiles (dominated by 'indeterminate' farmers, and roving 'sediment-removing' detritivore Ctenochaetus striatus) and the natural benthos (dominated by Ct. striatus and other grazers) was not measurably affected by cleaner presence. The composition of fouling material (dominated by detritus > turf algae > sediment > other) and organic and inorganic dry weight of material tile(-1) were also not measurably affected by cleaner presence. This points to resilience of the benthic community to loss of cleaners. The likely complex interactions between cleaner fish presence, grazer abundance and mobility, and the often-opposite effects of territorial farmers and roving grazers on the benthos underscore the challenge in determining indirect effects of cleaners on benthic community structure. However, a lack of cleaners has negative ramifications for fish populations and physiology and thus their loss remains problematic for client fishes.

AB  - The relationship between phytophagous insects and plants is a central aspect of food webs and ecosystem functioning. The introduction of new species into an environment can have significant impacts on the food web of a native ecosystem. In many cases, there is a lack of knowledge on the biology and feeding behavior of invasive species prior their introduction and in the invaded regions. Gut content analyses of insects have provided valuable information on the host spectrum of insects. However, current approaches are time-consuming and costly. Here, we describe a new molecular gut content analysis (GCA) approach using the Oxford Nanopore (ONT) Flongle sequencing platform to characterize the plant DNA present in the gut of the highly polyphagous insect species Halyomorpha halys. We demonstrate that this technique efficiently amplifies and correctly identifies plant DNA in a mock community. We performed a feeding experiment to determine the sensitivity of this approach and to assess how long the plant DNA can be detected. All plants used in the feeding experiment were correctly identified and detected after 56 days. Surprisingly, we also detected various plant genera that were not included in the feeding experiment and thus were likely ingested months before the experiment. Our study suggests that the GCA using the ONT Flongle sequencing platform represents a rapid and cost-efficient diagnosis of the dietary preferences, host range, and the diversity of consumed plant species of pest insects with high precision.

AB  - The Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus) is a small goat-like animal, which is considered "vulnerable" due to its rapid decline in population in the wild. Captive breeding programs are necessary to prevent the extinction of Chinese gorals; however, reproduction in captivity reduces genetic diversity due to inbreeding. In 2020, a total of six wild Chinese gorals were introduced into a captive population of 73 individuals to improve the allelic gene pool. An assessment of captive gorals was conducted to trace and understand genetic diversity in the new captive state. Microsatellite genotyping and mitochondrial D-loop sequence analyses were performed to examine the genetic diversity and population structure. The results showed very low haplotype diversity, with a significant difference between He (0.477 +/- 0.065) and Ho (0.196 +/- 0.056), suggesting a high degree of inbreeding. This resulted in a limited ability to adapt to environmental change and low natural reproductive fitness, thus increasing the risk of population decline and eventual extinction. Management of captive breeding plans based on different subpopulations and haplotypes has been proposed to maximize genetic variability and enhance the success of future conservation plans.

AB  - An increasing number of ecological studies have used chemical diversity as a functionally relevant, scalable measure of phytochemical mixtures, demanding more rigorous attention to how chemical diversity is estimated. Most studies have focused on the composition of phytochemical mixtures and have largely ignored structural concerns, which may have greater importance for ecological function. Here, we explore the development of structural complexity and compositional diversity resulting from different biotic and abiotic interactions in Piper kelleyi Tepe (Piperaceae). We also describe how variation in structural complexity and compositional diversity differs between two congeners, P. kelleyi and P. reticulatum. To better interpret these results, we have developed a framework for interpreting these dimensions of chemical diversity in phytochemical mixtures.
   We used the tropical shrub, P. kelleyi, as a model system to examine interactions between ecological factors and dimensions of phytochemical diversity. We also compared compositional diversity and metabolic complexity in P. kelleyi and P. reticulatum using liquid chromatography and H-1 NMR, respectively, to examine trade-offs between compositional diversity and structural complexity. A framework is provided to generate meaningful estimates of the structural complexity of phytochemical mixtures as measured by H-1 NMR.
   Piper is an abundant plant genus that supports diverse insect communities throughout the tropics. Subtle changes in understorey forest light were associated with increases in herbivory that directly increased compositional diversity and indirectly decreased structural complexity in P. kelleyi. This was attributed to the production of oxidation products resulting from herbivory-driven decomposition of structurally complex defence compounds. This type of complex result would remain undetected using standard chemical ecology approaches and accounts for the detailed molecular changes that are likely to affect species interactions.
   Synthesis. Our quantitative framework provides a method for considering trade-offs between structural complexity and compositional diversity and the interpretation of analytical approaches for each. This methodology will provide new theoretical insights and a more sophisticated model for examining the ecology and evolution of chemically mediated interactions.

AB  - There is a renewed global awareness to improve soil health through the intensification and management of organic inputs such as the application of animal waste-based digestate and other types of organic fertilizers to the soil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different types of animal waste-based digestate application on soil prokaryotic diversity and composition in an agricultural cropping system over a period of 3 years, cultivated with three different annual cereal crops (spring wheat, triticale, and barley). Treatments were laid out in a randomized design with five conditions (three replicates per condition): fertilizer treatments included three different types of digestate (pig manure, chicken manure, and cow manure digestates), synthetic mineral nitrogen, and unfertilized control. Prokaryotic soil communities were characterized by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The three most abundant phyla identified were Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Proteobacteria, which accounted for over 55% of the total prokaryotic community. Other phylogenetic groups such as Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes were also identified as part of the native soil microbiota. It was observed that the period of digestate application did not significantly influence the prokaryotic diversity in the soil. On the contrary, sampling time was a major factor in driving beta-diversity. A correlation with soil pH was also observed for several taxonomic groups, indicating its importance in shaping prokaryotic community composition. Our study showed that the richness and diversity of the soil prokaryotic community were not affected by digestate application, while other factors such as the yearly crop varieties and seasonal/climate changes were the major contributors to differentiating the prokaryotic community composition over time.

AB  - Steep terrace walls are the basis to guarantee the function of terraces, but due to the lack of vegetation cover, they are often exposed to serious erosion and soil degradation. Soil aggregate carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (C-N-P) contents and stoichiometry can provide a common framework for reflecting nutrient status, cycling, and limitation. However, the variability of C-N-P contents and stoichiometry of terrace wall soil aggregates and the path by which they are influenced have received little attention and are still uncertain. Soil samples were collected from terrace walls with four vegetation patterns, namely bare terrace wall (BTW), moss-covered terrace wall (MCTW), moss + grass-covered terrace wall (GCTW), and moss + grass + shrub-covered terrace wall (SCTW), at each vegetation recovery time (2, 5, 10, and 30 years) and at two soil depths (0-5 and 5-20 cm) in subtropical Camellia oleifera plantations. The results showed that the proportion of macroaggregates, the stability of aggregates, and the SOC, TN, C/P ratio, and N/P ratio in most aggregate sizes of terrace walls increased with increasing vegetation pattern complexity and recovery times. Compared to the vegetation patterns, the C-N-P contents and stoichiometry of aggregates were more influenced by vegetation recovery time through soil properties and aggregate size composition, respectively. Terrace walls are limited by soil C and N, but a complex SCTW vegetation pattern can effectively alleviate soil C limitation and improve nutrient content over long pe-riods of vegetation recovery. Importantly, the colonization of mosses should be a priority on the bare terrace wall, allowing a more complex vegetation pattern that is beneficial to improve soil nutrients, maintain elemental balance, and form a more stable ecological environment. The results provide a theoretical basis for the ecological restoration of steep slopes and guarantee the function of terraces.

AB  - The landscape of disgust framework emphasizes the trade-off of satisfying critical needs against environmental cues of putative disease risk. For animals that revisit areas, repeated exposures to infectious disease through self -fouling are a potential threat that can be averted through the mechanism of fecal avoidance, motivated by disgust. Here we present an agent-based, spatially explicit, network model, where simulated animal groups move along edges connecting network nodes representing waterholes. These water resources dynamically shift via evaporation, drinking, and rainfall. We parameterize our model with the case study of buffalo and their intestinal parasites. Buffaloes defecate near (and are then motivated to avoid) waterholes and we simulate parasite ag-gregation as a measure of contamination and potential disease risk. Though disgust (intolerance of fecal contamination) reduced maximum environmental parasite density at waterholes, strong disgust resulted in a marked increase of traveling, incurring energetic or other costs. We calculated an optimum trade-off in which fecal avoidance provides a reduction in expected environmental parasite density, but travel to obtain new water resources was not markedly increased. We recalculated this optimum varying assumptions of water influx and prioritization biases. Given the necessity of water, even when contaminated, it is theoretically justified that disgust would have some temporal and spatial variability via habituation. Thus, we included a cumulative modifier to disgust based on local conditions and travel burden; we observed pronounced habituation during periods of higher water availability and groups acclimated to conditions before low water availability. We present this model to encourage similar expansive approaches using a network-based model and to stimulate discussion, modeling, and experimental approaches which continue to develop the landscape of disgust.

AB  - Mammalian communities inhabiting temperate grasslands are of conservation concern globally, especially in Central Asia, where livestock numbers have dramatically increased in recent decades, leading to overgrazing and land-use change. Yet, how this pervasive presence of livestock herds affects the community of wild mammals remains largely unstudied. We used systematic camera trapping at 216 sites across remote, mountainous areas of the Mongolian Altai Mountains to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of occurrence and the interspecific relationships within a mammalian community that includes different categories of livestock. By adopting a recently proposed multispecies occupancy model that incorporates interspecific correlation in occupancy, we found several statistically strong correlations in occupancy among species pairs, with the majority involving livestock. The sign of such associations was markedly species-dependent, with larger wild species of conservation concern, namely, snow leopard and Siberian ibex, avoiding livestock presence. As predicted, we found evidence of a positive correlation in occupancy between predators and their respective main prey. Contrary to our expectations, a number of intraguild species pairs also showed positive co-occurrence, with no evidence of spatiotemporal niche partitioning. Overall, our study suggests that livestock encroaching into protected areas influences the whole local community of wild mammals. Though pastoralism has coexisted with wildlife for millennia in central Asian grasslands, our findings suggest that policies and practices to decrease the pressure of livestock husbandry on wildlife are needed, with special attention on large species, such as the snow leopard and its wild prey, which seem to be particularly sensitive to this pervasive livestock presence.

AB  - The Bering Land Bridge connecting North America and Eurasia was periodically exposed and inundated by oscillating sea levels during the Pleistocene glacial cycles. This land connection allowed the intermittent dispersal of animals, including humans, between Western Beringia (far northeast Asia) and Eastern Beringia (northwest North America), changing the faunal community composition of both continents. The Pleistocene glacial cycles also had profound impacts on temperature, precipitation and vegetation, impacting faunal community structure and demography. While these palaeoenvironmental impacts have been studied in many large herbivores from Beringia (e.g., bison, mammoths, horses), the Pleistocene population dynamics of the diverse guild of carnivorans present in the region are less well understood, due to their lower abundances. In this study, we analyse mitochondrial genome data from ancient brown bears (Ursus arctos; n = 103) and lions (Panthera spp.; n = 39), two megafaunal carnivorans that dispersed into North America during the Pleistocene. Our results reveal striking synchronicity in the population dynamics of Beringian lions and brown bears, with multiple waves of dispersal across the Bering Land Bridge coinciding with glacial periods of low sea levels, as well as synchronous local extinctions in Eastern Beringia during Marine Isotope Stage 3. The evolutionary histories of these two taxa underline the crucial biogeographical role of the Bering Land Bridge in the distribution, turnover and maintenance of megafaunal populations in North America.

AB  - Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) evolved for thousands of years in the presence of numerous predators, including mountain lions (Puma concolor). Bighorn sheep have presumably developed predator avoidance strategies; however, the effectiveness of these strategies in reducing risk of mountain lion predation is not well understood. These strategies are of increasing interest because mountain lion predation on bighorn sheep has been identified as a leading cause of mortality in some sheep populations. Therefore, we investigated how mountain lions affect both bighorn sheep habitat selection and risk of mortality in Arizona, USA. We used 2 approaches to investigate the predator-prey relationship between mountain lions and bighorn sheep. We fit 103 bighorn sheep (81 females and 22 males) with global positioning system radio-collars in 2 Arizona populations from 2013 to 2017, and used a negative binomial resource selection probability function to evaluate whether bighorn sheep selected for habitat features in accordance with presumed predator avoidance strategies, including terrain ruggedness, slope, topographic position, and horizontal obstruction, in 2 seasons (winter and summer). We then estimated how habitat features such as terrain ruggedness, slope, horizontal obstruction, and group size, influence the risk of mortality due to mountain lion predation using an Andersen-Gill proportional hazards model. Generally, both sexes selected areas with lower horizontal obstruction and intermediate ruggedness and slope, but selection patterns differed between seasons and sexes. The use of more rugged areas and steeper slopes decreased the risk of mortality due to mountain lion predation, consistent with presumed predator avoidance strategies. Increased group size decreased risk of bighorn sheep mortality due to mountain lion predation but this effect became marginal at approximately 10 individuals/group. We did not identify a relationship between horizontal obstruction and bighorn sheep mortality risk. Our findings can be used in habitat and population management decisions such as the prioritization of habitat restoration sites or selection of translocation sites. In addition, we suggest that augmentation of low-density bighorn sheep populations may reduce mountain lion predation risk by increasing group size, and that releasing large groups of bighorn sheep in population augmentation and reintroduction efforts may help to reduce mountain lion predation.

AB  - Persistent poaching fuelled by demand for elephant ivory and rhino horn continues to threaten these species. Despite international trade restrictions operating since the 1970s, limiting poaching has remained a substantial challenge over the last decade. The poaching economy of such storable goods is driven by a combination of persistent consumer demand and market speculation, and enabled by weak governance, lack of adequate resources for species protection, and alienation of local people who pay the costs of living alongside these species. We argue that restricting the legal supply of such wildlife products has created ideal conditions for the poaching economy - `poachernomics' - to thrive. Strategies that move toward empowering local communities with stronger property rights over wildlife and delivering more benefits to them, including via carefully regulated legal trade, are underused elements in the current fight against the onslaught of the international illegal wildlife trade.

AB  - Conservation of large carnivores, especially, wild tigers (Panthera tigris) require an accurate population estimate and knowledge of their ecology. Camera traps have been widely used to estimate the population abundance of animals with unique natural markings, cryptic behaviour, and low population density. This study aimed to assess tiger abundance and density, home range, and activity pattern in Jigme Dorji National Park (JDNP), Bhutan. We carried out camera traps from October 2021 to January 2022. A total of 56 camera stations (a pair in each station) was installed in a 5 x 5 km2 grid along the latitudinal gradient of 1200-4300 m. With the sampling effort of 1528 trap nights, 478 tiger images were captured in 12 stations (21.4 % of the camera stations). Their unique stripe patterns identified six tigers (4 male and 2 female). We estimated tiger abundance of 15.16 +/- SE 5.41 (9.13-32.79) and a density of 0.263 +/- SE 0.115 (0.116-0.601 individuals) per 100 km2. The home range analysis at 50 % kernel density estimators indicated 151 km2 and 90 km2 as the home range for the male and the female tiger, respectively. The activity pattern of the tigers in JDNP indicated crepuscular type with peak activity in 17:00-18:00 h. The tiger activity pattern strongly overlaps with the activity pattern of the Himalayan serow (Capricornis thar). The current study ascertains JDNP as an important tiger conservation area and can be a source for tiger population for other protected areas and Territorial Divisions. We recommend timely monitoring of tiger and their prey base population, and habitat through enhanced Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) patrolling programs..

AB  - Background Understanding the impacts of past and contemporary climate change on biodiversity is critical for effective conservation. Amphibians have weak dispersal abilities, putting them at risk of habitat fragmentation and loss. Both climate change and anthropogenic disturbances exacerbate these risks, increasing the likelihood of additional amphibian extinctions in the near future. The giant spiny frog (Quasipaa spinosa), an endemic species to East Asia, has faced a dramatic population decline over the last few decades. Using the giant spiny frog as an indicator to explore how past and future climate changes affect landscape connectivity, we characterized the shifts in the suitable habitat and habitat connectivity of the frog. Results We found a clear northward shift and a reduction in the extent of suitable habitat during the Last Glacial Maximum for giant spiny frogs; since that time, there has been an expansion of the available habitat. Our modelling showed that "overwarm" climatic conditions would most likely cause a decrease in the available habitat and an increase in the magnitude of population fragmentation in the future. We found that the habitat connectivity of the studied frogs will decrease by 50-75% under future climate change. Our results strengthen the notion that the mountains in southern China and the Sino-Vietnamese transboundary regions can act as critical refugia and priority areas of conservation planning going forward. Conclusions Given that amphibians are highly sensitive to environmental changes, our findings highlight that the responses of habitat suitability and connectivity to climate change can be critical considerations in future conservation measures for species with weak dispersal abilities and should not be neglected, as they all too often are.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries are a global conservation threat to marine megafauna (marine mammals, sea turtles, and elasmobranchs). There is currently limited information about marine megafauna catch in Thailand's small-scale fisheries, which is required for effective management.This study represents the first independent catch assessment of marine megafauna in Thai small-scale fisheries. Data on catch and fisheries effort across 1 year (2016-2017) were collected from questionnaire interviews with 535 fishers in 17 provinces along the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea coasts. Catch per unit effort was calculated for marine megafauna by fishing gear types and extrapolated to estimate annual catches using Thai official fisheries statistics.The annual estimated catches were 5.66 million (95% confidence interval, CI: 4.10-7.82 million) rays, 457,864 (95% CI: 192,352-969,166) sharks, 2,400 (95% CI: 1610-3,537) sea turtles, 790 (95% CI: 519-1,167) small cetaceans, and 72 (95% CI: 19-194) dugongs in Thai small-scale fisheries.Gillnets had the highest catch per unit effort for all megafauna groups in both sea areas except for sea turtles, where pound nets had the highest catch per unit effort in the Gulf of Thailand. Further, among gillnets, crab gillnets had the highest catch per unit effort for all groups except dugongs, where ray gillnets had the highest catch per unit effort. Accounting for effort, crab gillnets and shrimp trammel nets were responsible for most of the megafauna catch, where crab gillnets contributed 72%-95% of the annual estimated marine megafauna catch. Crab gillnets and shrimp trammel nets were used by 46% and 40% respectively of the interviewed fishers and by 27% and 15% respectively of all small-scale fishers operating in Thai waters.Restrictions for gillnet fishing effort (crab gillnets specifically) are needed to prevent extirpation of threatened megafauna species that are important for ecosystem resilience and productivity.

AB  - Understanding how Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) improve conservation outcomes across anthropogenic pressures can improve the benefits derived from them. Effects of protection for coral reefs in the western and central Indian Ocean were assessed using size-spectra analysis of fish and the relationships of trophic group biomass with human population density. Length-spectra relationships quantifying the relative abundance of small and large fish (slope) and overall productivity of the system (intercept) showed inconsistent patterns with MPA protection. The results suggest that both the slopes and intercepts were significantly higher in highly and well-protected MPAs. This indicates that effective MPAs are more productive and support higher abundances of smaller fish, relative to moderately protected MPAs. Trophic group biomass spanning piscivores and herbivores, decreased with increasing human density implying restoration of fish functional structure is needed. This would require addressing fisher needs and supporting effective MPA management to secure ecosystem benefits for coastal communities.

AB  - Snares have become a widespread hunting technique, with their indiscriminate nature jeopardizing terrestrial large carnivores. Since the lack of reliable data on snare distribution hampers an accurate evaluation of the potential risk. Continuous winter SMART (the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool) patrols have operated in the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) and Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) ranges in northeast China from 2013 to 2020 to record wildlife occurrences and remove snares. Our research aimed to assess the snares threat pose in the Amur tiger range and whether snare removal benefited roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) recovery. We modeled the spatial distribution of Amur tigers, Amur leopards, and prey species, comparing their distributions before and after anti-poaching measures. We also assessed the overlap between Amur tigers, Amur leopards, and snare locations. Additionally, we used the MaxEnt model to predict snare distribution, and then we analyzed the overlap of snares with species at different periods between 2013 and 2015 and 2018-2020. Our results showed that the probability of occurrence of ungulates increased significantly around roads after snares were removed. Furthermore, we found that Amur tigers and Amur leopards distribution overlapped with snare locations suggesting that snares pose a serious risk to these non-target species. The overlap between snares and species has the same trend as the growing with species distribution, and the least significant increase is in DHZ-XNC.Removing snares not only aids target game species but also protects sympatric large carnivores.

AB  - Tortoises inhabit arid regions where they may represent a significant herbivorous component, but are among the most threatened of tetrapod groups. Studying tortoise diets can help predict potential trophic disruptions following extinctions of tortoise populations, and inform conservation. We studied the diet of Karoo dwarf tortoises (Chersobius boulengeri), an endangered endemic of the arid Nama and Succulent Karoo biomes in South Africa, using vegetation analysis, DNA metabarcoding, morphological evaluation of faeces, a germination trial, and focal feeding observations. DNA metabarcoding was highly successful in the identification of dietary items. Karoo dwarf tortoises fed on a broad diet, including approximately 10 taxa eaten frequently. Specifically, doll's roses (five species in the genus Hermannia) were eaten more frequently than would be expected based on their availability, whereas grasses were rejected, for a dietary Proportional Similarity Index of 0.31-0.38. Dietary selection was likely related to water and nutrient contents of plant taxa. At least four plant species (including doll's roses) germinated from faecal samples, suggesting mutualistic relationships with Karoo dwarf tortoises. The habitat preference of Karoo dwarf tortoises (i.e., well-structured rocky terrain) may provide germination microsites with ample shade and run-off water to benefit seedling recruitment in an arid environment.

AB  - To clarify the changes in phytoplankton community and influencing factors in short-term nutrient-addition experiments in the Equatorial Eastern Indian Ocean, we conducted three experiments (one in situ-like experiment, one on-deck experiment with deep seawater, and one on-deck experiment with surface seawater). Our findings indicate that when nutrients were added, there was a more significant increase in the chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations of microphytoplankton (>20 mu m) compared to those of nanophytoplankton (2-20 mu m) and picophytoplankton (<2 mu m). The chl a concentrations for phytoplankton <20 mu m only exhibited significant increases in the on-board incubation of surface seawater collected at 1300 hr when grazing stress have likely been weak. In picophytoplankton, occasional increases in the abundances of Synechococcus were found, while the abundances of Prochlorococcus and eukaryotic picophytoplankton (Peuk) did not increase significantly. It results likely from the preference of grazing effect by herbivores and bottle effects. Additionally, the Prochlorococcus from 75 m was more adapted to weak light, thus its abundance sharply decreased when incubated under high light. We suggest that the nutrient effects have greater influence on microphytoplankton, but other factors, such as grazing and light, might contribute more to <20 mu m phytoplankton. Furthermore, bottle effects should be considered when conducting incubation experiments.

AB  - The biotic interaction hypothesis, which states the species interaction becomes stronger in the tropics, is deeply rooted in classic ecological literature and widely accepted to contribute to the latitudinal gradients of biodiversity. Tests in latitudinal insect-plant interaction have emphasized leaf-eating insects on a single or a few plant species rather than within an entire community and mixed accumulating evidence, leaving the biotic interaction hypothesis disputed. We aimed to test the hypothesis by quantifying insect seed predation in a pair of tropical and temperate forest communities with similar elevations. We applied a consistent study design to sample predispersal seeds with systematically set seed traps in 2019-2020 and examined internally feeding insects. The intensity of seed predation was measured and further applied to tropical versus temperate comparison at two levels (cross-species and community-wide). Our results showed every latitudinal pattern associated with different study levels and years, that is, negative (greater granivory in the tropics in community-wide comparison in 2020), positive (less granivory in the tropics in community-wide and cross-species comparison in 2019), and missing (similar level of granivory in the tropics in cross-species comparisons in 2020). The cross-species level analyses ignore differences among species in seed production and weaken or even lose the latitudinal trend detected by community-wide comparisons. The between-year discrepancy in tropical-temperate comparisons relates to the highly variable annual seed composition in the temperate forest due to mast seeding of dominant species. Our study highlights that long-term community-level researches across biomes are essential to assess the latitudinal biotic interaction hypothesis.

AB  - beta-casein (beta-CN) has an important effect on surface properties of casein micelles and milk-clotting properties. However, current understanding of buffalo CSN2 gene polymorphisms is not sufficient. In this study, the polymorphisms in the complete coding sequence (CDS) of buffalo CSN2 were detected using PCR product direct sequencing. The CDS lengths of CSN2 gene in river and swamp buffalo were the same, which was 675 nucleotides and encoded a peptide with 224 amino acid residues. A total of 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in two types of buffalo. Among them, c.72C>T, c.161A>G, c.167C>T, c.168A>G, c.236G>C, c.249C>G, c.350T>C and c.391G>T were non-synonymous, which leads to the changes of p Gly10 Ser, p.G1n39Arg, p. Thr41Met, p. Gly64 Al a, p.Asn68Ly s, p.Met102Thr and p.Val116Phe in the mature peptide of buffalo beta-CN, respectively. However, it was predicted that these substitutions had no effect on the function of buffalo beta-CN. Fourteen haplotypes were defined based on the SNPs found in buffalo, and accordingly, 4 protein variants and 6 synonymous variants were added in the genetic variants of buffalo beta-CN, named variant B-2, B-3, B-4, C, C-1, C-2, C-3, D, E and F, respectively. The main variant in river buffalo was variant B, whereas in swamp buffalo was variant C. All the variants determined in buffalo did not exist in the animals of Bos genus. In addition, there were 11 amino acid differential sites of beta-CN between buffalo and Bos genus, of which Thr at residue 41 was located at the phosphorylation site. Furthermore, the results revealed that both types of buffalo beta-CN were "A(2)-like", which indicates that the beta-CN in buffalo milk is beneficial to human health.

AB  - Wildlife management agencies are obliged to provide evidence-based management recommendations to stakeholders. However, allocation of resources towards the management of species is rarely uniform. The consideration of life-history characteristics of moose offers wildlife managers a more robust understanding of population ecology, while also providing insight into potential limiting factors for long-term management. From 2014-2020 we simultaneously measured survival of adult female moose, as well as calf productivity, in relation to the nutritional condition of adult females, in Colorado. Mean annual adult survival was high (93% and 95% confidence interval: 91-95%). Human hunter harvest was the leading source of mortality and lowered annual adult survival to 88%. Malnutrition was the leading source of natural mortality. Mean annual pregnancy rates were relatively low (77%) and highly variable (95% confidence interval: 65-88%). However, low pregnancy rates were compensated for by high apparent calf survival. The best predictor of moose pregnancy was nutritional condition. Our data suggest that bottom-up ecological processes were affecting moose population growth, but populations were likely increasing during our study, with a simulated population growth rate of 1.04 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-1.17).

AB  - Simple Summary The number of insects that feed on an individual tree can be influenced by the growth of leaves during the season, the size of the tree, genetic traits that affect leaf quality, and by the tree species that surround it. To estimate the relative importance of these processes, we determined the date on which leaves start unfolding in spring, trunk diameter, genotype, and neighbourhood of sessile oak trees, and sampled their caterpillar communities. We found that free-living caterpillars were less abundant on older leaves. Caterpillars were less diverse and experienced higher parasitism on larger trees. Leaf-mining casebearers were more abundant on trees that were genetically more homozygous. However, genome size was not important for any guild. In contrast to most previous studies, oaks surrounded by distantly related tree species tended to have higher caterpillar densities. Neighbourhoods were also related to species composition and diversity, but not to the average wingspans or specialization of species. Common species were less abundant on trees with high parasitism rates. Our results suggest that trees are not always better off in diverse forests, as large trees surrounded by distantly related species might actually suffer more insect damage. Communities of herbivorous insects on individual host trees may be driven by processes ranging from ongoing development via recent microevolution to ancient phylogeny, but the relative importance of these processes and whether they operate via trophic interactions or herbivore movement remains unknown. We determined the leaf phenology, trunk diameter, genotype, and neighbourhood of sessile oak trees (Quercus petraea), and sampled their caterpillar communities. We found that leaf development across a time period of days related to free-living caterpillars, which disappeared with leaf age. Tree growth across decades is related to increased parasitism rate and diversity of herbivores. The microevolution of oak trees across millennia is related to the abundance of leaf-mining casebearers, which is higher on more homozygous oaks. However, oak genome size was not important for any guild. In contrast to most previous studies, the phylogenetic distance of oaks from their neighbours measured in millions of years was associated with higher abundances of entire caterpillar guilds. Furthermore, on trees surrounded by only distantly related tree species, parasitism tended to be lower. Lower parasitism, in turn, was associated with higher abundances of codominant caterpillar species. Neighbourhoods and traits of trees were also related to community composition and diversity, but not to the average wingspans or specialization of species, consistent with the assembly of herbivore communities being driven by leaf traits and parasitism pressure on trees rather than by insect movement among trees. However, movement in rarer species may be responsible for concentration effects in more phylogenetically distant neighbourhoods. Overall, we suggest that the assembly of insects on a tree is mostly driven by trophic interactions controlled by a mosaic of processes playing out over very different time scales. Comparisons with the literature further suggest that, for oak trees, the consequences of growing amongst distantly related tree species may depend on factors such as geographic region and tree age.

AB  - Roads and traffic have various negative ecological and environmental consequences on wildlife. Their impacts on animal populations are not limited to deaths. The main goal of the study is to analyze the spatial patterns of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) at the Ankara-Kirikkale highway. More specifically, we identified the road- and landscape-related features that may promote the WVC likelihood and locate the WVC hotspots. The hotspots of WVC were generated by CrimeStat 3 software. Variables related to the WVC locations were statistically analyzed, and then, they were modelled with logit regression approach. A total of 76 medium and large mammal were recorded from five species. The number of high-, medium-, and low-density clusters in the hotspots map that contains all the accidents are one, two, and four, respectively. For all species, the model shows that the probability of a fatal accident increases as the speed limit increases and the road slope decreases. To spatially identify where these events are concentrated provides valuable information for reducing the accidents and creating the correct strategies to ensure the safe migratory movements of wild animals.

AB  - Biting insects have a long-standing reputation for being an extreme presence in the Arctic, but it is unclear how they are responding to the rapid environmental changes currently taking place in the region. We review recent advances in our understanding of climate change responses by several key groups of biting insects, including mosquitoes, blackflies, and warble/botflies, and we highlight the significant knowledge gaps on this topic. We also discuss how changes in biting insect populations could impact humans and wildlife, including disease transmission and the disruption of culturally and economically important activities. Future work should integrate scientific with local and traditional ecological knowledge to better understand global change responses by biting insects in the Arctic and the associated consequences for the environmental security of Arctic communities.

AB  - It is still not well established whether plant chemical and physical defence traits can be simultaneously induced in savanna trees and how this would affect plant nutritional quality. Here, we use a long-term mammalian herbivore exclosure experiment in a dystrophic semi-arid African savanna to test how chemical (condensed tannins [CTs] and total polyphenols [TPs]) and structural (spines and thorns) defences are affected by herbivore exclusion in five common savanna woody species. We also tested whether nutritional quality interacted with either physical or chemical defences after protected trees were reintroduced to herbivores. Trees that remained available to herbivores did not increase CTs and TPs, rather these were found to be higher without mammalian herbivory in some species. In contrast, herbivory resulted in a significant induction of structural defences (i.e. longer and thicker spines) and at the same time, improved nutritional quality (i.e. higher available crude protein and lower C:N ratios) for some species. We found that the plant defence traits of the treatment which previously excluded herbivores were mostly similar to the control, which both differed from the exclosure, suggesting that legacies of herbivore exclusion on plant defence traits are mostly short-lived.

AB  - Shallow lakes in subtropical climate regions may have a clear water state with a predominance of submerged or floating macrophytes and a turbid water state with a predominance of phytoplankton. The relationship between microcrustaceans and these changes in alternative states is still incipient in the literature. And to better understand these relationships, the functional approach is an excellent tool. Thus, the present work seeks to test the hypothesis that changes in alternative stable states over time reflect the variability of composition and functional diversity of microcrustaceans. For this, samples of microcrustaceans collected in a subtropical shallow lake, which underwent alternate state changes in the period to 2000-2014, were used. Our results demonstrate a variation in composition and functional diversity among alternative states, thus supporting our hypothesis. In periods of clear water with a predominance of floating macrophytes, we found a greater functional diversity and richness of genera. This result may be associated with several factors such as greater habitat heterogeneity and lower predation pressure. The lowest values of functional diversity found in periods of turbid waters with predominance of phytoplankton and periods of clear waters with submerged macrophytes are related to the dominance of functional traits, such as scraper feeding type, herbivorous/omnivorous trophic group, littoral habitat and asexual reproduction. These traits are functional features of most Ostracoda genera, a taxonomic group abundant in these two alternative states. The predominance of this group may be related to the environmental characteristics of these periods, such as the high vegetation cover and the availability of niches unoccupied by more sensitive species, since most Ostracoda have high environmental tolerance. We conclude that the functional traits approach combined with taxonomic groups respond to temporal variations of alternative stable states and are important tools to detect environmental changes.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a crucial region for biodiversity conservation and global ecosystem services supply, and its grassland carrying capacity (GCC) is directly related to both herders' livelihoods and the implementation of ecosystem conservation and restoration programs. However, the spatiotemporal distribution of GCC within the QTP and grasslands' responses to future climate change remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the spatiotemporal characteristics of GCC for 60 years and its load during 2000-2020, and then classified levels of early-warning based on whether the grassland is currently overgrazed, and whether the overgrazing is increasing over time. Results showed that (1) GCC increased from 86.15 million to 97.70 million sheep units (SU) during 2000-2020, and GCC was higher in the east than that in the west QTP. (2) Overgrazing was alleviated due to livestock reduction after 2010 and GCC has grown more, but remains serious. The counties with stronger GCC showed more serious overgrazing. (3) Annual mean GCC was projected to increase by 0.05 SU center dot km- 2 and 1.22 SU center dot km- 2 under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 126 and SSP460, respectively. Overgrazing is likely to be greatly alleviated in the future with climate change and livestock reductions in the QTP. Our study gives practical advice for adjusting the development pattern of grassland animal husbandry and provides recommendations for key implementation areas of ecosystem conservation and restoration programs of grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Commercial, off-the-shelf, multirotor drones are increasingly employed to survey wildlife due to their relative ease of use and ability to cover areas quicker than traditional methods. Such drones fitted with high-resolution visual spectrum (RGB) cameras are an appealing tool for wildlife biologists. However, evaluations of the application of drones with RGB cameras for monitoring large-bodied arboreal mammals are largely lacking. We aimed to assess whether Geoffroy's spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) could be detected in RGB videos collected by drones in tropical forests. We performed 77 pre-programmed grid flights with a DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone at a height of 10 m above the maximum canopy height covering 45% of a 1-hectare polygon per flight. We flew the drone directly over spider monkeys who had just been sighted from the ground, detecting monkeys in 85% of 20 detection test flights. Monkeys were detected in 17% of 18 trial flights over areas of known high relative abundance. We never detected monkeys in 39 trial flights over areas of known low relative abundance. Proportion of spider monkey detections during drone flights was lower than other commonly employed survey methods. Agreement between video-coders was high. Overall, our results suggest that with some changes in our research design, multirotor drones with RGB cameras might be a viable survey method to determine spider monkey presence in closed-canopy forest, although its applicability for rapid assessments of arboreal mammal species ' distributions seems currently unfeasible. We provide recommendations to improve survey design using drones to monitor arboreal mammal populations.

AB  - Soil microbiota is a crucial component of agroecosystem biodiversity, enhancing plant growth and providing important services in agriculture. However, its characterization is demanding and relatively expensive. In this study, we evaluated whether arable plant communities can be used as a surrogate of bacterial and fungal communities of the rhizosphere of Elephant Garlic (Allium ampeloprasum L.), a traditional crop plant of central Italy. We sampled plant, bacterial, and fungal communities, i.e., the groups of such organisms co-existing in space and time, in 24 plots located in eight fields and four farms. At the plot level, no correlations in species richness emerged, while the composition of plant communities was correlated with that of both bacterial and fungal communities. As regards plants and bacteria, such correlation was mainly driven by similar responses to geographic and environmental factors, while fungal communities seemed to be correlated in species composition with both plants and bacteria due to biotic interactions. All the correlations in species composition were unaffected by the number of fertilizer and herbicide applications, i.e., agricultural intensity. Besides correlations, we detected a predictive relationship of plant community composition towards fungal community composition. Our results highlight the potential of arable plant communities to be used as a surrogate of crop rhizosphere microbial communities in agroecosystems.

AB  - Plant genotype is known to affect plant-invertebrate interactions. However, in megadiverse tropical habitats there has been relatively little exploration of the influence of the plant genotype on plant growth and biotic interactions in an experimental setting. We set-up three adjacent plots in rainforest at the foothills of the Andes (Orellana, Ecuador), where we planted clones of 37 individual Heliconia stricta rhizomes collected from up to 4 km away. Each rhizome was split into at least three individual pieces, resulting in three genetically identical replicates. At least one representative of each genotype was planted in each plot. Shoot height was measured every few months. Nine months after planting, all leaves of the plants were photographed for leaf herbivory analysis. At the time of the herbivory analysis, neither shoot height nor total leaf area were more variable among than within genotypes, but the total percentage of leaf area consumed per plant varied significantly among the genotypes. Whether or not there was a significant difference in shoot height among genotypes depended on the timepoint at which the plants were measured. However, the overall growth rate over a period of 1.5 years varied significantly among the genotypes. Our results suggest that even in megadiverse systems and despite the plasticity of plant responses, plant genotype can influence growth rate and biotic interactions such as herbivory.

AB  - Extreme climatic events (ECEs) and predator removal represent some of the most widespread stressors to ecosystems. Though species interactions can alter ecological effects of climate change (and vice versa), it is less understood whether, when and how predator removal can interact with ECEs to exacerbate their effects. Understanding the circumstances under which such interactions might occur is critical because predator loss is widespread and ECEs can generate rapid phase shifts in ecosystems which can ultimately lead to tropicalization.
   Our goal was to determine whether loss of predation risk may be an important mechanism governing ecosystem responses to extreme events, and whether the effects of such events, such as tropicalization, can occur even when species range shifts do not. Specifically, our goal was to experimentally simulate the loss of an apex predator, the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier effects on a recently damaged seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Australia by applying documented changes to risk-sensitive grazing of dugong Dugong dugon herbivores.
   Using a 16-month-field experiment established in recently disturbed seagrass meadows, we used previous estimates of risk-sensitive dugong foraging behaviour to simulate altered risk-sensitive foraging densities and strategies of dugongs consistent with apex predator loss, and tracked seagrass responses to the simulated grazing.
   Grazing treatments targeted and removed tropical seagrasses, which declined. However, like in other mixed-bed habitats where dugongs forage, treatments also incidentally accelerated temperate seagrass losses, revealing that herbivore behavioural changes in response to predator loss can exacerbate ECE and promote tropicalization, even without range expansions or introductions of novel species.
   Our results suggest that changes to herbivore behaviours triggered by loss of predation risk can undermine ecological resilience to ECEs, particularly where long-lived herbivores are abundant. By implication, ongoing losses of apex predators may combine with increasingly frequent ECEs to amplify climate change impacts across diverse ecosystems and large spatial scales.

AB  - Mid-forest meadows are integral to maintaining biodiversity and ecological services in forested landscapes but face degradation due to various reasons. This study evaluated the effectiveness of renovation methods on sward yield and herbage quality in two mid-forest meadows in northwestern Poland (54 degrees 10 ' N, 16 degrees 78 ' E), aiming to maintain their function as the foraging areas for the free-living red deer population. The results indicated that overdrilling was insufficient to significantly enhance sward quality or productivity (with no significant differences in DM yield between treatment and control), largely due to competition with existing vegetation and suboptimal habitat conditions. The full tillage method, in combination with sowing dedicated seed mixtures, substantially improved the sward yielding and forage quality, especially in terms of DM yield (av. 7% on object W; 18% on object TD). The efficacy of renovation methods varied between experimental sites, suggesting that the renovation strategy of mid-forest meadows should be tailored according to the habitat conditions.

AB  - The classical niche theory supports the idea that stable coexistence requires ecological differences between closely related species. However, information on waterbirds coexistence in the entirely landlocked freshwater system of Poyang Lake is not well understood, especially when the available biomass of their food in the area decreases. In this study, we tested the ecological segregation mechanisms in the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 wintering periods among eight herbivorous waterbirds (including the Siberian crane Grus leucogeranus, hooded crane Grus monacha, white-naped crane Grus vipio, common crane Grus grus, greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons, bean goose Anser fabalis, swan goose Anser cygnoides, and tundra swan Cygnus columbianus) at Poyang Lake. Using field observations and species niche and foraging habitat selection models, we investigated the abundance, distribution, and food sources of these eight waterbird species to quantify and compare their habitat use and ecological niches. Our results showed that niche segregation among the waterbirds, with respect to food types, time, and spatial location, allow them to coexist and use similar resources. The water level gradually receded in the sub-lakes of the Poyang Lake, which could provide food sources and various habitats for wintering herbivorous waterbirds to coexist. We demonstrated that the differences in habitat use could mitigate interspecific competition, which may explain the mechanism whereby waterbirds of Poyang Lake coexist during the wintering period, despite considerable overlap in the dietary niches of herbivorous waterbirds.

AB  - IntroductionOcean fronts are moving ephemeral biological hotspots forming at the interface of cooler and warmer waters. In the open ocean, this is where marine organisms, ranging from plankton to mesopelagic fish up to megafauna, gather and where most fishing activities concentrate. Fronts are critical ecosystems so that understanding their spatio-temporal variability is essential not only for conservation goals but also to ensure sustainable fisheries. The Mozambique Channel (MC) is an ideal laboratory to study ocean front variability due to its energetic flow at sub-to-mesoscales, its high biodiversity and the currently debated conservation initiatives. Meanwhile, fronts detection relying solely on remotely-sensed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cannot access aspects of the subsurface frontal activity that may be relevant for understanding ecosystem dynamics. MethodIn this study, we used the Belkin and O'Reilly Algorithm on remotely-sensed SST and hindcasts of a high-resolution nested ocean model to investigate the spatial and seasonal variability of temperature fronts at different depths in the MC. ResultsWe find that the seasonally varying spatial patterns of frontal activity can be interpreted as resulting from main features of the mean circulation in the MC region. In particular, horizontally, temperature fronts are intense and frequent along continental shelves, in islands' wakes, at the edge of eddies, and in the pathways of both North-East Madagascar Current (NEMC) and South-East Madagascar Current (SEMC). In austral summer, thermal fronts in the MC are mainly associated with the Angoche upwelling and seasonal variability of the Mozambique current. In austral winter, thermal fronts in the MC are more intense when the NEMC and the Seychelles-Chagos and South Madagascar upwelling cells intensify. Vertically, the intensity of temperature fronts peaks in the vicinity of the mean thermocline. DiscussionConsidering the marked seasonality of frontal activity evidenced here and the dynamical connections of the MC circulation with equatorial variability, our study calls for addressing longer timescales of variability to investigate how ocean ecosystem/front interactions will evolve with climate change.

AB  - Recent experiments have demonstrated that carnivores and ungulates in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America fear the human 'super predator' far more than other predators. Australian mammals have been a focus of research on predator naivet & eacute; because it is suspected they show atypical antipredator responses. To experimentally test if mammals in Australia also most fear humans, we quantified the responses of four native marsupials (eastern grey kangaroo, Bennett's wallaby, Tasmanian pademelon, common brushtail possum) and introduced fallow deer to playbacks of predator (human, dog, Tasmanian devil, wolf) or non-predator control (sheep) vocalizations. Native marsupials most feared the human 'super predator', fleeing humans 2.4 times more often than the next most frightening predator (dogs), and being most, and significantly, vigilant to humans. These results demonstrate that native marsupials are not na & iuml;ve to the peril humans pose, substantially expanding the taxonomic and geographic scope of the growing experimental evidence that wildlife worldwide generally perceive humans as the planet's most frightening predator. Introduced fallow deer fled humans, but not more than other predators, which we suggest may result from their being introduced. Our results point to both challenges concerning marsupial conservation and opportunities for exploiting fear of humans as a wildlife management tool.

AB  - Human-carnivore conflict is a noteworthy rural livelihood issue as livestock of local communities living around protected areas are depredated by wild carnivores, which are the persecuted by local communities, in response. The current study aimed at investigating the patterns, perception, economic losses, and mitigation of human wildlife conflict in Pakistan through meta-analysis of published literature and using the questionnaire survey method. We retrieved data from the published and unpublished sources, and from records of provincial wildlife departments. In addition, we also collected empirical data from different households falling in the range of targeted carnivore species and filled 331 semi-structured questionaries. Based on the activities and home range of the predator species, conflict density maps for each predator species were developed. Our analysis revealed that five major carnivore species are involved in the human-wildlife conflict, namely Asiatic black bear (Ursus thi-betanus), Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos), common leopard (Panthera pardus), grey wolf (Canis lupus) and snow leopard (Panthera uncia). About 7214 livestock heads were reportedly lost during past two decades because of these five carnivore species. The domestic goat depredation was maximum (51.08 %, n = 3685), followed by sheep (27.09 %, n = 1954), cow (11.37 %, n = 820), buffalo (2.34 %, n = 169), dogs (2.05 %, n = 148), poultry (0.87 %, n = 63), donkey (4.28 %, n = 348), and horse (0.37 %, n = 27), causing a total financial loss of USD 1.87 million. Maximum livestock depredation occurred in summer season (50.79 %), at night (59.92 %) time and outside the village (51.22 %). Majority of the people showed negative attitude towards the predators, and they did not know about the conservation status and the authorities to report for conservation of the predator species. Most of the respondents were unaware about the possible management of the predator species for the co-existence of human and wildlife in the same landscape. However, majority of respondents (38.3 %) thought that livestock depredation by carnivore species can be controlled through payment of insurance compensation to the person who lost its livestock during carnivore attacks, followed by restoration of natural habitat (20.1 %), translocation of predator (16 %), and improved husbandry practices like predator proof corals (8 %). The study concludes that buffer zones of the protected areas are the hotspots for human-wildlife conflict and to avoid such conflict in future, special mitigation measures should be adapted, and regulations should be developed to minimize the niche overlap of the livestock and wildlife prey species, thereby to avoid any competition for food resources.

AB  - As part of a long-term experiment to determine the impacts of composted manure and straw amendments (replacing 50% of chemical fertilizer with composted pig manure, wheat straw return combined with chemical fertilizer, and setting no fertilizer and chemical fertilizer-only as controls) on rice-associated weeds in a rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation system, species richness, abundance, density, and biomass of weeds were assessed during years 8 and 9. Fertilization decreased the species richness and total density of rice-associated weeds but increased their total biomass. The species richness and densities of broadleaf and sedge weeds decreased with fertilization, while species richness of grass weeds increased only with straw return and density was not significantly affected. The shoot biomass per square meter of grass and broadleaf weeds was significantly higher with fertilization treatments than with the no-fertilizer control, while that of sedge weeds declined with fertilizer application. With fertilization, the densities of monarch redstem (Ammannia baccifera L.) and smallflower umbrella sedge (Cyperus difformis L.) decreased, that of Chinese sprangletop [Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees] increased, and those of barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.] and monochoria [Monochoria vaginalis (Burm. f.) C. Presl ex Kunth] were not significantly affected. Ammannia baccifera was the most abundant weed species in all treatments. Whereas composted pig manure plus fertilizer resulted in higher density of A. baccifera and lower shoot biomass per plant than chemical fertilizer only, wheat straw return plus chemical fertilizer caused lower density and shoot biomass of A. baccifera. Therefore, it may be possible that fertilization strategies that suppress specific weeds could be used as improved weed management program components in rice production systems.

AB  - BackgroundHard ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites infesting all types of domestic ruminants throughout the world and serve as vectors in the dissemination of a wide variety of pathogens. Sheep and goat farming is a vital economic source for resource-poor farming communities in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province of Pakistan. Aim: The aim of present study is to study the epidemiological profile of ticks in various agro-climatic zones of KPK. Materials and Methods: A total of 1500 (882 sheep and 618 goats) of all age groups and sexes were examined for the presence of ticks belonging to six districts in four agro-climatic zones of KPK province, Pakistan. Non-probability sampling was undertaken based on animal hosts' selection, collection of hard ticks, and epidemiological parameters. Ticks collected from sheep and goats were identified phenotypically using standard keys. Results: The results revealed that Rhipicephalus microplus (36.2%) was the predominant tick species followed by Hyalomma anatolicum (25.2%), Hyalomma trancatum (18.1%), Hyalomma aegyptium (11.3%), Hyalomma asiaticum (6.9%), and Haemephysalis bispinosa (2.4%). Different epidemiological parameters showed that weather, humidity, and host age negatively affect (p < 0.05) tick load while temperatures (Minimum and Maximum), sunshine (hrs), and precipitation positively affected (p < 0.05) tick load. Host sex only showed a positive association with tick load (p > 0.05). The highest value of tick diversity index (H) 0.36748 was noted for Hyalomma anatolicum as this tick species was commonly distributed in three agro-climatic zones except in the Suleiman Piedmont zone, while Haemaphysalis bispinosa has the lowest diversity index (0.0334) as it was only found in the Central Valley Plains zone of KPK. The Shannon diversity index of tick diversity was highest at Barikot while the lowest index value was at Kabal (2.407). Similarly, a higher Simpson's diversity index was at Barikot (0.9554) and the lowest hard index was noted at Takht bai (2.874). The dominance index showed that the tick species were more dominant at Takht bai (0.1251), while the lowest dominance was at Barikot (0.04465). Conclusions: It has been concluded that tick diversity and distribution, abundance, reproduction, development, and survival depend on prevailing climatic conditions. The present study would not only help to identify the tick species but also facilitate in devising effective control measures to minimize the transmission pathogens in sheep and goats being reared in the various agro-climatic zones of KPK province, Pakistan.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a rapidly-spreading wildlife disease hindering the health of deer populations, including white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus. Hunter compliance with management, such as testing their deer for CWD, is needed for CWD response plans to be successful. However, the role of social norms on hunters' behaviors in the CWD context has not been evaluated. A questionnaire was administered to North Carolina hunters in the 2022-2023 deer hunting season to assess how norms influenced their decision to test deer for CWD. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine the strength of these relationships and found that both personal norms and perceived social norms had an impact on whether a hunter tested their deer for CWD, with perceived social norms having a stronger effect. Results from this study can help predict testing compliance rates and enhance CWD testing efforts to encourage more participation within the hunting community.

AB  - Given the marked differences in environmental conditions and active biota between daytime and nighttime, it is almost inevitable that ecosystem functioning will also differ. However, understanding of these differences has been hampered due to the challenges of conducting research at night. At the same time, many anthropogenic pressures are most forcefully exerted or have greatest effect during either daytime (e.g., high temperatures, disturbance) or nighttime (e.g., artificial lighting, nights warming faster than days). Here, we explore current understanding of diel (daily) variation in five key ecosystem functions and when during the diel cycle they primarily occur [predation (unclear), herbivory (nighttime), pollination (daytime), seed dispersal (unclear), carbon assimilation (daytime)] and how diel asymmetry in anthropogenic pressures impacts these functions.

AB  - Personality is not a uniquely human characteristic and it has been documented in a wide range of organisms, from mammals to birds, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates. However, personality is still poorly understood in Cervids. Therefore, our study aimed to fill this gap by i) investigating personality and ii) exploring its links to dominance hierarchy, assessed by behavioral observations in 11 captive and tame male red deer (Cervus elaphus). Using questionnaires to assess personality, three trained volunteers rated these animals in 15 behaviorally composed adjectives with detailed descriptions, based on their overall impression at the end of the observation period. Behavioral data from animals were collected across three different situations, namely ?feeding? (i.e., high competition for a scarce resource), ?normal? (i.e., no external stimuli) in a group setting, and ?handling? (i.e., stressful situation due to human manipulation) in an individual setting. We estimated dominance hierarchies between the individuals based on situations of average and high competition (i.e., ?normal? and ?feeding?) via the Clutton-Brock Index (CBI). Using Fleiss? Kappa for inter-rater reliability, only five of our 15 behavioral adjectives showed acceptable reliability. Using principal component analysis, four of these adjectives formed one personality component labelled ?Confidence/Aggressiveness?. We found that although ?Confidence/Aggressiveness? did not correlate with CBI, ratings of two adjectives loading onto this component, namely ?Confident? and ?Submissive?, significantly correlated with the CBI, indicating that the questionnaire ratings reflect real behavioral variation in red deer males. Our study provides the first assessment of personality in male red deer and adds to the growing literature on Cervid personality, offering the basis for future personality research in ungulates.

AB  - The lithology, ostracods, palynomorphs and black carbon of a sediment core from a saline wetland in the southern Tibetan highlands (29 degrees 14'33.40 '' N/87 degrees 13'09.10 '' E, 4480 m a.s.I., A.R. Xizang, China) is analyzed and climate modelling applied with respect to core questions in Quaternary research: (1) Do mesoclimatic effects of regional landscape structures like high mountains overrule the effects of global climates? (2) Did life persist during the LGM? (3) Which shifts in ecosystems can be detected? (4) Does the fire-record testify for the presence of humans and their environmental impact? (5) How old is Neolithisation in the world's largest highlands?
   The results of this integrated multi-disciplinary investigation revealed (1) the meso-climatic effect of the Himalayan arc's relief channeled westerlies with West-Himalayan forest-pollen types into the southern Tibetan highlands, with (2) higher winter-precipitation, slightly lower summer precipitation, and the persistence of life for plants, and herbivores and therefore probably hunters. (3) The most arid period occurred between 17.8 and 15 cal kyr B.P., possibly synchronous with the Heinrich 1 event. Around 14.8 cal kyr B.P. humidity increased with torrential rains of high erosive power on sparsely plant-covered slopes and lasted until 4 cal kyr B.P. (4) The continuous fire-record proved the availability of combustible matter and a constant fire source which is believed to be human-attributed. Charcoal peaks around 17, 16 and 13 cal kyr B.P. remained sporadic until 11.5 cal kyr B.P. and attained the highest values since 8.7 cal kyr B.P. Black carbon increased steadily until 11 cal kyr B.P. and sharply peaked with high fluctuations around 10 cal kyr B.P., indicating high frequency intensive fires at the beginning of the Holocene. Between 10 and 6 cal kyr B.P. fire frequency decreases, with a slight peak around 4 cal kyr B.P. (5) The dawn of pastoralism in the early Mid Holocene Climatic Optimum dated back to 8.7 cal kyr B.P. with a decline of grass-pollen and the synchronous emergence of grazing weeds, leaving a perception gap of 5000 years between the palaeo-ecological and the archaeological state of the art.

AB  - The Neotropical realm is vastly known for its richness, being the Amazon one of the main cradles of taxonomic diversity in the region. In the last decades, molecular analyses have been further increasing the number of Amazonian vertebrate species, hidden under traditional taxonomy due to morphological convergence. Bats represent an interesting example, as the number of recognized bat species is continuously expanding with the identification of numerous cryptic taxa. Studies combining different lines of evidence, such as morphometric and molecular approaches, have been playing an important role in addressing knowledge gaps on Neotropical bat diversity. Within the Phyllostomidae family, the dwarf little fruit bat Rhinophylla pumilio is a forest-dependent species, with a disjunct distribution in the Amazonian and Atlantic forests. Moreover, different karyotypes have been recovered across the species distribution, suggesting this might be one more example of cryptic diversity. Here, we test this assumption by identifying geographic patterns of morphological and molecular variation within the species' entire range of distribution. Our results point to an overall morphological and morphometric homogeneity, except between Atlantic Forest and Amazonian specimens, with significant dissimilarity among some cranial characters. Furthermore, genetic data suggest a rapid and recent diversification, with these two lineages most likely corresponding to speciating taxa. Within the Amazonian forest, our molecular analyses also recovered four additional lineages, likely encompassing intraspecific diversity. Furthermore, studies are required to confirm the need for a taxonomic rearrangement.

AB  - Bark stripping is a key topic in forestry because of economic losses due to associated fungal infections of wood, finally resulting in growth decrease and the loss of ecosystem services. Numerous studies identified factors influencing the spatial distribution of bark stripping damage between stands or at the landscape scale. However, patterns within single stands are not yet reported. In this research, we performed a terrestrial laser scanning supported census of nine stands in Austria (9026 trees in total). A generalised additive model with a binomial distribution (link = logit) and soap film smoother was fitted to the data. The probability of bark stripping on the single tree level depended on the following covariates: Spruce was more vulnerable than larch, damage probability decreased with DBH and the local slope and increased with the Epanechnikov Kernel (bandwidth = 15 m) estimate of tree density. At the nearest neighbour distance of two metres, there was a damage maximum. The spatial distribution of bark stripping damage was clumped, and its intensity decreased with increasing distance to forest roads. In 67.7% of the cases, the model predicted the right outcome for the total population (overall model accuracy). This percentage varied between 55.3 and 79.1% between stands. In conclusion, the spatial distribution should be considered in inventory designs for bark stripping damages to mitigate bark stripping effects on the forests.

AB  - During the Dawenkou cultural period (ca. 6100-4600 BP) in China, people were frequently buried with pigs, but there are still many outstanding questions concerning domestic pig husbandry and management. In this study, we conducted a stable isotopic analysis on the animal remains from Houtieying, an early Dawenkou cultural site, to understand pig husbandry in this region. The results reveal that suids at Houtieying had a diverse diet, the majority of the suids analyzed consumed C3-based food, but others had a more C3/C4 mixed diet. The zooarchaeological composition of the suids from Houtieying is complex because wild boars and domestic pigs are mixed in the assemblage. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish wild boars from domestic pigs based on the stable isotopic results which suggest that they shared a similar diet. Thus, the domesticated pigs are assumed to be managed in a comparatively free-range manner, not through keeping them in pens. In addition to foraging in the natural environment, domestic pigs were also probably fed with a small number of cultivated foods, i.e., byproducts of millet and rice. Compared to studies that date to the previous periods, e.g., the Shuangdun and Houjiazhai sites of the Shuangdun culture, domestic pigs became more important during the Dawenkou cultural period which is linked to the development of pig husbandry. Additionally, through a comparative analysis of stable isotopic values of pigs from different archaeological sites, we observed variations in pig husbandry strategies within the early Dawenkou cultural sphere, which are constrained by specific ecosystems, agricultural regimes, and social factors.

AB  - Grazing is one of the most important biological factors controlling the abundance of early-life stages of fucoids and one of the major issues when restoring marine forests. Benthic macroinvertebrates (e.g., sea urchins) and fish shape and regulate benthic macroalgal communities from polar to tropical regions and can be responsible for regime shifts leading to the predominance of turfs and/or barren grounds. However, other herbivores (i.e., mesograzers) could also significantly participate in the grazing, especially on early-life stages, hampering the persistence and capacity of Cystoseira sensu lato populations to recover after major disturbances and being a cause of failure of restoration actions. We performed experiments in the field and in mesocosm in order to investigate the herbivory pressure and the effects of different grazers on recruits of Cystoseira compressa. The results highlight that non-strict herbivorous invertebrates, such as Clibanarius erythropus, Cerithium vulgatum, and Idotea balthica, graze on recruits of Cystoseira s.l. spp., with I. balthica showing the highest consumption rate. We concluded that biotic factors such as herbivory, which affect key life stages, can be crucial for the conservation of Cystoseira s.l. forests and need to be better understood and considered on a case-by-case basis when planning restoration actions.

AB  - As the dominant predator on North America's grasslands, coyotes Canis latrans have a large influence on biodiversity, both on working ranches and in protected parks. Ground squirrel (sciurid) species and livestock carrion are often abundant on grasslands worldwide and have the potential to influence a predator's consumption of alternative prey. We collected 1321 scats in four seasons over two years in and adjacent to Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan, to test the hypothesis that seasonal and spatial variation in consumption of sciurid prey and cattle Bos taurus carrion influenced coyote consumption of alternative prey. Sciurid (black-tailed prairie dog Cynomys ludovicianus and Richardson's ground squirrel Urocitellus richardsonii) remains were common from spring to fall and had a strong inverse relationship with deer (mule deer Odocoileus hemionus and white-tailed deer O. virginianus), which were most common in winter scats. Cattle remains were most common during spring, fall and winter, and occurred in 10.6% of scats annually. Biomass estimates suggest that cattle was the highest ranked food on cattle grazing land year-round, and the 2nd ranked food, after deer, during winter on the portion of the park from which cattle were excluded. Closer proximity of scats to a prairie dog colony increased the likelihood of prairie dog remains throughout the year and reduced the likelihood of cattle remains in scats from spring to fall, but not during winter. Individual differences in foraging and ranging behavior may explain the spatial distribution of prairie dog versus cattle in scats. Further work is needed to determine whether sciurid prey, deer, or livestock carrion support large predator populations on grassland habitats to a level that may negatively affect coexisting prey species, including species at risk.

AB  - Camera-based abundance estimators are an alternative methodology of growing interest in both research and management applications. The statistical formulations of camera-based abundance estimators using time-lapse data should theoretically produce precise and unbiased estimates; however, production of unbiased results also requires meeting several important assumptions, and real-world case studies evaluating such results remain relatively few. We applied instantaneous sampling (IS) and space-to-event (STE) estimators to remote camera data collected in April 2021 via time-lapse sampling of closed populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) on Wild Horse Island in western Montana, USA, and compared results for bighorn sheep to aerial and ground-based counts. Point estimates from camera-based approaches underestimated bighorn sheep populations by 32-44% (IS estimator) and 62-69% (STE estimator) relative to aerial and ground counts. Patchy spatial distribution and group-living behavior of sheep resulted in a high degree of noise surrounding the IS estimate. In comparison, a low point estimate with relatively narrow confidence intervals suggested potential sensitivity of the STE estimator to violating assumptions of independence among individual animals and sampling occasions. Estimates of mule deer had improved precision over sheep estimates, as indicated by lower estimated coefficients of variation of the mean (CVmean) derived from the analytic SE estimator. Using 15-m viewsheds and the IS estimators, mule deer density estimates came with a 26% CVmean compared to 43% CVmean for bighorn sheep. This discrepancy may be a result of differences in distribution, behavior, and relative abundance between the 2 species. Accounting for group size and increasing time between sampling may improve accuracy of density estimates and adhere better to model assumptions when estimating precision. In addition, factors influencing viewshed and resulting density extrapolations must be considered carefully. While camera-based methods theoretically provide an alternative way to estimate density when traditional methods are impractical, our results suggest that more work is needed to ensure density estimates are accurate and precise enough to inform population management.

AB  - Cattle (Bos taurus) grazing on public lands is widespread across the globe. Public rangelands are managed for multiple purposes, including preservation of wildlife populations; therefore, to manage public rangelands, it is imperative to understand how cattle grazing affects wildlife. Despite this, there is mixed evidence for the impacts of cattle on wildlife and few studies investigate both spatial and temporal aspects of wildlife activity. To improve understanding of how cattle grazing impacts spatiotemporal wildlife activity, we analyzed camera data from three California Department of Fish and Wildlife properties in California, the United States from 2019 to 2021. We recorded 2 863 detections of cattle across all properties and the most abundant wildlife were coyotes (Canis latrans, 572 detections) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; 1 415 detections). We used generalized linear mixed models and daily activity estimates to quantify cattle, coyote, and mule deer spatial and temporal activity and compared activity during grazing and nongrazing periods (properties were grazed 3-6 mo per year) and between sites with higher and lower cattle use. Mule deer spatial activity changed seasonally and at one property decreased during grazing seasons, but there were no overall significant effects of cattle detections on mule deer spatial activity. However, deer were more nocturnal at sites with higher cattle use, indicating that they may have been partitioning areas temporally with cattle. This shift in activity also increased deer overlap with more nocturnal species, like coyotes. Coyotes increased use of sites with higher activity of their prey and increased use of times with higher cattle activity. Our study suggests that low to moderate cattle grazing does not result in significant spatial displacement of common large mammals; however, shifts in temporal activity patterns of wildlife due to cattle presence may impact predator-prey interactions and wildlife energy expenditure and needs further monitoring.

AB  - Although fire occurrence plays a central role in the dominance of the super-dominant bracken fern Pteridium arachnoideum in Neotropical forests, it is unclear whether this applies to the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), which vegetation is naturally adapted to fire. We assessed fire effects on the aboveground biomass of P. arachnoideum in the Cerrado Ecological Reserve in Central Brazil. We measured frond height, density, standing biomass, and litter biomass before and for two years following a prescribed fire, and also sampled a control site to control for other mortality events and for seasonal variation. The average P. arachnoideum frond height and aboveground biomass decreased over three times in the burnt site 18 months after the fire. The frond density decreased both in the burnt and control site, indicating that this may have been caused in another way than by fire. Conversely, litter biomass decreased shortly after the fire in the burnt site, but returned to pre-fire levels in one year. Possible explanations for the lasting negative effects of fire on the height and biomass of P. arachnoideum include the implementation of the prescribed fire early in the dry season, which likely limited immediate clonal regrowth, and the herbivory by leaf-cutting ants. Nevertheless, the effective clonal growth of P. arachnoideum apparently precluded the fire from having stronger effects and hence this species was not excluded from the site. We conclude that direct and indirect fire effects may cause the decline of P. arachnoideum in Cerrado, so that prescribed fires may be applied as a management strategy in Cerrado sites where this species is super-dominant, ideally in combination with other control measures.

AB  - Successful management of invasive species often requires working across public and private landownerships. A prime example of an invasive species that commonly occurs on privately and publicly owned and managed lands is the wild pig (Sus scrofa). Because of the multitude of negative impacts associated with wild pigs, management must occur across both private and public lands to achieve widespread control and sustained success. However, managing wild pigs across property boundaries is challenging as we know very little about differing management practices and landowner perspectives. To address this knowledge gap, we sought to understand wild pig management efforts on privately owned lands, the perceived economic, ecological, and human health impact of wild pigs, and beliefs related to policy. Generally, stakeholders believe wild pigs have negative impacts on wildlife, the economy, and ecological and public health, however less than half of landowners participate in wild pig control. Furthermore, stakeholders believe that the responsibility of managing and paying for damages associated with wild pigs lies with individual landowners. Our findings suggest that increased efficacy of wild pig control and collaboration between private and public landowners is not only possible but also necessary if wild pig population control is to be regionally successful.

AB  - The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is among the 100 most harmful invasive alien organisms worldwide designated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Therefore, the Argentine government officially declared this species as being detrimental to biodiversity conservation. Rabbits represent a potential threat to the regeneration of Patagonian forests, which host unique biodiversity and functional relationships. However, two local studies that evaluated diet composition using microhistological analysis of feces in the north and south of Patagonian forests found that trees represent a small proportion of the annual diet of rabbits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of rabbits on saplings in an area of Patagonian forest with high rabbit densities. We sampled 294 saplings for rabbit herbivory in 20 1-ha forest plots adjacent to grasslands and shrublands in Lanin National Park, Argentina. No evidence of tree regeneration limitations was found in the affected stands, which concurs with the results of previous local studies on diet composition. Other anthropogenic impacts, such as domestic ungulate breeding, intentional fires, urban growth, and forestry, appear to represent more serious threats to Patagonian forests than rabbit herbivory.

AB  - Wild ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVC) in Europe have dramatically increased, creating serious conservation, economic and health problems. To examine which temporal and environmental features promote UVC involving the three most abundant and widely distributed wild ungulate species in Portugal (wild boar, red deer and roe deer), we used Generalized Linear Models, using a database of 3,374 UVC (2019-2022). We evaluated the influence of hour, day, month, hunting season, breeding season, lunar phase, meteorological conditions and land cover on the patterns of the wild ungulate-vehicle collisions. Temporally and spatially, UVC were not randomly distributed and the distribution was species-specific. Different factors explained the vehicle collisions for different species, being precipitation, time after dusk, forest and urban area around the collisions the drivers common for all the species. Hunting season also explained the wild boar collisions and both hunting and breeding season explained both wild boar and roe deer vehicle-collisions. Our results may be considered an important step towards the development of nationwide and space-time collision risk maps to be incorporated on navigation and mapping services. The information provided in this study emphasis the need for the optimization of ongoing mitigation measures and the need to focus them on periods of elevated collision risk, namely during twilight periods.

AB  - Simple Summary Climate is one of the most influential factors in the dynamics of tuberculosis in the Mediterranean Iberic wildlife population. In this study, we aim to address how drought as a risk factor influences the occurrence of Tuberculosis-like lesions (TBL) in wild boar inspected in the field. With this focus, our study contributes to pointing out the importance of periods of drought in the increased TBL occurrence in wild boars inspected in the field in the subsequent season. The results of our study allow hunting managers to be advised, in advance, on whether they should adopt extra protective measures when they are aware of the presence of periods of drought. This climate trait can become an alert sign for increased TBL occurrence in the following season, allowing for the implementation of a feasible, timely, and effective measures to control TB in the wild boar population. In the Iberian Peninsula, the prevalence of tuberculosis differs for each region and for different wild disease hosts and the region affected by a Mediterranean climate will be the most affected. The Mediterranean Iberic regions have a favourable ecosystem for the development of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex agents, where habitat, population dynamics, and climate (especially drought) are important factors affecting the high prevalence of tuberculosis in the wild boar population. Our objective was to study the association between the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the occurrence of tuberculosis-like lesions (TBL) in wild boar during nine hunting seasons (2008/09 to 2016/17) in Idanha-a-Nova County. To this end, statistical analysis revealed a significant association (p < 0.05) between the occurrence of TBL in wild boar in Idanha-a-Nova County and the analysed risk factor-previous season with periods of drought-which indicated that, when one season experiences some periods of drought, the probability of TBL occurrence in wild boars was 1.2 (OR = 1.2) times higher in the next hunting season than when there were no periods of drought. Therefore, our study contributes to the discovery of a positive effect of periods of drought on the transmission of tuberculosis in Iberian wildlife.

AB  - We examined natural regeneration changes in an urban natural area forest, the Good Woods, Cobbs Creek Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after placement of exclusion fencing to prevent white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing and unplanned North American beaver (Castor canadensis) felling. Seedlings (stem dbh < 2.5 cm, stump at 15 cm < 3.0 cm), saplings (stem dbh > 2.5-10 cm, stump at 15 cm > 3.0-11 cm), and trees (stem dbh > 10 cm, stump at 15 cm > 11 cm) were surveyed in 65 permanent 10 m X 10 m plots: 6 y after fencing placement to exclude white-tailed deer and 5 mo after the start of beaver felling. Overall seedling abundance increased by 5% while sapling populations grew by 20% and the number of trees expanded by 34% after white-tailed deer exclusion. Red maple (Ater rubrum) seedlings, tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) seedlings, and red oak (Quercus rubra) saplings increased significantly while pignut hickory (Carya glabra) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) seedlings decreased significantly. Seedling and tree losses to North American beaver felling were small (<2% for all seedlings and <3% for all trees). However, beaver felling caused a greater than 60% loss of saplings for red maple, black cherry (Prunus serotina), white oak (Quercus alba), and red oak. Less than 30% of the saplings were lost for pignut hickory, white ash, and tulip poplar. Urban North American beaver preferences for native species saplings paralleled rural beaver in the eastern United States. Our results indicate white-tailed deer exclusion fencing is an effective management method for increasing natural regeneration of both seedlings and saplings in an urban natural area forest when the fencing also effectively excludes North American beaver.

AB  - Background The islands in the Persian Gulf are home to several species of gazelles, i.e., Gazella bennettii, G. subgutturosa, and a new subspecies of Mountain gazelles which was discovered on Farur Island and described for the first time in 1993 as Gazella gazella dareshurii. Later, phylogenetic analyses showed that the Mountain gazelles consist of two species: G. gazella and G. arabica. As the Farur gazelles are more closely related to the Arabian forms of the Mountain gazelles, this subspecies is regarded to be G. arabica dareshurii. Until now, the origin of this subspecies has been an enigma. Results Here, we used mitochondrial cyt b, two nuclear introns (CHD2 and ZNF618), and morphological data to address this question by investigating the taxonomic position of the Farur gazelles. The results show that this population is monophyletic and split from other G. arabica populations probably 10,000 BP. Conclusions It is a natural relict population that was trapped on the island due to the rising sea levels of the Persian Gulf after the Last Glacial Maximum. Intermittent drought and flooding are suggested to be the main factors balancing population growth in the absence of natural predators on this monsoon-influenced island. Conservation actions should focus on preserving the natural situation of the island (cease introducing mesquite tree and other invasive species, stop building new construction and roads, and caution in providing water sources and forage), and possibly introducing individuals to other islands (not inhabited by gazelles) or to fenced areas on the Iranian mainland (strictly isolated from other gazelle populations) when the population reaches the carrying capacity of the island.

AB  - In the Anthropocene, the ranges of introduced species are expanding, while extinction-prone species are contracting. Introductions and extinctions are caused by how species respond to human impacts, but it is unknown why the ranges of some species expand and some contract. Here, we test whether this opposite response of human impact is due to introduced and extinction-prone species falling at opposite ends of geographic, evolutionary, or ecological trait continua. We constructed a database of native range maps, traits, phylogenetic relationships, and the introduction and extinction-prone status of squamate reptiles with ranges native to the Western Hemisphere. Across > 3000 snake and lizard species (88% of known native squamates), 142 had been introduced elsewhere and 483 were extinction-prone (i.e. vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild, extinct). To explain variation in status, we first tested if the same human-impacted regions in the Americas contained the native ranges of species of either status. Second, we tested for phylogenetic signal in species status. Finally, we tested the explanatory power of multiple trait continua. The native ranges of introduced and extinction-prone reptiles were clustered in island regions with high human impact versus mainland regions with lower human impact. Phylogenetic signal was weak for status, but introduced and extinction-prone species were clustered in different clades. All geographic and ecological traits that explained each status supported the opposite ends hypothesis. Introduced species had larger, edgier ranges, while extinction-prone species had smaller, simpler ranges. Introduced species were mostly herbivorous/omnivorous, while extinction-prone species were mostly carnivorous. Introduced species produced larger clutches, while extinction-prone species had smaller body sizes. In the Anthropocene, the native ranges of introduced and extinction-prone species are in the same human-impacted regions where trait continua, having opposite effects, determine whether species ranges expand or contract in the continuing face of global change.

AB  - It is important to assess whether anthropogenic activity affects wildlife distribution and resource use to appraise the efficacy of multi-use protected areas. Habitat degradation and vegetation damage as indicators of competitive and facilitative livestock-wildlife interactions were the focus of this study. Foot transects were conducted in the dry season of 2011, wet season of 2012, and dry season of 2012 in five wildlife sanctuaries in the Amboseli ecosystem, Kenya, to determine whether habitat degradation and vegetation damage affected wildlife distribution and wildlife-livestock interactions. Simpson's and Jaccard's biodiversity indices and Pianka's niche overlap index were used to assess wildlife-livestock interactions across a gradient of habitat degradation. In the dry season, Jaccard's, Pianka's, and Simpson's indices (0.50, 0.84, and 0.99, respectively) peaked at the highest level of degradation. In the wet season, Jaccard's index (0.42) peaked at a fairly high level of habitat degradation, Pianka's index (0.82) at a fairly low level, and Simpson's (0.80) at the lowest level. Two-way ANOVA revealed that there was no effect of degradation or vegetation damage on wildlife distribution irrespective of the feeding guild. Therefore, it appears that continued shared use of the Amboseli landscape by wildlife and livestock is feasible.

AB  - Oak (Quercus spp.) and hornbeam (Carpinus spp.) are one of dominant tree species in East Asian temperate broad leaf deciduous forests and many insect species, including more than 65% of Lepidoptera species, feed on these trees. We sampled lepidopteran caterpillars from two 0.1 ha plots in a temperate forest to investigate the role of dominant trees (oaks and hornbeams) in herbivore community. In total, we identified 738 caterpillars from 223 Lepidopteran species on 34 tree species. Most caterpillar species were from species-rich families such as Geometridae 25% (56 spp.), Noctuidae, and Tortricidae. After excluding dominant trees, plant-herbivore network analyses showed increased network specialization and nestedness and decreased generality and vulnerability. These results suggest that oaks and hornbeams support a large Lepidopteran herbivore community, and cooccurring plant species support diverse but specific herbivores. Geographical distribution and plant community are closely related to diversity of the herbivore community. Future work is needed to investigate the likelihood that specialist herbivores become relatively more abundant in the forest as oaks are succeeded by hornbeams.

AB  - Woody plant encroachment can eliminate open-structured habitats and commonly triggers ecological restoration. However, the long-term dynamics and formation processes of encroaching woody layers are often unclear, including after initial restoration has reestablished open habitats, making sustainability of restoration gains in open habitats uncertain. To examine the multi-decade change and formation processes of encroaching oak shrubby layers in midwestern U.S. savannas and woodlands undergoing restoration, we measured: (1) oak shrubby layers (primarily Quercus velutina) for 24-34 years on 24 restoration sites receiving 2-17 prescribed fires, (2) demographics of 379 shrubby oak shoots, and (3) age structure to determine recruitment history of oak shoots. The oak shrubby layer did not form until the second or third decade of restoration management. It was maximized when sites had cumulatively received >= 4 fires, but none within 3 years, and overstories were open. Most (91%) small-diameter (<2.5 cm at 1.4 m) oak shoots were top-killed by fire if incurring >= 15% scorch, but 99% resprouted. Moreover, the greater the scorch, the faster resprouts subsequently grew. Repeated establishment of the shrubby layer occurred through synchronized, even-aged pulses the year after fires. Results suggest that the oak shrubby layer, and its resilience, expands decades into restoration management and represents a conundrum. Some oak regeneration must occur to maintain savanna-woodland structure, and depauperate oak regeneration threatens oak ecosystems in many regions. Yet for restoring savannas, continual restoration inputs were required to perpetually reduce encroachment by oak, and the inputs needed increased-not decreased-as restoration sites aged.

AB  - Although dam removal has been considered a viable strategy to mitigate habitat fragmentation within a stream, long-term ecosystem effects after dam removal have rarely been discussed. In an effort to enhance the resilience of the critically endangered Formosan salmon (Oncorhynchus masou formosanus) in response to climate change, a 15-m-high check dam in a subtropical high-mountain stream was half-removed. The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term response of trophic structure and function to dam removal by constructing Ecopath models upstream and downstream of the removed dam at different times. Field surveys for model parameters were conducted for a complete seasonal cycle 1 year before dam removal, 1 and 2 years (short-term) after dam removal and 7 and 8 years (long-term) after dam removal. Both upstream and downstream systems moved to-ward maturity after dam removal. In the short term after dam removal, more energy can be transferred further up in the food webs. The vitality and diversity of both systems also increased. In the long term after dam removal, although the transfer efficiencies of both systems generally showed a decreasing pattern, the resilience increased. Compared to the upstream system, the effects of dam removal on the downstream system were more evident. In the downstream system, dam removal enhanced the vitality of the Formosan salmon and thus the top-down control. The dominance of detritivory flow in the food web also shifted toward the dominance of herbivory flow. Consequently, the downstream system reached more maturity, and the food web was more closely linked. The ecosystem attributes of the upstream and downstream systems converged, suggesting that the decoupling between upstream and downstream systems resulting from damming disappeared 8 years after dam removal.

AB  - The development, evaluation, and refinement of effective and humane capture methods for wildlife studies is important for increasing our capacity to understand and effectively manageand conserve wildlife populations. Carfentanil has been the primary agent used to chemically immobilize mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) during the past 40 years. However, carfentanil is no longer commercially available for wildlife captures in North America. To investigate viable alternatives for mountain goat capture, we conducted field trials using thiafentanil to immobilize free-ranging mountain goats via aerial darting methods; thiafentanil responses were then compared to a standard and widely used carfentanil dose. During June-October, 2005-2020, we immobilized mountain goats with either 2.4-3.0 mg carfentanil (n = 444) or 6.0-7.0 mg thiafentanil (n = 68) across a range of different field conditions at 6 different study sites in coastal Alaska. Induction and recovery times were more rapid (and subsequent immobilization times reduced) using thiafentanil compared to carfentanil. In most other respects, however, immobilization characteristics (i.e., body temperature, pulse rate, relative oxygen saturation) were virtually indistinguishable between individuals immobilized with carfentanil or thiafentanil. During typical immobilizations, mean rectal temperature increased 1.8 degrees C, but increased as much as 3.0 degrees C in some extreme cases. Administration of supplemental oxygen resulted in substantial, potentially clinically significant increases in peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen, and pH in immobilized mountain goats. Our findings indicate that thiafentanil is an effective alternative to carfentanil for chemical immobilization of mountain goats and may offer some important advantages, particularly when immobilizing mountain goats and other species in difficult and potentially dangerous capture environments.

AB  - Chronic exposure to lead (Pb) in livestock grazing in abandoned mining areas affects animal welfare and productivity, as well as represents a significant food safety risk. Here, we evaluate the physiological effects of Pb exposure in goats maintained under extensive farming conditions in a non-remediated mining area. We monitored blood, fecal, and milk Pb levels in two groups of goats, pregnant (n = 17) and lactating (n = 24), kept in different enclosures with high soil Pb concentrations (geometric means of 270 and 143 mu g/g, respectively) in Sierra Madrona mining district (Spain). We also studied the influence of Pb exposure on the ability to mount a cellular immune response, and on oxidative stress and biochemical biomarkers measured in blood. Blood Pb concentration was higher in pregnant than in lactating goats, but this difference was not observed in fecal Pb concentration. Pb levels in feces and milk concentrations were correlated with those measured in blood, with 11% of milk samples showing Pb concentrations above the maximum level (ML) for Pb in raw milk established by the EU (0.02 mu g/g wet weight). Animals with increased blood Pb levels showed reduced concentrations of retinol in plasma, but these Pb levels did not affect the cellular immune response. The stimulation of the cellular immune response in lactating goats was associated with an increase in blood Pb and calcium levels. The reproductive status and age of goats significantly affected several oxidative stress, antioxidants and plasma biochemistry variables. Goats grazing on soils contaminated by past Pb mining activities may be susceptible to detrimental health effects mediated by retinol deficiency. In view of the detected transfer of Pb through milk, special attention should be paid to the food safety of derived products (i.e. cheese).

AB  - Poaching is a pervasive threat to wildlife, yet quantifying the direct effect of poaching on wildlife is rarely possible because both wildlife and threat data are infrequently collected concurrently. In this study, we used poaching data collected through the Management Information System (MIST) and wildlife camera trap data collected by the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) network from 2014 to 2017 in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. We implemented co-occurrence multi-season occupancy models that accounted for imperfect detection to investigate the effect of poaching on initial occupancy, colonization, and extinction of five mammal species. Specifically, we focused on two species of conservation concern (mountain gorilla [Gorilla beringei beringei] and golden money [Cercopithecus mitis kandti]), and three species targeted by poachers (black-fronted duiker [Cephalophus nigrifrons], bushbuck [Tragelaphus scriptus], and African buffalo [Syncerus caffer]). We found that the probability of local extinction was highest in sites with poaching activity for golden monkey and bushbuck. In addition, the probability of initial occupancy for golden monkey was highest in sites without poaching activity. We only found weak evidence of effects of poaching on parameters governing the occupancy dynamics of the other species. All species showed evidence of poaching presence affecting the probability of detection of the wildlife species. This is the first study to our knowledge to combine direct threat observations from ranger-based monitoring data with camera trap wildlife observations to quantify the effect of poaching on wildlife. Given the widespread collection of ranger-based monitoring and camera trap data, our approach is broadly applicable to numerous protected areas and has the potential to significantly improve conservation management. Specifically, the relationship between poaching activity and wildlife population dynamics can be combined with information on the relationship between ranger patrols and poaching activity to develop models useful for making wise decisions about ranger patrol deployment.

AB  - Over the past few decades, increasing populations of cervid species in the Baltic region have reduced the quality and vitality of cultivated Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands. This study evaluated the effect of bark stripping on the volume growth of spruce trees in Latvia. Data collection took place in two forest stands. In each stand, 20 Norway spruce trees were sampled, 10 with visible bark damage scars and 10 control trees. Stem discs were collected from control trees at specified heights (0 m, 0.5 m, 1 m, 1.3 m, and 2 m, and then at one-metre intervals up to the top) and from damaged trees at additional specific points relative to the damage. Each disc was sanded and scanned; tree ring widths were measured in 16 radial directions using WinDendro 2012a software. Annual volume growth reconstruction was performed for each tree. Changes in relative volume growth were analysed in interaction with scar parameters, tree type (damaged/control), and pre-damage volume using linear regression models. The significance of parameter interactions was assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means (EMMs) were conducted using Tukey's HSD post hoc test. No significant effect of bark stripping on the total stem volume increment was detected. However, the length of bark stripping scars had a significant impact on relative volume growth in the lower parts of the stems. These findings underscore the importance of further research examining a broader spectrum of cervid damage intensity and the effects of repeated damage on tree survival and growth.

AB  - Exploring and developing new tools for the accounting and management of natural C sinks will provide a closer, more accurate option to remark the importance of such sinks in relation to livestock production, helping to support the persistence of some seriously endangered traditional, environmentally sustainable livestock farming. Following both precision and usability criteria, two main C sink databases covering the Andalusian region (S Spain) were developed from the Spanish Land Parcel Identification System (SIGPAC, coarse resolution) and the Spanish Information System on Land Cover (SIOSE, finer resolution) land use classes. Particular C sink factors based on growth rates for individual plant species were associated with detailed vegetation maps and, further, were linked to Land Use and Covers cartography across the region. In addition, eight ruminant farms were exhaustively studied in situ and used as a control. Results were compared with the obtained through the application of the developed C sink databases, and with the commonly used Petersen methodology. The sink capacity of vegetation associated with farms varied from 0.25 to 1.37 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), depending on the plant species composition and abundance. All the approaches showed significant differences from the control. C sink values were significantly higher when applying SIGPAC-based C sink database to farms, while values from the SIOSE and Petersen methodology approaches provided more moderate values, closer to the control. SIGPAC and Petersen approaches showed higher usability but presented lower precision due to a poor definition of plant cover. SIOSE-based C sink database provided suitable values able to be adapted to reality and used by farmers. In this regard, further research efforts to improve the adjustment of results and ease of use are required. The present approach means a methodological advance in the estimation of the C sink capacity associated with pastoral livestock farms, able to be incorporated into the CF calculation in contrasted areas worldwide, in the frame of the 'eco-schemes' being recently under development through the EU CAP.

AB  - 1. Interactions between herbivores and detritivores are common in greenhouse and laboratory experiments. Such interactions are thought to cause feedbacks in real ecosystems where the combined actions of these animals create either high or low nutrient cycling rates. There is limited evidence from factorial field experiments to support these expectations.
   2. We present the results of a 3-year experiment wherein we factorially manipulated grasshopper herbivores and earthworm detritivores in an old-field ecosystem and tested for significant interaction effects on plants, nitrogen mineralization and micro-organisms. Then, we used a dynamical system model built and parameterized for the study ecosystem to test the theoretical strength of these interactions. We predicted that grasshoppers and earthworms would have a positive interaction effect on plant growth and nitrogen cycling by driving plant community change.
   3. We found neither evidence for interaction effects on any of the variables we measured nor a consistent change in the composition of the plant community even though the individual effects of grasshoppers and earthworms were as expected. Our dynamical system model made the same prediction across a broad section of parameter space (e.g. feeding rates, death rates, etc) and after longer term simulations.
   4. Our results suggest that interactions between herbivores and detritivores are only likely in situ when animals have exceptionally high individual effects on ecosystems and where the exogenous forces driving plant community change and soil biogeochemical fluxes are weak.

AB  - The use of camera-trap methods, though important, has pitfalls and inconsistencies such as factors and interactions that may influence species photo rates. Jaguar (Panthera onca) camera-trap studies place cameras at sites where jaguar detections are likely greater (e.g., sites with previous evidence such tracks, feces, and other presence signs), but do not account for potential placement biases. Our study evaluated methodological implications of a paired camera-trap design at trail and off-trail locations, and climate seasonality, on photo rates of jaguars, their prey, and competitors. From June 2016 to June 2017, camera traps were deployed at 58 different sites in a hexagon grid array of 3 km(2) each in the Sector Santa Rosa (SSR) of area de Conservacion Guancaste in Costa Rica. Half of the cameras were located at a trail location that jaguars were likely to use, and the other half at an off-trail location closest to each hexagon centroid. We estimated a photographic relative abundance index (RAI; no. of independent photos/100 trap nights) and used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to assess statistical evidence of trail location and climate seasonality. With a total effort of 19,408 trap nights, we recorded 12,678 independent photo events of 64 species of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. For the 3 bird species and 14 mammal species we focused on, most species-specific RAIs were greater at trail locations (n = 8 species, including jaguars and pumas [Puma concolor]), some were greater at off-trail locations (n = 2 species, including collared peccaries [Pecari tajacu]), and there was no discernable location effect for others (n = 7 species, including tapirs [Tapirus bairdii] and white-tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus]). For jaguars, sex ratio data showed a smaller proportion of males at off-trail locations. Analysis of competitor and prey interaction data indicated temporal segregation at trail locations. Further jaguar camera-trap studies should highlight camera placement as important source of bias that might influence results; hence, conservationists must be aware of this to avoid erroneous decisions.

AB  - The introduction of numerous exotic dung beetles across southern Australia in regions where native dung beetles are not generally efficient in processing livestock dung has resulted in significant reductions in the quantity of such dung on the soil surface in recent years. However, the direct impacts of such ecosystem services on pasture quality and soil nutrient mobility have not yet been investigated in the Riverina region of New South Wales (NSW), an area recognised for prime cattle and sheep production in Australia. Utilising 48 soil columns for lysimetry, we quantified the impact of a common introduced dung beetle (Bubas bison) in this region on water quality after permeation through four different soil types sown to winter annual pastures. Dung beetle treatments included dung plus dung beetles, dung alone and no dung beetles, and no dung and no beetles as a control. Dung beetles and soil type impacted on the performance of improved overseeded annual pastures as measured by biomass accumulation over a four-month growing season. The four soil types, namely, Chromosol, Kandosol, Rudosol, and Vertosol, differed considerably with respect to their water-holding capacity and nutrient profiles, as assessed by initial soil testing and soil leachate evaluation following rainfall plus simulated rainfall events. The concentration of Escherichia coli resulting from cattle dung, cattle dung plus beetles, and the control soils without dung or beetles was assessed in collected leachates over a three-month period. E. coli numbers were significantly increased following B. bison activity, when compared to the dung-only and control treatments. Evaluation of the soil microbiome, by assessing genomic DNA in soils sampled 10 cm below the soil surface where dung beetles remained active following tunnelling, revealed significant differences among soil types with respect to bacterial and fungal communities. Within each soil type, dung beetle activity impacted the fungal community structure, but not the bacterial community. Pasture performance as assessed by biomass accumulation was significantly improved following dung beetle activity in later stages of pasture growth, while E. coli numbers and total coliforms appeared unaffected by beetle presence.

AB  - The exclusion of grazing has been used extensively in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. Studies, however, have shown reported recent trends of decreasing concentrations of soil nutrients because of grazing exclusion and climate change. The effects of excluding grazing on the soil biogeochemical process of phosphorus cycling in alpine meadows are unclear, especially under climatic warming. We conducted a 5-year grazing-exclusion and warming-manipulation experiment to examine the effects of excluding grazing on fractions of soil phosphorus, microbial and nematode com-munities and enzymatic activities in treatments of low grazing intensity, grazing exclusion, and combined grazing exclusion and warming. Our results indicated that excluding grazing significantly decreased bacterivore and omnivore-predator densities, phoD gene abundance and alkaline phosphomonoesterase activity (in the 0-5 cm layer by -34, -41, -38 and -42 %) at altitudes of 3850 m, 4000 m, 4150 m and 4250 m, respectively. Structural equa-tion modeling indicated that bacterivores positively affected phoD gene abundance, alkaline phosphomonoesterase ac-tivity and inorganic-phosphorus fractions. Combined grazing exclusion and warming significantly decreased bacterivore and omnivore-predator densities but significantly increased fungivore density (in the 0-5 cm layer by 238, 172, 119 and 65 %) at altitudes of 3850, 4000, 4150 and 4250 m, respectively. Structural equation modeling also indicated that the combined grazing-exclusion and warming treatment increased the soil fungi and fungivores, but the higher abundances of fungi and fungivores did not significantly affect acid phosphomonoesterase activity or inorganic-phosphorus fractions. Alternatively, the combined grazing-exclusion and warming treatment significantly increased the concentrations of amorphous and free aluminum, which were positively correlated with the maximum adsorption of phosphorus. The combined grazing-exclusion and warming treatment thus significantly decreased the availability of resin phosphorus (-63, -51, -81 and -67 %) in the 0-5 cm layer at altitudes of 3850, 4000, 4150 and 4250 m, respectively. Our results suggested that light grazing (0.5 yak ha-1 year-1) could increase phospho-rus mineralization and the activity of soil enzymes in alpine meadows under global warming. An adequate load of live-stock pressure at each altitude can be an effective management technique, mainly under warming, to maintain an adequate, sustainable and equilibrated phosphorus cycle in the plant-soil system.

AB  - Compensatory plant growth and plant defense are responses to deal with herbivory and light availability. The research focused on compensatory growth responses explained through the influence of morphological and physiological components of plant growth, allocation mass, and plant defense could clarify such process. We studied the effects of herbivory and gap-openness on compensatory growth responses, morphological and physiological components, allocation mass, and chemical defenses in seedlings of Brosimum alicastrum in a subhumid tropical forest. We used a nested design with understory and gap-openness site (n = 3 each) within each replicated site seedling belong to three herbivory treatments (n = 10 each): control, simulated, and natural; and along six months we studied the influence of leaf herbivory on plant growth (mass, leaf area, height, diameter, and leaf production) and production of phenols and leaf toughness. We recorded compensatory growth responses (all plant growth variables) with natural herbivory, subcompensatory (mass, height, and diameter) with simulated and, overcompensatory (leaf production) with natural herbivory although only under gap-openness. We found a higher leaf area ratio (LAR) and specific leaf area (SLA) (both morphological components) under gap-openness and high values of net assimilation rate (NAR) on understory. The mass proportion was highest in leaves and stems on the understory and higher in roots under gap-openness. Leaf herbivory was highest under gap-openness while the phenols of the leaves on understory. We did not find a relationship (trade-off) between defense with plant growth, but it was possible to underline a negative pattern of the leaf phenols under limiting resources environment such as understory.

AB  - The endangered and declining butterfly species Colias myrmidone is sensitive to land-use changes and vulnerable in its immature stages. The requirements for its larval habitats are still largely unknown, which hinders appropriate management in protected areas. We examined the relation between the larval development of C. myrmidone and environmental variables at a Natura 2000 site in Romania. Individuals that reached higher larval stages had a higher cover of litter as well as a lower cover of forbs around their host plants than individuals that died in early larval stages or as eggs. Surviving individuals had less other host plants in their surrounding and were found on larger host plants. Surviving individuals were found further away from the tip of their hosts than individuals that were lost due to grazing. The grazing regime is of particular importance to ensure the successful development of C. myrmidone from egg to higher larval stages. There seems to be a trade-off between positions at the tip of the shoot with palatable leaves and positions further down that protect against grazing. Especially sheep grazing may cause high direct mortality. The higher amount of litter around surviving larvae indicates a better survival when the grazing pressure is very low, but still present to keep the habitat open. However, occasional heavy grazing events may reduce the cover of forbs. Implications for insect conservation The designation of the investigated Natura 2000 site offers a great opportunity to implement the insights on larval development of C. myrmidone into a management plan, which can support low-intensity grazing regimes preferably with cattle.

AB  - Simple Summary With the implementation of China's ecological projects and related policies, the population of wild boars has rapidly increased, leading to an increased possibility of conflicts with humans. Thus, it is crucial to understand the distribution and habitat selection of wild boars in northwest China for the control and management of this species. This study used the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to analyze the potential distribution areas of wild boars in the northwest region under the current environmental conditions and compare changes in land use in their habitats over time. The findings revealed that wild boars prefer habitats dominated by cultivated land, woodland, and grassland. Precipitation seasonality, elevation, and human footprint index were identified as the main environmental factors influencing their habitat selection. These findings indicate that wild boar habitat selection results from comprehensive consideration of the environment, providing a theoretical reference for guiding ecological prevention measures and population management strategies for wild boars in the northwestern region.Abstract With the implementation of ecological engineering projects and related policies in China, wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations have surged, leading to increasingly serious conflicts with humans. We evaluated their potential habitat changes from the perspective of environmental suitability. To elucidate the suitable habitat characteristics for wild boars, we obtained data from 79 sites in five provinces in northwest China using database retrieval, human-wildlife conflict (HWC) incident questionnaires, and document retrieval. Thus, 10 environmental variables with lower correlation were selected, and potentially suitable distribution areas for wild boars under the current climate scenario were predicted based on the maximum entropy model. These areas were superimposed with different land use types in different periods to explore habitat selection. Precipitation seasonality (26.40%), human footprint index (16.50%), and elevation (11.90%) were the main environmental factors affecting wild boar distribution. The areas with high potential suitability for wild boars were mainly in the southeast and northwest of the region (total area of 2.63 x 105 km2). The land use types in the high-suitability zones are mainly woodland and grassland with high coverage, canopy density, and cultivated land borders. This study provides a reference for the effective prevention of HWC and management of wild boars.

AB  - Serows and gorals (Bovidae, Caprinae) are emblematic antelopes distributed in Southeast Asia. They all are nearly threaten or vulnerable species nowadays despite having a more widespread distribution during the Pleistocene. Fossils of three native caprine species, i.e., a Sumatran serow Capricornis sumatraensis, Chinese goral Naemorhedus griseus, and Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral, were recovered from four Pleistocene paleontological and archeological sites in Thailand, namely Pha Bong, Khok Sung, Tham Wiman Nakin, and Tham Lod Rockshelter. To investigate dietary changes of these Southeast Asian serows and gorals through the Quaternary, differences in feeding habits and habitat preferences between the Pleistocene and extant populations were examined using the hypsodonty index (HI) together with the mesowear II method and the dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA). The HI and mesowear-II results showed that Pleistocene and extant caprines were mixed feeders. For the Pleistocene caprine populations, the DMTA results suggested more browsing signals for C. sumatraensis than both Naemorhedus species that were mixed feeders similar to their extant populations. The DMTA demonstrated a considerable dietary overlap among the Pleistocene sympatric caprine populations. The dental microwear results also revealed that the extant C. sumatraensis is a leaf-dominant browser, while the extant N. griseus possibly feeds on seeds or tough food items. These data combined with previous stable carbon isotope analyses reinforce the idea that the restricted ranges of habitats for these extant serow and goral populations have possibly been driven by the Holocene climatic and environmental changes as well as the negative effects of human activities.

AB  - Insular populations of mammals have been shown to undergo drastic morphological changes relative to mainland counterparts, and these adaptations can provide insight into the evolutionary effects of predation and competition. Selection has been shown to favor more energetically efficient body plans in insular mammals, even when this entails the reduction of anti-predator defenses, but few studies have focused on morphological effects within the same species. Previous research has established that insular large mammals tend to reduce in body size, and that size reduction may not scale isometrically across all body parts. The brain has been a particular subject of interest due to its high energy requirements. Here, we report that an extant, dwarfed island population of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) exhibits significantly reduced brain mass relative to body mass in comparison to their mainland conspecifics, with brain mass 4.9% smaller in the island population for a given body mass. Further, in the dwarfed population, orbital area was 4.1% smaller for a given body mass, but this reduction was not significant. Foramina magna reduced isometrically. In resource-limited insular environments, negative allometry of the brain is consistent with predictions of reduced investment in energetically costly organs. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine the morphological effects of insularity on brain size in two conspecific populations, and these findings suggest that selection toward reduced brain size may act relatively quickly after isolation.

AB  - The spread of the African swine fever through wild boar population has caused major losses in the pig industry. Therefore, to decrease the population density of wild boar in Poland, the culling of these animals has been dramatically increased. However, the effect of depopulation is unknown because there are no methods that could be used throughout the country to estimate the number of wild boar. Thus, during two hunting seasons an attempt was made to estimate the number of wild boar using data from collective hunts. The forested area of 21 hunting districts (351.5 km(2)) was divided into five sampling inventory blocks (SIBs), which were used for the statistical analysis of the population density, the harvest rate and results of collective hunts. The average population density obtained by a driving census amounted to 8.19 +/- 1.12 and 10.09 +/- 1.06 ((x) over bar +/- SE), animals/km(2), which indicates that 2879 and 3547 wild boar were living in the study area in 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons respectively. The number of wild boars bagged per one hunting plot was adopted as the harvest success index (HBI). In SIBs the HBI value fluctuated in the range of 0.55 to 1.87 individuals/hunting plot and the population density ranged from 6.46 to 12.18 wild boars/km(2). The non-linear regression showed a positive relationship between the HBI index and the population density. The discussion covers the possibility of using collective hunts to estimate the number of wild boar in Poland and in the European Union.

AB  - Chemical reversal from acidification has been progressing in European freshwaters since the late 1980s, responding to successful control of atmospheric pollution by acidifying emissions. However, biological recovery is often delayed after improvements in water composition. We studied macroinvertebrate recovery from acidification in eight glacial lakes in the Bohemian Forest (central Europe) between 1999 and 2019. The chemical composition of these lakes reflects a complex of environmental changes, dominated by a very steep decline in acid deposition and, currently, by elevated nutrient leaching following climate-induced tree dieback within their catchments. Temporal trends in species richness, abundance, species traits and community composition were evaluated with regard to water chemistry, littoral habitat properties and fish colonisation. The results showed accelerated recovery of macroinvertebrates following two decades of gradual improvement in water composition and slowly progressing biological rehabilitation. We observed a signif-icant increase in macroinvertebrate species richness and abundance, coupled with distinct changes in community com-position, the extent of changes varying between lakes, reflecting different littoral habitat properties (vegetated vs. stony) and water chemistry. Overall, the communities shifted toward more specialised (grazers, filterers, and phytophilous species) and acid-tolerant taxa at the expense of detritivorous, eurytopic and acid-resistant taxa. Where fish reappeared, open-water taxa declined greatly. Compositional changes were likely driven by the combined effects of water chemistry reversal, rehabilitation of habitat conditions and fish colonisation. Despite favourable trends, communities in recovering lakes still lack several biotic elements, particularly less vagile, acid-sensitive taxa and specialised herbivores known from the regional species pool. It is expected that future progress in lake recovery will be further promoted or inhibited by stochastic colonisation or disturbance events.

AB  - Context. Distribution and abundance of the three northern Australian tree-rat species, Conilurus penicillatus, Mesembriomys macrurus and M. gouldii, have contracted significantly since European settlement. All three species were recorded from the Mitchell Plateau, Western Australia, in the 1980s, enabling their niche separation to be assessed. Despite this study being conducted in 1987, the results remain relevant for conservation strategies for these species. Aims. To determine the ecological separation among three tropical tree-rat species by documenting habitat preferences, habitat use and diet. Methods Live-trapping, radiotracking and spotlighting were used to assess relative abundance, habitat preference and movements of each species at nine sites on the Mitchell Plateau. Diet was determined using scat analysis; vegetation communities were described and characterised by pattern analysis. Key results. C. penicillatus (number of individuals trapped (n) = 24) was most abundant, followed by M. macrurus (n = 8) and M. gouldii (n = 2). Mature open forest with a well-developed understorey was preferred by the predominantly arboreal M. gouldii (1 site), M. macrurus occupied more varied habitats (four sites), especially ecotones between vine thicket and open eucalypt forest and the boulder edges of the plateau, and C. penicillatus occupied the greatest variety of habitats (four sites) in open eucalypt woodland with a diverse shrub layer and ground cover almost absent to very dense, tall grass. Diet analysis identified M. gouldii as a frugivore (fruits, some flowers), M. macrurus as an omnivore (seeds, fruits, flowers, termites, other invertebrates), and C. penicillatus as a generalist (monocot and dicot leaves, seeds, flowers, fruits, some arthropods). Conclusions. The largest of the species, M. gouldii, appeared to have the narrowest ecological niche, preferring more stable, structurally diverse, mature open forest that is infrequently burnt. The mid-sized M. macrurus occupies a broader range of habitats, particularly ecotones between vine thickets and eucalypt forest/woodland and woodland. C. penicillatus preferred open eucalypt woodland with a variable understorey. Implications. With a changing climate, increased fire frequency, habitat degradation by introduced herbivores and predation by cats across the tropical savanna distribution of these threatened tree-rats, this study provides data to underpin actions that may ensure their survival.

AB  - Simple Summary In Australia, feral cats (Felis catus) have been a ubiquitous threatening process to Australian fauna since European colonisation. There is a concern that irrigating land on pastoral leases and storing agricultural produce may indirectly increase the abundance of feral cats and European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), which in turn may negatively impact native species such as the threatened bilbies (Macrotis lagotis). Our baseline study on a pastoral lease in the arid subtropics of Western Australia revealed a high density of feral cats with dietary data that suggests the current native mammal assemblage on the lease is depauperate. Environmental damage caused by the intensification of agriculture may be compensated by implementing conservation projects directed towards reducing threatening processes and conserving threatened native species. In Australia, feral cats (Felis catus) have been a ubiquitous threatening process to Australian fauna since European colonisation. On Shamrock Station, in the north-west of Western Australia, the Argyle Cattle Company has proposed intensifying agriculture through the installation of irrigation pivots. There is concern that irrigating land and storing agricultural produce may indirectly increase the abundance of feral cats and European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on the property, which in turn may negatively impact threatened bilbies (Macrotis lagotis) that also inhabit the property. Feral cat control is required under the approved management plan for this project to mitigate this potential impact. Our baseline study revealed a high density of feral cats on Shamrock Station (0.87 cats km(-2)) and dietary data that suggest the current native mammal assemblage on Shamrock Station is depauperate. Given the high density of feral cats in this area, the effective control of this introduced predator is likely to confer benefits to the bilby and other native species susceptible to cat predation. We recommend ongoing monitoring of both native species and feral cats to determine if there is a benefit in implementing feral cat control around areas of intensive agriculture and associated cattle production.

AB  - The Bay of La Paz (BLP) is located in the southwestern portion of the Gulf of California (GC), the largest and deepest coastal environment along the gulf. The BLP is recognized for its high biological diversity and is a place of refuge, growth, and feeding for several emblematic species, some of which are critically endangered. However, what makes the BLP productive? This paper presents a synthesis and review of the physical processes and mechanisms related to planktonic production, which are directly linked to productivity at higher trophic levels, including top predators. This review reveals that the BLP has a high richness and abundance of plankton species. Several hydrodynamic processes at different scales exert a marked influence on these organisms, including internal waves, hydraulic jumps, thermohaline fronts, the presence of a dipole eddy, and a quasi-permanent cyclonic eddy that is confined to the bay, which induces Ekman pumping that determines the availability of nutrients in the euphotic zone. This eddy induces a differential phytoplankton distribution, with a predominance of dinoflagellates in its center and the dominance of diatoms in its periphery. This arrangement is closely linked to that of zooplankton. Herbivorous zooplankton are highly abundant in the periphery of the eddy, while omnivorous zooplankton are dominant in the center. In contrast, carnivorous zooplankton are dominant in the GC. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the dynamics of the BLP over the last two decades, gaps remain unaddressed. This review highlights the areas of opportunity to continue advancing this endeavor, achieve a better scientific understanding of the region, and propose better management and conservation plans for this highly diverse area.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in growth and defence among plant populations can be driven by differences in (a)biotic conditions, such as herbivory and resources. Introduction of species to novel environments affects simultaneously herbivory encountered by a plant and resource availability both directly and via altered competitive environment. Here, we address the question of how growth (leaf mass per area (LMA), plant size) and resistance traits (leaf alkaloids, leaf trichomes, resistance to a generalist snail) vary and covary between native and introduced populations of the garden lupine, Lupinus polyphyllus. We focused specifically on evolved differences among populations by measuring traits from plants grown from seed in a common environment. Plants from the introduced populations were more resistant against the generalist snail, Arianta arbustorum, and they had more leaf trichomes and higher LMA than plants from the native populations. The composition of alkaloids differed between native and introduced populations, with the native populations having more diversity in alkaloids among them. Resistance was positively associated with plant size and LMA across all populations. Other trait associations differed between native and introduced areas, implying that certain trade-offs may be fundamentally different between native and introduced populations. Our results suggest that, for the introduced populations, the loss of native herbivores and the alterations in resource availability have led to a lower diversity in leaf alkaloids among populations and may facilitate the evolution of novel trait optima without compensatory trade-offs. Such phytochemical similarity among introduced populations provides novel insights into mechanisms promoting successful plant invasions.

AB  - Effects of invasive exotic plants on plant communities are often profound, but interactions with higher trophic levels are less evident. Postulated effects of invasive plants on arthropods include increased abundances of herbivores through refuge and improved microclimate, facilitation of other exotic species, and altered arthropod diversity. We examined the impact on the arthropod community by Lespedeza cuneata, an exotic legume with dense, chemically defended foliage, by comparing arthropod numbers in unmanipulated 1-m(2) plots with L. cuneata shoots (= control) to arthropod numbers in plots from which shoots of L. cuneata were removed. Lespedeza cuneata removal produced no overall effect on arthropod abundance, but an invasive herbivore, Popillia japonica (Japanese Beetle), was twice as abundant in plots with L. cuneata. Lespedeza cuneata removal increased arthropod evenness in May then decreased it through the summer. In a second experiment we quantified chewing herbivory by placing individual potted plants from five native prairie species and L. cuneata within these same removal/no removal plots for 4 weeks. Removal of L. cuneata shoots from plots did not significantly affect herbivory of tagged leaves from the native species. However, entire L. cuneata leaves or plants disappeared more frequently regardless of plot treatment. Invasion by this exotic legume is likely due to direct effects on native plants, but indirect effects through facilitation of an exotic herbivore could contribute to its success in some areas.

AB  - Anthracotheres and entelodonts are large mammals with peculiar morphological characteristics that combine plesiomorphic and derived features. The unusual anatomy of anthracotheres shows a morphological resemblance to pigs and hippos and their bunoselenodont low-crowned molars have been interpreted as an adaptation to frugivorous/folivorous diets. Entelodonts share cranial and dental similarities to pigs and carnivores, and this has been interpreted as an adaption to opportunistic omnivore diets, hunting/scavenging, or bone-crushing (cf. hyenas). The objective of the present study is to use dental microwear analysis to test these assumptions and to infer the diet of anthracotheres and entelodonts. Dental microwear was quantified on the upper and lower molars using a stereomicroscope. To assess the dietary traits of the fossil samples, the results were compared to a dataset of extant large mammals covering ten dietary categories. The microwear features indicate different diets for Anthracotherium sp. and Entelodon magnus. Our sample of entelodonts shows an omnivorous diet similar to that of the wild boar, and it probably varied considerably between seasons. The anthracotheres we analysed were opportunistic browsing, frugivore, and grazing herbivores. During the Oligocene, these two taxa occupied ecological niches characterised by a large diversity of food resources. The results of the study offer further in-sights into the characteristics of the digestive system in fossil artiodactyls. The large dataset used in this research opens new perspectives for the dietary reconstruction of poorly known mammal taxa by considering a wide range of diets.

AB  - Wild sheep (Ovis spp.) are of conservation concern throughout the Middle East. Little is known, however, about the natural history or ecology of this taxon. To better understand size relationships among wild sheep occupying Iran, we analyzed results from 120 females collected from widely separated ecosystems. Morphometrics and body weights for all age categories of females occupying the Khosh-Yeilagh Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Iran were larger than those for the same age classes of females occupying Bamou National Park in southwestern Iran. Females from Bamou National Park, however, obtained adult body weight (x? = 25.8 +/- 2.47 [SD] kg) at an earlier age than those from the Khosh-Yeilagh Wildlife Refuge (x? = 36.6 +/- 3.21 kg). Ecological differences between these two areas suggest that net primary productivity, which is a function of numerous climatic and geographical factors, has been a primary force contributing to these results. Weights and measurements reported here provide the basic information for additional, more detailed research necessary to fully understand the evolutionary significance and management implications of these differences in body size and emphasize the conservation value of even the most basic natural history information.

AB  - A study was carried out to characterize the hard tick species and risk factors associated with tick prevalence in bovines in Andhra Pradesh, India on 3720 animals (1942 cattle and 1778 water buffaloes) in 344 livestock farms covering the tropical wet and dry zone and the tropical semi-arid zone . Overall, 10,371 ticks were collected from 947 animals reared on 216 farms. Analysis of morphology, 16S r RNA, andCOI gene sequences identified four tick species, namely Haemaphysalis bispinosa, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (clade C), Hyalomma anatolicum, and Hyalomma isaaci. Haemaphysalis bispinosa was the predominant species in two zones, and the occurrence of Hy. anatolicum was restricted to the semi-arid zone. The overall prevalence of tick infestation was 25.5% and was 25.8% and 25.0% in cattle and buffaloes, respectively. The prevalence of tick infestation did not vary (P>0.05) between the two zones. The overall median tick burden per animal differed (P<0.01) between the two zones; but not among cattle and buffaloes. Age, sex, and breed (P<0.001) the overall prevalence of tick infestation. The conventional housing system, absence of rural poultry, soft floor, presence of a boundary wall, and rearing multiple ruminant species were observed to be potential risk factors associated with higher tick prevalence in livestock farms.

AB  - Perennial flower strips on high-yield soils may lose most of their flowering aspect during aging. This creates a dilemma, referred to herein as flower strip dilemma (FSD): On the one hand the number of pollinating and non-pollinating insects increases during the short-term aging of flower strips, on the other hand, perennial flower strips of a certain age often become grass dominated and are therefore less attractive to many species. Thus, the question arises when there is the most appropriate time to create a new flowering strip to support as many species as possible. To find a way out of the described dilemma, we focused on carabid beetles in two different aged types of flower strips. Many ground beetle species (carabids) are important pest antagonists in intensively cultivated farmland and can be promoted by flower strips. The creation of combined wildflower strips, consisting of wildflower strips of different ages, might be a measure to compensate the loss of species richness and abundance during flower strip aging. To study the impact of combined wildflower strips on non-pollinating insects, we recorded carabid beetles as a model guild in one-and three-year-old wildflower strips as well as in combined wildflower strips, and examined the results regarding species richness, abundance and functional traits. We show that combined wildflower strips increase the richness of carabid beetle species significantly beyond simple aging effects. Furthermore, the dominating functional traits of carabids differ with the type of flower strip: In combined wildflower strips significantly more macropteric and herbivorous carabid species were found, as well as carabids with imaginal hibernation. The study shows that the creation of combined wildflower strips can increase species richness in carabids by buffering possible negative effects in either young or old flower strips regarding their specific attractiveness for different species or guilds respectively. As a recommendation, farmers should create at least part of their flower strips in combination, so that a greater effect on increasing biodiversity can be achieved. Further investigations should make suggestions for how long a flower strip should exist according to different taxa to make the problem of the FSD more visible.

AB  - We analyzed harvest data to test hypotheses that nearly 4 decades of effort to reduce abundance of brown bears (Ursus arctos), black bears (U. americanus) and gray wolves (Canis lupus) in an 60,542 km(2) area in south-central Alaska (Game Management Unit [GMU] 13) was positively correlated with moose (Alces alces) harvests in some time-lagged fashion. Predator-reduction efforts were progressively more aggressive over decades (both de facto and officially designated predator control) and did not have clear starting points which complicated our post hoc analyses. We documented no positive correlations (p > 0.05) between harvests of brown and black bears and subsequent moose harvests for any time lag. Moose harvest was negatively correlated with the previous years' wolf harvest, but the relationship was weak (correlation = -0.33, p < 0.05). Consequently, we reject our hypotheses that harvest of predators was positively correlated with moose harvests. We also observed no differences in mean moose harvests during periods of officially designated wolf control (2005-2020) and a previous period (p > 0.50). We recommend that predator reductions designed to improve hunter harvests of moose be conducted within a research framework that will permit improved interpretations of results and the implementation of an adaptive-management approach to achieve management objectives.

AB  - Assessing and reconstructing the impacts of defoliation caused by insect herbivores on tree growth, carbon budget and water use, and differentiating these impacts from other stresses and disturbances such as droughts requires multi-proxy approaches. Here we present a methodological framework to pinpoint the impacts of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), a major winter-feeding defoliator, on tree cover (remote-sensing indices), radial growth and wood features (anatomy, density, lignin/carbohydrate ratio of cell walls, delta C-13 and delta O-18 of wood cellulose) of drought-prone pine (Pinus nigra) forests in north-eastern Spain. We compared host defoliated (D) and coexisting non-defoliated (ND) pines along with non-host oaks (Quercus faginea) following a strong insect outbreak occurring in 2016 at two climatically contrasting sites (cool-wet Huesca and warm-dry Teruel). Changes in tree-ring width and wood density were analyzed and their responses to climate variables (including a drought index) were compared between D and ND trees. The Normalized Difference Infrared Index showed reductions due to the outbreak of -47.3% and -55.6% in Huesca and Teruel, respectively. The D pines showed: a strong drop in growth (-96.3% on average), a reduction in tracheid lumen diameter (-35.0%) and lower lignin/carbohydrate ratios of tracheid cell-walls. Both pines and oaks showed synchronous growth reductions during dry years. In the wet Huesca site, lower wood delta C-13 values and a stronger coupling between delta C-13 and delta O-18 were observed in D as compared with ND pines. In the dry Teruel site, the minimum wood density of ND pines responded more negatively to spring drought than that of D pines. We argue that multi-proxy assessments that combine several variables have the potential to improve our ability to pinpoint and reconstruct insect outbreaks using tree-ring data.

AB  - While long-term vegetation greening trends have appeared across large land areas over the late 20th century, uncertainty remains in identifying and attributing finer-scale vegetation changes and trends, particularly across protected areas. Serengeti National Park (SNP) is a critical East African protected area, where seasonal vegetation cycles support vast populations of grazing herbivores and a host of ecosystem dynamics. Previous work has shown how non-climate drivers (e.g. land use) shape the SNP ecosystem, but it is still unclear to what extent changing climate conditions influence SNP vegetation, particularly at finer spatial and temporal scales. We fill this research gap by evaluating long-term (1982-2016) changes in SNP leaf area index (LAI) in relation to both temperature and moisture availability using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis with regression techniques. We find that SNP LAI trends are nonlinear, display high sub-seasonal variation, and are influenced by lagged changes in both moisture and temperature variables and their interactions. LAI during the long rains (e.g. March) exhibits a greening-to-browning trend reversal starting in the early 2000s, partly due to antecedent precipitation declines. In contrast, LAI during the short rains (e.g. November, December) displays browning-to-greening alongside increasing moisture availability. Rising temperature trends also have important, secondary interactions with moisture variables to shape these SNP vegetation trends. Our findings show complex vegetation-climate interactions occurring at important temporal and spatial scales of the SNP, and our rigorous statistical approaches detect these complex climate-vegetation trends and interactions, while guarding against spurious vegetation signals.

AB  - The cross-species characterization of evolutionary changes in the functional genome can facilitate the translation of genetic findings across species and the interpretation of the evolutionary basis underlying complex phenotypes. Yet, this has not been fully explored between cattle, sheep, goats, and other mammals. Here, we systematically characterized the evolutionary dynamics of DNA methylation and gene expression in 3 somatic tissues (i.e. brain, liver, and skeletal muscle) and sperm across 7 mammalian species, including 3 ruminant livestock species (cattle, sheep, and goats), humans, pigs, mice, and dogs, by generating and integrating 160 DNA methylation and transcriptomic data sets. We demonstrate dynamic changes of DNA hypomethylated regions and hypermethylated regions in tissue-type manner across cattle, sheep, and goats. Specifically, based on the phylo-epigenetic model of DNA methylome, we identified a total of 25,074 hypomethylated region extension events specific to cattle, which participated in rewiring tissue-specific regulatory network. Furthermore, by integrating genome-wide association studies of 50 cattle traits, we provided novel insights into the genetic and evolutionary basis of complex phenotypes in cattle. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for exploring the evolutionary dynamics of the functional genome and highlights the importance of cross-species characterization of multiomics data sets for the evolutionary interpretation of complex phenotypes in cattle livestock.

AB  - Max Egon Thiel worked as curator of the aquatic invertebrates collection at the Zoological Museum in Hamburg until 1963. Specialising in marine planktonic megafauna, he compiled a broad review of the research history on the Scyphozoa (Coronatae, Cubomedusae, Semaeostomeae) including the Staurozoa (as Stauromedusae), written in German. After publishing major parts in 1936 and 1938, World War II delayed further chapters until 1959 and 1962. A complete bibliography covering references up to 1970 was not printed until 1977. The final section on the taxon Rhizostomeae was completed as a typescript before his death, but was never published. In the present paper, the authors provide a synopsis of the published volumes in English. Following Thiel's original outline, the research history, as well as reviews of the current knowledge at the time about morphology, histology, ontogeny (life cycle), physiology, ecology, and phylogeny of the taxa are presented. The paper is complemented by two electronic supplements: A translated and revised version of the left-behind typescript of Max Egon Thiel about the taxon Rhizostomeae, and the revised digital list of references published in Thiel (1977).

AB  - Simple Summary Hunting can have direct effects (i.e., mortality) and indirect effects (i.e., behavior changes, such as shifting away from foraging areas to circumvent risk from hunters) on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Deer populations within the Chattahoochee National Forest of northern Georgia, USA, have declined significantly since the 1980s. Since deer population sustainability is a concern, understanding the potential negative effects of hunting on female deer is important. During the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 hunting seasons, we evaluated the indirect effects of 7 firearms hunts for male deer on 20 non-target female deer. We used GPS locations recorded every 30 min during pre-hunt, hunt, and post-hunt periods to calculate and compare movement rates during the day and night, as well as the size and landscape characteristics of the space the deer utilized. Our results suggest that the low level of hunting pressure in our study area led to no biologically significant changes in female deer movements. To the extent of the findings presented in this paper, adjustments to the management of hunting in our study area do not appear to be necessary to minimize hunting-related disturbances for female deer. However, managers should continue to consider female deer behavior when evaluating future changes to hunting regulations.Abstract Perceived risk associated with hunters can cause white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to shift their activity away from key foraging areas or alter normal movements, which are important considerations in managing hunting and its effects on a population. We studied the effects of seven firearms hunts on the movements of 20 female deer in two Wildlife Management Areas within the Chattahoochee National Forest of northern Georgia, USA, during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 hunting seasons. Deer populations and the number of hunters in our study area have declined significantly since the 1980s. In response, hunting regulations for the 2019-2020 hunting season eliminated opportunities for harvesting female deer. To evaluate the indirect effects of antlered deer hunting on non-target female deer, we calculated 90% utilization distributions (UDs), 50% UDs, and step lengths for pre-hunt, hunt, and post-hunt periods using the dynamic Brownian bridge movement model. Data included 30 min GPS locations for 44 deer-hunt combinations. Pre-hunt 50% UDs (x- = 7.0 ha, SE = 0.4 ha) were slightly greater than both hunt (x- = 6.0 ha, SE = 0.3 ha) and post-hunt (x- = 6.0 ha, SE = 0.2 ha) 50% UDs (F = 3.84, p = 0.03). We did not detect differences in step length, nor did we detect differences in size or composition of 90% UDs, among the periods. Overall, our results suggest that the low level of hunting pressure in our study area and lack of exposure to hunters led to no biologically significant changes in female deer movements. To the extent of the findings presented in this paper, adjustments to the management of hunting in our study area do not appear to be necessary to minimize hunting-related disturbances for female deer. However, managers should continue to consider female deer behavior when evaluating future changes to hunting regulations.

AB  - Simple Summary The Xuwen coral reef, as a potential refuge for corals to adapt to high-temperature migration, is an ideal "laboratory" to determine the impact of human activities on coral reef ecology in the northern South China Sea (NSCS). Global warming, coastal eutrophication and the decrease in herbivores has influenced coral reef degradation; compared with human activities, global climate change is the stronger influence on coral reef degradation on a large scale. For the Xuwen coral reef, which is in the coastal zone, anthropogenic stressors are more significant to the rapid degradation of its coral reef ecosystems. Under these circumstances, more evidence is required to understand the response of high-latitude reefs under natural and anthropogenic stresses. In this study, we investigated the ecological features of the scleractinian coral assemblage and their correlation with environmental factors on the Xuwen coral reef in 2020. Based on the data acquired by investigation and the implementation of statistical analysis methods, potential environmental conditions favoring coral communities in Xuwen were summarized. These results of the survey are expected to provide a basis for bridging the gap between economic development and sustainable management. Taking the coral communities of the Xuwen coral reef in 2020 as the research object, we analyzed the species composition, diversity, and interspecific Spearman correlation of the scleractinian coral communities, investigated the features and spatial distribution of the scleractinian coral community, and discussed the correlation between the community composition and environmental factors to identify the affecting factors and their sources. These results showed that (1) compared with the survey in 2004, the coverage of corals in 2020 had significantly decreased, while the dominant genera were still Goniopora and Porites. The coral morphology was massive, and the diversity of the coral community (Shannon-Wiener index, H') was 2.87. The distribution of coral was uneven. The competition among some dominant species of coral was intense. (2) The mass coral bleaching event in the NSCS in August 2020 did not cause severe coral death in the short term on the Xuwen coral reef. (3) The growth of the coral community in 2020 might be greatly affected by high suspended solids and nutrient levels, which were related to the current, mariculture, and coastal erosion. (4) Anthropogenic activities such as coastal aquaculture and fishing were the major factors leading to the reduction in coral coverage on Xuwen coral reef in the past 10 years.

AB  - Ecological phenomena operate at different spatial scales and are not uniform across landscapes or through time. One ecological theory that attempts to account for scaling and spatiotemporal variances is hierarchical patch dynamics. It introduces a hierarchical patch network with smaller spatiotemporal scales being nested within larger scales. However, few studies have modeled its presence within animal population dynamics. Locusts are an excellent model for investigating the spatiotemporal hierarchy of animal population dynamics, due to their high migratory capacity, large geographic ranges that extend across widely differing environments, and available long-term data on distributions. Here, we investigated the influence of preceding vegetation growth on desert locust Schistocerca gregaria and Australian plague locust Chortoicetes terminifera outbreaks on three spatial levels (species range > geographic region > land unit) and between seasons. Both species are dryland herbivores with population dynamics linked to habitat productivity pulses after rain. We used NDVI data (MODIS imagery) as a measure of vegetation growth in hierarchical generalized additive models at different scales. Locust outbreaks were either preceded by vegetation growth between 78 and 32 days (Australian plague locusts) or 32 and 20 days before (desert locust) the observation. Although prior vegetation growth characterized outbreaks of both species, the temporal pattern of NDVI differed between spatiotemporal levels. All model selection criteria selected for a similar spatial hierarchy for both species: geographic region > land unit which supports the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm. Further, it illuminates important timing differences between geographic regions and land units for preceding vegetation growth and locust outbreaks which can help locust managers identify when and where outbreaks occur. By acknowledging the spatiotemporal patterning of locust abundance, we account for heterogeneity of population dynamics throughout species ranges. Our findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating spatiotemporal variation in population models of insects and other animals.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewApproximately 40 years ago, key papers indicating that volatile chemicals released by damaged plants elicited defense-related changes in their neighbors, brought prominence to the idea of plant communication. These studies were conducted with several tree species and the phenomenon observed was dubbed "talking trees. " Today there is a wealth of evidence supporting the idea that plants can send and receive information both above and belowground. However, while early reports of plant-plant communication concerned trees, the literature is now heavily biased towards herbaceous plants. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent research on tree-tree communication with an emphasis on synthesizing knowledge on the ecological relevance of the process.Recent FindingsAboveground, information is often provided in the form of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are released by both undamaged and damaged plants. The blends of VOCs released by plants provide information on their physiological condition. Belowground, information is conveyed through mycorrhizal networks and via VOCs and chemical exudates released into the rhizosphere. Recent findings have indicated a sophistication to tree communication with more effective VOC-mediated interactions between trees of the same versus a different genotype, kin-group, or chemotype. Moreover, common mycorrhizal networks have been shown to convey stress-related signals in intra- and interspecific associations. Together these two forms of communication represent "wireless " and "wired " channels with significance to facilitating plant resistance to herbivores.In this review, we examine tree-tree communication with a focus on research in natural forest ecosystems. We particularly address the effects of tree-tree communication on interactions with herbivorous insects. Aboveground and belowground interactions are both reviewed and suggested implications for forest management and future research are presented.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is the most widely distributed large wildlife mammal worldwide. To investigate the transmission of Salmonella enterica amongst wild boars (Sus scrofa), humans, and livestock, we compared via pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and whole genome sequences the isolates of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (biphasic and monophasic variants) and Enteritidis collected from wild boars, food-producing animals, and human patients in Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy) between 2017 and 2020. Specifically, we analysed 2175 isolates originated from human (1832), swine (117), bovine (128), poultry (76), and wild boar (22).The genomic analyses showed that wild boars shared most of their lineages of biphasic Typhimurium with bovines and most of Enteritidis with poultry, whilst we did not find any lineage shared with swine. Moreover, almost 17% of human biphasic Typhimurium and Enteritidis belonged to genomic clusters including wild boar isolates, but the inclusion of bovine and poultry isolates in the same clusters and the peculiar spatial distribution of the isolates suggested that human cases (and wild boar infections) likely originated from bovines and poultry. Consequently, wild boars appear not to play a significant role in infecting humans with these serovars, but seem to get infected themselves from livestock, probably through the environment.

AB  - Abundance estimation is frequently an objective of conservation and monitoring initiatives for threatened and other managed populations. While abundance estimation via capture-mark-recapture or spatially explicit capture-recapture is now common, such approaches are logistically challenging and expensive for species such as boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus), which inhabit remote regions, are widely dispersed, and exist at low densities. Fortunately, the recently developed 'close-kin mark-recapture' (CKMR) framework, which uses the number of kin pairs obtained within a sample to generate an abundance estimate, eliminates the need for multiple sampling events. As a result, some caribou managers are interested in using this method to generate an abundance estimate from a single, non-invasive sampling event for caribou populations. We conducted a simulation study using realistic boreal caribou demographic rates and population sizes to assess how population size and the proportion of the population surveyed impact the accuracy and precision of single-survey CKMR-based abundance estimates. Our results indicated that abundance estimates were biased and highly imprecise when very small proportions of the population were sampled, regardless of the population size. However, the larger the population size, the smaller the required proportion of the population surveyed to generate both accurate and reasonably precise estimates. Additionally, we also present a case study in which we used the CKMR framework to generate annual female abundance estimates for a small caribou population in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada, from 2006 to 2015 and compared them to existing published capture-mark-recapture-based estimates. Both the accuracy and precision of the annual CKMR-based abundance estimates varied across years and were sensitive to the proportion of pairwise kinship comparisons which yielded a mother-offspring pair. Taken together, our study demonstrates that it is possible to generate CKMR-based abundance estimates from a single sampling event for small caribou populations, so long as a sufficient sampling intensity can be achieved.

AB  - Hybridization between domestic pigs and wild boars of unknown origins has disrupted the precious gene pool of Vietnamese wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations in the Central Highlands. However, the genetic background of Vietnamese wild boars remains largely unknown. This study describes the complete mitochondrial genome of the Vietnamese Central Highland wild boar, a circular molecule comprising 16,581 base pairs (bp). The mitogenome contains 37 genes, which encode for 2 ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and 13 mitochondrial proteins. It has a conserved gene order, gene orientation, and similar nucleotide composition indexes to other boars and pig breeds across the world. Notably, 232 nucleotide substitutions were detected when comparing this genome with 19 previously described Sus scrofa genomes. Partial cytochrome b gene analysis revealed the distribution of Asian haplotypes in the Vietnamese Central Highland Sus scrofa. A phylogenetic tree constructed from 32 Sus scrofa's whole mitogenome sequences demonstrated the close relationship between Vietnamese wild boars and domestic pig breeds. The study provides additional insights into the genetics of Vietnamese wild boars, paving the way for future research in conservation, evolution, and breeding of Vietnamese wild boar populations.

AB  - Environmental changes caused by fires in forest ecosystems can hinder reforestation processes, since it is necessary to have a cover that provides lateral protection. One solution to this problem has been the incorporation of tree shelter; however, there is evidence both for and against their use. The objectives of this study are to compare the initial performance (in terms of survival, growth and browsing) in Nothofagus pumilio plantations with and without the use of tree shelters in Torres del Paine National Park and to evaluate associated costs and operational yields involved in the use of this protections. Survival, growth and browsing variables were measured for 194 experimental units in three sectors of the park. The findings show that after four years, there are significant differences in survival and growth, being higher for plants with shelter. Browsing was also less likely under protected conditions. However, planting management and operational costs related to protections showed 51,6% additional costs and 14% loss of protections aesthetically affecting natural areas of the park. In consideration of the above, we conclude that the use of tree shelter favors a better performance in N. pumilio, however, we recommend that for a sustainable management of restoration actions, especially within wild areas, the financial, operational and environmental aspects associated with the use of tree shelter should be considered and counterbalanced.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is widely cultivated worldwide. This study explores the effects of different tea varieties on soil organic matter (SOM) content and microbial communities in tea plantations, providing insights for the green development of the tea industry. We conducted a comparative analysis using metagenomic sequencing to evaluate disparities in SOM content and microbial community composition among a 12-year mature Fuding tea (FD) plantation, Longjing 43 tea (LJ) plantation, and virgin land (VL). Compared with VL, the soil respiration rate, temperature, moisture, and organic matter in LJ and FD plantations increased significantly, with LJ showing the highest SOM content. Bacterial diversity and richness were highest in LJ while fungal diversity and richness decreased. Tea plantation construction alters the SOM content and microbial diversity, with LJ showing the greatest increase in SOM. This study provides new insights for tea plantation management and bacterial fertilizer development.

AB  - During winter, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) may avoid burned forest for up to 60 years. Typically, that is the time required for lichens to recover following fire. We examined the response of caribou of the Klaza population (west-central Yukon, Canada) to recent burns (<= 50 years) during winter. We quantified resource selection of individual caribou across the winter range and use of habitats that were adjacent to or within burns. Typically, caribou selected or used areas with greater density of terrestrial lichen. There was considerable inter-animal variability, but in some season-years caribou selected burned habitat with stronger selection of relatively small burns. Approximately 6.2% of GPS-collar locations were located outside but within 500 m of the boundary of a recent burn and 5.6% of locations occurred within a burn. During late winter, when snow was deeper, caribou demonstrated greater avoidance of burns. Our results suggest that the relationship between caribou and burns is dynamic. Caribou will use recent burns, but such relationships are complicated by cumulative landscape change. It is important to recognise plasticity in behaviour when developing land-use strategies that represent the multi-year, seasonal

AB  - Declines of many bumble bee species have raised concerns because of their importance as pollinators and potential harbingers of declines among other insect taxa. At present, bumble bee conservation is predominantly focused on midsummer flower restoration in open habitats. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that forests may play an important role in bumble bee life history. Compared with open habitats, forests and woody edges provide food resources during phenologically distinct periods, are often preferred nesting and overwintering habitats, and can offer favorable abiotic conditions in a changing climate. Future research efforts are needed in order to anticipate how ongoing changes in forests, such as overbrowsing by deer, plant invasions, and shifting canopy demographics, affect the suitability of these habitats for bumble bees. Forested habitats are increasingly appreciated in the life cycles of many bumble bees, and they deserve greater attention from those who wish to understand bumble bee populations and aid in their conservation.

AB  - The restoration of unproductive abandoned agricultural soils under a semi-arid climate in southeastern Spain was evaluated. Four organic amendments from different composted wastes (greenhouse crop residues; worm compost from sheep-cow manure and plant remains; chicken manure; and sheep-chicken manure and plant remain) were applied, untreated control plots were installed, and natural unexploited soils were selected as a reference ecosystem. Through three sampling campaigns (initial, 3 months, and 12 months), significant changes were observed in soil physico-chemical properties, nutrient content (carbon -C-, nitrogen -N-, and phosphorus -P-), and bacterial composition of the restored soils with respect to control and natural soil, especially at 3 months. The increase of labile nutrients caused the proliferation of copiotrophic phyla at 3 months, which, after their consumption, were replaced by oligotrophic phyla at 12 months. Specific taxa involved in C, N, and P cycles were identified for each soil. For the soil bacterial composition of vermicompost, only chicken and sheep-chicken manures were more dissimilar to control and natural soils after 12 months, while greenhouse crop compost showed an intermediate position between them. Results indicated that composted greenhouse crop remains could be an optimal treatment for the short-term recovery of physico-chemical properties, nutrient content, and bacterial composition of agriculture-degraded soils in semi-arid areas.

AB  - Intraspecific variation, including individual diet variation, can structure populations and communities, but the causes and consequences of individual foraging strategies are often unclear. Interactions between competition and resources are thought to dictate foraging strategies (e.g. specialization vs. generalization), but classical paradigms such as optimal foraging and niche theory offer contrasting predictions for individual consumers. Furthermore, both paradigms assume that individual foraging strategies maximize fitness, yet this prediction is rarely tested. We used repeated stable isotope measurements (delta C-13, delta N-15; N = 3,509) and 6 years of capture-mark-recapture data to quantify the relationship between environmental variation, individual foraging and consumer fitness among four species of desert rodents. We tested the relative effects of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, resource abundance and resource diversity on the foraging strategies of 349 individual animals, and then quantified apparent survival as function of individual foraging strategies. Consistent with niche theory, individuals contracted their trophic niches and increased foraging specialization in response to both intraspecific and interspecific competition, but this effect was offset by resource availability and individuals generalized when plant biomass was high. Nevertheless, individual specialists obtained no apparent fitness benefit from trophic niche contractions as the most specialized individuals exhibited a 10% reduction in monthly survival compared to the most generalized individuals. Ultimately, this resulted in annual survival probabilities nearly 4x higher for generalists compared to specialists. These results indicate that competition is the proximate driver of individual foraging strategies, and that diet-mediated fitness variation regulates population and community dynamics in stochastic resource environments. Furthermore, our findings show dietary generalism is a fitness maximizing strategy, suggesting that plastic foraging strategies may play a key role in species' ability to cope with environmental change.

AB  - An abundance of studies in marine systems have documented species range shifts in response to climate change, and many more have used species distribution models to project species ranges under future conditions. However, there is increasing interest in moving beyond a single-species focus to understand how species redistribution alters ecosystem dynamics via changes in trophic interactions. We employed spatiotemporal models to characterize decadal-scale changes in spatial overlap between the distribution of juvenile walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus and the distributions of four of its groundfish predators: arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis and adult walleye pollock. These fishes represent ecologically and commercially important species in a rapidly changing sub-Arctic ecosystem, the eastern Bering Sea, Alaska, USA. We then examined whether changes in spatial overlap corresponded to changes in predation, using spatiotemporal models of predator stomach contents. We found marked shifts in spatial overlap between juvenile pollock and two predators (arrowtooth flounder and Pacific halibut) over 34 years, with changes in overlap corresponding to increases in population-scale predation pressure. By contrast, we did not find clear relationships between spatial overlap and predation for Pacific cod and adult pollock, the two predators for which juvenile pollock constitute a much smaller diet proportion. Our findings highlight the complexity of predicting predation dynamics for generalist marine species and suggest a need for better process-based methods for understanding the potential future ecological impacts of coupled species range shifts. However, simple metrics of spatial overlap between relatively specialized predators and their prey offer promise as a means to integrate predictions from species distribution models into ecosystem-based fisheries management.

AB  - Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) populations have been increasing in Europe in the last decades. Without reliable methods, game managers frequently underestimate the population size, leading to underharvesting. The aim of this research was to identify the most suitable method for roe deer density estimation in lowland, sparsely forested, high-visibility flat areas in Hungary. The census data of the total counting in the daytime strip transect and the night spotlight strip transect, as the total counting of the sample areas with a thermal camera from observation points within 0-250 m and 0-500 m ranges, were compared in seven hunting areas. It was revealed that using the thermal camera within 0-250 m and the spotlight method in the same range gave the statistically highest population density values. There was no significant difference between the two methods. The smallest mean was revealed in the case of the daytime strip transect data. The thermal imaging method gave significantly lower values for the greater distance (250-500 m) than for the range of spotlighting (250 m). The night spotlight strip transect method and the counting from observation points with a thermal camera, both to 250 m, provided the highest values; thus, they are recommended to determine the roe deer population density in open flat areas. They require the same amount of human resources and time, but due to the high cost of the thermal camera, the spotlight is also perfectly suited for widespread use by hunting companies. The results supported the underestimation of roe deer populations.

AB  - The rising challenge of eutrophication in aquatic systems globally necessitates an understanding of phytoplankton community dynamics under diverse biomanipulation approaches. This study, conducted from June 2022 to July 2023 in the Yuqiao Reservoir's ponds in China, explored phytoplankton dynamics across ponds under different biomanipulation strategies. The study included a pond (BL) without fish stocking, a pond (CH) stocked with carnivorous and herbivorous fish, and another pond (CFD) incorporating a mix of carnivorous, filter-feeding, and detritus-feeding fish. Substantial seasonal variations in phytoplankton density and biomass were observed. In the BL pond, phytoplankton density ranged from 0.23 x 107 to 3.21 x 107 ind/L and biomass from 0.71 to 7.10 mg/L, with cyanobacteria predominantly in warmer seasons and a shift to cryptophytes and chrysophytes in winter. The CH pond exhibited a density range from 0.61 x 107 to 8.04 x 107 ind/L and biomass of 1.11 to 7.58 mg/L. Remarkably, the CFD pond demonstrated a significant reduction in both density (0.11 x 107 to 2.36 x 107 ind/L) and biomass (0.27 to 5.95 mg/L), indicating the effective implementation of its biomanipulation strategy. Key environmental factors including total nitrogen, water temperature, pH, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus played a significant role in shaping phytoplankton communities. The study highlights the importance of tailored biomanipulation strategies in aquatic ecosystem management, emphasizing long-term monitoring for sustainable management of eutrophication.

AB  - It is also necessary to enhance ecological security shelter in the Three Parallel Rivers Region (TPRR) with the Nu-Salween, Lancang-Mekong and Jinsha Rivers which is the key area of biodiversity hotspot on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Mapping spatio-temporal patterns of forest disturbance and recovery is prerequisites for planning effective policies by policy-makers to maintain local sustainable development. Multi-source remote sensing data is useful for long-term spatial analysis of forest disturbance and recovery. We used LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE), sample migration and random forest classification methods to classify forest types and to detect forest changes (disturbance and recovery) from 1990 to 2020 in the TPRR. Results showed that: (1) total area of forest disturbance was 2107.0 km(2), accounting for 8.0% of the forest area in 1990. Since 2000, except in 2006 and 2010, the area of forest recovery was always higher than the area of forest disturbance; (2) proportion of forest disturbance in Honglaxueshan national nature reserve (HLXS NNR), Baimaxueshan national nature reserve (BMXS NNR), Laojunshan scenic spots (LJS SS), Yunlongtianchi national nature reserve (YLTC NNR), Yunling provincial nature reserve (YL PNR) and outside of protected areas (OPA) was 3.0%, 6.1%, 5.5%, 10%, 15.6% and 8.3%, respectively. Percentage of forest recovery was 6.2% in the whole study area, and 6.7% outside of protected areas. Proportion of forest recovery was 1.7%, 2.3%, 3.3%, 12.4% and 10.0% in HLXS NNR, BMXS NNR, LJS SS, YL PNR and YLTC NNR, respectively; (3) duration of forest disturbance was mainly concentrated in 1-3 years with a total area of 1632.9 km(2), accounted for 77.5% of total area of forest disturbance. Duration of forest recovery was less volatile which was mainly concentrated in 2-13 years, with an area of 957.2 km(2), accounted for 58.8% of total area of forest recovery; (4) recovery area of pine forest was the largest, with an area of 850.2 km(2), accounted for 52.2% of the total forest recovery area in the study area. Based on mapping forest distribution and recovery, this research can support the decision-making of local governments on ecological conservation and is of benefit to ecological security improvement in the TPRR.

AB  - Quantifying discards is essential for assessing the impact of fisheries on non-target species and the ecosystems in which these fisheries operate. In Western Australia (WA), fishers are required only to report catches of retained species. For the currently operating shark fisheries of WA, the authors quantified catch time series of discarded teleosts using data from at-sea observers collected since 1993. Sixty-two teleost species were observed in the catch of which 20 were routinely discarded. The most commonly discarded teleosts were western buffalo bream/silver drummer, Kyphosus cornelii/K. sydneyanus, and dusky morwong, Dactylophora nigricans. Annual discards peaked in the 1990s; nonetheless, current discard levels, 36.9 +/- 2.1 (S.E.) t year(-1), are much lower than the overall annual retained catches (c. 1000 t year(-1)). The catch time series reconstructed in this study are important inputs for assessing the ecosystem-based approach used for managing WA's shark fisheries.

AB  - BackgroundDeclines in ecologically beneficial fire, coincident with alterations to native herbivory and intensive land use, have led to dynamic changes in woodland structure and composition, leading to midstory densification and reductions in ground flora abundance and diversity. Frequent, low intensity fire is key to achieving woodland restoration objectives and prescribed burns are often used to meet management goals. For a variety of reasons, the use of prescribed fire is often limited. Further, growing season prescribed burning is often suggested to have a greater impact on woody stems than dormant season applications, but its implementation is difficult. Targeted herbivory may emulate many aspects of prescribed fire holding the potential to diversify management strategies for restoration. We designed a replicated, experimental study to evaluate targeted browsing and prescribed burning for achieving restoration objectives, specifically, a two layered oak woodland with a diverse and abundant native ground flora. The six treatments included: (1) spring browsing, (2) fall browsing, (3) dormant-season and fall browsing, (4) dormant-season prescribed fire, (5) spring browsing plus dormant-season prescribed fire, and (6) an untreated control.ResultsResults suggest that fire had an overriding effect on the reduction of midstory stems that was not comparable to the browsing treatments. Burning reduced leaf litter, increased bare soil exposure and forb coverage. Browsing may reduce the accumulation of woody stems when compared to the control, but this effect was not statistically meaningful. Differences in browsing seasonality and frequent browsing were also not statistically important but trends suggest a greater influence of spring browsing for meeting woodland objectives. Browsing may also exert compositional changes to woodlands because of forage preferences by goats.ConclusionsTo achieve woodland objectives in the short-term, fire is necessary to quickly reduce midstory densities, increase light availability, consume leaf litter, and thereby promote native ground flora abundance and diversity which may not be achieved with targeted browsing alone. Further, the interaction of fire and herbivory suggest that browsing preferences may influence structural and compositional outcomes associated with pyric herbivory regimes in woodlands that require further investigation.
   AntecedenesLa declinació n de los fuegos ecoló gicamente beneficiosos, coincidente con alteraciones causadas a los herbí voros nativos y el uso intensivo de la tierra, ha llevado a cambios diná micos en la composició n y estructura de algunos bosques, lo que lleva a una densificació n de los estratos intermedios del bosque y a una reducció n en la abundancia y diversidad de la flora cercana a la superficie del suelo. Los fuegos frecuentes, de baja intensidad, son claves para alcanzar los objetivos de restauració n de bosques, y las quemas prescriptas son frecuentemente usadas para alcanzar los objetivos de manejo. Por una variedad de razones, el uso de las quemas prescriptas es frecuentemente limitado. Ademá s, las quemas durante la estació n de crecimiento son muchas veces sugeridas ya que tienen un mayor impacto en los tallos de plantas arbó reas que las aplicadas durante la estació n de dormició n, aunque su implementació n es dificultosa. Algunos herbí voros especí ficos pueden emular muchos aspectos de las quemas prescriptas, teniendo el potencial de diversificar las estrategias de manejo para la restauració n. Diseñ amos un estudio experimental con ré plicas, para evaluar los efectos especí ficos del ramoneo y de las quemas prescriptas para alcanzar objetivos de restauració n, especí ficamente a dos estratos de rodales de roble con abundante y diversa flora superficial. Los seis tratamientos incluyeron: (1) ramoneo en primavera; (2) ramoneo en otoñ o; (3) estació n de dormició n y ramoneo en otoñ o; (4) estació n de dormició n y quema prescripta, (5) ramoneo en primavera má s una quema en la estació n de dormició n; y (6) tratamiento de control.ResultadosLos resultados sugieren que el fuego tiene un efecto predominante en la reducció n de tallos leñ osos de especies del estrato medio que no fue comparable con los tratamientos de ramoneo. La quema redujo la broza de hojas (hojarasca superficial) e incrementó la exposició n del suelo desnudo y la cobertura de malezas de hoja ancha. El ramoneo, por otro lado, pudo reducir la acumulació n de tallos leñ osos cuando se lo comparó con el control, aunque su efecto no fue estadí sticamente significativo. Las diferencias en la estacionalidad del ramoneo y el ramoneo frecuente tampoco fueron estadí sticamente importantes, aunque las tendencias sugieren una mayor influencia del ramoneo de primavera para alcanzar los objetivos de restauració n del bosque. El ramoneo puede asimismo causar cambios composicionales en esos bosques, dadas las preferencias de diferentes forrajes por las cabras.ConclusionesPara alcanzar objetivos de restauració n del bosque en el corto plazo, el fuego es necesario para reducir rá pidamente la densidad de la vegetació n en el dosel medio, incrementar la disponibilidad de luz, consumir la hojarasca, y por lo tanto promover la abundancia y diversidad de la flora nativa superficial (sotobosque), que no podrí a alcanzarse con só lo el ramoneo. Asimismo, la interacció n del fuego y la herbivorí a sugiere que la preferencia por el ramoneo puede influenciar los resultados estructurales y composicionales asociados con regí menes de fuego asociados a herbí voros en bosques que requieren de má s investigaciones.

AB  - While it is well documented that wolves (Canis lupus) hunt and scavenge bison (Bison bison) from some long-established populations, such ecological interactions are not well known for most small, reintroduced populations in the boreal forest. Indeed, predation or scavenging of reintroduced bison in the boreal forest is rarely reported. Yet, documenting instances of bison killed or consumed is imperative to understanding the integration of reintroduced populations into local food webs and ecosystems. Such observations also indicate that reintroduced bison may be under selective pressure from their key predator. We compiled 20 verifiable observations of wolves hunting or scavenging bison from three reintroduced populations in northwestern Canada. We report the first confirmed observations of wolves feeding on bison from the 'Nahanni' and 'Pink Mountain' populations. We also report new records of wolves hunting or scavenging bison from the 'Aishihik' population. Where sex was known, most (14 of 17) bison consumed were females and 17 of 20 were adults (either sex). Contrary to other studies, we found that 7 of 20 bison consumed by wolves were aged individuals. It took 19-50 years since bison were reintroduction before verifiable observations of wolf-bison interactions emerged for these populations, indicating that wolves were likely slow to view reintroduced bison as prey and incorporate them into their diets. These observations are of value mainly because they provide unequivocal evidence that these reintroduced bison populations are becoming integrated into local food webs and beginning to be under selective pressure by their main predator, both of which are hallmarks of ecological restoration.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are known to be rich in fauna, with complex food webs that provide trophic subsidy to species and habitats way beyond the extent of their distribution. Birds are an often-overlooked part of marine ecosystems; not only are they crucial to the health of marine ecosystems, but their populations are also supported by the productivity and biodiversity of marine ecosystems. The links of birds to specific habitat types such as seagrass meadows are largely not considered except in the context of direct herbivorous consumption. Here, we examine the linkages between seagrass and birds and propose a conceptual framework for how seagrasses may support bird populations beyond their distribution in both direct and indirect pathways. We present evidence that seagrass meadows are globally foraged for fish and invertebrates by coastal birds. They are also targeted by herbivorous wildfowl and potentially benefit birds further afield indirectly as a result of their support for offshore marine fish species at critical times in their life cycle (e.g., Atlantic Cod and King George Whiting). Evidence from the literature indicates that seagrass does provide support for birds, but reveals a field of research requiring much gap filling as studies are globally sparse, mechanistically limited, and small in spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Ecological interactions, such as facilitation among plant species, has been identified as key for restoration actions. The stress-gradient hypothesis predicts that facilitation increases under harsh environments, but disturbance type and nurse shrub characteristics may modify this prediction. We aim at assessing the effect of two interacting factors (herbivory pressure and light availability) and palatability of the nurse shrub on the importance of nurse effect for active restoration of mixed evergreen forests of northern Patagonia (Argentina) for silvopastoral use. We planted Austrocedrus chilensis seedlings under two silvopastoral use intensities (higher and lower according to livestock seasonal movements) and under three micro-site treatments (palatable shrub, non-palatable shrub, inter-canopy), and evaluated survival and growth during three consecutive years. Under higher use intensity (increasing stress of light availability as desiccation risk and herbivory) we found contrasting effects of the nurse effect on seedling survival and growth, but the palatability of nurse shrub had no effect. Under higher use intensity, seedling survival was lower, while growth was higher. Higher values of seedling survival were found under low use intensity inter-canopy micro-site. Under high use, the presence of a nurse shrub is important for summer seedling survival, indicating its role in avoiding desiccation. The same occurred for winter seedling survival, where a nurse shrub may decrease mainly trampling risk. We highlight the importance of considering the interaction between disturbance factors for the net outcome of the nurse effect in active restoration actions, as it may allow for diverse actions to restoration.

AB  - The present work is the first extensive study of large-scale pesticides research in wild animals. The investigation covered three game species: wild boar (n = 42), roe deer (n = 79) and deer (n = 15) collected from northeastern Poland. To characterize the 480 pesticides in muscle samples, LC-GC-MS/MS techniques were used. A total of 28 compounds were detected: 5 neonicotinoids, 6 organochlorine and 5 other insecticides, 9 fungicides and 4 herbicides, in the range of 0.1-85.3 ng g(-1). Over four hundred detections were done. The highest mean concentrations were as follows: anthraquinone (85.3 ng g(-1)) > DDT-p,p' (4.6 ng g(-1)) > imidacloprid (4.3 ng g(-1)) > permethrin (3.6 ng g(-1)) > thiacloprid (2.8 ng g(-1)). DDT and metabolites were the most frequently detected, followed by acetamiprid, tebuconazole, clothianidin and imidacloprid. Overall, 92% samples with residues were recorded, including 100% of wild boar, 88% of roe deer and 86% of deer. More than one pesticide (up to 9) was found in over 73% of the tested samples. The estimated chronic and acute risk to consumers of venison were very low (below 1% ADI and ARfD). This interdisciplinary study may be helpful for estimating ecological risk to wild animals and risk to consumers of wild animal products, and also as a source of biomonitoring data.

AB  - In the Himalaya, wild ungulates and livestock share resources and interact. We studied impacts of livestock on Kashmir markhor (Capra falconeri cashmeriensis), a species on the brink of local extinction within Indian Himalayan region. One of our study sites (Lachipora WLS received much less livestock than the other (Limber WLS) which allowed us to investigate and compare the interactions between livestock and markhor in a better way. We assessed the impact of livestock grazing on altitudinal migration and habitat use of markhor. We further looked at population performance of markhor by studying its population density and structure in the two valleys. Markhor habitat use was examined along a gradient of livestock grazing intensity. Livestock grazing intensity at each pasture was assessed based on the number of livestock and number of days livestock spent in that pasture. Population of markhor was monitored through block counts. Results reveal that livestock population seasonally exceeds by over 30 times that of markhor. Markhor primarily used areas with low to medium livestock pressure. Markhor showed altitudinal migration in the valley with no livestock in alpine and subalpine habitats but did not migrate to higher altitudes which were occupied by livestock. High livestock pressure had negative impact on population performance of markhor, as evident by a lower population density and extremely low yearling: adult female ratios in the Limber Valley. Keeping habitats of markhor relatively free from grazing should help to maintain the population of this threatened caprid within India.

AB  - The composition of roe deer Capreolus capreolus abomasal nematode compound community depends on several factors; however, little is known about the impact of habitat and host co-occur- rence. Roe deer appears to be the most suitable host species model for conducting studies on formatting the parasitic fauna of wild and domestic ruminants. Therefore, this study was conducted to find out whether the connection between the abundance of a particular roe deer abomasal nematode species and the habitat (i.e. agricultural land, the urban agglomeration, mountains and forests) can be determined. Special emphasis was placed on the mean abundance values which were used in correspondence analysis performed to clarify the observed connection. Based on post-mortem examinations of 75 roe deer overall, 12578 nematodes belonging to eight species (Ostertagia leptospicularis, O. antipini, Spiculopteragia boehmi, S. asymmetrica, Haemonchus contortus, Ashworthius sidemi, Trichostrongylus axei, T. askivali) were collected. The majority of the nematode species were derived from the forest roe deer population co-occurring with red deer Cervus elaphus, fallow deer Dama dama and moose Alces alces, whereas the lowest species diversity was observed in abomasum of roe deer living in the habitat without permanent existence of other cervids (agricultural land). The highest mean intensity of infection was reached by A. sidemi found in roe deer inhabiting forests, while the lowest by T. askivali found in roe deer from mountain habitat. The co-infection of H. contortus and A. sidemi was noted in 11 analysed roe deer. The results sug- gest that the sympatry favors the exchange of A. sidemi between the representatives of Cervidae. Identification of T. axei in the majority of analyzed habitats indicates that roe deer participate in parasite transmission between wild and domestic ruminants. The results show that the presence of a particular roe deer abomasum nematode species does not only depend on occupied habitat but is also strictly connected with the sympatry.

AB  - Background Telomere length provides a physiological proxy for accumulated stress in animals. While there is a growing consensus over how telomere dynamics and their patterns are linked to life history variation and individual experience, knowledge on the impact of exposure to different stressors at a large spatial scale on telomere length is still lacking. How exposure to different stressors at a regional scale interacts with individual differences in life history is also poorly understood. To better understand large-scale regional influences, we investigated telomere length variation in moose (Alces alces) distributed across three ecoregions. We analyzed 153 samples of 106 moose representing moose of both sexes and range of ages to measure relative telomere lengths (RTL) in white blood cells. Results We found that average RTL was significantly shorter in a northern (montane) and southern (sarmatic) ecoregion where moose experience chronic stress related to severe summer and winter temperatures as well as high anthropogenic land-use compared to the boreal region. Our study suggests that animals in the northern boreal forests, with relatively homogenous land use, are less disturbed by environmental and anthropogenic stressors. In contrast, animals in areas experiencing a higher rate of anthropogenic and environmental change experience increased stress. Conclusion Although animals can often adapt to predictable stressors, our data suggest that some environmental conditions, even though predictable and ubiquitous, can generate population level differences of long-term stress. By measuring RTL in moose for the first time, we provide valuable insights towards our current understanding of telomere biology in free-ranging wildlife in human-modified ecosystems.

AB  - Alpine pastures of Kaghan valley are one of the most productive grazing lands in Pakistan. These pastures provide many ecosystem services which are important for livelihood of the local people, nomadic graziers and economy of the country. Alpine pastures of Kaghan spread over an area of 71,939 ha constituting 28% of the total area of the valley. Present study was conducted to quantify the economic value of provisioning ecosystem services i.e. forage production in the study area. The data was collected from 40 fenced experimental plots laid out at eight sites during June-September 2019. Livestock population was estimated through a field survey by interviewing 485 graziers. Results indicated that 65% of the vegetation was comprised of forbs, 24% grasses and 11% was shrubs. Average dry weight of forage was calculated as 2,900 kg ha-1. Total forage production in the grazeable areas of alpine pastures of Kaghan Valley was estimated as 146,035 tonnes per year. The average price of air-dried forage in the area was Rs. 12,000 per tonne or US$ 74.48 per tonne. Therefore, total economic value of forage production in the grazeable areas of Kaghan valley was Rs. 1,752 million or US$ 10.87 million per year. Total livestock population of the Alpine pastures of Kaghan valley was estimated as 163,550 animals. About 56% of the livestock grazing in the pastures comprised of goats, 39% sheep, 2% cows, 2% horses, 1% donkeys, 0.4% mules and 0.3% buffaloes. It was concluded that the alpine pastures of Kaghan valley are very productive and have a key role in the local economy. Sustainable management of alpine pastures will ensure the continuity of valuable ecosystem services.

AB  - Historical exploitation, and a combination of current anthropogenic impacts, such as climate change and habitat degradation, impact the population dynamics of marine mammalian megafauna. Right whales (Eubalaena spp.) are large cetaceans recovering from hunting, whose reproductive and population growth rate appear to be impacted by climate change. We apply noninvasive genetic methods to monitor southern right whale (E. australis, SRW) and test the application of noninvasive genetics to minimise the observer effects on the population. Our aim is to describe population structure, and interdecadal and interannual changes to assess species status in the Great Acceleration period of Anthropocene. As a basis for population genetic analyses, we collected samples from sloughed skin during post-migration epidermal moult. Considering the exploration-exploitation dilemma, we collaborated with whale watching companies, as part of a citizen science approach and to reduce ad hoc logistic operations and biopsy equipment. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite data and population genetic tools. We report for the first time the genetic composition and differentiation of the Namibian portion of the range. Population genetic parameters suggest that South Africa hosts the largest population. This corresponds with higher estimates of current gene flow from Africa compared to older samples. We have observed considerable interannual variation in population density at the breeding ground and an interdecadal shift in genetic variability, evidenced by an increase in the point estimate inbreeding. Clustering analyses confirmed differentiation between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific, presumably originating during the ice ages. We show that population monitoring of large whales, essential for their conservation management, is feasible using noninvasive sampling within non-scientific platforms. Observed patterns are

AB  - Rocky reefs of New South Wales (NSW) are characterised by a mosaic of habitats, including kelp forest and urchin-grazed barrens. These habitats support a diversity of dependent species. Decades of research have demonstrated that kelps form extensive forests with distinctive fish and invertebrate faunas and the 'barrens' boulder habitat provides shelter and other resources for commercial fishes, charismatic fishes and invertebrates; the barrens are not deserts! The feeding activities of herbivorous invertebrates, particularly the black sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii) determine the presence of barrens habitat. Some invertebrates survive only in the presence of urchins and are the food resources for many predatory fishes. The barrens habitat in NSW has been highly stable for decades and is critical for the diversity of reef-based organisms. Because of climate change, Tasmanian waters have warmed and as a result C. rodgersii larvae have dispersed southward from NSW. Importantly, the situation regarding C. rodgersii in Tasmania differs from the established pattern in NSW and this needs to be recognised in the approach to management of this species in the two states. Urchins in NSW should be appreciated as important habitat determiners and the removal of them for whatever purpose would have to be managed carefully.

AB  - Marine mollusks provide important ecosystem services. They create habitats for benthic organisms, filter water, biodeposit organic carbon in the seafloor, and serve as food sources for other organisms. Studies of mollusk diversity require time-consuming methods to process samples and identify species. Thus, it is not surprising that most studies have focused on macromollusks that can be collected and processed easily, ignoring micromollusk species. Without understanding the ecology and distributions of micromollusks properly, it is impossible to assess their populations and implement adequate conservation measures. Here we present microgastropods collected in Bahia de los Angeles at the family level for September 2013 (summer) and February 2014 (winter). During each season, we sampled 6 coastal sediment stations, and analyzed depth, salinity, temperature, granulometry, and organic matter. A total of 20,353 specimens were collected: 15,310 in summer and 5,043 in winter. Seven micromollusk families were identified: Barleeidae, Caecidae, Cerithiidae, Eulimidae, Pyramidellidae, Rissoidae, and Tornidae. Caecidae and Barleeidae exhibited the highest densities among all families in summer and winter, respectively (278,044 ind center dot m(-2), 142,222 ind center dot m(-2)). The lowest densities for summer and winter were observed for the Tornidae family (similar to 1,867 ind center dot m(-2), similar to 1,411 ind center dot m(-2)). Barleeidae, Caecidae, Cerithiidae, Rissoidae, and Tornidae were classified as herbivorous and detritivorous; Eulimidae and Pyramidellidae, as carnivorous and ectoparasitic. Tornidae and Eulimidae showed symbiotic relationships with various invertebrate species. The Bayesian analysis of variance indicated a high probability of differences only in summer (BF > 3). When comparing the stations in both periods, all stations, except station 6, showed differences between periods (BF > 3). The canonical correlation analysis indicated some associations between family abundances and temperature. This study provides valuable information that expands the knowledge of micromollusk biodiversity in the coastal area of Bahia de los Angeles, an important site for conservation in Mexico.

AB  - The influence of biochars on water retention, mitigating nutrient leaching, and pollutant removal in green infrastructure has been explored in the past. However, there is a lack of understanding on how feedstock (i.e., biomass) would affect biochar physicochemical properties and hence, overall erosion control (including infiltration, surface, and sub-surface runoff) in green infrastructure. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of biochars produced from three different feedstocks (pig manure, wood, and kitchen waste) on the erosion of granite residual soil. Flume experiments were conducted to measure and analyze soil erosion, runoff, and infiltration. The result showed that the runoff and soil erosion of kitchen waste biochar (KWB) samples were reduced by 17.7% and 21.7%, respectively. On the contrary, wood biochar (WB) and pig manure biochar (PMB) were found to enhance runoff and soil erosion. In addition, biochar particles were found in runoff and infiltration in erosion experiment. Thus, it is important to note that measures should be taken to prevent biochar loss when using biochar as a soil amendment. Additionally, the effects of different types of biochar on soil hydraulic and hydrophobicity properties should be taken into account as a selection criterion for choosing amendments in green infrastructure. This study finds that kitchen waste biochar has better performance in improving soil hydraulics and erosion.

AB  - Anthropogenic linear infrastructures (ALIs), including roads, railways, and canals, provide important resources to humans, but they can affect wildlife through habitat fragmentation and reduced movement through landscapes. To mitigate these effects, overpass crossing structures (i.e., overpasses) can facilitate wildlife movement across ALIs and maintain landscape connectivity. Human activities can potentially influence spatial and temporal patterns in wildlife use of overpasses; however, little information is available about human-wildlife interactions across some types of ALIs. Using remote wildlife cameras, we evaluated human and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) use and interactions at 43 overpasses along the Central Arizona Project canal in Arizona, USA, during 2 seasons (warm and cool) from February 2021 to February 2022. Mule deer exhibited spatial avoidance of human activities at overpasses, although the effect varied across seasons and types of human activity. At a broad scale, the presence of recreationists at overpasses did not exclude mule deer from using overpasses to cross the canal; however, human presence reduced mule deer detection probability in the warm season. At a fine scale, mule deer decreased use of overpasses as activity associated with canal personnel (i.e., security and maintenance workers) increased in the cool season. For both seasons, mule deer exhibited greater overlap in daily activity patterns with recreationists compared to canal personnel. Further, mule deer shifted daily activity patterns to be more active earlier in the morning at sites with high amounts of recreational use compared to sites with lower recreational use. Because human activities can influence mule deer crossings at overpasses, managers might consider minimizing human activities at crossing locations to increase wildlife use and promote wildlife movement across canals and other types of ALIs.

AB  - In the debate about tree species suited to cope with the ongoing global changes, Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) is frequently discussed as a potentially future-proof tree species for Central Europe. This is mainly due to its current southern distribution range, which climatically corresponds to what is expected for Central Europe in the near future. Present chestnut forests are, however, the result of historic long-term intensive management, which has extended and partially obscured the species' natural ecological range and autecology. Therefore, knowledge about the competitiveness and suitability of chestnut for future conditions is still poor. Here, we analysed data of the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) for Southern Switzerland to compare the survival probability of chestnut to other co-occurring tree species and detect drivers of chestnut mortality under natural dynamics including the Asian Chestnut Gall Wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus) using survival models, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the Cox-Proportional Hazards model.
   Despite the potential longevity of cultivated chestnuts, under natural conditions the survival curves rank the chetsnut among short-lived and light-demanding tree species, especially for individuals smaller than 50 cm diameter at breast height. Moreover, the survival models confirm the pioneer-like characteristics of the chestnut tree such as its low shade tolerance and poor competitiveness in comparison to late-successional species. The mortality probability of chestnut increases when growing under dry conditions and under grazing pressure from goats, while fire disturbances have a positive effect on survival. Severe damage due to repeated D. kuriphilus attacks represents an additional significant factor of increased chestnut mortality risk.
   Our results suggest that chestnut is not per se a future-proof tree species. Rather, forest managers should be aware that chestnut might not be the best option to face expected rises in summer temperatures and dry periods on xeric site conditions, whereas the species can be considered on good site conditions when regular silvicultural management is provided.

AB  - DNA analysis of environmental samples (eDNA) provides a non-intrusive approach to identify organisms, characterize biological communities, and assess biodiversity, including the detection and monitoring of invasive plant effects. However, the use of eDNA for specific applications, such as targeted-species detection, geographic and floral source tracing, and assessment of invasive plant ecological and environmental effects, requires the development of species-specific genetic primers. Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera (L.) Small) is a non-native high-impact invader, capable of changing fire regimes, native biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat and populations, that is expanding in range and abundance throughout the southern United States. In this study, we investigated and identified specific genetic sites, markers, in the tallow chloroplast genome and developed sets of primers for tallow eDNA detection. Two sets of tallow primers were developed, tallow-specific primers and tallow-related primers. Both sets of primers can be used for tallow eDNA detection, with higher target specificity for tallow-specific primers. Primers were subsequently validated for target specificity against closely related species, samples of tallow tissue, and honey and honey bee-collected pollen from areas with tallow. We found that tallow-specific primers differentiated tallow eDNA from closely related species, demonstrating target specificity. Furthermore, a sequence analysis of the tallow-related primers in the polymerase chain reaction accurately distinguished members of the Hippomaninae subtribe, including tallow, from other subtribe or subfamily members within the Euphorbiaceae. Ultimately, the genetic markers and the corresponding sets of primers will facilitate eDNA analysis of tallow for several applications, including detection and monitoring in water and soil, assurance of honey quality and floral source tracing, and perhaps serving as a model for determining plant use by pollinators.

AB  - The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the world's most widespread member of the order Carnivora, occurring across a large range of latitudes and inhabiting multiple habitat types. There is no comprehensive study of how the diets of this flexible generalist vary across the whole Asian continent. We conducted a meta-analysis of red fox diets in Japan, examining the patterns in food type selection and their associations with seasonality, regional climate, vegetation productivity, and human influences at the national scale. Using linear mixed models, we revealed significant seasonal effects on the frequency of occurrence of mammals in general, ungulate carcasses, birds, and invertebrates in the diets of red foxes. Furthermore, the frequency of occurrence of mammals significantly decreased with mean annual temperature and increased with vegetation productivity. The frequency of invertebrate occurrences increased with temperature, and that of anthropogenic foods increased with human population density. Trophic diversity and dietary niche breadth increased with annual temperature but decreased with vegetation productivity and population density. These results suggest that the red fox is a flexible predator in Japan that adapts its foraging patterns according to variations in resource availability and abiotic conditions, while persistently consuming a certain ratio of animal prey to meet its metabolic requirements. Modifications of predators' trophic niches can influence structures of prey communities and interactions with sympatric competitors. Our findings are important for informing ecosystem management practices under ongoing environmental and social changes in Japan.

AB  - Herbivores, omnivores, and predators transfer energy and structure the communities of many coastal marine ecosystems, and the intensity with which they consume prey and contribute to ecosystem functioning varies substantially among habitats over short time periods. Whether generalities across habitats might emerge for longer time series and using standard methods remains largely untested. Here, we deployed standardized assays of consumption using dried squid ("squidpops") and five common macrophytes ("weedpops") to quantify consumption across coral fore reef and patch reefs, mangroves, seagrass meadows, and bare sand from 2015 to 2019 around Carrie Bow Cay, Belize. We also used video in 2017 to identify the species responsible for consumption. We found that both squid- and weedpop consumption were consistently highest on patch and fore reef habitats, moderate in mangroves, and lowest in seagrass and sand across all years of the survey. Videos showed that the majority of consumption on the reefs in 2017 could be attributed to < 5 fish species, and the identity of the dominant consumers differed among habitats. This study validates a key but implicit assumption in marine ecology that relative patterns in consumption across habitats are consistent through space and time in tropical nearshore environments, and reveals that high consumption rates may be the consequence of one or few species in each location.

AB  - The higher drought intensity recorded in the last decades in the Mediterranean zone of Chile increased the level of threats of the endemic Beilschmiedia miersii (Gay) Kosterm and has raised concern about its capacity to face drought. In this study, we assessed the effect of seed provenance and mother tree on seed germination traits, seedling growth, biomass allocation, presence of cotyledons, and survival responses of B. miersii cultivated under two water treatments (well-watered versus water stress. Average pre-dawn plant water potentials of -0.9 and -4.5 MPa, respectively). The germination stage of this trial showed significant differences in germination capacity, germination energy, and the maximum value of Czabator. Provenances from the southern range of the species, with higher precipitation (Cantillana and El Arbol) had a better germination performance, however, once germinated, the ability of the seedlings to survive in the nursery was high only in two of the five provenances under study. The coastal and interior provenances with lower precipitations (El Pobre, Longotoma, and Antumapu) were not able to survive to the seedling stage (<5% survival). Seedling growth and survival varied significantly between the two remaining provenances and the two watering treatments. The provenance El Arbol, exhibited a higher survival, growth, presence of cotyledons, and biomass traits. This provenance also exhibited a higher presence of cotyledons in both watering treatments and an unaltered root to shoot ratio between the well-watered and the water stress treatments. Our results suggests that there is important phenotypic variation for seed germination and seedling survival associated to the provenance origin, emphasizing the importance of a nursery-evaluation phase before the beginning of restoration projects at the landscape level.

AB  - Soil aggregate fractions serve as functional units of a soil ecosystem, providing ecologically diverse microhabitats for microbial communities. Manure application has been previously reported to alter the abundance, diversity and structure of soil microbial communities. However, how manure application changes functional microbial groups and microbiome complexity in various soil aggregate fractions remains largely unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of 18-year pig manure application on microbial communities and their network complexity in soil aggregate fractions from an acidic Ultisol. Manure application significantly enhanced soil bacterial diversity rather than fungal diversity. Both manure application and aggregation had a significant impact on the bacterial and fungal community structure. Manure application reduced the relative abundance of Chloroflexi, AD3 and Basidiomycota phyla across all aggregate fractions, and enriched Proteobacteria and Ascomycota phyla in macroaggregates. As for functional microbial groups, the relative abundances of diazotrophs and bacterial nitrifiers were enhanced while bacterial denitrifiers were inhibited under manure application. Manure application increased the relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi while suppressed plant pathogens and parasites. Microbial network complexity, especially the number of positive links, increased with increasing application rates of manure. In contrast, the complexity of microbial networks declined with increasing aggregate sizes. Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi phyla comprised the majority of the potential keystone taxa in the low-rate and high-rate manure amended treatments, respectively. The importance of Chloroflexi phylum in microbial networks was promoted by manure application, despite of their reduced abundance. Together, these findings advance our understanding of the impacts of manure application on microbiome diversity, complexity and functional groups in soil aggregate fractions, with implications for managing agricultural ecosystem functioning in Ultisols.

AB  - The estimation of foraging parameters is fundamental for understanding predator ecology. Predation and feeding can vary with multiple factors, such as prey availability, presence of kleptoparasites and human disturbance. However, our knowledge is mostly limited to local scales, which prevents studying effects of environmental factors across larger ecological gradients. Here, we compared inter-kill intervals and handling times of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) across a large latitudinal gradient, from subarctic to the Mediterranean ecosystems, using a standardised dataset of predicted adult ungulate kills from 107 GPS-collared lynx from nine distinct populations in Europe. We analysed variations in these two foraging parameters in relation to proxies reflecting prey availability, scavengers' presence and human disturbance, to improve our understanding of lynx predation at a continental scale. We found that inter-kill intervals and handling times varied between populations, social status and in different seasons within the year. We observed marked differences in inter-kill intervals between populations, which do not appear to be driven by variation in handling time. Increases in habitat productivity (expressed by NDVI, used as a proxy for prey availability) resulted in reduced inter-kill intervals (i.e. higher kill rates). We observed less variation in handling (i.e. feeding) times, although presence of dominant scavengers (wild boars and brown bears) and higher human impact led to significantly shorter handling times. This suggests that kleptoparasitism and human disturbance may limit the energetic input that lynx can obtain from their prey. We also observed that the human impact on foraging parameters can be consistent between some populations but context-dependent for others, suggesting local adaptations by lynx. Our study highlights the value of large-scale studies based on standardised datasets, which can aid the implementation of effective management measures, as patterns observed in one area might not be necessarily transferable to other regions. Our results also indicate the high degree of adaptability of these solitary felids, which enables them to meet their energy requirements and persist across a wide range of environmental conditions despite the constraints imposed by humans, dominant scavengers and variable prey availability.

AB  - Sea turtle nesting brings marine-derived nutrients into sandy beach ecosystems, potentially influencing their dynamics. We investigated nutrient input from green turtle Chelonia mydas eggs and hatchlings into coastal habitats in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa. We assessed two islands within the Jo & atilde;o Vieira-Poil & atilde;o Marine National Park ('JVPMNP'), with contrasting sea turtle nesting density: very low (Jo & atilde;o Vieira) and very high (Poil & atilde;o). On each island, we analyzed stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in one pair of plant species (coinvine Dalbergia ecastaphyllum bush/baobab Adansonia digitata tree) and two pairs of predator species (tufted ghost crab Ocypode cursor/African rainbow crab Cardisoma armatum and sea catfish Carlarius spp./crevalle jack Caranx hippos). The first species in each pair is distributed closer to nesting sites, while the second is found further inland or offshore. Stomach content analysis was also conducted for fishes. Results supported nutrient input from turtle clutches benefiting the species living near nesting sites. Shoreline coinvines at Poil & atilde;o had higher delta 15N (5.1 +/- 3.2 parts per thousand) compared to Jo & atilde;o Vieira (approximate to 0 parts per thousand), suggesting assimilation of turtle-derived 15N. Shoreline tufted ghost crabs at Poil & atilde;o had enriched delta 15N (15.2 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand vs. Jo & atilde;o Vieira's 12.2 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand) and delta 13C (- 13.4 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand vs. Jo & atilde;o Vieira's - 18.7 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand), likely reflecting predation upon eggs and hatchlings. Sea catfishes at Poil & atilde;o frequently consumed unhatched turtle eggs washed into the sea (17% frequency of occurrence) and hatchlings (up to 27%). This study suggests that nutrient availability from turtle nests influences and supports shoreline plants and consumers at JVPMNP.

AB  - Response and effect traits help to understand how changes in ecological communities (e.g. in response to land use) relate to changes in ecosystem functioning. In grasslands, plants and insect herbivores are involved in many ecosystem processes such as herbivory and plant biomass production. Simultaneous changes in the trait composition of both plants and herbivores should affect herbivory rates, with consequences for plant growth and potentially biomass production. The mechanisms underlying these links are little understood for grasses and sucking insects, which build a major part of grassland communities. In a mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the composition of grasses and sucking herbivores (Hemiptera) to study the role of plant traits, herbivore traits and their interaction on herbivory and plant growth. Because sucking herbivory is generally difficult to quantify, we developed a novel experimental setting, in which we labelled plants with 15N isotope. This allowed to quantify 15N uptake and thus sucking rates of individuals. We found that herbivory and simultaneous plant growth reduction are most strongly linked to herbivore species identity. Unexpectedly, herbivory did not increase with herbivore size, but was highest for small species and for thin-bodied Heteroptera. Additionally, herbivory and plant growth reduction depended on the interacting herbivore and plant species, indicating trait matching, which could, however, not be explained with commonly used traits. This indicates that mechanisms linking ecological communities and ecosystem processes are highly context-specific. To understand how global change affects ecosystem functioning, studies need to cover all functionally relevant groups, including plant sap suckers. (C) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Hornbills are particularly important seed dispersers in tropical Asian forests, but most of the species in the region are declining. In addition, long-term data on the extent of the declines and how forest degradation impacts hornbills remain mostly unquantified. Here, we used multicovariate distance sampling to estimate the densities of hornbills in 2021 -2022 in Hala -Bala Wildlife Sanctuary and Budo Su-Ngai Padi National Park protected areas in southern Thailand. These two sites are particularly useful for comparison due to differences in protection levels, with Bala being relatively less disturbed than Budo Mountain and because Bala was surveyed 20 years prior (2001 -2002). Fig tree watches were also conducted in 2021 -2022 to assess the potential impact of forest disturbance on hornbill visitation rates. Results indicated significant differences in hornbill densities between the two sites. The mean density of the Rhinoceros ( Buceros rhinoceros ) and Wreathed Hornbill ( Rhyticeros undulatus ) was 3.2 and 5.1 times higher in Bala than in Budo, while the mean density of the Great Hornbill ( Buceros bicornis ) was 2.2 times higher in Budo than in Bala. The density of the Helmeted Hornbill ( Rhinoplax vigil ) was notably lower than other hornbill species. There were also significant changes over the past 20 years in large hornbill densities, with Great Hornbill and Wreathed Hornbill significantly increasing, while the Helmeted Hornbill declined more than 90 %. Also, the probability of hornbills visiting fruiting Ficus trees was higher in the less -disturbed Bala than the Budo Mountain, making hornbills more reliable visitors in the less -disturbed site. We demonstrate the applicability of the multi-covariate distance sampling approach to estimate densities of rare hornbills, the negative impacts of habitat degradation on hornbills and the ecological role they play as seed dispersers. Additional surveys are needed throughout tropical Asia to establish further sites for long-term monitoring, especially in the Sunda region, where the Helmeted Hornbill is under extreme threat.

AB  - Water table decline is one of the most serious environmental problems in the peatland in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. However, the effect of water table decline on the structure of aboveground arthropod communities is still not clear. We investigated changes in the abundance of different arthropod groups, and estimated the abundance, height, and biomass of the plant community in a soil water table reduction experiment to reveal the effect of water table decline on the arthropod community structure. The effect of water level decline on herbivorous arthropods varied according to the feeding habits. Specifically, water table decline treatment decreased the abundance of grass-preferring herbivores but increased the abundance of forb-preferring herbivores. However, the density of predators (e.g., spiders) did not change significantly. The variations in arthropod communities were correlated with the increase in forbs and leaf nitrogen content in the water table decline treatments. Our experiment demonstrated that the effect of water table decline on plant communities cascades upwardly to alter the arthropod community. Such trophic interactions should be considered in studies aimed at predicting shifts in the arthropods communities in a changing climate.

AB  - Monitoring large marine mammals is challenging due to their low abundances in general, an ability to move over large distances and wide geographical range sizes.
   The distribution of the pygmy (Kogia breviceps) and dwarf (Kogia sima) sperm whales is informed by relatively rare sightings, which does not permit accurate estimates of their distribution ranges. Hence, their conservation status has long remained Data Deficient (DD) in the Red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which prevent appropriate conservation measures.
   Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding uses DNA traces left by organisms in their environments to detect the presence of targeted taxon, and is here proved to be useful to increase our knowledge on the distribution of rare but emblematic megafauna.
   Retrieving eDNA from filtered surface water provides the first detection of the Dwarf sperm whale (Kogia sima) around the remote Malpelo island (Colombia).
   Environmental DNA collected during oceanic missions can generate better knowledge on rare but emblematic animals even in regions that are generally well sampled for other taxa.

AB  - Organisms from higher tropical levels (e.g., herbivores) can mediate indirect competitive interactions between two target plant species, but such apparent competition may also be mediated by a third plant species and thus may vary depending on the size and competitive ability of the target plant species and the third plant species. We set up an outdoor experiment with four aquatic plant species with similar niches but differing greatly in size, i.e., Lemna minor (the smallest), Spirodela polyrhiza (the second smallest), Salvinia natans (the second largest) and Pistia stratiotes (the largest). We grew L. minor and S. polyrhiza alone or in mixture and in the absence of any third plant species, in the presence of a small, third species S. natans or in the presence of a large, third species P. stratiotes. In the absence of the third species or in the presence of S. natans, the growth of L. minor was greatly inhibited by S. polyrhiza, but in the presence of P. stratiotes, the inhibiting effects of S. polyrhiza disappeared completely and the growth of L. minor greatly increased. By contrast, the presence of L. minor had no effect on the growth of S. polyrhiza, and this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of the third plant species, although the presence of the third species, particularly P. stratiotes, decreased its growth. We conclude that the presence of a third plant species can regulate plant-plant interactions, but such an impact depends on the size and competitive ability of the competing species as well as the third species. Our findings highlight the role of complexity in plant-plant interactions, and suggest that apparent competition between plants can also occur at the same trophic level. These results have important implications for the explanations of species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - Purpose Insect herbivory affects plant growth, nutrient and secondary metabolite concentrations and litter quality. Changes to litter quality due to insect herbivory can alter decomposition, with knock on effects for plant growth mediated through the plant-litter-soil feedback pathway. Methods Using a multi-phase glasshouse experiment, we tested how changes in shoot and root litter quality of fast- and slow-growing grass caused by insect herbivores affect the performance of response plants in the soil in which the litter decomposed. Results We found that insect herbivory resulted in marginal changes to litter quality and did not affect growth when plants were grown with fast- versus slow-growing litter. Overall, presence of litter resulted in reduced root and shoot growth and this effect was significantly more negative in shoots versus roots. However, this effect was minimal, with a loss of c. 1.4% and 3.1% dry weight biomass in roots versus shoots, respectively. Further, shoot litter exposed to insect herbivory interacted with response plant identity to affect root growth. Conclusions Our results suggest that whether litter originates from plant tissues exposed to insect herbivory or not and its interaction with fast- versus slow-growing grasses is of little importance, but species-specific responses to herbivory-conditioned litter can occur. Taken collectively, the overall role of the plant-litter-soil feedback pathway, as well as its interaction with insect herbivory, is unlikely to affect broader ecosystem processes in this system.

AB  - Soils contain biotic and abiotic legacies of previous conditions that may influence plant community biomass and associated aboveground biodiversity. However, little is known about the relative strengths and interactions of the various belowground legacies on aboveground plant-insect interactions. We used an outdoor mesocosm experiment to investigate the belowground legacy effects of range-expanding versus native plants, extreme drought and their interactions on plants, aphids and pollinators. We show that plant biomass was influenced more strongly by the previous plant community than by the previous summer drought. Plant communities consisted of four congeneric pairs of natives and range expanders, and their responses were not unanimous. Legacy effects affected the abundance of aphids more strongly than pollinators. We conclude that legacies can be contained as soil 'memories' that influence aboveground plant community interactions in the next growing season. These soil-borne 'memories' can be altered by climate warming-induced plant range shifts and extreme drought.

AB  - Simple Summary Zoos help to rescue, rehabilitate, and care for wildlife. Approximately fifteen years ago, the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) was successfully reintroduced into the Alps. There are at least 17 zoos throughout Europe that keep Alpine ibexes in captivity. To ensure success, the staff must understand the animal's specific requirements and provide leading managers and researchers to investigate strategies such as feed quality control, successful reproduction, and appropriate social group structure. The animal welfare strategy is an important factor for success. Appropriate and stress-free animal capture and sampling methods are especially important. Non-invasive sampling methods are increasingly being used in veterinary practice. Cortisol (C) concentrations can be measured in various matrices, such as saliva, hair, and faeces. Blood collection using venipuncture, which is stressful, can be replaced by collection with kissing bugs (Triatomines) or medicinal leeches (Hirudo medicinalis). In this article, C concentrations in different matrices were compared in Alpine ibexes at the zoo. Differences according to the sex, age, and season of sampling were also compared. The usefulness of blood collection using venipuncture versus kissing bugs or medicinal leeches and the collection of saliva, faeces, hair, urine, and tears for measuring "immunoreactive" C (iC) concentration in Alpine ibexes was verified using commercial enzyme immunoassays. The mean value of serum C was highest in serum collected using venipuncture and lowest in serums collected using kissing bugs. Statistically significant differences were observed between venipuncture and kissing bugs and between leeches and kissing bugs. However, no statistically significant difference was found in C concentrations between samples collected with venipuncture and those collected with leeches. The highest mean value of C concentration was measured in serum (all three methods), followed by that in hair and faeces, and the lowest mean value was found in saliva. Statistically significant differences were found between saliva and faeces samples and between saliva and hair samples. The difference between the concentrations for faeces and hair was not statistically significant. A significant difference in C concentration between males and females was found in saliva. A significant difference in C concentration among different ages was measured in serum obtained using venipuncture in all three groups and in faeces between the groups older than ten years and younger than 10 months. Highly significant differences in C concentrations were also found between hair sampled in summer and hair sampled in autumn. Collecting tear and urine samples is a laborious procedure and is therefore less acceptable for C determination. Due to the small number of samples, statistical values are not given for these two matrices.

AB  - Understanding producer-herbivore dynamics is fundamental for maintaining ecosystem stability and biodiversity. This study proposes a novel stoichiometric producer-herbivore model that incorporates positive density dependence induced by demographic factors. We conduct a rigorous mathematical analysis of the proposed model, covering well-posedness, nullcline analysis, and system stability. This analysis is expanded through numerical bifurcation analysis to explore the effects of critical biological parameters, including light intensity, on producer-herbivore interactions. Our findings reveal that variations in the severity of the Allee effect significantly influence these interactions, driving multistability and periodic oscillations. Severe Allee effects lead to complex dynamics, including four forms of bistability and three forms of tristability. Severe Allee effects can also lead to the extinction of both producer and herbivore populations due to positive density dependence. Intermediate levels of parameters such as light intensity, producer growth rate, herbivore loss rate, saturation levels of the Allee effect, total phosphorus, and sufficiently high production efficiency can lead to system instability and oscillations. Conversely, in scenarios with low-severity Allee effects, the system shows relatively simpler dynamics, with three types of bistability. Low producer growth rate and herbivore loss rate, moderate saturation levels of the Allee effect, light intensity, and sufficiently high herbivore production efficiency and total phosphorus levels can induce periodic oscillations. These findings emphasize the importance of managing Allee effect severity in conservation efforts to sustain biodiversity and prevent undesirable state transitions.

AB  - Understanding species' population status is crucial for strategizing their conservation. This study assessed the population density, size, structure and spatial occurrence of puku (Kobus vardonii) in Rukwa Game Reserve, Tanzania. A systematic line transect sampling design was used to collect data, including radial distance, sighting angle, number of individuals, age-sex categories, GPS coordinates of puku observations, and surveyed transect length. Puku density was estimated at using Distance software (version 7.5). Population structure was analyzed with Microsoft Excel, and spatial occurrence was assessed using Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS). The results show a population density of 30.8 (13.5-70.5) individuals per square kilometer, indicating a 190.6% increase compared to what Waltert et al. (2009) observed in the same area using equal distance zigzag sampling design. This increase in density may result from habitat shrinkage caused by rising Lake Rukwa water levels submerging dryland. The population size was estimated at 573 (251-1311) individuals, a 26.2% decline from 776 (432 - 1393) in the previous study, likely due to poaching. Despite this decline, population density increased, suggesting an unusual pattern. The results also indicate a reduced range compared to the previous study. The findings also indicate a stable population with potential for increase, with female-to-male and female-to-young ratios at 1.34 and 1.4, respectively, a mean group size of 6.9, and juveniles accounting for 23% of the population. Overall, these findings highlight the need for long-term monitoring of trends in population size, range, and density, as well as research into their causes.

AB  - Mobile marine protected areas have been proposed for the conservation of highly seasonal or mobile marine megafauna. However, seasonal data on the distribution of marine wildlife to inform protected areas are generally scarce worldwide, especially for cetaceans, which makes dynamic solutions difficult to implement.Furthermore, conservation objectives are often set at the level of individual species rather than at the community level, despite many species having similar or overlapping habitat requirements, and a comparison of the effectiveness of mobile vs. static Marine Protected Areas options has rarely been done.Systematic conservation planning was used to identify priority areas of cetacean biodiversity in the north-east Atlantic accounting for seasonal changes in distribution. Consistent hotspots across seasons at a community level, in particular along the shelf edge, suggest that fixed priority areas for cetacean biodiversity may be appropriate.The area required for protection to meet conservation targets (i.e. 20% of a population occurring within a protected area) is minimized when considering populations at basin scale rather than national level. Highly mobile megafauna normally exploit persistent and predictable oceanographic features, so a habitat suitability rather than a jurisdiction-based approach is more appropriate.

AB  - Transgenerational effects in plants incur opposing effects on the adaptation to predictable vs. unpredictable environments. While seed-dimorphic plants can produce dimorphic offspring with different adaptive strategies, it remains unclear whether the transgenerational effects and seed dimorphism may interact to dictate offspring adaptation. This study aimed to explore whether and how seed-dimorphic maternal plants impart different transgenerational effects to dimorphic offspring. Synedrella nodiflora was chosen as a study species, which is adaptive to a wide soil water gradient and produces two distinctive types of seeds (light disc vs. heavy ray seeds). In a greenhouse, S. nodiflora was grown for two generations under drought stress to test whether the transgenerational effects on offspring performance and mortality depend on maternal (MS) or offspring seed morph (OS). The potential regulatory mechanisms were explored by measuring seed provisioning and chemical regulators of maternal plants and related reproductive processes. The transgenerational effects depended on both MS and OS. Drought stress induced the maternal plants originated from ray seeds to increase the relative proportion of ray- vs. disc-seed offspring and transmit stronger adaptive transgenerational effects to the former, whereas its effects on the maternal plants originated from disc seeds were exactly opposite. These different effects on offspring corresponded with different seed abscisic acid and soluble sugar contents but not seed provisioning. Dimorphism-dependent transgenerational effects allow large divergence of drought tolerance among offspring, which may be an important but under-explored mechanism to balance the needs of population maintenance and range expansion in seed-dimorphic species.

AB  - Contextual and spatial systems facilitate changes in emotional memory regulation brought on by traumatic stress. Cholinergic basal forebrain (chBF) neurons provide input to contextual/spatial systems and although chBF neurons are important for emotional memory, it is unknown how they contribute to the traumatic stress effects on emotional memory. Clusters of chBF neurons that project to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) modulate fear conditioned suppression and passive avoidance, while clusters of chBF neurons that project to the hippocampus (Hipp) and PFC (i.e. cholinergic medial septum and diagonal bands of Broca (chMS/DBB neurons) are critical for fear extinction. Interestingly, neither Hipp nor PFC projecting chMS/DBB neurons are critical for fear extinction. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a contextual/spatial memory system that receives input from chMS/DBB neurons, but whether this chMS/DBB-RSC circuit facilitates traumatic stress effects on emotional memory remain unexplored. Traumatic stress leads to neuroinflammation and the buildup of reactive oxygen species. These two molecular processes may converge to disrupt chBF circuits enhancing the impact of traumatic stress on emotional memory.

AB  - Macroalgae canopies are common in tropical coastlines, and can be feeding grounds for coral reef fishes. We investigated whether fish transfer algal material from Sargassum-dominated macroalgae habitats to coral reefs by collecting gut contents of two herbivorous fish species (Naso elegans and N. unicornis) from coral reefs in the central Red Sea. On inshore reefs close to macroalgae canopies, Sargassum accounted for up to 41% of these species' gut contents while almost no Sargassum was found in the stomachs of fish on offshore reefs farther from macroalgae canopies. Using consumption and excretion rates from literature, we estimate that these fish consume up to 6.0 mmol C/m2 reef/day and excrete up to 10.8 mu mol N/m2 reef/day and 1.0 mu mol P/m2 reef/day across inshore reefs as a result of Sargassum consumption. Examining fish-mediated connections between habitats illuminates the role of fish as a vector of nutrition to nutrient-poor coral reefs.

AB  - Optimal foraging theory predicts that carnivores select prey species based on intrinsic factors, such as body size, vulnerability, and abundance. Prey abundance can vary significantly, especially when prey species move in and out of an area en masse in search of food. However, little is known about how these resource pulses influence the prey profiles of large carnivores. Using data on lion (Panthera leo) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) kills in the Maasai Mara in Kenya, we investigate whether changes in prey abundance, as a result of a mass annual migration of herbivores, influence the prey profiles of these two carnivore species. Furthermore, for cheetah we investigate whether there are sex-specific differences in prey profiles in response to changes in prey abundance. Using data from 387 lion kills and 220 cheetah kills (160 female and 60 male), we found that changes in prey abundance had a strong influence on prey profiles, but that for cheetahs this varied by sex and social grouping. More specifically, during the migration, when there is an influx of wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), lions and male cheetah (particularly those in coalitions) were more likely to feed on wildebeest than out of the migration. In addition, when wildebeest were less abundant, lions switched to buffalo (Syncerus caffer). Overall, the breadth of the prey profiles was narrower during the migration compared to out of the migration but this was most significant for lions and coalitions of male cheetahs. These changes in prey profiles could have an impact on herbivore dynamics, human-wildlife conflict and ecological interactions more broadly. Through the detailed characterisation of prey profiles, we contribute to the understanding of predator-prey dynamics and trophic interactions in complex, multi-species ecosystems and illustrate the importance of taking into account inter- and intraspecific variations in predators when modelling predator-prey dynamics.

AB  - Marine animals such as the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) rely on a productive marine environment and are vulnerable to oceanic changes that can affect their reproduction and survival rates. Davis Base, Antarctica, acts as a moulting site for southern elephant seals that forage in Prydz Bay, but the mitochondrial haplotype diversity and natal source populations of these seals have not been characterized. In this study, we combined genetic and animal tracking data on these moulting seals to identify levels of mitochondrial haplotype diversity, natal source population, and movement behaviours during foraging and haul-out periods. Using partial sequences of the mitochondrial control region, we identified two major breeding mitochondrial lineages of seals at Davis Base. We found that the majority of the seals originated from breeding stocks within the South Atlantic Ocean and South Indian Ocean. One seal was grouped with the Macquarie Island breeding stock (South Pacific Ocean). The Macquarie Island population, unlike the other two stocks, is decreasing in size. Tracking data revealed long-distance foraging activity of the Macquarie Island seal around Crozet Islands. We speculate that changes to the Antarctic marine environment can result in a shift in foraging and movement strategies, which subsequently affects seal population growth rates.

AB  - Habitat selection theory suggests that environmental features selected at coarse scales reveal fundamental factors affecting animal fitness. When these factors vary across seasons, they may lead to large-scale movements, including long-distance seasonal migrations. We analyzed the seasonal habitat selection of 25 satellite-tracked Arctic hares from a population on Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Canada) that relocated over 100 km in the fall. Since no other lagomorph is known to perform such extensive movements, this population offered an ideal setting to test animal movement and habitat selection theory. On summer grounds hares selected low elevation areas, while on winter grounds they selected high vegetation biomass, high elevation, and steep slopes. During fall relocation, they alternated between stopover and traveling behavioral states (ratio 2:1). Stopover locations were characterized by higher vegetation heterogeneity and lower rugosity than traveling locations, while vegetation biomass and elevation interacted to explain stopover locations in a more complex way. The selected combination of environmental features thus varied across seasons and behavioral states, in a way broadly consistent with predictions based on the changing food and safety needs of hares. Although causality was not demonstrated, our results improve our understanding of long-distance movements and habitat selection in Arctic hares, as well as herbivore ecology in the polar desert. Results also provide strong support to animal movement and habitat selection theory, by showing how some important hypotheses hold when tested in a species phylogenetically distinct from most animal models used in this research field.

AB  - Ecotourism generates $7.6 trillion annually and supports 292 million jobs around the world, and because of these benefits, it has been emphasized as a conservation strategy. Ecotourism, how-ever, is not the solution for every community, and there is growing evidence that tourism can have unintended consequences for local people and wildlife, unless well managed. Here, we assessed the relative impacts of anthropogenic activities related to tourism (e.g. road density, distance to ranches and camping areas) and prey distributions on puma occupancy and abun-dance in the open steppe habitat of the southeast portions of the Torres del Paine UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, where pumas are protected. In winter, puma abundance and occupancy were explained by both prey and anthropogenic metrics. In summer, puma abundance was explained by both prey and anthropogenic metrics, but occupancy only by anthropogenic metrics. Across both periods, puma abundance was only explained by anthropogenic metrics, and occupancy was explained by both prey and anthropogenic metrics. Guanacos, the most important prey species for local pumas, never appeared in any top model, except in summer, during which puma abundance was explained by lower not higher guanaco abundance. Not unexpectedly, puma abundance and occupancy were negatively correlated with trail and road density across all analyses. In the high tourism season of summer, roads had 2-3 times the impact on puma abundance than prey metrics in top models. During our study, the average number of monthly visitors per month in summer (November-January) was 892 % higher than winter (May-July). As a whole, we believe our analyses suggest that tourism may be negatively impacting pumas, but the severity of this impact remains questionable. Future work should include studying stress in puma populations experi-encing heavy tourism, simultaneous with the work needed to understand relative thresholds of impact on puma fitness metrics (e.g. survival, hunting success). We believe our work also high-lights the need for standards and guidelines to be created and adopted among those involved in puma tourism in Torres del Paine and beyond.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) cause significant damage to agriculture and native ecosystems and can transmit diseases to animals and people. Management responses designed to reduce population numbers are needed to mitigate these threats. Identifying networks of key actors, including the ways in which they interact, is valuable for purposes of better understanding opportunities or constraints that generate or impede effective management responses. The goal of our study was to understand the network of organizations, and the personnel working within them, that were active in wild pig management, research, or policy initiatives in Missouri during 2018-2020 by 1) identifying individuals and organizations involved in the network, 2) investigating the attributes of relevant personnel, 3) determining the structural patterns of the network, and 4) examining how the network structure could be optimized to improve communication and collaboration efforts. Results from a social network analysis identified 150 personnel affiliated with 26 organizations actively working on wild pig issues in Missouri. The network was largely homogenous based on respondents' attributes, had low density, and was relatively fragmented, small, decentralized with few ties per node, and separated with few brokers. We emphasize the importance of understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a network's structure in facilitating effective collective action to manage wild pigs.

AB  - The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) populations in Yunnan Nangunhe National Nature Reserve (NNNR) represents the smallest known population in China and geographically isolated from other Asian elephant populations, potentially leading to their gradual extinction over time. Therefore, multi-scale habitat selection and habitat suitability analyses were conducted in this study to understand the key factors influencing the distribution of this population by employing camera-trap monitoring, unmanned aerial survey, and species distribution models. The results showed that elephant groups and solitary elephants exhibited strong selectivity for most habitat factors above 800 m, with elephant groups demonstrating higher vegetation requirements than solitary elephants. There are relatively few areas in NNNR where the habitat suitability for elephant groups and solitary elephants was good and high, primarily located in valley areas near rivers. The primary factors limiting their distribution were the presence of complex terrain and roads in large spaces surrounding the study area. Therefore, facilitating movement and genetic exchange between Asian elephants in this area and other populations by constructing corridors is challenging. Furthermore, based on the findings, it is advisable to adopt ex situ conservation to improve the population development of Asian elephants in NNNR. The insights gained from this research provide valuable guidance for the effective conservation and management of Asian elephants, contributing to their long-term survival and the preservation of biodiversity in the region.

AB  - The reduced cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed researchers to generate nuclear and mitochondrial genome data to gain deeper insights into the phylogeography, evolutionary history and biology of non-model species. While the Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) has been well-studied across its range with traditional genetic markers over the last 25 years, researchers are building on this knowledge by generating whole genome, population-level data sets to improve understanding of the genetic composition and evolutionary history of the species. Using publicly available NGS data, we assembled 40 Cape buffalo mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from four protected areas in South Africa, expanding the geographical range and almost doubling the number of mitogenomes available for this species. Coverage of the mitogenomes ranged from 154 to 1036X. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity for Kruger National Park (n = 15) and Mokala National Park (n = 5) were similar to diversity levels in southern and eastern Africa. Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (n = 15) had low levels of genetic diversity, with only four haplotypes detected, reflecting its past bottleneck. Addo Elephant National Park (n = 5) had the highest nucleotide diversity of all populations across Africa, which was unexpected, as it is known to have low nuclear diversity. This diversity was driven by a highly divergent mitogenome from one sample, which was subsequently identified in another sample via Sanger sequencing of the cytochrome b gene. Using a fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analysis, we estimated that this lineage diverged from all other Cape buffalo lineages approximately 2.51 million years ago. We discuss several potential sources of this mitogenome but propose that it most likely originated through introgressive hybridisation with an extinct buffalo species, either S. acoelotus or S. antiquus. We conclude by discussing the conservation consequences of this finding for the Addo Elephant National Park population, proposing careful genetic management to prevent inbreeding depression while maintaining this highly unique diversity.

AB  - The belowground compartment of terrestrial ecosystems drives nutrient cycling, the decomposition and stabilisation of organic matter, and supports aboveground life. Belowground consumers create complex food webs that regulate functioning, ensure stability and support biodiversity both below and above ground. However, existing soil food-web reconstructions do not match recently accumulated empirical evidence and there is no comprehensive reproducible approach that accounts for the complex resource, size and spatial structure of food webs in soil. Here I build on generic food-web organisation principles and use multifunctional classification of soil protists, invertebrates and vertebrates, to reconstruct a 'multichannel' food web across size classes of soil-associated consumers. I infer weighted trophic interactions among trophic guilds using feeding preferences and prey protection traits (evolutionarily inherited traits), size and spatial distributions (niche overlaps), and biomass-dependent feeding. I then use food-web reconstruction, together with assimilation efficiencies, to calculate energy fluxes assuming a steady-state energetic system. Based on energy fluxes, I propose a number of indicators, related to stability, biodiversity and multiple ecosystem-level functions such as herbivory, top-down control, translocation and transformation of organic matter. I illustrate this approach with an empirical example, comparing it with traditional resource-focused soil food-web reconstruction. The multichannel reconstruction can be used to assess 'trophic multifunctionality' (analogous to ecosystem multifunctionality), i.e. simultaneous support of multiple trophic functions by the food web, and compare it across communities and ecosystems spanning beyond the soil. With further empirical validation of the proposed functional indicators, this multichannel reconstruction approach could provide an effective tool for understanding animal diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in soil. This tool hopefully will inspire more researchers to describe soil communities and belowground-aboveground interactions comprehensively. Such studies will provide informative indicators for including consumers as active agents in biogeochemical models, not only locally but also on regional and global scales.

AB  - Global environmental change exerts growing pressure on biodiversity. Anthropogenic climate and land use change are particularly important drivers of biodiversity loss. While their effects on biodiversity have been widely studied individually, interactions among them are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of two common drivers of global change, increased temperature and nitrogen fertilization, on host-plant quality and herbivore performance in the butterfly Lycaena tityrus. We show that butterfly performance was positively affected by plants grown at increased temperatures and nitrogen fertilization, the latter being in line with the nitrogen limitation hypothesis. Effects were largely consistent across treatments; that is, nitrogen deposition and temperature did not interact strongly to affect herbivore performance. Overall, females suffered more strongly than males from poor host-plant quality. Our study demonstrates changes in host-plant quality caused by variation in temperature and nitrogen availability, which induced indirect effects in an herbivore. Such indirect effects of global environmental change are an important source of variation and should be considered in order to reduce uncertainties with regard to the effects of global change on biodiversity.

AB  - Monitoring the body condition of feral horses is important for animal welfare considerations and to anticipate population densities that affect the ecosystem. Monthly adult body condition scores (BCS) were estimated in a population of feral horses in an Argentine grassland nature reserve in 2001 and 2002, when the population reached maximum historical density approaching estimated carrying capacity. Monthly mean BCS showed a seasonal pattern. Female BCS was higher throughout 2001 with respect to 2002, while males only showed this pattern between wet seasons. BCS was higher for males than for females throughout the study and also higher during the wet season for both sexes. Mean monthly BCS of males was correlated to precipitation of the previous month, which is known to determine grass productivity in the area. Lower BCS values for females can be explained by the additional energy expenditure associated with pregnancy and lactation. In many cases, continuous monitoring of body condition is not possible and then it is important to identify times of the year when it is a more sensitive indicator of the population's proximity to carrying capacity. For the area, this would be during the peak of rainfall in autumn or the minimum of rainfall in winter. The estimates corresponding to females would be especially accurate considering their dependence to density and rainfall. The implementation of management measures guided by BCS could avoid reaching population levels close to carrying capacity, reducing the negative impacts on the environment and on the welfare of the horses themselves.

AB  - Anthropogenic-induced climate change is having profound impacts on aquatic ecosystems, and the resilience of fish populations will be determined by their response to these impacts. The northern Namibian coast is an ocean warming hotspot, with temperatures rising faster than the global average. The rapid warming in Namibia has had considerable impacts on marine fauna, such as the southern extension of the distribution of Argyrosomus coronus from southern Angola into northern Namibian waters, where it now overlaps and hybridizes with the closely related Namibian species, A. inodorus. Understanding how these species (and their hybrids) perform at current and future temperatures is vital to optimize adaptive management for Argyrosomus species. Intermittent flow-through respirometry was used to quantify standard and maximum metabolic rates for Argyrosomus individuals across a range of temperatures. The modelled aerobic scope (AS) of A. inodorus was notably higher at cooler temperatures (12, 15, 18 and 21 degrees C) compared with that of A. coronus, whereas the AS was similar at 24 degrees C. Although only five hybrids were detected and three modelled, their AS was in the upper bounds of the models at 15, 18 and 24 degrees C. These findings suggest that the warming conditions in northern Namibia may increasingly favour A. coronus and promote the poleward movement of the leading edge of their southern distribution. In contrast, the poor aerobic performance of both species at cold temperatures (12 degrees C) suggests that the cold water associated with the permanent Luderitz Upwelling Cell in the south may constrain both species to central Namibia. This is most concerning for A. inodorus because it may be subjected to a considerable coastal squeeze.
   This study used metabolic experiments to show that ocean warming in southern Angola and northern Namibia will likely favour Argyrosomus coronus over its cooler water relative, A. inodorus. Hybrids of the two species seem to be competitive and hybridization may provide opportunities for physiological adaptation to climate change.

AB  - Obtaining information about the eye arterial supply in the buffalo can be a criterion for ocular diseases diagnosis and give a morphological basis for even more researches on the related clinical surgery of this animal. The aim of the present study was to describe the course and branches of the arteries supplying the eye in the adult river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). In this study, the heads of eight buffaloes were prepared from the public slaughterhouse and dissected to study the eye arterial supply. This research results showed that the eye blood supply in the buffalo originates from the external ophthalmic, internal ophthalmic, superficial temporal and malar arteries. The external ophthalmic artery was given rise to branches to take part in the ophthalmic rete mirabile formation and also given off lacrimal, external ethmoidal, supraorbital and ciliary arteries as well as muscular branches to supply the eye ball and extra-ocular muscles. The internal ophthalmic artery was one of the sources of lateral posterior long ciliary artery. The superficial temporal artery was detached off some branches to supply the lateral angle of inferior and superior eyelids as well as lacrimal branch to supply lacrimal gland. The malar artery was originated from the infra-orbital artery and its branches were supplied the medial angle of inferior, superior and third eyelids. There were no obvious differences between buffalo and yak regarding arteries supplying the eyes. However, there were minor differences between buffalo and oxen, sheep and goat and there were obvious differences between buffalo and camel and giraffe. (C) 2021 Urmia University.

AB  - Indian yaks (Bos grunniens) have experienced a significant decline in their population in recent years, primarily due to reduced economic returns from bovid products and the lack of mainstream markets for yak milk and meat. This decline has led to a decreased interest among younger generations in continuing the tradition of nomadic yak herding. To establish effective conservation strategies and improvement plans, it is imperative to conduct in-depth studies on these animals, uncovering their genetic intricacies and identifying key genomic variants associated with adaptive traits. The present study focuses on whole-genome sequencing data from diverse Indian yak populations to elucidate the genomic adaptations associated with high-altitude hypoxia tolerance, physiological resilience, coat color variations, and skeletal modifications. Despite the critical role of yaks in these regions, the comprehensive genetic structure and evolutionary dynamics of these animals remain largely unexplored. Through comparative analyses using interpopulation statistical methodologies, including Fixation Index (FST) and Nucleotide Diversity Ratio (theta pi), we examined the genetic makeup of Arunachali, Himachali, and Ladakhi yak populations alongside the Chinese Jinchuan yak. This analysis identified genomic loci subjected to selective pressures, revealing a suite of candidate genes indicative of adaptation to distinct environmental niches. Our integration of FST and theta pi analyses highlighted substantial genetic signatures of selection, particularly in the Ladakhi yak, which exhibits enhanced adaptation to high-altitude environments. Notably, Ladakhi yaks demonstrated enriched pathways associated with altitude adaptation, underscoring their superior resilience compared to other Indian yak breeds. Comparative analyses between Indian and Chinese yaks unveiled distinctive genetic profiles, with Chinese yaks showing enrichment in pathways associated with tameness and domestication. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of high-altitude adaptation and the diverse selective forces shaping the genomes of yak populations. Our study will contribute crucial knowledge on the genetic relationships between Indian yak populations, which is essential for the conservation of this native germplasm.

AB  - Plants interact in complex networks but how network structure depends on resources, natural enemies and species resource-use strategy remains poorly understood. Here, we quantified competition networks among 18 plants varying in fast-slow strategy, by testing how increased nutrient availability and reduced foliar pathogens affected intra- and inter-specific interactions. Our results show that nitrogen and pathogens altered several aspects of network structure, often in unexpected ways due to fast and slow growing species responding differently. Nitrogen addition increased competition asymmetry in slow growing networks, as expected, but decreased it in fast growing networks. Pathogen reduction made networks more even and less skewed because pathogens targeted weaker competitors. Surprisingly, pathogens and nitrogen dampened each other's effect. Our results show that plant growth strategy is key to understand how competition respond to resources and enemies, a prediction from classic theories which has rarely been tested by linking functional traits to competition networks.
   In this paper, we combine ecological theory of biodiversity maintenance and a large field experiment manipulating factorially nitrogen enrichment and foliar pathogen abundance in a perennial grassland composed of 18 species in central Europe (Switzerland) to determine how competition networks within fast and slow growing strategies (defined by their specific leaf area) are modified by resources and leaf fungal enemies. We found that nitrogen and leaf fungal pathogens reshaped the structure of plant interactions, however, fast and slow growing species often responded differently to treatments. Our results show that fast-slow traits are key in determining how species interactions change with resource addition and enemy removal.image

AB  - Plants and insects are the most diverse and ecologically important organisms in the terrestrial biosphere. Their interactions are also among the richest biotic relationships, and offer significant insights into the evolution of terrestrial ecosystem complexity through the geological record. This investigation of the late Rhaetian Xujiahe and the earliest Jurassic Zhenzhuchong floral assemblages provides the first data on foliar herbivory generated by terrestrial arthropods across the Triassic-Jurassic transition in the eastern Tethys (East Asia) region. The damage types from two fossil assemblages are collectively attributed to seven functional feeding and egg-laying categories (i.e., hole feeding, margin feeding, surface feeding, skeletonization, piercing and sucking, oviposition, and galling). Most feeding strategies are spread across the major plant groups and persist through the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, with the exception of skeletonization (a category of external foliage feeding), which was restricted to the latest Triassic within dipteridacean ferns. The survey reveals that the respective frequency and diversity of interactions between plants and insects prior to and following the end-Triassic mass extinction event are almost the same, despite a substantial turnover of floral components. This suggest that insect herbivores were largely able to transfer to alternative (but commonly related) plant groups during the dramatic floristic turnover and environmental changes at the end of the Triassic. Sporadic occurrences of foliar modifications, such as marginal cusps on pinnules of Pterophyllum and prominent ridges on the rachises of some ferns and bennettites are interpreted as adaptations for defense against insect herbivores. A few differences in taxonomic composition and herbivory representation between the latest Triassic Xujiahe flora and the earliest Jurassic Zhenzhuchong flora are more likely to be related to collection and preservational biases rather than reflecting palaeoecological changes. We encourage further investigations exploring the distribution of insect damage in fossil floras from other palaeolatitudinal zones and spanning other major extinction events to develop a better understanding of terrestrial ecosystem responses to major crises in Earth's history.

AB  - (Semi-)natural ecosystems provide many important benefits to nature and people, but are often located near populated and urbanized areas across the globe. During recreational activities, many people bring dogs into peri-urban forests and nature, but their nutrient inputs per unit space and time via dog faeces and urine into ecosystems remain scarcely quantified. Here, we estimate net fertilization rates of dogs in peri-urban ecosystems, with a focus on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) because of their evident effects on plant biodiversity. We used 487 direct-count censuses over 1.5 years to collect accurate dog abundance data per hectare per year in four sites in peri-urban forests and nature reserves in Belgium. Based on estimated dog densities and a systematic literature search of nutrient concentrations in urine and faeces, we calculate N and P fertilization rates from urine and faeces deposits, also propagating uncertainty and variability in these estimates. We find that canine N and P fertilization rates on average amount to 11 kg N (more or less equally from urine and faeces) and 5 kg P (predominantly from faeces) per hectare per year, respectively. These estimated amounts are substantial when compared to atmospheric inputs of N and extractable amounts via traditional nature management (e.g. mowing and hay removal). Our estimated dog N and P fertilization rates in peri-urban forests and nature are substantial. Such levels of nutrient inputs may considerably influence biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and co-determine restoration outcomes. Our results underpin the need for managers and policy makers to more often (i) consider currently neglected nutrient inputs by dogs in management plans and restoration goals, (ii) communicate to dog walkers the role of their dog as 'fertilizer' and highlight the necessity to remove at least canine solid faecal waste, (iii) in sensitive oligotrophic ecosystems with species adapted to nutrient-poor soils, establish nearby off-leash dog parks, enforce the use of short leashes and/or apply dog bans such that high dog abundances can be avoided.

AB  - Introduction: Epizoochorous dispersal of grassland plants by large herbivores is an important way by which grassland plants achieve population expansion over long distances. However, little is known about the maximum distance that seeds can be dispersed by domestic animals under seasonal grazing, which is the most common type of grassland management worldwide, especially in alpine regions.
   Methods: To this end, we estimated the distance over which epizoochory dispersal occurs via yaks (Poephagus grunniens) for seven common plant species seeds in an alpine meadow under seasonal grazing using a simulated yak-fur seed adhesion test combined with observations of grazing behavior.
   Results: The results showed that, as yak primary (e.g., walking time) and secondary (e.g., foraging rate) behavioral patterns differed significantly across seasons (P< 0.05), the epizoochory dispersal distances of plant seeds also had clear seasonal dynamics, manifesting as spring > summer > autumn > winter, and that the length of seed adhesive structures correlated positively with the retention rate as well as retention time on yak fur. The relatively slow loss of diaspores observed in this study mainly shows that moving yak from one seasonal pasture to the following allows the dispersal of diaspores between two successive pastures. The dispersal scale was even wider (maximum dispersal distance of similar to 35 km) for seeds with special appendages (i.e., mucilage, sticking to the fur due to mucilage presence).
   Discussion: Our results highlight that yaks are substantial seed dispersal vectors for alpine meadow plants and that seasonal grazing is a suitable management method for coping with habitat fragmentation as well as plant diversity conservation in alpine areas from the perspective of seed dispersal.

AB  - Climate change is altering the functioning of foundational ecosystems. While the direct effects of warming are expected to influence individual species, the indirect effects of warming on species interactions remain poorly understood. In marine systems, as tropical herbivores undergo poleward range expansion, they may change food web structure and alter the functioning of key habitats. While this process ('tropicalization') has been documented within declining kelp forests, we have a limited understanding of how this process might unfold across other systems. Here we use a network of sites spanning 23 degrees of latitude to explore the effects of increased herbivory (simulated via leaf clipping) on the structure of a foundational marine plant (turtlegrass). By working across its geographic range, we also show how gradients in light, temperature and nutrients modified plant responses. We found that turtlegrass near its northern boundary was increasingly affected (reduced productivity) by herbivory and that this response was driven by latitudinal gradients in light (low insolation at high latitudes). By contrast, low-latitude meadows tolerated herbivory due to high insolation which enhanced plant carbohydrates. We show that as herbivores undergo range expansion, turtlegrass meadows at their northern limit display reduced resilience and may be under threat of ecological collapse.
   Conducting a simulated turtlegrass herbivory experiment across 650 experimental plots and 13 seagrass meadows, the authors show that the negative effects of herbivory increase with latitude, driven by low levels of light insolation at high latitudes.

AB  - Increases in frequency of anthropogenic and natural disturbances exacerbated by climate change are disrupting animal movement patterns and, in turn, species distribution and abundance. Habitat models are a valuable approach for predicting how a species or population is distributed across habitats. However, in these models, the environmental characteristics describing habitat are typically constant over time which is inaccurate for a frequently disturbed landscape. The goal of this study is to assess the degree to which frequent disturbances can alter abundance and distribution, to the point of which inferences from static habitat maps are no longer relevant. We simulated individual animal movement in a dynamically disturbed landscape and compared the observed spatial relative abundance to the one predicted from a static habitat model fit to the simulated trajectories. We found that the prediction error is higher when the landscape is disturbed than where there are no disturbances. This result holds even with the addition of life-history and demographic processes to the model which would facilitate the discovery of novel habitat by increasing density-dependent movement, thereby bringing the spatial distribution of individuals closer to a proportion of habitat quality arising from the population at equilibrium assumption underlying most habitat models. In the context of species at risk recovery planning, using habitat models with constant environmental covariates to forecast animal locations in areas with more frequent disturbances as a result of climate change will likely produce inaccurate predictions.

AB  - Microzooplankton play a critical role as herbivores and nutrient recyclers in marine ecosystems, yet their importance is often overlooked. In the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, particularly in Uruguayan waters -a transitional zone between subtropical and subantarctic regions- data on microzooplankton are scarce. This study estimates microzooplankton herbivory in this region for the first time. Monthly samples were collected from July 2019 to June 2020 at the surface and intermediate depths (similar to 3.5 m, where fluorescence maxima typically occur) near Cabo Polonio (34 degrees 23'30"S-53 degrees 45'54''W). Using chlorophyll a (Chl a) as a tracer, dilution experiments were conducted to quantify daily phytoplankton growth (mu), microzooplankton-induced mortality (m), and herbivory pressure (m/mu). CTD data, nutrients and Chl a concentration, and grazers abundance, biomass, and composition were analyzed to examine patterns in biological rates associated to environmental variability and community structure. The study site showed marked seasonal variability in water conditions (temperature range 11.4-22.4 degrees C, salinity range 17.6-32.8). The grazer community was dominated by dinoflagellates in autumn and ciliates in summer. Annual averages of mu and m were 0.36 +/- 0.60 d(-)(1) , and 0.74 +/- 0.68 d(-)(1) , respectively, with a strong correlation (slope = 0.94), suggesting that microzooplankton grazing accounted for most phytoplankton mortality. Biological rates exhibited large variability across seasons and depths, with no significant differences. Annually, grazing removed an average of 115 % (range: 0-383 %) of primary production, consistent across seasons. Biological rates showed no association with environmental variables but correlated strongly with grazer abundance, biomass, and composition. Higher phytoplankton growth rates occurred at lower abundances of large ciliates, generalist non-constitutive mixotrophs (e.g., Strombidium and Laboea spp.) and strict phagotrophs (Protoperidinium and Tintinnopsis spp.), as well as lower total microzooplankton biomass. Higher microzooplankton grazing rates were linked to lower abundances of constitutive mixotrophic dinoflagellates (Tripos spp.). Results indicate a robust and resilient trophic link, with microzooplankton exerting sustained high herbivory pressure despite environmental variability. While environmental conditions shape community structure, the functional role of microzooplankton herbivory remains consistent across seasons, underscoring their essential role in coastal-marine ecosystems.

AB  - Traditionally, trophic ecology research on aquatic ecosystems has focused more on the quantity of dietary energy flow within food webs rather than food quality and its effects on organisms at various trophic levels. Recent studies emphasize that food quality is central to consumer growth and reproduction, and the importance of food quality for aquatic ecosystems has become increasingly well recognized. It is timely to synthesise these findings and identify potential future research directions. We conducted a systematic review of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (& omega;3-PUFAs) as a crucial component of high-quality food sources in freshwater ecosystems to evaluate their impact on a variety of consumers, and explore the effects of global change on these high-quality food sources and their transfer to higher trophic consumers within and across ecosystems. In freshwater ecosystems, algae rich in & omega;3 long-chain PUFAs, such as diatoms, dinoflagellates and cryptophytes, represent important high-quality food sources for consumers, whereas cyanobacteria, green algae, terrestrial vascular plants and macrophytes low in & omega;3 long-chain PUFAs are low-quality food sources. High-quality & omega;3-PUFA-containing food sources usually lead to increased growth and reproduction of aquatic consumers, e.g. benthic invertebrates, zooplankton and fish, and also provide & omega;3 long-chain PUFAs to riparian terrestrial consumers via emergent aquatic insects. Consumers feeding on high-quality & omega;3-PUFA-containing foods in turn represent high-quality food for their own predators. However, the & omega;3-PUFA content of food sources is sensitive to global environmental changes. Warming, eutrophication, increased light intensity (e.g. from loss of riparian shading), and pollutants potentially inhibit the synthesis of algal & omega;3-PUFAs while at the same time promoting the growth of lower-quality foods, such as cyanobacteria and green algae. These factors combined could lead to a significant reduction in the availability of & omega;3-PUFAs for consumers and constrain their overall fitness. Although the effect of individual environmental factors on high-quality & omega;3-PUFA-containing food sources has been investigated, multiple environmental factors (e.g. climate change, human activities, pollution) will act in combination and any synergistic effects on aquatic food webs remain unclear. Identifying the sources and fate of & omega;3-PUFAs within and across ecosystems could represent an important approach to understand the impact of multiple environmental factors on trophic relationships and the implications for populations of freshwater and riparian consumers. Maintaining the availability of high-quality & omega;3-PUFA-containing food sources may also be key to mitigating freshwater biodiversity loss due to global change.

AB  - Caribou are keystone species important for human harvest and of conservation concern; even so, much is unknown about the impact of parasites on caribou health and ecology. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence, tissue prevalence, and diversity of tissue-dwelling coccidian parasites (including Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Sarcocystis spp.) in 88 migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) harvested for human consumption in two communities in Nunavik, Que & PRIME;bec, Canada. Both T. gondii and N. caninum have potential to cause abortions and neurological disease in caribou. Seroprevalence for antibodies to T. gondii using ELISA on fluid from thawed hearts was 18% overall, and no DNA of T. gondii was detected in tissues, which has positive implications for food safety since this parasite is zoonotic. Seroprevalence for antibodies to N. caninum using competitive ELISA was 5%, and DNA of N. caninum was detected in only one heart sample. DNA of Sarcocystis, a non-zoonotic, related coccidian, was detected in tissue samples from 85% of caribou, with higher prevalence in heart (82%) than skeletal muscle (47%). This is the first time that Sarcocystis spp. from caribou in Canada have been identified to species level, many of which have been described in reindeer from Fennoscandia. The high prevalence and diversity of Sarcocystis spp. suggests intact trophic relationships between canids and caribou in Nunavik. Besnoitia spp. was serendipitously detected in three muscle samples, a parasite previously associated with skin lesions in caribou in Nunavik. Community-level differences in T. gondii exposure and prevalence of Sarcocystis spp. in skeletal muscle tissues may reflect differences in hunter selection of individual animals and muscles, or possibly regional differences in the ecology of carnivore definitive hosts for these parasites. Further work is needed to explore effects of tissue coccidians in caribou, their taxonomic classifications, and community level differences in parasite prevalence and diversity.

AB  - The potential for targeted grazing for restoration through the removal of invasive species represents an effective tool for practitioners. This study examines the impact of targeted grazing across highly variable precipitation on buffelgrass, a widely introduced African grass that often escapes cultivation. We simulated targeted grazing, overgrazing, and no grazing by clipping at two intensities and not clipping in a third treatment. We did this in plots with buffelgrass invasion and documented buffelgrass size and reproduction, as well as native plant community diversity. Additionally, as a further proxy for grazing, we tracked root allocation by buffelgrass in mowed and unmowed plots for 25 months while documenting large variability in precipitation. We found that targeted grazing reduced the negative impact of buffelgrass on the native community; on the other hand, overgrazing reduced the native community diversity. Precipitation interacted with simulated grazing such that buffelgrass subjected to grazing was less tolerant to drought and future simulated herbivory after rains returned. Long-term targeted grazing may lead to reductions in buffelgrass that allow the restoration of the native plant community, which benefits the biodiversity of flora and fauna, and supports multiple uses of rangelands.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change poses a substantial challenge to many organisms, to which they need to respond to avoid fitness reductions. Investigating responses to environmental change is particularly interesting in herbivores, as they are potentially affected by indirect effects mediated via variation in host-plant quality. We here use the herbivorous insect Pieris napi to investigate geographic variation in the response to variation in food quality. We performed a common garden experiment using replicated populations from Germany and Italy, and manipulated host quality by growing host plants at different temperature and water regimes. We found that feeding on plants grown at a higher temperature generally diminished the performance of P. napi, evidenced by a prolonged development time and reduced larval growth rate, body mass, fat content, and phenoloxidase activity. Genotype by environment interactions (G x E) were present in several performance traits, indicating that Italian populations (1) respond more strongly to variation in host-plant quality and (2) are more sensitive to poor food quality than German ones. This may reflect a cost of the rapid lifestyle found in Italian populations. Consequently, German populations may be more resilient against environmental perturbations and may perhaps even benefit from warmer temperatures, while Italian populations will likely suffer from the concomitantly reduced host-plant quality. Our study thus exemplifies how investigating G x E may help to better understand the vulnerability of populations to climate change.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) are three essential soil nutrients for plant growth, and their stoichiometric ratios are already important indices of elemental balance and the soil fertility status in soil ecosystems. The evolution mechanism of the SOC, Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorus (TP), and stoichiometry following the "conversion of cropland to forest program" (CCFP) in southwest China is not yet clear. Seven different CCFP restoration models, including Zenia insignis (RD), Toona sinensis (XC), Castanea mollissima (BL), Citrus reticulate (GJ), Zenia insignis and Guimu-1 elephant grass (RG), Guimu-1 elephant grass (GM), and abandoned cropland (LH), were chosen to explore changes in the concentration and stoichiometry of the SOC, TN, and TP, and their recovery times, at a depth of 0-100 cm. The results indicate that the SOC and TN concentrations in different restoration models all increased with restoration years in the topsoil, whereas the soil TP concentration remained relatively stable. The soil C:N and C:P ratios increased with increasing restoration years in the topsoil, whereas the N: P ratio was relatively stable over time. After ten years of reforestation, the SOC and TN concentrations decreased as the soil layer increased. The effects of the restoration model on the C: N ratios were greater in shallow soils. Our results suggest a complex reaction of SOC, soil TN, and soil TP concentrations and stoichiometry to the vegetation restoration mode, particularly in the topsoil. This research further improves the understanding of SOC, N, and P interactions and restricted nutrition, and provides relevant theoretical support for vegetation restoration in the southwest karst region.

AB  - Background Telemetry studies on terrestrial mammals have been carried out almost exclusively using neck collar-mounted devices. However, collars are not suitable for all species and all age classes and may therefore compromise animal welfare and data quality requirements. Here, we evaluate the use of non-collar tracking devices on wild boars (Sus scrofa), a species for which collars may be problematic due to neck shape and seasonal body mass variation. We tested pelt-glued tags and three types of GPS ear tags. In addition, animals were marked with plain cattle ear tags. Results The tested GPS tags exhibited various technical challenges related mostly to satellite coverage of the study area and tag loss. However, GPS devices enabled moderate movement monitoring of weeks to months, whereas plain cattle ear tags offered information on displacement over longer time intervals. The longest direct dispersal distance (163 km) by a wild boar sounder was discovered by cattle tags. Conclusions Data volume and quality obtained from small tags are inferior to data provided by GPS collars, but low-fix rate tags may enable monitoring of individuals with reduced invasiveness. Moreover, these tags enable tracking in cases where the collar is not an option. The low price and small size of the devices together with technical developments may offer cost-effective tools for future studies on dispersal and survival.

AB  - Genetic composition can influence host susceptibility to, and transmission of, pathogens, with potential population-level consequences. In bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), pneumonia epidemics caused by Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae have been associated with severe population declines and limited recovery across North America. Adult survivors either clear the infection or act as carriers that continually shed M. ovipneumoniae and expose their susceptible offspring, resulting in high rates of lamb mortality for years following the outbreak event. Here, we investigated the influence of genomic composition on persistent carriage of M. ovipneumoniae in a well-studied bighorn sheep herd in the Wallowa Mountains of Oregon, USA. Using 10,605 SNPs generated using RADseq technology for 25 female bighorn sheep, we assessed genomic diversity metrics and employed family-based genome-wide association methodologies to understand variant association and genetic architecture underlying chronic carriage. We observed no differences among genome-wide diversity metrics (heterozygosity and allelic richness) between groups. However, we identified two variant loci of interest and seven associated candidate genes, which may influence carriage status. Further, we found that the SNP panel explained similar to 55% of the phenotypic variance (SNP-based heritability) for M. ovipneumoniae carriage, though there was considerable uncertainty in these estimates. While small sample sizes limit conclusions drawn here, our study represents one of the first to assess the genomic factors influencing chronic carriage of a pathogen in a wild population and lays a foundation for understanding genomic influence on pathogen persistence in bighorn sheep and other wildlife populations. Future research should incorporate additional individuals as well as distinct herds to further explore the genomic basis of chronic carriage.

AB  - Bycatch represents a critical threat to many marine megafauna species. Dynamic ocean management (DOM) has been proposed as means to reduce bycatch interactions but currently, most DOMs provide information products only. These products delineate spatiotemporal areas of high bycatch of specific species with the goal of helping fishers engage in self-directed avoidance. However, the efficacy of information-based DOMs depends on fishers' use and their incentives to do so. We reviewed one of the longest and earliest DOM informational products, TurtleWatch, which is a U.S. government program to provide information to help Hawai'i shallow set pelagic longline fishers avoid North Pacific loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) interactions based on a specific sea surface temperature band. Though TurtleWatch continues to identify a zone of higher interactions, fishers have not been incentivized to use the product. Further, the rate of interactions has increased since TurtleWatch's deployment in 2005, and fishers continued to operate within and closer to the recommended avoidance area as interaction limits were approached. This indicates that the interaction limit, which was shared among all fishers, may have created a common pool resource that disincentivizes individual fishers to avoid hotspots of loggerhead bycatch. As the majority of DOM relies on similar informational products and incentives, our findings suggest strong and appropriate incentives are needed for DOM to reduce bycatch.

AB  - The Tibetan argali (Ovis ammon hodgsoni) is a trans-Himalayan Mountain sheep subspecies at the periphery of its range. The isolated population is a high conservation concern. We examined partial regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from non-invasive samples collected from important habitats in Sikkim to evaluate genetic diversity, phylogenetics, and evolutionary history. Several distinct haplotypes and moderate nucleotide diversity indicated historic isolation and restricted maternal gene flow in argali. Combining new sequences along with available GenBank references, our analysis revealed that Sikkim's Tibetan Argali forms a well-supported clade separated from other O. ammon lineages of central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau. Genetic distance of similar to 2.1-2.3% (cytochrome b divergence) indicates significant matrilineal differentiation. Consistent with phylogeny, the haplotype network depicts it as a separate cluster. The Bayesian Skyline Plot analysis indicates demographic stability, followed by a recent decline, which can be attributed to the negative Tajima's D and Fu's F neutrality tests. Coalescent dating estimates an early Pleistocene divergence (similar to 2.41 million years ago) of Tibetan argali from other populations. Our results provide baseline genetic data for O. a. hodgsoni of Sikkim, highlighting the role of topographic barriers in isolating this population as an Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU). It underlines the necessity of transboundary genetic monitoring and management of O. ammon populations throughout the eastern Himalayas and the significance of integrating molecular data into regional conservation strategies.

AB  - Predator tourism is one strategy to improve tolerance for predators, and support biodiversity and ecosystem health. Torres del Paine National Park (TdP) - a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in southern Chile - supports productive livestock industries and nascent puma tourism. We compared interviews conducted in the region prior to puma tourism, with results from interviews collected across 45 ranches post-puma tourism. We assessed rancher attitudes regarding pumas, puma-livestock conflict, puma tourism, and linked them with socio-ecological factors. Respondents who viewed pumas as a threat experienced higher livestock losses. Respondents who reported higher sheep losses were inclined to support the lethal removal of livestock-killing pumas, and to initiate a puma hunt, whereas respondents who supported puma tourism disagreed with hunting pumas. Using the Potential for Conflict Index, we found that participants exhibited the highest consensus on the benefit of puma tourism and the lowest consensus over lethal removal of pumas. Our results suggest predator tourism has increased tolerance for pumas but is creating new potential for conflict. Previous to puma tourism, ranchers were almost entirely negative about pumas and unanimously supported illegal puma hunting. Now, most believe that pumas are part of Patagonia's heritage. This divide was best explained by distance to TdP: ranches closer to TdP experienced greater losses to pumas but had neighbours that benefitted most from puma tourism. Therefore, we suggest that tourism revenues supplement community compensation insurance programs that reimburse rancher losses to pumas to mitigate the growing divide between those benefiting from pumas and those experiencing economic hardship.

AB  - Background Studies of the African savannas have used national parks to test ecological theories of natural ecosystems, including equilibrium, non-equilibrium, complex adaptive systems, and the role of top-down and bottom-up physical and biotic forces. Most such studies have excluded the impact of pastoralists in shaping grassland ecosystems and, over the last half century, the growing human impact on the world's rangelands. The mounting human impact calls for selecting indicators and integrated monitoring methods able to track ecosystem changes and the role of natural and human agencies. Our study draws on five decades of monitoring the Amboseli landscape in southern Kenya to document the declining role of natural agencies in shaping plant ecology with rising human impact. Results We show that plant diversity and productivity have declined, biomass turnover has increased in response to a downsizing of mean plant size, and that ecological resilience has declined with the rising probability of extreme shortfalls in pasture production. The signature of rainfall and physical agencies in driving ecosystem properties has decreased sharply with growing human impact. We compare the Amboseli findings to the long-term studies of Kruger and Serengeti national parks to show that the human influence, whether by design or default, is increasingly shaping the ecology of savanna ecosystems. We look at the findings in the larger perspective of human impact on African grasslands and the world rangelands, in general, and discuss the implications for ecosystem theory and conservation policy and management. Conclusions The Amboseli study shows the value of using long-term integrated ecological monitoring to track the spatial and temporal changes in the species composition, structure, and function of rangeland ecosystems and the role of natural and human agencies in the process of change. The study echoes the widespread changes underway across African savannas and world's rangelands, concluding that some level of ecosystem management is needed to prevent land degradation and the erosion of ecological function, services, and resilience. Despite the weak application of ecological theory to conservation management, a plant trait-based approach is shown to be useful in explaining the macroecological changes underway.

AB  - Addressing public preferences can enhance wildlife management effectiveness and reduce backlash. We conducted novel research on public acceptance of wildlife management by accounting for the role of underexplored drivers including emotion and political identity across an urban-to-rural gradient. Using data from a 2022 survey about white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Durham County, North Carolina, we analyzed drivers of acceptance for three management strategies: passive management, lethal management by hunting, and lethal management by professionals. Support for deer management varied across the urban-to-rural gradient, as rural residents favored hunting but were less supportive of passive management compared to urban and suburban residents. Emotions and general attitudes toward deer were the strongest predictors of management acceptance. Support for passive management was higher among residents with more positive emotions toward deer, whereas support for lethal strategies was higher among those with more negative emotions. Additionally, political identity emerged as a complex yet influential factor in shaping support for lethal management. Conservative respondents exhibited a higher acceptance of hunting, whereas liberal respondents exhibited a higher acceptance of professional sharpshooting. Collectively, our results demonstrate the ways in which emotions, politics, and other socio-demographic factors interact to influence public support for deer management across the urban-rural gradient. When direct experience with wildlife is lacking (e.g., in urban areas), emotions may act as heuristic guides that shape preferences. Managers aiming to increase deer management acceptability could integrate insights about emotional, political, and demographic drivers of public management support in communication efforts, potentially rendering urban deer management more effective.

AB  - Human-wildlife interaction is a complex issue that has positive as well as negative implications for both humans and wildlife that share the same habitat. In this paper, we used the Wildlife Tolerance Model (WTM) as the theoretical framework to determine the factors that affect tolerance towards the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana), chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) among the Tonga indigenous people of Zimbabwe. We used structural equation modeling for the identification of causal pathways to see which variables - namely, exposure, positive and negative interactions, costs and benefits - affect toler-ance. Our study finds that intangible benefits are the most significant determinants of tolerance across all three species. Contradictory to the expectations, tangible cost had no effect on the tolerance for any of the three species. We find that reducing exposure would also have a strong mediating effect on tangible and intangible costs from the three species. We discuss the roles that socio-economic and cultural factors play to help explain the differences in communities' attitudes towards the three species. We conclude that more emphasis should be given to increasing the awareness of the intangible benefits, such as the ecosystem services provided by the species. Finally, we recommend using the WTM to help establish a mitigation strategy for the targeted communities and then conducting a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study to evaluate the true impact of those mitigation strategies on the communities' wildlife tolerance.

AB  - The diet of predators can be highly variable, which is exemplified by their ability to acclimate to a wide range of ecological conditions. Such flexibility in foraging may be a key aspect of their performance in unpredictable environments such as at the edge of the range of a species or where food availability varies greatly in time and space. Gaining information on the diets of predators under such conditions could foster our comprehension of their ecological flexibility and the potential role of predation on the population dynamics of prey. We determined the diet of wolves (Canis lupus) and black bears (Ursus americanus) in northern Quebec and Labrador (Canada) within the range of two migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herds: the high-abundance Riviere-aux-Feuilles herd (RFH) and low-abundance Riviere-George herd (RGH). Worldwide, decline in caribou populations has become a concern, stressing the need to better understand the factors involved in these declines, including predation. In northern Quebec (RFH range), caribou was the primary year-round prey of wolves while moose (Alces alces) and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) were consumed in some sectors. The diet of wolves in northern Labrador (RGH range) varied seasonally, with caribou, moose, and fish as main prey during different periods throughout the year. Black bear diets varied seasonally and regionally. Among the foods we analyzed, caribou was the main source of animal protein for bears in northern Quebec and northern Labrador, except during a high abundance of Ungava collared lemming (Dicrostonyx hudsonius). Only bears in northern Quebec ate caribou during late summer/fall. Our results highlight the diet flexibility of wolves and black bears in northern food webs, and how their diets change in relation to the distribution and abundance of prey. Our results will help quantify the potential impact of these predators on prey populations in northern systems.

AB  - Motion-sensitive cameras are commonly used to monitor wildlife occupancy rates; however, few studies have assessed whether data from cameras are correlated with density estimates obtained from more traditional labor-intensive methods such as those based on capture-mark-recapture. We used data from a boreal forest community to test whether camera data were correlated with densities estimated from independent monitoring methods. We placed 72 covert cameras in the forest around Lhu'aan Man' (Kluane Lake), Yukon, Canada, for 7 years and tracked changes in population densities by camera hit rates. We independently estimated population densities of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) using capture-mark-recapture via live trapping, and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), coyotes (Canis latrans), and moose (Alces americanus) by snow track transects. Density estimates obtained from conventional aerial surveys were also periodically available for moose. Except for red squirrels, camera hit rates were highly correlated with population density estimates obtained by traditional methods, including across a large range of estimated densities corresponding to cyclic population dynamics in several species. Accordingly, we infer that motion-sensitive cameras could supplement or replace traditional methods for monitoring key species in boreal forest food webs. Using cameras to monitor population change has several advantages; they require less effort in the field, are non-invasive compared to live-trapping, include multiple species at the same time, and rely less on weather than either aerial surveys or snow track transects. Tracking changes across the vast boreal forest is becoming increasingly necessary because of climate and landscape change and our data validate the use of motion-sensitive cameras to provide a useful quantitative method for state-of-the-environment reporting.
   We used data from a Yukon boreal forest community to test whether motion-sensitive camera data were correlated with density estimated from independent monitoring. Camera hit rates were highly correlated with capture-mark-recapture density estimates for snowshoe hares and were highly correlated with snow track transect density estimates for lynx and coyotes. Camera hit rates were not correlated with independent density estimates for red squirrels. image

AB  - Translocations are essential for re-establishing wildlife populations. As they sometimes fail, it is critical to assess factors that influence their success pre-translocation. Socioecological suitability models (SESMs) integrate social acceptance and ecological suitability to enable identification of areas where wildlife populations will expand, which makes it likely that SESMs will also be useful for predicting translocation success. To inform site selection for potential elk Cervus canadensis reintroduction to north-eastern Minnesota, United States, we developed broadscale maps of social acceptance from surveys of local residents and landowners, animal use equivalence (AUE) from forage measured in the field and empirical conflict risk from geospatial data. Resulting SESMs integrated social acceptance favourability scores, AUE and conflict risk, and weighted SESMs showed the relative influences of acceptance and conflict. Social acceptance was positive for local residents and landowners (mean >= 5.4; scale of 1-7). AUE (scaled to an elk home range) ranged between 1 and 9 elk/16 km(2) during winter, and from 14 to 83 elk/16 km(2) during summer. Human-elk conflict risk was low (mean <= 0.10; scaled 0-1), increasing from north to south. Geographical distributions differed for social acceptance, AUE and conflict risk, and weighted SESMs revealed unsuitable areas that were otherwise obscured. Synthesis and applications. Integrating human-wildlife conflict risk into SESMs shows where social acceptance of translocated species is likely to erode, even where viewed favourably pre-translocation, to inform translocation planning by highlighting interactions between key factors. Such integrated models supplement existing reintroduction biology frameworks by supporting decision-making and knowledge development. In north-eastern Minnesota, natural resource managers who are considering elk reintroductions are using SESMs reported here to identify where human-elk conflict is unlikely to result in an isolated elk population and where addressing concerns for area residents about conflict risk is essential.

AB  - Warming temperatures are allowing native insect herbivores to expand into regions that previously exceeded their thermal tolerance, encounter new host species, and pose significant threats to native communities. However, the dynamics of these expansions remain poorly understood, particularly in the extent to which outbreaks remain reliant on emigration from historical hosts or are driven by local reproduction within novel hosts in the expanded range. We tested these non-mutually exclusive hypotheses using spatially explicit data on mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), which historically undergoes intermittent outbreaks in low-elevation lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), but is now causing severe mortality in a high-elevation endangered species, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). We compiled data from 2000 to 2019 across British Columbia, Canada, at 1-km(2) resolution, and analyzed spatiotemporal patterns of beetle infestations, lodgepole pine distributions, expansion into habitats dominated by whitebark pine, and the likelihood of future outbreaks in all pine communities under simulated conditions. Overall, we found strong support for the hypothesis of emigration from the historical host species continuing to be a major driver of outbreaks in the more recently accessed host. First, beetle population pressure was consistently the best predictor of infestation severity in both lodgepole and whitebark pine, and appeared to be mostly unidirectional from lodgepole to whitebark pine. Second, infestations in lodgepole pine were of a longer duration than those in whitebark pine, which appeared too brief to sustain transitions from endemic to eruptive dynamics. Furthermore, resource depletion appears to drive emigration from lodgepole pine, whereas in whitebark pine drought appears to favor establishment of immigrants although bioclimatic factors and stand structure preclude self-sustaining outbreaks. Finally, we project that most pine in British Columbia will be at risk in the event of a new major outbreak. We describe implications for conserving and protecting whitebark pine and to other climate-driven range expansions.

AB  - Microplastics are heterogeneously distributed in soils. However, it is unknown whether soil microplastic heterogeneity affects plant growth and root foraging responses and whether such effects vary with plant species and microplastic types. We grew each of seven herbaceous species (Platycodon grandiflorus, Trifolium repens, Portulaca oleracea, Medicago sativa, Taraxacum mongolicum, Perilla frutescenst, and Paspalum notatum) in heterogeneous soil (patches without microplastics and patches with 0.2 % microplastics) and homogeneous soil (patches with 0.1 % microplastics). Three microplastic types were tested: polypropylene (PP), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polyester (PET). P. frutescens showed no response to soil microplastic heterogeneity. For P. grandiflora, microplastic heterogeneity tended to decrease its biomass (total, shoot and root) when the microplastic was PAN and also shoot biomass when it was PET, but had no effect when it was PP. For T. repens, microplastic heterogeneity promoted biomass when PAN was used, decreased total and root biomass when PET was used, but showed no effect when PP was used. Microplastic heterogeneity increased biomass of P. oleracea and decreased that of M. sativa when PET was used, but had no effect when PP or PAN was used. For T. mongolicum, microplastic heterogeneity reduced biomass when the microplastic was PAN, tended to increase total and root biomass when it was PP, but showed no effect when it was PET. For P. notatum, microplastic heterogeneity increased biomass when the microplastic was PP, decreased it when PET was used, but had no effect when PAN was used. However, biomass of none of the seven species showed root foraging responses at the patch level. Therefore, soil microplastic heterogeneity can influence plant growth, but such effects depend on species and microplastic types and are not associated with root foraging. Our findings highlight the roles of soil microplastic heterogeneity, which may influence species interactions and community structure and productivity.

AB  - Migration has been regarded as a global phenomenon, where Rohingya migration in Bangladesh has posed a significant challenge to the environment. The study explored the impact of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change after the arrival of Rohingya on the elephant route in Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh. The study analyzed the satellite image to find out the LULC change after the influx of Rohingya, and the data regarding the impact of LULC on the elephant route have been collected from published documents like articles, newspapers, and reports. The images have been collected from two times after and before the arrival of the Rohingya (2016 and 2021). ArcGIS (version 10.8), Erdas Imagine (version 2014), and QGIS (version 3.16.16) have been used to figure out the LULC change. The study has found that the sudden arrival of Rohingya in the forest and hilly areas of Ukhiya, Teknaf in Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh adversely affected the land use pattern of the southeast part of Bangladesh that is near the border to north-west Myanmar. Most of the forest land, bare land, and water body transformed into Rohingya house structure buildings, road networks, sanitation, and markets by Rohingya. The study has found that forest cutting is higher in Ukhiya and Teknaf Upazila due to most of the Rohingya camps being located in Cox's Bazar district. In 2016, forest coverage was 9569.10 hectares; in 2021, it reached 7106.72 hectares in Palong Khali Union under Ukhiya Upazila. The settlement comprised 1354.40 hectares in 2016 and 3291.91 hectares in 2021 in Palong Khali Union in Ukhiya. In Teknaf municipality, the forest cover was 363.64 hectares in 2016 and it has been 269.3 hectares in 2021. The settlement was 151 hectares in 2016 but increased to 208.14 hectares in 2021 in Teknaf municipality. Furthermore, the study found that wild Asian elephants are endangered in Cox's Bazar district due to Rohingya obliterating their route by building up unplanned settlements through deforestation. Hence, the elephant-human conflict accelerated due to the food sources and destination in forest land in Cox's Bazar district. Thus, Rohingya deaths and injuries are increasing day by day, and more than 200 Rohingya deaths are estimated in this study. The study suggests repatriation of Rohingya to save the natural land covers and human lives.

AB  - IntroductionSpace use patterns in fish result from the interactions between individual movement behaviour and characteristics of the environment. Herbivorous parrotfishes, for instance, are constrained by the availability of resources and different predation risks. The resulting spatial distribution of the fish population can strongly influence community composition and ecosystem resilience. MethodsIn a novel approach, we combine individual-based modelling (IBM) with an artificial potential field algorithm to realistically represent fish movements and the decision-making process. Potential field algorithms, which are popular methods in mobile robot path planning, efficiently generate the best paths for an entity to navigate through vector fields of repellent and attracting forces. In our model the repellent and attracting forces are predation risk and food availability, both implemented as separate grid-based vector fields. The coupling of individual fish bioenergetics with a navigation capacity provides a mechanistic basis to analyse how the habitat structure influences population dynamics and space utilization. ResultsModel results indicate that movement patterns and the resulting spatial distributions strongly depend on habitat fragmentation with the bioenergetic capacity to spawn and reproduce being particularly susceptible processes at the individual level. The resulting spatial distributions of the population are more irregularly distributed among coral reef patches the more the coral reef habitat becomes fragmented and reduced. DiscussionThis heterogeneity can have strong implications for the delivered ecosystem functioning, e.g., by concentrating or diluting the grazing effort. Our results also highlight the importance of incorporating individual foraging-path patterns and the spatial exploitation of microhabitats into marine spatial planning by considering the effects of fragmentation. The integration of potential fields into IBMs represents a promising strategy to advance our understanding of complex decision-making in animals by implementing a more realistic and dynamic decision-making process, in which each fish weighs different rewards and risks of the environment. This information may help to identify core areas and essential habitat patches and assist in effective marine spatial management.

Detected subtypes included 23 cases of pandemic 2009 H1N1, six of human seasonal H3N2, three of classical swine H1N1, 13 of triple-reassortant swine H1N2, seven of triple-reassortant swine H3N2, and seven of swine-origin H3N2 variant. Notably, none of the serum samples tested positive for avian IAV subtypes H3N8, H5N3, H7N7, and H9N2 or canine IAV subtype H3N2. This serologic analysis confirmed the exposure of Korean wild boars to various subtypes of swine and human influenza viruses, with some serum samples cross-reacting between swine and human strains, indicating potential infections with multiple IAVs. The results highlight the potential of wild boar as a novel mixing vessel, facilitating the adaptation of IAVs and their spillover to other hosts, including humans. In light of these findings, we recommend regular and frequent surveillance of circulating influenza viruses in the wild boar population as a proactive measure to prevent potential human influenza pandemics and wild boar influenza epizootics.

AB  - Predation risk and prey responses exhibit fluctuations in space and time. Seasonal ecological disturbances can alter landscape structure and permeability to influence predator activity and efficacy, creating predictable patterns of risk for prey (seasonal risk landscapes). This may create corresponding seasonal shifts in antipredator behaviour, mediated by species ecology and trade-offs between risk and resources. Yet, how human recreation interacts with seasonal risk landscapes and antipredator behaviour remains understudied. In South Florida, we investigated the impact of a seasonal ecological disturbance, specifically flooding, which is inversely related to human activity, on interactions between Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We hypothesized that human activity and ecological disturbances would interact with panther-deer ecology, resulting in the emergence of two distinct seasonal landscapes of predation risk and the corresponding antipredator responses. We conducted camera trap surveys across southwestern Florida to collect detection data on humans, panthers and deer. We analysed the influence of human site use and flooding on deer and panther detection probability, co-occurrence and diel activity during the flooded and dry seasons. Flooding led to decreased panther detections and increased deer detections, resulting in reduced deer-panther co-occurrence during the flooded season. Panthers exhibited increased nocturnality and reduced diel activity overlap with deer in areas with higher human activity. Supporting our hypothesis, panthers' avoidance of human recreation and flooding created distinct risk schedules for deer, driving their antipredator behaviour. Deer utilized flooded areas to spatially offset predation risk during the flooded season while increasing diurnal activity in response to human recreation during the dry season. We highlight the importance of understanding how competing risks and ecological disturbances influence predator and prey behaviour, leading to the generation of seasonal risk landscapes and antipredator responses. We emphasize the role of cyclical ecological disturbances in shaping dynamic predator-prey interactions. Furthermore, we highlight how human recreation may function as a 'temporal human shield,' altering seasonal risk landscapes and antipredator responses to reduce encounter rates between predators and prey.

AB  - The skulls of 54 specimens of the South American tapir, Tapirus terrestris collected in the department of Loreto, Peru were measured, analyzed and compared to investigate skull development of this species. Univariate, multivariate and allometric analyses were performed using 32 skull variables through traditional morphometrics. Significant skull shape variation was detected among ontogenetic classes. Young individuals (class I, n = 22) showed higher variation than subadults and adults (class II, n = 23 and class III, n = 9), without evidence of sexual dimorphism (males = 35, females = 19). Principal component analyses and discriminant function analysis showed almost complete separation of the age classes. Allometric analysis indicated a tendency of unproportioned cranial growth. All our samples come from the same population living under the same ecological condition, which eliminates the effect of confounding variables related to habitat on the pattern of ontogenetic variation of this anatomical structure.

AB  - The record of mammal declines and extinctions inAustralia raises concerns regarding geographically restrictedand poorly known taxa. For many taxa, the existing data areinsufficient to assess their conservation status and informappropriate management. Concerns regarding the per-sistence of the subspecies of yellow-footed rock-wallabyPetrogale xanthopus celeris, which is endemic to Queens-land, have been expressed since thes because of redfoxVulpes vulpespredation, competition with feral goatsCapra hircusand land clearing. This rock-wallaby is rarelyobserved, occupies rugged mountain ranges and, prior toour surveys, had not been surveyed foryears. We sur-veyedsites across the range of this rock-wallaby during, including revisiting sites surveyed in thes-s and locations of historical records. We examined occurrence in relation to habitat variables and threats.Occupancy and abundance remained similar over time atmost sites. However, bythe subspecies had recolonizedareas in the north-east of its range where it had disappearedbetween surveys in thes ands, and three south-western subpopulations that were considered extinct inthes were rediscovered. Recolonization and increasesin abundance at numerous sites between thes ands are associated with declines in feral goat abundance,indicating dietary and habitat competition are majorthreats. Exclusion fences erected sincecould limitgenetic exchange between rock-wallaby subpopulationswhilst allowing domestic goats to be commercially grazed.Petrogale xanthopus celerisshould remain categorized as Vulnerable based on these ongoing threats. Repeated moni-toring approximately every decade should underpin manage-ment of this endemic taxon.

AB  - Anthropogenic mercury (Hg) emissions and climate change are altering the global cycle of Hg. Levels of Hg in natural archives can help us understand not only its historical trends but also the future changes in different ecosystems, including the Arctic. In this study, we investigated the temporal variation of Hg across 4200 years in 78 antlers of the High-Arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus). Antler Hg concentrations were higher during the pre-1650 Anno Domini (AD) period compared to the post-1650 AD period. Thus, antler Hg concentrations did not reflect the increased environmental Hg levels caused by high anthropogenic activities during the past three centuries. Trabecular Hg concentrations tended to be higher during the Medieval Warm Period than during the Little Ice Age, as revealed by a post hoc analysis conducted to explore the relationship between climatic variation and antler Hg concentrations. The overall mean (+/- SE) antler Hg concentration was generally low (5.29 +/- 0.46 ng/g) compared to the present levels of Hg in various tissues of terrestrial Arctic ungulates. Combined with other paleo-archives, this millennial-scale study of Hg using antlers could provide insights into the temporal patterns and potential drivers of Hg variation in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Prescribed fire is a land management practice utilized in fire-adapted ecosystems to reduce wildfire risks, control invasive, exotic and woody plant species, enhance productivity and biodiversity, and share knowledge of land and culture. Fire exclusion has been the dominant management regime in western Canada since colonization. Efforts to reintroduce prescribed fire often face complex obstacles. The purpose of this research was to evaluate and compare organizational strategies for restoring fire as a land management process in grasslands of Saskatchewan. Agency practitioners with a range of experience in prescribed fire attended a workshop including presentations on agency practices and burn plan reviews. Workshop discussion was recorded, and themes were categorized and summarized. Common themes stressed the importance of access to education and training, information sharing and public engagement. Agencies were limited by institutional and jurisdictional barriers, liability concerns, weather and site complexities and had developed divergent strategies in response. Established programs with trained personnel and investment of significant funds accomplished the largest and most complex areas burned. In contrast, programmes with limited funding used a low-cost collaborative approach and completed frequent small burns. Solution. In response to the limitations to prescribed fire identified in the workshops, the Canadian Prairies Prescribed Fire Exchange was formed in 2021 to support interagency cooperation. The success of this organization between 2021 and 2024 emphasizes the importance of collaboration to overcome barriers, build successful programmes and accomplish shared conservation goals.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions generate public interest and attract substantial media attention. This becomes particularly interesting in regions where different languages are used by media reports, creating the opportunity to investigate associations between language and the perspectives presented in the reports. In this article, we used 207 English articles (from 2006 to 2019) and 721 Chinese articles (from 2016 to 2019) on human-wild boar interactions in Hong Kong to analyze the gaps and differences in how the interactions are presented in the Chinese and English language media. Although English and Chinese news reporting on interactions follow similar geographical patterns, they differed significantly in terms of the content included, the identity of interviewees, the management strategies mentioned and the reported causes of "conflict." The distinct presentation of human-wild boar interactions in English and Chinese news has the potential to contribute to diverging public attitudes toward the wild boar and policy development.

AB  - The 1983 die-off of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum was linked to dramatic increases in macroalgal biomass and abundance on Caribbean coral reefs. D. antillarum densities have only recently begun to recover, and on some reefs this has led to a decrease in algae and an increase in coral recruits. Given the historic importance of this herbivore and the patchiness of its distribution on modern Caribbean reefs, a better understanding of its feeding preferences for different macroalgae is fundamental to reef ecology and management. This study investigated the feeding preferences of D. antillarum for different macroalgae and benthic cyanobacteria that were most common at our study sites on reefs of the U.S. Virgin Islands, although most of these algae occur throughout the Caribbean. Many of these algae are chemically rich, and some are known to be chemically defended against generalist grazers. Previous studies have suggested that D. antillarum has a greater capacity than herbivorous fishes and other herbivores to consume chemically defended algae. However, in this series of experiments, D. antillarum was more selective than expected in its food choices and avoided eating some macroalgae and cyanobacteria commonly found on shallow reefs of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Types of algae and their chemical extracts that deterred feeding include common brown algae (Dictyota and Lobophora spp.) and cyanobacteria (Dichothrix sp.). These feeding preferences have implications for coral reef ecosystems because some macroalgae and cyanobacteria can have negative effects on the survival of other organisms on reefs, including corals.

AB  - While attention in coastal ecosystem restoration has increased over the last two decades, the success rate of efforts remains relatively low. To increase success rates, physical restoration techniques often utilize supporting or protective materials to provide a stable surface for transplantation, and in some cases reduce herbivory and hydrodynamic disturbances. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of traditional (staples, burlap) and novel (BESE- elements, a biodegradable potato starch lattice) physical restoration techniques on the growth of transplanted Halodule wrightii seagrass. A first experiment revealed that seagrass planted in both two-stacked BESE structure without planting holes and four-stacked BESE with holes had significantly higher shoot count and blade length than four-stacked BESE without holes, with the latter design losing all seagrass shortly after deployment as shoots could not float through the structure. In a second experiment, the BESE lattice treatment (four-stacked with holes) had three times the shoot count and equal to greater blade length compared to traditional methods of physical restoration (staples and burlap), likely due to BESE providing some protection from hydrodynamic activity. However, disturbances, possibly including herbivory and hydrodynamic activity (culminating with Hurricane Irma), prevented long term study, illustrating the importance of stochastic abiotic factors in seagrass planting success. Overall our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using BESE lattice designs and similar physical techniques in the restoration of seagrass beds.

AB  - Resources play an important role in shaping the evolution of plant defensive strategies. How resource availability influences overall phytochemical diversity within species, and how this in-turn affects herbivore damage is not well understood. Using Monarda fistulosa, a species that produces diverse terpene compounds and distinct chemotypes (i.e. thymol or carvacrol), we addressed three questions: 1) how do phytochemical components (i.e. total concentration, Shannon diversity, and chemotypes) vary between distinct populations from two large, widely separated regions that differ in climate and productivity? 2) How do these components influence attack by different herbivore species? 3) What are the growth costs of higher phytochemical levels in different chemotypes? Seeds were collected from 12 populations spread across two regions that differ in precipitation-driven productivity, six from a low-productivity environment in Montana and six from a high-productivity environment in Wisconsin, and grown in a common garden in Wisconsin. We analyzed terpene concentrations, quantified the number of herbivores and damage, and measured plant above-ground biomass. Plants from Montana exhibited higher terpene concentrations but lower diversity, whereas those from Wisconsin displayed lower terpene concentrations but higher diversity. Plants from Wisconsin received more damage from a specialist seed predator and leaf-chewing herbivores, although abundance of a specialist aphid was lower, compared to plants from Montana. Total terpene concentration emerged as the primary predictor of herbivore damage, although some differences were observed between region of origin and with terpene richness. Herbivores exhibited mixed responses to phytochemistry; some herbivores were negatively affected, while a specialized leaf galler responded positively. Costs of producing defenses were evident by negative correlations between plant biomass and total terpene concentration (but not chemical richness or Shannon diversity). Our study revealed that regional differences in productivity can influence the evolution of phytochemical concentration and diversity, which, in turn, affects plant damage and incurs growth-related costs.

AB  - Grazing by large herbivores can potentially affect interspecific interactions between small herbivores by reducing the ecological fitness of animals. Desert rodents are important components in desert ecosystems and indicators of environmental change. Grazing reduces food resources, but rodents can decrease interspecific niche overlap by adaptive behavior. However, the key factors driving rodent behavioral activities and coexistence in the Alxa desert remains unstudied. We monitored population density and behavioral activities of Midday gerbil (Meriones meridianus) and northern three-toed jerboa (Dipus sagitta) in a grazing exclusion experiment in Alxa desert, Inner Mongolia, China, in 2017. We assessed the relationship between environmental factors (such as plant height, density, coverage, rainfall and temperature) and the behavioral activities of two coexisting rodent species. The results showed that: (1) In summer, grazing significantly reduced the activity time of gerbil and jerboa compared to that in grazing exclusion areas (gerbil: F = 5.98, p < 0.05, eta(2) = 0.22; jerboa: F = 8.57, p < 0.01, eta(2) = 0.28). Grazing reduced the temporal niche overlap with an obvious shifting of activity peaks between two species. (2) Grazing exclusion enhanced the temporal niche overlap between the two rodent species due to greater food availability which relieved inter-specific competition in each season. (3) Grazing strengthened the sensitivity of rodents to environmental changes in all seasons. These results indicated that grazing affected competition between the rodent species by altering vegetation conditions, which in turn affected the temporal niche and activity patterns of rodents.

AB  - Nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) on prey animals by predators have received considerable interest in wildlife ecology and conservation. However, NCEs by large carnivore species with omnivorous diet still remain unclear. The Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is widely found in eastern parts of the Eurasian Continent, including Honshu and Shikoku Islands of Japan. At present, this bear species is the only large carnivore in the region as a typical omnivore that occasionally predates sika deer (Cervus nippon). If sika deer recognize predation threats from black bears, then the NCEs by bears will provoke antipredator behavioral responses by the deer. In testing this hypothesis, we evaluated the spatial and temporal overlaps between bears and deer as well as compared the vigilance level and spatiotemporal avoidance observed in sika deer between bear-active and -inactive years, using camera trapping in an agroforest landscape in Fukushima, eastern Japan. Consequently, we found little changes in deer behaviors between bear-active and -inactive years, indicating that sika deer neither exhibited spatial partitioning and spatiotemporal avoidances from black bears nor increased their vigilance even in bear-active year. We concluded that our study showed no significant NCE of omnivorous Asiatic black bears on sika deer.

AB  - This paper presents data on the state of stands and undergrowth of the main forest-forming species at the Karadag Nature Reserve in oak forests of downy oak (Quercus pubescens) and sessile oak (Q. petraea) under the conditions of an excessive density of the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). By 2016, the exponential growth in the number of roe deer in the reserve, which has been observed since its establishment in 1979, led to an increase in its number to 750 individuals and density of up to 437 individuals per 1000 ha, which is 10 times higher than the norm. At the same time, the level of damaged undergrowth increased from 7.6 to 88.9% in sessile oak and from 8.4 to 83.7% in downy oak. This has resulted in a decrease to an absolute minimum in the numbers of the medium and the complete absence of large undergrowth in both sessile oak and downy oak. The alignment of tree species in abundance (estimated by the Berger-Parker index) is 1.2 for sessile oak stands and 1.18 for downy oak stands; the undergrowth is 3 and 1.6, respectively. At the Primorskoe Forestry located next to the reserve, which exhibits a relatively satisfactory density of roe deer (37 individuals per 1000 ha), damage to the undergrowth of the main species was 5.5% in sessile oak groves and 7.2% in downy oak groves. In the Primorskoe Forestry oak forests, alignment of tree species in abundance is 1.25 for sessile oak and 1.54 for downy oak and 2.15 and 2.11 for their undergrowth, respectively. Based on cumulative data, it is concluded that even providing the conditions of a super-high density of ungulates, oak forests of the Karadag Reserve retain the ability to regenerate through an increase in the density of small undergrowth (sessile oak groves) and alignment of the undergrowth species (downy oak groves). The role of the overabundance of roe deer in the reserve is negative in relation to the reproduction of the main species and positive in regards to biodiversity in terms of the alignment of tree species of the undergrowth in abundance.

AB  - To predict and mitigate the effects of climate change on communities and ecosystems, the joint effects of extreme climatic events on species interactions need to be understood. Using the common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.)-leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) system, we investigated the effects of heat wave and elevated CO2 on common ragweed growth, secondary metabolism, and the consequent impacts on the beetle. The results showed that elevated CO2 and heat wave facilitated A. artemisiifolia growth; further, A. artemisiifolia accumulated large amounts of defensive secondary metabolites. Being fed on A. artemisiifolia grown under elevated CO2 and heat wave conditions resulted in the poor performance of O. communa (high mortality, long development period, and low reproduction). Overall, under elevated CO2, heat wave improved the defensive ability of A. artemisiifolia against herbivores. On the other hand, enhanced adaptability to climatic changes may aggravate invasive plant distribution, posing a challenge to the control of invasive plants in the future.
   Key message Being fed on A. artemisiifolia grown under elevated CO2 and heat wave conditions resulted in the poor performance of O. communa (high mortality, long development period, and low reproduction). Elevated CO2 and heat waves resulted in the accumulation of secondary metabolites in A. artemisiifolia. After feeding on the secondary metabolites accumulated by A. artemisiifolia, the mortality of O. communa increased.

AB  - Species that have undergone range declines due to human activities present an unstable species-environment relationship and require integrative approaches for their conservation. The pygmy bluetongue lizard Tiliqua adelaidensis occupies vacant spider burrows and is found on private grazing properties. Without active conservation management, the species faces climate-induced extinction. Translocation to more southerly environments is considered a mitigation strategy. We used predictive distribution modelling (MaxEnt) combined with field surveys to identify potential translocation sites. Two species were potentially reliable indicators of suitable habitat: brush wire grass Aristida behriana and trapdoor spider Blakistonia aurea. Habitat suitability maps produced using these species found that, despite the importance of B. aurea burrows for lizard occupancy, A. behriana was a more suitable indicator species. Our field surveys compared habitat quality at lizard-occupied sites to potential translocation sites but did not reveal factors associated with higher lizard occupancy at current sites. Spider burrow availability was lower at potential translocation sites but a higher proportion were high-quality trapdoor spider burrows. Only one potential translocation site was found to be suitable; attributed to having trapdoor spider burrows, grasshoppers, and sheep grazing management. This site was a private property listed for sale during the surveys. Given that translocations of pygmy bluetongues are inevitable and this is the first suitable translocation site identified, we highlight the necessity of long-term measures to safeguard potential translocation sites on private property before any planned translocation occurs. Integrating conservation strategies with agricultural practices offers a chance to safeguard private properties so wildlife and agriculture may co-exist.

AB  - Recreation is known to impact wildlife by displacing and sometimes contributing to the extirpation of sensitive species, underscoring a need for policies that balance wildlife and recreation. This is especially pressing when Indigenous rights necessitate ecological integrity and sustainable populations of wildlife throughout traditional territories. In the Cascade Mountain Range of Washington, USA, Indigenous harvest of elk (Cervus canadensis) is declining, concurrent with increases in recreation. Yet, the nature and magnitude of the effects of recreation on elk are unknown, which prevents land managers from developing informed policies regarding recreation and wildlife management. Here, we use camera traps alongside visitation models that incorporate geolocated social media to quantify the impacts of recreation on elk in western Washington. Random forest models show elk detection rates are relatively constant at low levels of recreation (0-11 people/day), but decrease by over 41% when recreation increases from 12 to 22 people/day. Activity overlap analysis also revealed a shift toward increased evening activity by elk at cameras with higher-than-average recreation (triangle = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.61-0.88; chi(2) = 7.79, p = 0.02). Generalized additive modeling confirms that elk are more crepuscular or nocturnal at camera locations with more than 10 hiker detections per day. We compare methods for estimating recreation, showing model-based estimates are more informative than camera-based estimates. This indicates that recreational intensity along and in the immediate vicinity of trails may be a better predictor of impacts on wildlife than camera-based estimates that quantify recreational intensity at specific locations along trails. We stress the importance of examining the impacts of recreation on wildlife across multiple spatiotemporal scales and underscore how novel approaches can provide land managers valuable tools to develop management strategies that balance recreation and wildlife. We hope that our work can also serve as a strong example of collaboration between universities, state agencies, and sovereign Indigenous nations toward the broader goal of mitigating the negative impacts of recreation on wildlife.

AB  - Context. Predation risk, whether from large carnivores or humans, is a primary driver of movement and habitat selection for ungulates. Throughout much of the geographical range of white-tailed deer, predation risk during autumn and winter is driven by hunters; however, information about how deer respond to hunting pressure during a long hunting season is lacking. Aims. We aimed to determine how differences in daily temporal exposure to hunting risk affected habitat selection of adult male white-tailed deer. Methods. We deployed GPS collars on 42 adult male white-tailed deer during the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 firearm hunting seasons in Mississippi, USA. GPS collars provided fine-scale spatial and temporal information regarding habitat use of our study area. Key results. We showed a mismatch between what hunters and deer selected; landscape characteristics selected most by hunters were least selected by deer during the day, which we believe has never been documented. Fine-scale temporal analysis showed that deer selected for some areas (food plots) as much as five times more often during the night, when no hunting risk was present, than during the day, when risk was present. Conclusions. Habitat selection by deer varies depending on the amount of risk that is present. Even in a high-risk heavily hunted area, adult male white-tailed deer can recognise external cues on the landscape, and shift habitat selection both spatially and temporally to favour areas that present less risk. Implications. This study, to our knowledge, provides the first evidence that white-tailed deer actively selected for habitat characteristics that hunters were not utilising. To minimise the effectiveness of risk-avoidance behaviours used by deer, we suggest hunters moderate temporal hunting effort across time to decrease the risk to which deer are exposed, thereby minimising the response by deer.

AB  - Shifts from coral-dominated to macroalgal-dominated states on coral reefs are typically attributed to overfishing, often in combination with natural or other anthropogenic disturbances. However, a recent study attributed increased macroalgal cover to enhanced nutrient supplies alone without associated reductions in herbivorous fishes. This highlights the need to understand macroalgal responses to terrestrial runoff and how this can contribute to their proliferation on coral reefs. We explored the responses of two common brown macroalgae, Sargassum mangarevense (Grunow) Setchell and Padina boryana Thivy to nutrient addition, sediment addition, and mechanical damage in 3 field experiments. In the first experiment, we exposed all experimental units to herbivores and found that nutrient addition ameliorated biomass loss of both S. mangarevense and P. boryana by 79% and 47%, respectively, while sediment addition had no effect on either species. Exploring the underlying causes of these findings, we determined nutrient addition caused a 5% increase in toughness of S. mangarevense and a 51% increase in calcification of P. boryana. In a final experiment, both mechanical damage and nutrient addition independently increased calcification of P. boryana, while an antagonistic interaction between these factors for S. mangarevense suggests an upper limit to thallus toughness. Overall, we demonstrate that nutrients from anthropogenic terrestrial runoff may support macroalgal proliferation on coral reefs by ameliorating short-term biomass losses in the presence of herbivores. Further, we suggest the mechanism behind this amelioration may be changes in algal physical characteristics, specifically thallus toughness and calcification, in response to anthropogenic or natural disturbances.

AB  - Biodiversity appears to strongly suppress pathogens and pests in many plant and animal systems. However, this "dilution effect" is not consistently detected, and when present can vary strikingly in magnitude. Here, we use forest inventory data from over 25,000 plots (>1.1 million sampled trees) to quantify the strength of the dilution effect on dozens of forest pests and clarify why some pests are particularly sensitive to biodiversity. Using Bayesian hierarchical models, we show that pest prevalence is frequently lower in highly diverse forests, but there is considerable variability in the magnitude of this dilution effect among pests. The strength of dilution was not closely associated with host specialization or pest nativity. Instead, pest prevalence was lower in forests where co-occurring tree species were more distantly related to a pest's preferred hosts. Our analyses indicate that host evolutionary history and forest composition are key to understanding how species diversity may dilute the impacts of tree pests, with important implications for predicting how future biodiversity change may affect the spread and distribution of damaging forest pests.

AB  - Difficult terrain is characterized by deteriorated conditions for plant adaptation, e.g., owing to poor substrate, substantial land slope, or intensive insolation. In terms of plant adaptation, difficult terrain includes newly created ski slopes, any kind of embankment, scarps, levees, and etc. Application of grasses is an effective and economic method of stabilization of the ground. However, sowing of grass-legume mixtures to sod these areas does not typically produce adequate effects. Application of a new generation of protective fabrics with the addition of bird feathers may be a remedy to these problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of biodegradable fabrics for covering difficult areas to improve the habitat conditions for plants. To evaluate this issue, an area characterized by difficult conditions for plant development was selected. Five types of protective fabrics were applied. The main factor influencing the efficiency of the sodding of difficult terrain was the application of fabrics that were capable of absorbing water, which were then given to plants over a longer period of time. Vegetation grew easiest through the geotextile made of sheep wool with the addition of bird feathers. Fabrics manufactured from problematic waste materials contribute to an ecological effect as well as an economic effect resulting from lower costs of waste management as well as the income from selling the innovative product.

AB  - Cost benefit analysis (CBA) is used in many fields to ensure efficient allocation of scarce resources but is rarely applied in conservation. By using a common metric to evaluate projects in complex social-ecological systems, CBA can help to maximize the impact of conservation funding. It can also help to interrogate issues of distributional equity, plan for effective community-based conservation, and inform future research and strategic priorities. We demonstrate this using the example of the Nyerere Selous-Udzungwa Wildlife Corridor in Tanzania, a wildlife corridor aiming to restore connectivity between two protected areas to enhance African elephant (Loxodonta africana) conservation outcomes and mitigate human-elephant conflict. We combine novel data on elephant crop depredation with crop price and productivity data, elephant valuation methods, and ecosystem service values to analyze corridor costs and benefits from contrasting global and local community perspectives. From the global perspective, we find benefits to outweigh costs by at least 4.6:1. From the communities' perspective, we find that while substantial benefits should secure buy-in to the project, continued subsidy will be required to cover the costs. Our findings support generalized recommendations for application of CBA across diverse systems and conservation priorities.

AB  - Zooplankton play a pivotal role in the marine biological pump, and vertical variations in their functional trait composition and functional diversity can affect the export of organic carbon. However, our comprehension of the vertical variations in functional traits and functional diversity of zooplankton in the northwestern Pacific is insufficient. This study examined the vertical distributions in the functional trait composition, functional diversity, and trait space of zooplankton in the tropical and subtropical northwestern Pacific. Zooplankton functional trait composition exhibited obvious vertical variations. The proportion of active-feeding zooplankton increased with depth, while the proportion of ambush feeders decreased. The trophic groups of zooplankton shifted from omnivore-herbivore to omnivore-detritivore with depth. Zooplankton displayed high functional richness and functional dispersion in the 0-100 m layer, whereas narrow trait space but high functional evenness was observed in the 500-3000 m layer. The trait space of zooplankton within the 500-3000 m layer was nested within that of the epipelagic zone, indicating maintenance of the core functional structure. Environmental filtering and limiting similarity primarily governed zooplankton community assembly in the 0-100 m and 500-3000 m layers, whereas the process was more stochastic in other layers. These findings highlight the relationship between zooplankton functional traits and the biological pump, which could help explain the variations in biological pump strength among marine ecosystems.

AB  - Aposematic species rely on primary and secondary antipredator strategies. Yet, some opportunistic and generalist species may consume them, although this has been largely supported by indirect evidence such as dietary analyses or clay model experiments. Here, we studied the role of the wild boar, Sus scrofa, as a consumer and possible predator of an aposematic and toxic salamander, Salamandra salamandra gallaica. We investigated this behaviour using camera traps and salamander carcasses on a small island where both species co-occur. Our results show a very low proportion of salamanders consumed by wild boars (3.8%), which indicates that fire salamanders might not completely rely on their aposematic strategy to avoid being consumed by this generalist species. The number of predation events does not differ between wild boar age classes, but it does between seasons, with a higher consumption in spring, which can be associated with an increase in animal consumption when fruits (e.g., acorns) are no longer available on this island. We also highlight the need for temporal studies targeting predator-prey interactions through behavioural data and complementary approaches to better understand the possible impact of opportunistic and generalist species in the ecosystem. This is particularly important in management plans involving the control of generalist species such as the wild boar, which is considered one of the most invasive species globally and a threat to countless species worldwide.

AB  - Due to the influence of human activities such as cultivation and urban construction, the ecosystem of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) is subjected to increased vulnerability and even potential risk of destruction. Ecological restoration has led to an increase in vegetation, but excessive afforestation conversely results in low survival rate of trees, water shortages, and biodiversity loss. It is of great significance for achieving sustainable development of forests to reasonable revegetation in the region. At present, the potential distribution pattern of dominant species and their mixed forms in the basin has not been effectively studied. This study simulated the potential distribution of dominant vegetation in the YRB based on Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) and explored the impact of human interference on it by employing land use as the environmental filter to distinguish the regions of human activities. We further predicted the potential distribution of typically mixed forests and discussed their human interference. The main results are as follows: (1) Except for Caragana korshinskii, all models had good above performance (0.7 < the mean AUC < 1). Except for Caragana korshinskii, the area under the curve (AUC) for 90% of the models indicated that MaxEnt performed better than GARP, and MaxEnt easily lead to over-fitting while GARP predicted a wider range. (2) Except for Nitraria tangutorum, the dominant types of vegetation such as Pinus tabulaeformis, Platycladus orientalis, and Hippophae rhamnoides mainly distributed in southern Gansu, Shaanxi, and south-central Shanxi. Among them, the largest suitable area of Artemisia gmelinii and Stipa bungeana (High suitable area) were approximately 56.7x10(4) km(2) (38.8%) and 54.7x10(4) km(2) (28.5%) with the area occupied by large-scale cultivation being 17.5x10(4) km(2) (39.4%) and 18.9x10(4) km(2) (48%), respectively, which indicated human activities caused great damage to the core growth regions of these vegetation. (3) Mean temperature of coldest quarter or month mainly constrained the growth of most vegetation in the YRB in terms of temperature, while precipitation of wettest/driest month is one of the dominant factors. However, some vegetation responded differently to other meteorological factors due to niche differences. (4) Most of the mixed forests were distributed in southern Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces; its middle and high suitable areas were mainly concentrated in Shaanxi and southern and central Shanxi, where the cultivated land had occupied most of them. Therefore, the results showed that the restoration of herbaceous vegetation such as Artemisia gmelinii and Stipa bungeana has a high potential and it is appropriate that the measures for afforestation should be concentrated in the areas like the lower reaches of the Weihe, Jinghe, and Beiluo rivers and Luliang Mountain, where the cultivated land overlaps with the high suitable areas of the corresponding vegetation and the mixed forests with less water consumption and wide distribution, such as Caragana korshinskii-Hippophae rhamnoides, Pinus tabulaeformis-Quercus liaotungensis, and Ostryopsis davidiana-Stipa bungeana- Hippophae rhamnoides. The results of this study can provide effective guidance for mixed forest plantations and vegetation conservation in the YRB.

AB  - Predator loss can cause shifts in ecosystem state, especially when accompanied by changes in the behaviour of its prey. The recent decline of predatory sunflower sea stars Pycnopodia helianthoides and a coincident a decline of kelp forests across the northeastern Pacific raises questions about their role in kelp forest ecosystem maintenance and recovery. While P. helianthoides may support kelp forests by consuming herbivorous sea urchins, less is known about their non-consumptive effects, especially in degraded habitats. Here, we ask: How do the non-consumptive effects of this predator vary among prey species, and what are the emergent effects on community-level grazing pressure in a degraded habitat when kelp is reintroduced? We conducted a field experiment, where we deployed kelp blades in urchin barrens at discrete distances from caged P. helianthoides and control cages for 24 h. We demonstrate a reduction in the density of red sea urchins Mesocentrotus franciscanus nearest the sunflower star and no effect on green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. Our results suggest the chemical cue of P. helianthoides elicits a localized landscape of fear of approximately 15 m2 that suppresses grazing, and that the non-consumptive effects of P. helianthoides on sea urchin behaviour may be important for kelp restoration.

AB  - Negative density dependence (NDD) has been accepted as a key mechanism for biodiversity maintenance in natural forests and different lineages of natural enemies (fungus, bacterium, insect and virus) may be involved. Previous NDD related studies usually correlated seedling survival to the density of host-specific pests or pathogens along the physical distance to conspecific neighbors, and molecular defense responses of focal seedlings to natural enemies were seldom concerned. By employing a community functional genomic strategy, we extracted copy numbers of homologous genes in defense responses from transcriptomic data of 99 tree species and their inherent impacts on seedling survival were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) and general linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs). The copy number of fungus-defense, insect-defense, and virus-defense genes showed significant negative correlations with survival rates of the seedling community and the copy number of insect-defense genes significantly and negatively correlated with survival rates of top-twenty common species. Seedlings tended to have high survival rates when surrounded by seedling neighbors with similar insectdefense CNV matrices and adult neighbors with distinct bacterium-defense and virus-defense CNV matrices.We conclude that both gene copy number and dissimilarities to adult and seedling neighbors in defense response to natural enemies contributed to seedling survival, indicating the critical contributions of molecular defense responses of plants to species coexistence and diversity maintenance in subtropical forests.

AB  - Background Proximity loggers are a biotelemetry technology used to quantify animal-animal interactions non-invasively. They are small devices can be affixed to a target animal and detects and records if another device is within a certain distance, which can provide unprecedented insights into individual behavior and interactions with other animals or other aspects of the environment. Proximity loggers also can record the duration and distance between the two or more individuals detected, and have been used to study a diverse array of interactions. Studying drinking behavior in sheep is important for several critical reasons, such as improving animal welfare, enhancing productivity, managing resources efficiently, and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices. The objective of this study was to test the capacity for Bluetooth Low Energy proximity loggers to quantify drinking habits in sheep (n = 7 adult females). At all times, they had access to water from two drinking troughs. Animals wore neck collars that contained a mobile logger, and two stationary loggers were placed under the drinking troughs. To store the records downloaded from the stationary loggers, a gateway was placed close to the troughs. The mobile loggers were programmed as beacons to transmit their ID to the stationary loggers, which were programmed as receivers to scan the proximity of the mobile loggers, record the time, the IDs of the mobile loggers, and the received signal strength of the contact with the mobile loggers. Results Ewes visited the drinking troughs 2.4 +/- 0.5 times per day (rank 1.4-2.9), most frequently (42%) between 0800 and 1000 h, and 84% occurred in the daytime. Mean length of each water intake was 1.72 +/- 0.30 min. The cosinor analysis of the distribution of drinking events revealed a significant (P < 0.0001) 24-h circadian rhythm in drinking events, and the acrophase (time of the highest proportion of events) occurred at 1054 h. Conclusions Considering that studying water intake in sheep is crucial for optimizing their health, welfare, and management, the proximity loggers were demonstrated to be appropriate for documenting the drinking habits of sheep, and probably, would be suitable for studies of other behaviors that involve approaching other animals or objects.

AB  - Goat grazing has increasingly become an attractive solution to invasive plant removal and wildfire fuel reduction in Southern California. Despite the potential advantages of grazing when compared with other removal methods, little is known regarding its effectiveness in this region, particularly in forb-dominated landscapes. We aimed to determine how the timing and frequency of summer goat grazing affect three focal invasive plant species: Brassica nigra, Bromus diandrus, and Silybum marianum, all of which are common in Southern California as well as our study site near Whittier, CA. We found that grazing in both the early and late summer during the first year reduced the cover of our three focal species by at least 86% on average. This reduction did not carry over into the second year, likely due to heavy winter precipitation after the first year of grazing, but a second grazing period resulted in lower total invasive cover compared with the treatment that was only grazed in the first year, which appears to be driven by a significant decrease in cover of rip-gut brome (Bromus diandrus). We did not find strong evidence of grazing decreasing fine fuel loads, although black mustard (Brassica nigra) biomass was significantly decreased (87% on average) for the early and late summer grazing periods in the first year. These results highlight the importance of long-term grazing studies that consider seasonal differences between years as well as how timing, intensity, and frequency of grazing affect invasive removal.

AB  - The Swedish wild boar (Sus scrofa) population has increased rapidly over the last decades, resulting in conflicts with human activities. Particularly, the increase has been challenging for agriculture as wild boar cause damage on crops and grasslands. To predict under what conditions to expect damage and where to prioritize management actions, basic knowledge about wild boar habitat and space use is needed. In this study, we used data from 99 wild boar equipped with GPS-collars, collected over a large temporal scale and throughout their distributional range in southern Sweden. We investigated wild boar home range size and habitat use across gradients of habitat availability and population density. Functional response in habitat use was assessed by estimating the use and availability of agricultural land on individual level and then, on population-level evaluating how use changed with changing availability. Finally, a potential response in habitat use was evaluated in relation to population density, i.e., the interaction between availability and population density. Home range size was negatively related to population density for both male and female wild boar. Wild boar used agricultural land more intensively with increasing population density and when other habitat types were less available. Our findings show that wild boar spatial behavior is highly context dependent and may vary considerably due to landscape characteristics and local conditions. Wild boars tend to overuse agricultural land at high densities which has strong implications for wildlife management. It is therefore important to consider local conditions when predicting space and habitat use by wild boar. Overall, this study provided a better understanding of the drivers of wild boar distribution and space use in agro-forested mosaic landscapes and how this knowledge can improve management practices.

   The two non-synonymous g.11685G>A and g.11773T>C SNPs of PRLR(L2) were significantly associated with milk yield, fat%, and protein%, and mRNA and protein levels of PRL and PRLR in milk somatic cells. GT-animals had the best milk performance; however, AC-animals had inferior milk production. Thus, the selection of buffaloes with GT haplotypes may enhance milk performance in Egyptian buffaloes.
   Prolactin (PRL) and its receptor (PRLR) were considered as potential genetic markers for milk production and quality traits in cattle. However, little information is available regarding PRLR genetic diversity and association studies with milk traits in Egyptian water buffaloes. Therefore, the present study was conducted to search for mutations in PRLR and determine their associations with milk performance in these animals. Exon3 (E3) and E10 of PRLR were screened for polymorphisms using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing in 400 buffaloes. The associations between haplotypes and milk production (fat%, protein%, lactose%, and solid%) traits as well as mRNA and protein levels of PRL and PRLR were studied. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in E10 were detected: g.11685G>A (p.Ala494Thr) and g.11773T>C (p.Val523Aal). The G and T alleles were wild (ancestral) alleles, while the A and C alleles were mutant alleles. These SNPs resulted in four haplotypes; AC, AT, GC, and GT. Buffaloes with wild GT haplotypes showed significantly higher milk yield, fat% and protein%, mRNA and protein levels of PRL and PRLR in milk somatic cells than other animals. Animals carrying mutant AC haplotype had inferior milk traits and lowest levels of associated mRNAs and proteins. With these results, we could conclude that the selection of buffaloes with wild GT haplotypes for g.11685G>A and g.11773T>C SNPs of the PRLR gene might improve the milk production traits of Egyptian water buffaloes.

AB  - Mixed-species plantations are promoted to restore degraded ecosystems and improve soil quality worldwide. However, differences of soil water conditions between pure and mixed plantations are still controversial and how species mixtures affect soil water storage (SWS) was not well quantified. In this study, vegetation characteristics, soil properties and SWS were continuously monitored and quantified in three pure plantations (Armeniaca sibirica (AS), Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) and Hippophae rhamnoides (HR)) and their corresponding mixed plantations (Pinus tabuliformisArmeniaca sibirica (PT-AS), Robinia pseudoacacia-Pinus tabuliformis-Armeniaca sibirica (RP-PT-AS), Platycladus orientalis-Hippophae rhamnoides plantation (PO-HR), Populus simonii-Hippophae rhamnoides (PS-HR)). The results found that SWS of 0-500 cm in RP (333.60 & PLUSMN; 75.91 mm) and AS (479.52 & PLUSMN; 37.50 mm) pure plantations were higher than those in their corresponding mixed plantations (p > 0.05). SWS in the HR pure plantation (375.81 & PLUSMN; 81.64 mm) was lower than that in its mixed plantation (p > 0.05). It is suggested that the effect of species mixing on SWS was species specific. Additionally, soil properties exerted more contributions (38.05-67.24 %) to SWS than vegetation characteristics (26.80-35.36 %) and slope topography (5.96-29.91 %) at different soil depths and the whole 0-500 cm soil profile. Furthermore, by excluding the effects of soil properties and topographic factors, plant density and height were particularly important to SWS (with standard coefficients 0.787 and 0.690 respectively). The results implied that not all the mixed plantations exhibits the better soil water conditions than the compared pure plantations, which was tightly related to species selected for mixing. Our study provides scientific support for revegetation technique improvement (structural adjustment and species optimization) in this region.

AB  - Velvet antler of the Formosan sambar Querydeer (Cervus unicolor swinhoei), an indigenous subspecies of deer found in the Taiwan region, has become a promising commodity for use in healthy foods and traditional Chinese medicines but the waste from the deer farm becomes one of the main problems. The advanced process of biogas production system using deer manure solving the farm waste problem and creating bioenergy was conducted in this study. Two deer manure samples (dry and wet) were collected from two different velvet antler farms in the deer farming area of central Taiwan. Each deer manure sample was diluted 6 times with tap water. The biogas slurry was used as inoculum with a 1:9 (10% v center dot v-1) volume ratio between the biogas slurry and diluted deer manure. The batch fermentation was tested in a 60 ml glass vial bottle and incubated for 120 days at 37 degrees C with agitation of 120 rpm. The cumulative volume of biogas production, pH, COD, TS, and VS of the influent and effluent were analyzed to examine the fermentation performance. The results showed the wet sample of deer manure that was diluted six times produced the highest methane yield (289.2 +/- 8.9 ml center dot g VSadded-1) with 61.6 +/- 0.09% of the methane produced. The Illumina Next Generation Sequencing used for microbial community analysis showed that the methanogenic Archaean, Methanosaetaceae and Methanobacteriaceae, were enriched and become dominant at the final of the batch fermentation.

TI  - Downstream ecological consequences of livestock grazing in the Sahel: a space-for-time analysis of the relations between livestock and birds

AB  - Bird counts in the Ferlo, NW Senegal had shown that the density of groundforaging birds was much lower in grazed than in ungrazed savannah: 84% fewer granivorous birds and 64% fewer insectivorous birds. Between 1960 and 2010, in three areas within the same region, granivores declined by 39-97% and insectivores by 61-91%, losses attributable to the steadily increasing livestock grazing pressure. If these trends hold for all Sahelian rangelands, the extrapolation at the time indicated that 1.5 billion birds would have been lost in just half a century. The aim of this space-for-time substitution study was to investigate whether that extrapolation can be substantiated with data from the eastern Sahel. To permit analysis of the spatial and seasonal variation in grazing pressure and its impact on ground-foraging granivorous and insectivorous birds, we counted birds in 1901 sites across the entire region (Mauritania to Ethiopia) and took landscape photos of these sites to evaluate livestock presence. We also estimated livestock density from our counts of cowpats and of droppings of sheep and goats, and the cover of the soil vegetation. Within the same rainfall zone (200-400 mm/year), the grazing pressure was higher in the Ferlo than elsewhere in the Sahel. Grazing pressure declined in the Ferlo in the course of the dry season, indicating that cattle food supply became depleted. No such seasonal decline was recorded elsewhere in the Sahel. The same pattern was found for ground-foraging birds: a decline during the dry season in the Ferlo, but nowhere else in the same Sahel rainfall zone. Indeed, in the 1960s and 1970s, when the grazing pressure was much lower than today, there were no records of a seasonal decline of ground-foraging birds in the Ferlo. The much lower densities of seed-eating birds in the Ferlo were not exhibited elsewhere in the Sahel, which is consistent with the phenomenon of local overgrazing. The previous extrapolated loss of 1.5 billion birds is therefore too high, because conditions in the Ferlo were found to differ from those experienced elsewhere in Sahel's arid zone. The actual overall loss cannot be specified due to lack of bird counts from the past in the eastern Sahel. The comparison of grazing pressure and bird densities across all rainfall zones of the western and eastern Sahel shows that increasing livestock densities negatively impact bird numbers. Livestock grazing pressure in the west was higher than in the east and most ground-foraging bird species were less common in the west than in the east. Furthermore, the majority of ground-foraging species in West Sahelian savannahs were exclusively confined to the arid and semi-arid zone, but in the east, these species were more widely distributed and also occupied the more humid zone to the south.

AB  - Several biophysical factors are leading to the loss of biodiversity, among them the dominance of exotic invasive species on native communities is important. Their dominance can lead to changes in the structure of insect communities, by competing and displacing native species to other crops or habitats. These changes can impact the herbivore's natural enemies in invaded areas by diverging them from suitable herbivores and altering their biological control process. The development of edible insects and derived products at an industrial scale can also have an impact on the local fauna by the risks of spillover and accidental release in nature. Several area-wide integrated pest management programs are also using the sterile insect technique to control insect pests and disease' vectors. This technique is becoming largely used; however, its application as 'non-intrusive to the environment' is controversial particularly when eradication is concerning species that are at the basis of food webs.

AB  - The science guiding design and evaluation of restoration interventions in tropical landscapes is dominated by ecological processes and outcomes and lacks indicators and methods that integrate human wellbeing into the restoration process. We apply a new systems approach framework for tree restoration in forest-agricultural landscapes to show how this shortcoming can be addressed. Demonstrating 'proof of concept', we tested statistical models underlying the framework pathways with data collected from a case study in Tanzania. Local community perceptions of nature's values were not affected by levels of self-reported wildlife-induced crop damage. But mapped predictions from the systems approach under a tree restoration scenario suggested differential outcomes for biodiversity indicators and altered spatial patterns of crop damage risk, expected to jeopardize human wellbeing. The predictions map anticipated trade-offs in costs and benefits of restoration scenarios, which we have started to explore with stakeholders to identify restoration opportunities that consider local knowledge, value systems and human wellbeing. We suggest that the framework be applied to other landscapes to identify commonalities and differences in forest landscape restoration outcomes under varying governance and land use systems. This should form a foundation for evidence-based implementation of the global drive for forest landscape restoration, at local scales.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

AB  - The predation-stress hypothesis has been proposed as a general mechanism to explain the negative effect of predation risk on reproduction, through a chronic activation of the stress response. However, in some cases, stress appears to augment the reproductive potential of mammals. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations are on a rise worldwide, despite the high hunting pressure that they are exposed to. This hunting pressure instigates, among other effects, earlier sexual maturity in juvenile females, leading to the shortening of wild boars' generation time. The mechanism that underlies this earlier sexual maturity under high hunting pressure has not been examined to date. To explore the physiological effects that hunting has on the reproductive system and whether the stress response is involved, we examined steroid hormone levels in the hair of female wild boars in northern Israel, comparing populations exposed to high and low hunting pressure. Furthermore, we compared steroid levels in the hair of female wild boars that were roaming alone or as a part of a group. We found no hormonal signs of stress in the hunted boars. Cortisol levels were low in both the high and low hunting-pressure groups. Yet, progesterone levels were higher in females that were exposed to high hunting pressure. Females roaming in a group also had higher progesterone levels compared to females that were alone, with no distinguishable differences in cortisol levels. These elevations in reproductive hormones that were associated with hunting may lead to a higher reproductive potential in female wild boars. They further show that high hunting pressure does not necessarily lead to chronic stress that impairs the reproductive potential of female wild boars. This data suggests that a reproductive hormonal response may be one of the factors leading to the rapid wild boars population growth worldwide, despite the high hunting pressure.

AB  - BackgroundThe rumen microbiome plays an essential role in maintaining ruminants' growth and performance even under extreme environmental conditions, however, which factors influence rumen microbiome stability when ruminants are reared in such habitats throughout the year is unclear. Hence, the rumen microbiome of yak (less domesticated) and cattle (domesticated) reared on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau through the year were assessed to evaluate temporal changes in their composition, function, and stability.ResultsRumen fermentation characteristics and pH significantly shifted across seasons in both cattle and yak, but the patterns differed between the two ruminant species. Ruminal enzyme activity varied with season, and production of xylanase and cellulase was greater in yak compared to cattle in both fall and winter. The rumen bacterial community varied with season in both yak and cattle, with higher alpha diversity and similarity (beta diversity) in yak than cattle. The diversity indices of eukaryotic community did not change with season in both ruminant species, but higher similarity was observed in yak. In addition, the similarity of rumen microbiome functional community was higher in yak than cattle across seasons. Moreover, yak rumen microbiome encoded more genes (GH2 and GH3) related to cellulose and hemicellulose degradation compared to cattle, and a new enzyme family (GH160) gene involved in oligosaccharides was uniquely detected in yak rumen. The season affected microbiome attenuation and buffering values (stability), with higher buffering value in yak rumen microbiome than cattle. Positive correlations between antimicrobial resistance gene (dfrF) and CAZyme family (GH113) and microbiome stability were identified in yak, but such relationship was negatively correlated in cattle.ConclusionsThe findings of the potential of cellulose degradation, the relationship between rumen microbial stability and the abundance of functional genes varied differently across seasons and between yak and cattle provide insight into the mechanisms that may underpin their divergent adaptation patterns to the harsh climate of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. These results lay a solid foundation for developing strategies to maintain and improve rumen microbiome stability and dig out the potential candidates for manufacturing lignocellulolytic enzymes in the yak rumen to enhance ruminants' performance under extreme environmental conditions.

AB  - Agricultural commodity production is one the main drivers of deforestation in Legal Brazilian Amazonia resulting in a deforested and/or fragmented landscape formed by forest remnants of different sizes and shape embedded within the agricultural matrix. As an ecosystem engineer and a crucial seed predator, white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari) play a pivotal role in forest structure, biodiversity, and nutrient cycling. However, they are highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation and hunting pressure. White-lipped peccaries are, therefore, a wide-ranging "landscape species," the spatial and ecological requirements of which can be used to guide conservation planning in human-modified landscapes. Using data from GPS-tracked individuals in large-scale mechanized agriculture landscapes in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's largest soybean and maize producer, we investiated the home range size and resource selection during both the crop and non-crop season. We observed a seasonal variation in home range size and an increased selection for croplands during the crop season. White-lipped peccaries favored native vegetation patches and also exhibited avoidance of locations distant from perennial water bodies and distant cropland locations far from forest remmants.

AB  - This study investigates the use of a drone equipped with a thermal camera for recognizing wild mammal species in open areas and to determine the sex and age of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreoulus) in a 13 km2 moor in Denmark. Two separate surveys were conducted: (1) To achieve drone images for the identification of mammals, the drone was tested around a bait place with a live wildlife camera that was often visited by European badger (Meles meles), stone marten (Martes foina), European hare (Lepus europaeus), roe deer and cattle (Bos taurus). The thermal images of wild animal species could be distinguished by their body measures when the drone filmed with the camera pointed perpendicular to the ground in an altitude range of 50-120 m. A PCA ordination showed nonoverlapping body characteristics and MANOVA showed that the combined body measures used were significantly distinctive F = 6.8, p < 0.001. The reactions and behavioral responses of the different species to the altitude and noise of the drone were also tested in this place. (2) On a 13 km(2) moor, a drone was used for a population study of deer. Red deer and roe deer were counted and separated by body measures. Red deer individuals could, at the right altitude, be separated into adults and calves, and males and females. Body length was the most conclusive body measure, and therefore a reference measurement in the field is recommended. The frame thermal images were effective in species recognition and for use in population studies of deer, and are thought to be more time-efficient and less invasive than traditional methods. In autumn, the number of stags and the life stage of red deer, as well as the distribution of deer in different types of vegetation, could be determined.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) poses a significant challenge to biodiversity conservation and rural livelihoods, particularly in regions where human activities overlap with wildlife habitats. This study examines livestock predation patterns and economic losses caused by the Himalayan black bear (Ursus thibetanus), Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus), and common leopard (Panthera pardus) in the Kupwara region of the Western Himalayas, India. Over two years (2021-2022), data were collected from 32 villages in Handwara and Sogam-Lolab subdivisions through interviews with 258 respondents, including 50 herders. A total of 178 predation incidents were recorded, resulting in the loss of 287 livestock and an estimated economic impact of $42,683 USD. Sheep were the most frequently targeted species (75%), followed by goats (13%), cattle (9%), and horses (2%). Predation was most common in spring (55.7%) and summer (26.6%). Black bears were responsible for 69% of kills, leopards for 27%, and brown bears for 3%. Significant differences were observed in predation patterns by livestock age class and species, with sheep and young livestock being particularly vulnerable. Spatial analysis identified Handwara and Dorosa as predation hotspots using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). The study highlights unattended grazing and poorly constructed corrals as key factors driving predation. Community-preferred mitigation strategies included financial compensation, removal of conflict animals, and incentives for constructing predator-proof enclosures. These findings emphasize the importance of targeted interventions, such as seasonal management strategies, improved livestock practices, and community engagement, to mitigate livestock predation risks.

AB  - Understanding the population size of animals is crucial for formulating scientific management policies, especially for endangered species. The central area of the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi is a vital area for forest musk deer, but research is insufficient and estimates of its population size are lacking. In this study, we constructed a species distribution model for the forest musk deer in the central Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi using topography, land-use, and bioclimatic variables alongside forest musk deer occurrence data. The Time-to-Event (TTE) model was employed to estimate the population density of forest musk deer in the selected survey area. By utilizing the suitable habitat area provided by the species distribution model, the population density in the central Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi was estimated by extrapolating from the survey area. Our estimate of the population size of forest musk deer in the central Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi is approximately 2722 +/- 788. Similar population estimation methods could be more widely applied, especially in areas with limited survey resources.

AB  - The results of a two-year study conducted to assess the outcomes of a long-term forest isolation experiment are presented. A section of a spruce-birch forest in Yaroslavl oblast (6S4B, 100 years old, quality class I) was isolated from the presence of moose for 25 years. It is established that net mineralization of nitrogen compounds in the 0- to 12-cm soil horizon measured from May to October under field conditions was more intense in the unfenced area in comparison with the isolated area (15 +/- 0.4 and 10.4 +/- 0.5 g N/m(2), respectively). Carbon dioxide emissions from the soil in that same time period were lower in the unfenced area (319 +/- 47 g C/m(2)) than in the isolated area (552 +/- 82 g C/m(2)). On the isolated site, 19 mg of nitrogen is mineralized in the soil per gram of C-CO2; while on the control site, it is 47 mg of nitrogen per gram of C-CO2. In the isolated variant, the distribution of ammonium concentrations in the upper (0-4 cm) soil horizon is normal, while in the control variant, it is lognormal due to the presence of elk.

AB  - The temporal abundance of Antarctic seals is known to be influenced by variation in the sea ice environment, itself affected by temperature and daylight cycles across seasons. However, the sensitivity of seal populations to changes in their environment beyond expected natural variation depends on their abilities to deal with extreme conditions and to take advantage of favourable environmental changes, which is rarely validated empirically. Here, we report on the responses of three sympatric Antarctic seal species to sea ice change: two 'ice-tolerant' species: Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella and southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina, and the 'ice-obligate' Weddell seal Leptonychotes wedellii, over a 48-year period from 1977 to 2024 at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands. This area has undergone changes in the sea ice environment following persistent long-term warming since the 1950s, and a cooling period from approximately 1998-2014. The shared environment and varying adaptation to sea ice of the three species presented a unique opportunity to assess and compare species-specific responses to fluctuating sea ice cycles, and validate predictions of responses from projections of sea ice change. Across five decades, all three species were significantly affected by temporary changes in the sea-ice environment, which contributed to synchronous between-year variation in numbers, although density dependence was an important effect for each species. Maximum synchrony between seal species was observed from the late 1990s to mid-2000s, coinciding with the temporary absence of warming, with the ice obligate Weddell seal benefiting from an extended sea ice season but not the two ice-tolerant species. Numbers of Antarctic fur seals and Weddell seals declined significantly between 1977 and 2024 by approximately 47% and 54% respectively, from a peak in 1994 and 1985, although no significant overall long-term decline in the numbers of southern elephant seals was found, despite trend synchronicity.

AB  - Like many other anthropogenic habitats, log piles are mainly built in urban areas as a species-specific conservation measure for the European stag beetle (Lucanus cervus). As little is known about the success of this measure, we aim to study their success and longevity based on 100 small log piles that were followed up with emergence traps. Log piles were colonised the first year of building and beetles emerged up to 13 years later, with most beetles emerging after eight years. Overall, 67% of the log piles had emerging beetles: Quercus robur log piles (80%) were more successful than Fagus sylvatica (58%) and Populus x canadensis (50%). Overall, 177 +/- 5, 131 +/- 5 and 89 +/- 5 beetles emerged per 1 m(3) wood used in the log pile for oak, beech, and poplar respectively, but tree species had no effect on the size of the beetles. The emergence phenology was explained by a degree-day model with 6.6 degrees C as baseline temperature, predicting start and end of the emergence around 620 and 810 accumulated degree-days.

AB  - The study investigates the effects of composting sheep manure with corn straw (CM) and sheep manure with apple tree branches (AM) on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities. The results indicate that AM treatment enables the compost pile to reach the high-temperature phase more quickly. The total phosphorus and total potassium content in AM treatment compost increased compared to the initial stage of composting, while CM treatment effectively enhanced the total nitrogen and total phosphorus content, and CM treatment compost was more conducive to reducing the compost's electrical conductivity. The relative abundance of total ARGs for sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and integrase genes in CM treatment compost were lower than in AM treatment compost. CM treatment was beneficial in reducing the relative abundance of sul1 and tetA02 by 33.61% and 35.51%, respectively. Both treatments were effective in reducing the relative abundance of sul3 and intI2. . The relative abundance of Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria in AM treatment decreased over time, while Bacteroidetes increased, which was opposite to the trend observed in CM treatment. There were significant correlations between the compost's physicochemical properties, bacterial communities, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). ARGs and MGEs can exist in multiple host bacteria, and various ARGs and MGEs can also be hosted in the same bacterium. Mantel analysis showed that the total organic matter, total phosphorus, and total potassium had the greatest contributions to the changes in ARGs and MGEs, while temperature and bacterial communities regulated ARGs by affecting MGEs. Obviously, adding corn straw is more effective in reducing the abundance of ARGs during the sheep manure composting.

AB  - Effective conservation management of threatened species with transboundary distributions is a challenge, requiring international coordination to ensure that country-specific actions align with regional imperatives. Many international conservation efforts overlook species needing attention and fail to incorporate the field expertise of local researchers in regional-level assessments. Here we focus on the taruka Hippocamelus antisensis, a threatened and little-studied deer of the Central Andes Ecoregion in South America. Since 2016, experts, managers and governmental authorities from all countries encompassing the species' range have gathered to collate information about its presence and coordinate efforts to conserve it. We constructed taruka distribution models using historical records and more recent sightings reported during the last 50 years. Our findings revealed several critical insights: slope, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during the dry season, and daily and seasonal temperature variability are primary predictors of taruka distribution, and the largest part of its range is in Peru (54%), followed by Bolivia (30%), Argentina (10%) and Chile (6%). The species' core distribution is confined to the western and eastern limits of the Central Andes Ecoregion, bordered by the Sechura and Atacama Desert to the west and the Yungas Forest to the east. Protection is limited, with only 12 and 8% of the core and non-core areas, respectively, of the species' range under formal protection. We recommend safeguarding connectivity of the core distribution by establishing transboundary protected areas, improving taruka coexistence with local communities, strengthening and formalizing international collaboration amongst taruka experts and raising the species' appeal amongst policymakers and the public. In particular, we hope to encourage international collaboration between Southern Hemisphere specialists. This is important because these researchers have extensive field knowledge that could improve global conservation efforts, especially in regions that lack adequate conservation funding.

AB  - Baraiyadhala National Park (BNP) is one of the 53 protected areas in Bangladesh that is attached to the southeastern hilly areas representing mixed-evergreen forest with a couple of waterfalls, deciduous patches, and steep hills. Also, this area is a popular destination for tourists during monsoon season. Here, we studied the relative abundance, diversity, and community composition of terrestrial mammals along with the associated factors implying camera traps in the 48 locations of BNP. Over a span of 2793 days, 2430 independent video clips were obtained between 2022 and 2023 resulting in 27 cryptic species from six orders. Seven of the recorded species were globally threatened (25.93%) including Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) and pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina). RAI showed a high index value for Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) from primates, northern red muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis) from cetartiodactyla and small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus) from carnivora. In contrast, RAI was relatively small for the Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) and marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata). The lack of relationship between elevation and disturbance indicated that species diversity was influenced by the heterogeneity of habitats. Species richness was relatively higher in tropical wet areas (TW) than in forest edge (ED) and steep hills but not significantly varied with semievergreen areas. Species composition was also found to be spatially different; high and low beta diversity was found from TW and ED, respectively. Northern red muntjac was the identical species in this forest that occupied all habitats apart from the ED area. Forest fire and other anthropogenic activities were also evident; however, poachers significantly influenced the species composition rather than villagers, tourists, and domestic animals in BNP. This systematic study provides valuable insights for the future management and conservation of threatened mammals in this national park.

AB  - Mojave Desert shrublands are home to unique plants and wildlife and are experiencing rapid habitat change due to unprecedented large-scale disturbances; yet, established practices to effectively restore disturbed landscapes are not well developed. A priority species list of native plant taxa was developed to guide seed collectors, commercial growers, resource managers, and restoration practitioners in support of the Bureau of Land Management's Mojave Desert Native Plant Program. We identify focal plant taxa that are important for habitats of the threatened Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), a widely distributed herbivore in low and middle elevations, and pollinator taxa, including mostly Lepidopterans and Apoidean bees, some of whose populations are in decline. We identified 201 unique plant taxa in the diets of tortoises, and 49 taxa that provide thermal cover for tortoises with some overlapping taxa that provide both diet and cover. We discuss 134 native pollinators associated with plants used for nectaring, larval hosts, or cover and nesting materials. Detailed plant species accounts describing the status-of-knowledge for 57 plant taxonomic groups including detailed information on life history, ecology, and pollinator syndrome relevant to restoration success, methods of seed harvesting, propagation, and historical use in restoration. Our approach for developing a priority plant species list for the Mojave Desert provides a data-guided listing of species for restoration practitioners and identifies knowledge gaps for future investigation.

AB  - 1.Invasive species are reducing global biodiversity. The Llgaay gwii sdiihlda-Restoring Balance project was initiated to halt and reverse biodiversity loss on six islands on Haida Gwaii, Canada through the eradication of invasive Sitka Black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis).
   2.Invasive deer were killed using various hunting methods including bait station, boat, aerial and indicator dog hunting as well as a combination of bailing dogs with boat and aerial hunting. Cost was quantified in terms of helicopter hunting hours (1965 CAD/hr at the time of the study) to facilitate comparisons. Efficiency was quantified as the expected number of deer per helicopter hour.
   3.Hierarchical Bayesian integrated removal models were used to estimate the change in efficiency of the various hunting methods with deer density based on a power function. The models used the number of scent trail detections by dogs at the end of the study to help parameterise the population density.
   4.At densities between 2 and 30 deer/km(2), boat hunting was estimated as the most efficient method while at lower densities indicator dog hunting was most efficient.
   5.The eradication was incomplete. The estimated cost to completion using indicator dog hunting for each island was 43 helicopter hours (similar to$84,000) on Ramsay Island (95% CI = 19-128), 3.9 helicopter hours on Murchison Island (95% CI = 0.56-18) and no additional hours on House (95% CI = 0-1.6) though the selected method would likely have been indicator dogs with combined hunting due to the variable terrain.
   6.Lessons learned: DNA connectivity analysis can be used to determine project durability, pilot studies to confirm method efficiency in local context will increase the chances of success, local knowledge improves efficiency of hunting methods, population and efficiency estimates should be updated throughout operations to allow adaptive management, eradications on ungulates can include pauses to facilitate adaptive management, the level of certainty for determining eradication completion should be determined in advance of operations with explicit trade-offs identified for managers.

AB  - Simple Summary: The main hosts of hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 are porcine species. Transmission of the virus to humans, for example via undercooked meat, may cause acute or chronic hepatitis. To determine sources and routes of infection, comparing the viruses present in humans to the ones present in main hosts is a helpful tool. However, it requires knowledge of the genetic diversity of the circulating viruses. Therefore, we tested Swiss pigs and wild boars for HEV and determined the virus subtype and part of its genome. In addition, we determined the HEV subtype present in 11 positive meat products. One pig liver from the slaughterhouses (0.3%) and seven livers from a carcass collection (13%) as well as seven wild boar livers (5.8%) were found HEV positive. The same virus subtypes were found in Swiss pigs, wild boars, and meat products. Most of the viruses belonged to a Swiss-specific cluster within the subtype 3h. In addition, one pig liver and one wild boar liver were found positive for 3l and two meat products from Germany for 3c. Our data indicate that Switzerland has its "own" HEV viruses that circulate independent from the rest of Europe.Hepatitis E caused by hepatitis E viruses of the genotype 3 (HEV-3) is a major health concern in industrialized countries and due to its zoonotic character requires a "One Health" approach to unravel routes and sources of transmission. Knowing the viral diversity present in reservoir hosts, i.e., pigs but also wild boars, is an important prerequisite for molecular epidemiology. The aim of this study was to gain primary information on the diversity of HEV-3 subtypes present along the food chain in Switzerland, as well as the diversity within these subtypes. To this end, samples of domestic pigs from slaughterhouses and carcass collection points, as well as from hunted wild boars, were tested for HEV RNA and antibodies. HEV positive meat products were provided by food testing labs. The HEV subtypes were determined using Sanger and next generation sequencing. The genetic analyses confirmed the predominance of a Swiss-specific cluster within subtype HEV-3h in pigs, meat products, and wild boars. This cluster, which may result from local virus evolution due to the isolated Swiss pig industry, supports fast differentiation of domestic and imported infections with HEV.

AB  - We investigated the effects of strong top-down control by high fish stock on structure and seasonal dynamics of plankton in nine fishponds under conventional fishery management based on auxiliary feeding during two vegetation seasons. Mean concentrations of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and high densities of phytoplankton, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and ciliates indicated hypertrophic state of the fishponds, as well as a markedly reduced control of these microbial food web components by crustacean zooplankton. Mean seasonal densities of zooplankton varied within one order of magnitude for cladocerans, copepods, nauplii, and rotifers. Daphnia were found in most fishponds in densities up to 630 ind. l(-1) (median: 53 ind. l(-1)). While TN and TP concentrations were high, dissolved inorganic N (median: 29 & mu;g l(-1)) and reactive P (median: 11 & mu;g l(-1)) indicated possible nutrient deficiency. The fish stock index (defined as the product of biomass and square root of densities) was used as a proxy for fish predation pressure. Multivariate analysis revealed that nutrients and high fish stocks (market carp, carp fry, and/or undesirable small planktivorous fishes) were the main driving forces shaping the fishpond plankton. The resulting trophic structure thus severely reduced the herbivorous zooplankton-fish link during a vegetation season.

AB  - Mother-offspring communication is especially crucial for social species in order to synchronize activities essential for early survival including nursing, resting, maintaining proximity during group movements between food or water sources, and locating one another if separated in a large social group. One of the most social ungulate species in North America is the American Bison (Bison bison), formerly known as buffalo. Adult female bison associate with their young for over a year and communication between mother and offspring is likely essential for establishing and maintaining a bond upon which the life of a calf depends. One goal of this study was to quantify and compare the acoustic form of vocalizations of adult female, subadult, and calf bison and to determine how age classes differed in call structure. The other goal was to identify the contexts in which bison vocalized. Vocalizations of 101 bison (53 adult females, 15 subadults, 33 calves) in a semi-free-ranging herd in Montana were analyzed and found to be pulsatile sounds, unlike vocalizations of bison bulls or domestic cows and calves. Vocalizations of bison cows, subadults, and calves differed significantly in total duration, numbers of pulses, pulse duration, and pulse rate. Seven distinct call contexts were identified. The majority of calls were "moving-on calls" (39%), when a cow called and her calf ran to her side and the 2 moved on together, and "contact calls" (21%) when a cow called and her calf called back but neither changed their location. "Imprinting calls" and "nursing calls" were also identified. Mother-offspring acoustic communication in bison appears especially critical for coordinating movements. Understanding the role of acoustic communication in maintaining the bond between bison mothers and their offspring can contribute to the humane management and welfare of this iconic species.
   The American Bison, the national mammal of the United States, teetered on the brink of extinction in the 1800s. Today, efforts to reestablish populations of bison are increasing. However, bison are not domestic cattle and we lack an understanding of bison behavior, which can lead to bison and bison managers being injured. Bison cows and their offspring numerically dominate a bison herd and this study focused on the vocalization of bison cows and their offspring. Using 4 acoustic variables, bison vocalizations could be correctly classified to age class of the individual calling in 85% of cases, indicating the potential for individual identification. Bison mothers uttered calls, to which their calves responded, in 7 distinct contexts. In the majority of cases, mothers called to their calves in the contexts of moving to a new location and when locating the position of the calf in the herd (39% moving-on calls and 21% contact calls). Mother-offspring acoustic communication in bison appears critical for coordinating movements. Understanding the role of acoustic communication in maintaining the bond between bison mothers and their offspring can contribute to the humane management and welfare of this iconic species.
   La comunicaci & oacute;n madre-cr & iacute;a es especialmente crucial para especies sociales, debido a que permite sincronizar actividades esenciales para la supervivencia temprana, como la lactancia, el descanso, el mantenimiento de proximidad durante los movimientos de los grupo entre las fuentes de alimento o agua y la localizaci & oacute;n mutua en caso de separaci & oacute;n dentro de un grupo social grande. Una de las especies de ungulados m & aacute;s sociales de Am & eacute;rica del Norte es el bisonte (Bison bison). Las hembras adultas de bisonte se asocian con sus cr & iacute;as durante m & aacute;s de un a & ntilde;o y la comunicaci & oacute;n entre madre el becerro es probablemente esencial para establecer y mantener un v & iacute;nculo en el que depende la vida de la cr & iacute;a. Uno de los objetivos de este estudio fue cuantificar y comparar la forma ac & uacute;stica de las vocalizaciones de hembras adultas, subadultas y cr & iacute;as de bisonte, y determinar c & oacute;mo difer & iacute;an las clases por edad en la estructura de las llamadas. Otro objetivo fue identificar los contextos en los que se emit & iacute;an las vocalizaciones. Se analizaron las vocalizaciones de 101 bisontes (53 hembras adultas, 15 hembras subadultas, 33 cr & iacute;as) en un reba & ntilde;o semi-libre en Montana. Se encontr & oacute; que estas vocalizaciones eran sonidos puls & aacute;tiles, completamente diferentes a los emitidos por los bisontes machos adultos o las vacas y becerros dom & eacute;sticos. Las vocalizaciones difer & iacute;an significativamente entre las tres clases de edad en su duraci & oacute;n total, n & uacute;mero de pulsos, duraci & oacute;n de los pulsos y ritmo de los pulsos. La mayor & iacute;a de las llamadas se dieron en dos contextos: "llamadas de avance" (39%), cuando una hembra adulta llamaba y su cr & iacute;a corr & iacute;a a su lado y ambas avanzaban juntas, y "llamadas de contacto" (21%), cuando una hembra adulta llamaba y su cr & iacute;a respond & iacute;a, pero ninguna cambiaba su ubicaci & oacute;n. Tambi & eacute;n se identificaron "llamadas de impronta" y "llamadas de amamantamiento," as & iacute; como otros tres contextos de llamada. La comunicaci & oacute;n ac & uacute;stica madre-cr & iacute;a en bisontes parece especialmente cr & iacute;tica para coordinar los movimientos. Entender el papel de la comunicaci & oacute;n ac & uacute;stica en el mantenimiento del v & iacute;nculo entre las madres y sus cr & iacute;as puede contribuir al manejo humanitario y al bienestar de esta especie ic & oacute;nica. Este trabajo representa el primer estudio que investiga cuantitativamente las se & ntilde;ales ac & uacute;sticas de hembras adultas, subadultas y cr & iacute;as de bisontes Norte Americanos mientras se desplazan en condiciones de semi-libertad.

AB  - Mutualisms may be more or less sensitive to environmental conditions depending on the diversity and responses of the species involved. Ants frequently form mutualistic associations with plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs): the ants protect the plants from herbivores and receive food resources (i.e., nectar) in return. As ectotherms, ants are strongly influenced by temperature, and temperature shifts can affect ant-plant interactions in ways that often depend on species functional traits. In this study, we explored the influence of EFN size and leaf surface temperature on ant-plant interactions in a Caatinga dry forest in Brazil. We observed the ants visiting 14 EFN-bearing plant species at different times of day over 12 sampling months; we also measured leaf surface temperatures during these periods. We next quantified EFN size for 68 individuals from the 14 plant species. The observational data were used to characterize the heat tolerance of the attendant ant species (i.e., based on levels of foraging activity). We then evaluated the mutualism's degree of functional resilience using two indices: functional redundancy (i.e., the number of ant species interacting with a given plant species) and thermal response diversity (i.e., variability in the heat tolerance of the ant species interacting with a given plant species). We found that leaf surface temperature, but not EFN size, had an influence on mutualism functional resilience. As temperatures increased, both functional redundancy and thermal response diversity decreased. This result implies that warmer global temperatures could heighten the vulnerability of facultative ant-plant mutualisms, regardless of plant traits.

AB  - Macrobenthic communities in a lake are affected by the type of bottom cover such as macrophytes or algae. In the southern basin of Lake Biwa, mats of the benthic cyanobacteria (BC) Microseira wollei widely cover the lake bottom and are interspersed with submerged macrophytes (SMs). Because different macrobenthos species appear to occur at those bottoms, we investigated the composition of the communities. Furthermore, as M. wollei is supposed to be inedible to consumer organisms owing to its hard sheath and toxins, the food possibility of the cyanobacteria and macrophytes for macrobenthos was analyzed. In this study, macrobenthos were collected, identified molecularly, counted in the BC and SM zones, and analyzed for carbon and nitrogen stable-isotopic compositions. In the BC zone, asellids and amphipods dominated the macrobenthic community, while chironomids dominated the SM zone. The stable-isotope analysis revealed that M. wollei was a minor food source for macrobenthos and other higher-level consumers, with some macrophytes, particulate organic matter and bottom sediment potentially being a major source. The dominance of crustacean macrobenthos in M. wollei mats suggested that they provided a refuge from predation for crustaceans, whereas SMs were not sufficiently abundant to achieve this. Although different macrobenthic communities in the BC and SM zones were likely supported by common food sources, with the exeption of M. wollei, the present study was conducted over a short period and lacked advanced methods for gut content analysis. Therefore, further monitoring and food web analysis are required.

AB  - Stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs) may vary over time due to ecological and anthropogenic impacts, challenging traditional approaches of calculating maximum sustainable yield (MSY)-based reference points that assume constant population traits. We compare seven methods to calculate MSY, F-MSY and B-MSY by modelling constant, stochastic (uncorrelated), and autocorrelated SRRs using simulations and two case studies [Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the Grand Bank off Newfoundland, Canada]. Results indicated that the method used to model SRRs strongly affected the temporal pattern of recruitment projection, and the variations generated by autocorrelated SRRs were more similar to observed patterns. When the population productivity had low-frequency and large-magnitude variations, stochastic SRRs generated greater MSY and F-MSY estimates than constant or autocorrelated SRRs, while no consistent pattern of B-MSY was detected. In the case studies, stochastic and autocorrelated SRRs produced asymmetric relationships between fishing mortality and yield, with higher risk of overfishing by going beyond F-MSY. Overall, our results suggest that caution should be taken when calculating MSY-based reference points in highly dynamic ecosystems, and correctly accounting for non-stationary population dynamics could, therefore, lead to more sustainable fisheries.

AB  - Invasive species employ competitive strategies such as releasing allelopathic chemicals into the environment that negatively impact native species. Decomposing Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) leaves leach various allelopathic phenolics into the soil, decreasing the vigor of several native species. Notable differences in the net negative impacts of L. maackii metabolites on target species were argued to depend on soil properties, the microbiome, the proximity to the allelochemical source, the allelochemical concentration, or environmental conditions. This study is the first to address the role of target species' metabolic properties in determining their net sensitivity to allelopathic inhibition by L. maackii. Gibberellic acid (GA(3)) is a critical regulator of seed germination and early development. We hypothesized that GA(3) levels might affect the target sensitivity to allelopathic inhibitors and evaluated differences in the response of a standard (control, Rbr), a GA(3)-overproducing (ein), and a GA(3)-deficient (ros) Brassica rapa variety to L. maackii allelochemicals. Our results demonstrate that high GA(3) concentrations substantially alleviate the inhibitory effects of L. maackii allelochemicals. A better understanding of the importance of target species' metabolic properties in their responses to allelochemicals will contribute to developing novel invasive species control and biodiversity conservation protocols and may contribute to applications in agriculture.

AB  - The Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary, a critical habitat for elephant conservation in the Dalma Landscape, is increasingly experiencing the multifaceted impacts of climate change. This study reviews secondary literature to examine the consequences of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes on elephant populations, emphasizing the exacerbating effects of climate-induced alterations. The sanctuary faces challenges like habitat degradation and fragmentation, which impede wildlife movement and intensify human-wildlife conflicts, particularly with elephants. These issues are now compounded by climate change, which is altering vegetation patterns, water availability, and seasonal behaviours of wildlife, further straining the delicate balance of this ecosystem. This paper methodically dissects the literature, highlighting how climate change interplays with existing environmental stressors, affecting the conservation strategies and viability of elephant corridors. The review also considers management strategies, underscoring the need for adaptive measures that address the dual challenges of habitat degradation and climate change. By broadening the scope to include the climate change dimension, this research not only underscores the researcher's comprehensive understanding of the sanctuary's ecological challenges but also aligns the study with global environmental concerns, making it relevant in the context of contemporary wildlife conservation efforts. Through a structured approach, the paper is divided into sections that explore the sanctuary's ecological significance, the factors impacting elephant populations with a focus on climate change, and methods for studying human-elephant conflicts in the context of a changing climate. This comprehensive analysis aims to identify research gaps, propose adaptive conservation strategies, and contribute to the broader understanding of how climate change is reshaping wildlife conservation paradigms.

AB  - Large population increases of Arctic-breeding waterfowls over recent decades have intensified the conflict with agricultural interests in both Eurasia and North America. In the spring-staging region Vesteralen in sub-Arctic Norway, sheep, dairy and meat farmers have reported reduced agricultural grassland yields due to pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus and barnacle geese Branta leucopsis that rest and forage in the region for 3-4 weeks in spring on their way to their breeding grounds on Svalbard. Here, we report from an experimental exclosure design where goose access to plots at three grassland fields in Vesteralen was prevented. The experiment was conducted over 3 years between 2012 and 2014. Goose abundance varied greatly between fields and years as a function of variable spring weather and forage quantity, facilitating evaluation of longer-term impacts under contrasting grazing intensities. First and second harvest yields across fields and years were 20% and 19% higher in exclosures than in plots open for grazing, while total yields (sum of first and second harvests) were on average 27% higher. Within-year effects on harvest yields varied substantially, primarily due to highly contrasting sward development during the spring-staging periods. Cool weather (2012) led to slow sward development and little or no effects on harvest yields, warmer weather (2013) resulted in generally large effects, while variable weather (2014) led to treatment effects varying across fields, with one field experiencing 61% higher yields in exclosures while there were no significant impacts on first-harvest yields at the two other fields. Goose grazing did not increase dry weight-based proportions of weeds. Overall, the farmers' reports on yield-loss due to goose grazing were confirmed, although impacts varied substantially between years. A novel finding is that second-harvest yields were also reduced. For the most affected farmers, it is unlikely that the current subsidy scheme is sufficient to cover all the their losses. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change is a major driver of global biodiversity loss, yet the precise mechanisms linking climate change to population declines remain poorly understood. We developed a novel, broadly applicable framework that integrates biophysical, nutritional, and population modeling to capture fundamental physiological constraints on mammalian herbivores and applied it to investigate the causes of declines in ringtail possums of the Australian Wet Tropics (Pseudochirops archeri and Hemibelideus lemuroides). Our approach bridges the gap between mechanistic ("bottom-up") models, which simulate species' responses based solely on their traits and local microclimates, and the more common ("top-down") statistical models, which infer species' responses from occurrence or abundance data and standard environmental variables. We quantified population dynamics over a 30-year period by generating species-specific estimates of temperature and water stress, foraging limitations, and linking these with annual monitoring and nutritional quality within an open population model. Our findings demonstrate that climate change has impacted populations through physiological stress, but in a species-specific manner. Both species have experienced population collapses at lower elevations and in low-nutritional sites. For P. archeri, we found evidence that population changes were driven by reduced survival due to overheating and dehydration, alongside diminished recruitment from limited foraging. In contrast, our model suggests that H. lemuroides populations were primarily affected by foraging constraints, emphasizing the importance of considering climate-driven limitations on foraging activity in addition to direct physiological stress. These mechanistic insights offer a foundation for targeted conservation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate pressures on wild populations.

AB  - Captive breeding programmes represent the most intensive type of ex situ population management for threatened species. One example is the Cuvier's gazelle programme that started in 1975 with only four founding individuals, and after more than four decades of management in captivity, a reintroduction effort was undertaken in Tunisia in 2016, to establish a population in an area historically included within its range. Here, we aim to determine the genetic consequences of this reintroduction event by assessing the genetic diversity of the founder stock as well as of their descendants. We present the first whole-genome sequencing dataset of 30 Cuvier's gazelles including captive-bred animals, animals born in Tunisia after a reintroduction and individuals from a genetically unrelated Moroccan population. Our analyses revealed no difference between the founder and the offspring cohorts in genome-wide heterozygosity and inbreeding levels, and in the amount and length of runs of homozygosity. The captive but unmanaged Moroccan gazelles have the lowest genetic diversity of all genomes analysed. Our findings demonstrate that the Cuvier's gazelle captive breeding programme can serve as source populations for future reintroductions of this species. We believe that this study can serve as a starting point for global applications of genomics to the conservation plan of this species.

AB  - In the European Union, African swine fever (ASF) affects wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations in several Member States. Knowledge of population connectivity is important for the implementation of control measures, in particular the establishment of effective barriers. Population genetic comparisons of neighbouring populations can be very helpful in this respect. The present study investigated the genetic differentiation of wild boar in eastern Germany. This region has been affected by ASF since September 2020. A total of 1,262 wild boars from 31 hunting grounds (populations) in ASF-affected and ASF-free districts were sampled over a total area of almost 100,000 km(2). The study area encompassed a network of geographical factors that promote (roads, rivers, cities) or inhibit (natural areas, habitat corridors) genetic differentiation between wild boar populations. The genetic differentiation of the areas was based on 12 microsatellite markers. Three different Bayesian algorithms were used to analyse the data. The results were combined into a common approach with 9 clusters. Based on the cluster distribution in each population, the connectivity between the areas was quantified. The strongest differentiation was found along an imaginary line along the lower Elbe valley through Berlin and the A11 freeway to the Szczecin Lagoon. In contrast, the Mecklenburg Lake District and the south-east of the study area showed strong connectivity between areas. The special features of the landscapes along the lower Elbe valley, which was assessed as highly connective, and the high barrier effect of the A11 freeway in contrast to the other freeways in the study area show that barrier effects cannot be generalised in principle, but are actually determined by the circumstances of individual structures. The results of the connectivity analysis were compared with the distribution of viral lineages and variants. The genotypes of the wild boar populations and the ASFV lineages and variants showed a good explanatory approach for the observed disease dynamics in the study area. The newly gained knowledge on barriers and regionally different connectivity between wild boar populations can support considerations and measures for the containment of ASF in the affected areas by improving the understanding of wild boar dispersal dynamics.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have a significant influence on species range expansion, habitat shifts, and risk of biological invasion due to changes in survival rates, and rapid reproduction. This will tend to affect their geographical distribution and dispersal patterns, thereby threatening agriculture production and food security. Therefore, it is essential to understand the impact of climate change on the range shifts of an invasive species like the Asiatic rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Dynastinae: Scarabaeidae), to inform policy formulation and preventive measures. To achieve this, we used environmental variables and occurrence records of O. rhinoceros to predict the current and future potential distribution of the pest under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) for three time periods (2030, 2050, and 2080). We employed Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) and ArcGIS to create risk maps for the pest. The BRT model predicts an expansion of O. rhinoceros outside the current known distribution. The environmental variables which contributed the most to the geographical distribution of the pest were minimum temperature of coldest month (26.81 %), followed by precipitation of wettest month (20.61 %), temperature annual range (11.34 %), mean diurnal range (11.33 %), and elevation (4.49 %). Under the different climate change scenarios, O. rhinoceros will continue to threaten the economically important host plants until 2080. As a result, there will be a need for effective strategies to prevent its spread. Our predictions are reliable and have the potential to estimate the global distribution of the pest, as well as provide suggestions for prompt of O. rhinoceros prevention and management.

AB  - Large herbivore grazing plays a key role in regulating ecosystem functioning and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects and mechanisms of large herbivore grazing intensity on soil nutrient fractions remain largely unclear in alpine grasslands. Here, we determine 20 indicator variables associated with soil nutrient fractions (e.g., particulate organic carbon, POC; mineral-associated organic carbon, MAOC) to investigate how grazing intensity on labile fractions through a well-controlled grazing experiment in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results show that microbial biomass carbon, dissolved organic carbon, light fraction organic carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen and phosphorus, total potassium, and available potassium significantly decrease with increased grazing intensity, whereas other fractions (e.g., POC, MAOC, dissolved organic nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, available nitrogen, etc.) have marginal or non-significant responses to grazing intensity. Further analysis reveals that above-and below-ground biomass, soil moisture, and soil pH jointly determine the grazing effects on soil nutrient fractions, without the impact of species richness. Moreover, correlation analyses indicate that grazing intensity decouples carbon and nitrogen from phosphorus and potassium in alpine meadows. Collectively, our results emphasize the importance of grazing intensity effects on nutrient cycling in alpine grasslands and incorporate the impacts of grazing intensity into terrestrial ecosystem models may help accurately predict carbon sequestration potential in grazinglands.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressure has well-documented effects on the spatial distribution of biodiversity but it can also have more subtle effects on wildlife, influencing the time of the day and for how long animals are active. These temporal effects have not received much attention from the scientific and conservation community, despite activity being intrinsically related to crucial aspects in an animal's life. Here we use data from a large-scale camera trap survey (517 survey sites covering more than 1000 km(2)) conducted in areas under distinct levels of protection in the Brazilian Cerrado to investigate the effect of anthropogenic pressure on the activity of mammal species >1 kg. We used both circular statistics and GLMMs to investigate whether species would shift activity towards the night in response to disturbance, resulting in a decrease of diurnal activity in areas under lower protection levels and closer to households. Our results revealed that most species investigated did not show a temporal response to anthropogenic pressure, with only two species responding in the way we expected: tamanduas reduced the probability of daytime activity closer to households and collared peccaries reduced diurnal activity slightly in areas under lower protection levels. Our findings also suggest that environmental factors have a greater influence on species' activity than indicators of pressure in the mosaic of protected areas studied. Although stricter levels of habitat protection are known to have a positive and strong influence on the spatial distribution of many mammal species in the study region, we showed here that human pressure has only a modest effect on the period these species were active. This limited temporal response highlights the need for large natural areas under low disturbance that allow mammal species to respond spatially to threats.

AB  - Thirty dairy buffaloes were used for 90 days to evaluate the impact of a novel protein source (HI-PRO (R)), (R)), a feed alternative rich in protein (made from Saccharomyces and Bacillus), on the productivity of nursing buffaloes. The nursing water buffaloes had an average weight of 550 +/- 11.2 kg. The treatments consisted of diets containing two distinct protein sources: (1) soybean meal (44 % as the control group); and (2) HI-PRO (R) (R) product. Throughout the trial, measurements of nutritional digestibility and blood metabolites (total protein, albumin, urea, and creatinine) were conducted. Quantity and composition of the milk were measured to determine the content of milk proteins, lipids, and lactose. The outcome of the results showed insignificant decrease in the buffaloes receiving HI-PRO (R) (R) feed versus control group. Furthermore, there was enhancement in the fiber digestibility by approximately 2.5 % in the HI-PRO (R) (R) group compared to the control group. The levels of protein, albumin, globulin, urea, and creatinine fall within the normal range for animals in good health. Using HI-PRO (R) (R) resulted in a marginal improvement in milk production, increasing it by approximately 4.8 % compared to soybean meal. Furthermore, the buffaloes fed HI-PRO (R) (R) showed a slightly elevated 4 % fat-corrected milk output and milk composition. To summarize, nursing buffaloes can utilize HI-PRO (R) (R) as an efficient protein source in their diets, replacing soybean meal.

AB  - Although cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus were once widespread in the Horn of Africa, their presence in Somaliland has not been confirmed since 2010, and they have been presumed extirpated in recent years. During 2021-2022 the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change in Somaliland carried out two rapid surveys in the Awdal region of western Somaliland to investigate the status of the cheetah in this area. The team collected socio-ecological data from 26 villages for a total of 13 days. In both years people from most villages reported sightings of cheetahs, and the team also received multiple reports of predation on small livestock (sheep and goats) by cheetahs. We also investigated two reports of recent cheetah presence. This led to finding a set of confirmed cheetah tracks, which we followed for > 250 m, and two large feline scrapes, both approximately the size expected of a cheetah. In 2020 and 2022 we received direct evidence of cheetah presence in the form of mature cheetah carcasses. In the first instance the cheetah was reported as having been shot in defence of livestock, and in the second instance two cheetahs were apparently poison-baited. Both reports were accompanied by photographic records. This combination of social and ecological data means that we can confirm the recent presence of wild cheetahs in western Somaliland. We will now prioritize work with local communities to understand and mitigate human-cheetah conflict and continue to investigate the distribution of cheetahs throughout Somaliland.

AB  - Background Disturbance is a key driver of changes in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in water limited regions. In the desert ecosystem of Northwest China, shrubs are often foraged by camels and this causes the shrubs lost their aboveground tissues. Although the aboveground tissue could recover after the disturbance, the mechanisms of resprouts' recovery after the disturbance are still poorly understood. We investigated the morphological and physiological characteristics and root water uptake sources of resprouts and non-disturbed seedlings of four desert shrub species that were often foraged by camels.Results The results showed that the resprouts grew rapidly after the removal of aboveground tissue. The height and aboveground biomass of resprouts reached the level of 5-year-old seedlings following a growing season. Compared to un-disturbed seedlings, higher leaf water potential, leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthesis rate were observed in resprouts, indicating that resprouts grew rapidly after disturbance. Furthermore, we found that the root water uptake source did not change after disturbance. This indicated that the roots of resprouts kept intact water uptake capacity after disturbance, which could keep supplying sufficient water to the aboveground tissue. Due to the removal of aboveground tissue of the resprouts, the water demand of aboveground tissue decreased, which induced an imbalance of water supply from roots to demand of aboveground tissues of resprouts. This explained the improved physiological performance and rapid recovery of resprouts after disturbance.Conclusions The imbalance of water supply to demand contributes to the rapid recovery of desert shrubs after disturbance. The findings provide insight into the eco-physiological mechanism for the maintenance of desert ecosystems that are facing disturbance.

AB  - Understanding the genetic and fitness consequences of anthropogenic bottlenecks is crucial for biodiversity conservation. However, studies of bottlenecked populations combining genomic approaches with fitness data are rare. Theory predicts that severe bottlenecks deplete genetic diversity, exacerbate inbreeding depression and decrease population viability. However, actual outcomes are complex and depend on how a species' unique demography affects its genetic load. We used population genetic and veterinary pathology data, demographic modelling, whole-genome resequencing and forward genetic simulations to investigate the genomic and fitness consequences of a near-extinction event in the northern elephant seal. We found no evidence of inbreeding depression within the contemporary population for key fitness components, including body mass, blubber thickness and susceptibility to parasites and disease. However, we detected a genomic signature of a recent extreme bottleneck (effective population size = 6; 95% confidence interval = 5.0-7.5) that will have purged much of the genetic load, potentially leading to the lack of observed inbreeding depression in our study. Our results further suggest that deleterious genetic variation strongly impacted the post-bottleneck population dynamics of the northern elephant seal. Our study provides comprehensive empirical insights into the intricate dynamics underlying species-specific responses to anthropogenic bottlenecks.
   Analysis of northern elephant seal populations shows no evidence of inbreeding depression, probably because a recent extreme bottleneck purged much of the genetic load.

AB  - Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi is a rare animal uniquely distributed in the Qinling Mountains (China). Human disturbance and habitat fragmentation have directly affected the survival of B. t. bedfordi. It is urgent to clarify the genetic diversity and genetic structure of the B. t. bedfordi population and implement effective conservation measures. In this study, 20 new polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated by Illumina sequencing. The genetic diversity and population structure of 124 B. t. bedfordi individuals from three populations (Niubeliang population, Zhouzhi population, and Foping population) were analysed according to these 20 microsatellite loci. Our results indicated that B. t. bedfordi had a low level of genetic variability and that there was inbreeding in the three populations. The population genetic structure analyses showed that the Niubeliang population had a trend of differentiation from other populations. National roads can affect population dispersal, while ecological corridors can promote population gene exchange. None of the three B. t. bedfordi populations experienced bottleneck effects. For conservation management plans, the Zhouzhi population and Foping population should be considered one management unit, and the Niubeliang population should be considered another management unit. We suggest building an ecological corridor to keep the habitat connected and formulating tourism management measures to reduce the influence of human disturbance on B. t. bedfordi.

AB  - Evolutionary radiations underlie much of the species diversity of life on Earth, particularly within the world's most species-rich tree flora-that of the Amazon rainforest. Hybridization occurs in many radiations, with effects ranging from homogenization of divergent species to the generation of genetic and phenotypic novelty that fuels speciation. However, the influence of hybridization on Amazonian tree radiations has been little studied. We address this using the ubiquitous, species-rich, Neotropical tree genus Inga, which typifies rapid radiations of rainforest trees. We assess patterns of gene tree incongruence to ascertain whether hybridization was associated with rapid radiation in Inga. Given the importance of insect herbivory in structuring rainforest tree communities (and hence the potential for hybridization to promote adaptation through admixture of defense traits), we also test whether introgression of loci underlying chemical defenses against herbivory occurred during the radiation of Inga. Our phylogenomic analyses of 189/288 Inga species using >1300 target capture loci showed widespread introgression in Inga. Specifically, we found widespread phylogenetic incongruence explained by introgression, with phylogenetic networks recovering multiple introgression events across Inga and up to 20% of shared, likely introgressed, genetic variation between some species. In addition, most defense chemistry loci showed evidence of positive selection and marginally higher levels of introgression. Overall, our results suggest that introgression has occurred widely over the course of Inga's history, possibly in a syngameon scenario, likely facilitated by extensive dispersal across Amazonia. Furthermore, in some cases, introgression of chemical defense loci may influence adaptation in Inga.

AB  - Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems throughout the northern Rocky Mountains; however, the species was recently listed as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act due to widespread mortality throughout its native range. Land managers tasked with whitebark pine conservation and restoration require information on strategies that can positively influence whitebark pine establishment and promote growth and defense of preexisting trees on the landscape. Our study investigated the response of whitebark pine tree growth and resin duct defenses to thinning and removal of competing shade-tolerant conifers in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest, Idaho, USA. In the nine years following thinning treatments, we found that whitebark pine trees (>12.7 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]) responded favorably to thinning and experienced a 60% increase in basal area increment (52% increase in ring width index) while also producing 34% more resin ducts. Additionally, resin ducts were 23% larger with 49% increased area in the nine years post-thinning compared with trees in the control. Small diameter (<5 cm dbh) whitebark pine in the treatment experienced a dramatic growth release with over 90% increase in basal area increment (74% increase in ring width index). Thinning also created conditions favorable for whitebark pine seedling and sapling establishment. In the treatment, 75% of seedlings and 93% of saplings were whitebark pine, compared with 32% seedlings and 14% saplings in the control. In addition, 93% of overstory trees in the treatment were whitebark pine, compared with 42% in the control. Whitebark pine tree mortality was similar across both the control (26%) and the treatment (25%), indicating that the thinning treatments did not have any adverse impacts on tree mortality. The positive effects of thinning on whitebark pine establishment and tree growth, coupled with the lack of elevated mortality in the treatment, provide strong evidence in support of thinning as a viable silvicultural technique in whitebark pine conservation efforts.

AB  - Agricultural management is essential to enhance soil ecosystem service function through optimizing soil physical conditions and improving nutrient supply, which is predominantly regulated by soil microorganisms. Several studies have focused on soil biodiversity and function in tea plantation systems. However, the effects of different agriculture managements on soil fertility and microbes remain poorly characterized, especially for what concerns perennial agroecosystems. In this study, 40 soil samples were collected from 10 tea plantation sites in China to explore the effects of ecological and conventional managements on soil fertility, as well as on microbial diversity, community composition, and co-occurrence network. Compared with conventional management, ecological management was found to significantly enhance soil fertility, microbial diversity, and microbial network complexity. Additionally, a significant difference in community composition was clearly observed under the two agriculture managements, especially for rare microbial taxa, whose relative abundance significantly increased under ecological management. Random forest modeling revealed that rare taxa (e.g., Rokubacteria and Mortierellomycota), rather than dominant microbial taxa (e.g., Proteobacteria and Ascomycota), were key variables for predicting soil fertility. This indicates that rare taxa might play a fundamental role in biological processes. Overall, our results suggest that ecological management is more efficient than conventional management in regulating rare microbial taxa and maintaining a good soil fertility in tea plantation systems.

AB  - Context. Lethal control through the application of 1080 baits is widely used in Australia to manage the negative impacts of wild dogs (dingoes, wild domestic dogs and their hybrids) on cattle production, but its effectiveness in this regard is not well understood.
   Aims. To evaluate the efficacy of once yearly 1080 baiting on dingoes and its effects in mitigating predation and sublethal impacts on beef cattle.
   Methods. A replicated experiment with two paired treatments (1080 poisoned and non-poisoned) was conducted on each of four cattle stations of 3782-10 850 km(2), over 2.5 years (2000-02) in the southern Northern Territory. The study was undertaken in relatively good rainfall years.
   Key results. Track-based surveys indicated that dingo abundance declined on poisoned relative to non-poisoned areas immediately following a single baiting episode. However, there was no detectable difference about 8 months after baiting. No difference was detected in observed levels of calf damage or calf loss between poisoned and non-poisoned areas.
   Conclusions. The results add to the growing body of consistent evidence that contemporary dingo control practices yield little benefit to rangeland beef producers most of the time.

AB  - Oak and hickory (Quercus spp. and Carya spp.) recruitment in forests of eastern North America is adversely impacted by woody invasive species. Conservation grazing, the use of livestock for restoration or biodiversity promotion, has been used to control invasive plants. The efficacy of such grazing and its ecological tradeoffs in oak-hickory forests, however, is unknown. We aimed to fill this gap by investigating browsing intake and preference by goats. To support this, nineteen experimental plots were established in an invaded forest, and their species composition and biomass quantified. Twelve plots were browsed under high (1019 goat-days ha(-1)) and low (509 goat-days ha(-1)) browsing pressure regimes with direct observations of forage intake and selection. Leaves of commonly browsed species were assessed for nutritional composition. Goats generally selected for native spicebush (Lindera benzoin) over invasive multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), however, selection of the latter increased with time. Both species identity and browsing pressure were good predictors of browse intake. For greater biomass reduction of invasive species, the use of high browsing pressure is recommended. This research showed that conservation grazing can be an effective tool to reduce biomass of invasive species such as multiflora rose, privet (Ligustrum spp.), and oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus) in oak-hickory forests when high browsing pressure is implemented, nevertheless goats may initially target their preferred species (e.g., spicebush).

TI  - Avoidance of Water Bodies by Gaur at Parsa National Park (PNP): Real Ecology of the Species or Methodological Shortfalls?
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
LA  - English
AB  - Gaur (Bos gaurus) is one of the largest and threatened ungulates in Nepal with limited ecological researches. To address the gap, Bhattarai et al. have published the article in 2025. However, the paper has many scientific limitations that could mislead the investment made in conservation of species. Their limitations include the issues related to referring gaur as preferred prey despite existing literature referring them as the prey species often avoided by tiger, failure to randomize the sampling necessary to acquire the answer to their research questions and selection of site for placement of camera traps using convenience sampling. Furthermore, despite using the occupancy model, they have failed to account detection probability. Issues of model checking and consideration of credible interval in the response curve have been ignored. When credible interval is included, the response of the species to the given variables becomes questionable. Details of the comments have been explained in the full text.

AB  - We explored the extent of post-bleaching impacts, caused by the 2014-2016 El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, on benthic community structure (BCS) and herbivores (fish and sea urchins) on seven fringing reefs, with differing protection levels, in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Results showed post-bleaching alterations in BCS, with up to 68 % coral mortality and up to 48 % increase in turf algae cover in all reef sites. Herbivorous fish biomass increased after bleaching and was correlated with turf algae increase in some reefs, while the opposite was found for sea urchin densities, with significant declines and complete absence. The severity of the impact varied across individual reefs, with larger impact on the protected reefs, compared to the unprotected reefs. Our study provides a highly relevant reference point to guide future research and contributes to our understanding of post-bleaching impacts, trends, and evaluation of coral reef health and resilience in the region.

AB  - Mineral licks are key ecological components of the Amazon rainforest, providing critical dietary functions for herbivorous and frugivorous mammals and birds, which help maintain the structure and function of the forest itself through seed and nutrient dispersal. One of the most frequent visitors of interior forest mineral licks in the Amazon is the red brocket deer (Mazama americana), a large-bodied ruminant frugivore and seed predator. While several hypotheses for the drivers of geophagy exist, including mineral supplementation, toxin adsorption, and habitat selection, robust data on geophagy for the red brocket deer for large numbers of mineral licks is nonexistent. We used soil data from 83 mineral licks in conjunction with camera trap data from 52 of those mineral licks and a mixed-effects modeling approach to test the three proposed hypotheses of geophagy for the red brocket deer. We found that consumed soils at mineral licks had elevated concentrations of almost all major and minor biologically active minerals measured, including Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cu, Zn, and Mn. Model results suggest that all three hypotheses hold true to some extent for the red brocket deer, with the greatest support for the mineral supplementation hypothesis, in particular with respect to Mg, Ca, Na, Cu, and Zn. This study provides critical information on the feeding ecology of the red brocket deer in the wild, and the first robust analysis of geophagy of an Amazonian mammal involving a large sample size of interior forest mineral licks.

AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) support endemic biodiversity, and the livelihoods of millions of people globally. Invasive species, such as Lantana camara, are a predominant cause of degradation of TDFs. We examined lesserstudied vocalizing fauna and social outcomes of TDF restoration through Lantana removal, focusing on a Central Indian TDF. We quantified biodiversity using acoustics in 55 locations in restored, unrestored, and Low Lantana Density (LLD) forest sites and surveyed 656 households across villages adjacent to these forest sites. Our ecological analysis showed that in comparison to unrestored and LLD sites, restoration was not significantly associated with a different acoustic space occupancy (ASO) in higher frequencies (9-24 kHz) during night time hours, meaning restoration does not impact nocturnal vocalising or stridulating species. However, restored and LLD sites had significantly lower ASO in the day time hours, potentially due to differences in the insect community when Lantana is absent. Through the household surveys, we found that the highest number of respondents across all the three types of sites valued the cash payment they received for participating in restoration efforts. Perceptions of lower amounts of crop raiding by wild ungulates were associated by villagers with a restored site. This perception was mediated by the total number of households in a village with a restored site. Focusing restoration efforts on forests surrounding villages, restoration planners could reduce potential negative human-wildlife interactions. Combining ecological and social outcomes, we found that there are immediate positive outcomes of restoration for people. However, in the short term (three years following restoration), there was no significant biodiversity 'benefit'. Based on our results, we recommend that restoration planners (1) consult local people about their perception of forest degradation and restoration because people's perceptions can accurately mirror the condition of the forest; (2) provide a cash income for participating in restoration activities and (3) anticipate potential changes in the faunal species community in the short term when large scale invasive species removal takes place.

AB  - Establishment of new populations is contingent on overcoming abiotic and biotic barriers. While this applies to all species, these hurdles are at the forefront of invasion biology where prediction, prevention, eradication, and control strategies depend on an understanding of these processes. Terrestrial Arundina graminifolia and epiphytic Dendrobium crumenatum are two non-indigenous orchids spreading throughout Puerto Rico. The two species have acquired a native herbivore and seed predator, the orchid-specialist weevil, Stethobaris polita. With recently acquired presence records of the three species, land cover data and downscaled climate variables, we modeled their potential distributions under current conditions and also those projected under the least and most extreme climate scenarios for 2050 and 2070. We show that D. crumenatum flourishes in urban environments which also provide refugia from S. polita, whereas there is currently limited refugia for A. graminifolia from S. polita attack, as this orchid has similar climatic niches as the weevil. Projections into all climate scenarios suggest range retractions for all species, with a decreased extent of both orchid populations subject to S. polita attack. Thus, we illustrate for island invasions how climate change will likely alter the distribution of acquired biotic interactions.

AB  - Facultative clonality is extremely common in plants, but the relative emphasis on sexual versus asexual reproduction varies both between and within species, which in turn may influence individual fitness and population persistence. Tilia cordata is a temperate, entomophilous canopy tree that is partially clonal. Favourably warm climatic conditions have been linked with successful sexual reproduction in the species with clonality being suggested as the reason for population persistence in colder periods. Despite this the extent, character and structure of asexual reproduction in the species have never been described, nor has its relationship with climate. Fine-scale spatial genetic structure was assessed in 23 stands across a latitudinal gradient. The proportion of individuals that are of clonal origin has a wide range with a mean of similar to 43%. Genetic diversity is high, with even mostly clonal stand possessing several distinct genotypes. A beta regression model shows that historic summer temperatures and density of recent recruits are predictors of the proportion of clonal recruitment. Clonal reproduction is less important in stands that experience higher temperatures during flowering while stands with more saplings have more clones. Additional factors likely affect the balance between the two reproductive modes. The climatic relationship suggests a trend towards a higher proportion of recruitment from seed in a warming climate, although factors such as herbivory may prevent this.

AB  - Sleep serves vital physiological functions, yet how sleep in wild animals is influenced by environmental conditions is poorly understood. Here we use high-resolution biologgers to investigate sleep in wild animals over ecologically relevant time scales and quantify variability between individuals under changing conditions. We developed a robust classification for accelerometer data and measured multiple dimensions of sleep in the wild boar (Sus scrofa) over an annual cycle. In support of the hypothesis that environmental conditions determine thermoregulatory challenges, which regulate sleep, we show that sleep quantity, efficiency and quality are reduced on warmer days, sleep is less fragmented in longer and more humid days, while greater snow cover and rainfall promote sleep quality. Importantly, this longest and most detailed analysis of sleep in wild animals to date reveals large inter- and intra-individual variation. Specifically, short-sleepers sleep up to 46% less than long-sleepers but do not compensate for their short sleep through greater plasticity or quality, suggesting they may pay higher costs of sleep deprivation. Given the major role of sleep in health, our results suggest that global warming and the associated increase in extreme climatic events are likely to negatively impact sleep, and consequently health, in wildlife, particularly in nocturnal animals.

AB  - The aim of the research is to assess the current state of steppe ecosystems, which are subjected to human impact and to provide scientifically-based proposals for the conservation and regeneration of their natural potential. The object of the study is the steppe ecosystems of the arid zone in the Stavropol Territory. The research conducted in 2019-2021 included the use of methods and techniques, encompassing the geobotanical, economic and statistical, abstract and logical, computational and constructive. An analysis of the natural resource potential of the steppes in the arid zone of Stavropol Territory showed a discrepancy between the current livestock and the carrying capacity of this territory. The forage for grazing is about 830 thousand tons of feed units, which is 1.5 times lower than the livestock needs. The predominant plant associations are wormwoodbluegrass-sedge, bluegrass-sheep fescue-wormwood, bluegrass-feather grass-wormwood, bluegrass- wormwood-salt grass with low species diversity - from 10 to 17 species per 100 m 2 . The plant cover of the soil is from 30 to 60 %, which indicates its sparseness. The average biological yield of phytomass is 7.0 kg/ha of air-dry matter. The species diversity of the steppe communities is represented by weed species that have low forage quality. In natural phytocenoses, the cereals dominant in forming cenoses in virgin land, have been lost. There are no any representatives of the legume family in the plant stand. The scientific approach to sustainable development, conservation and regeneration of the potential of natural ecosystems in agricultural landscapes involves the rational use and improvement (rehabilitation) of the remaining low-yield natural grass stands that have lost the ability of regeneration.

AB  - Native shrubs facilitate the establishment of oak seedlings in the opencast coal mines rehabilitated to pastures in Northern Spain, under a Mediterranean sub-humid climate. We evaluate soil changes as one of the possible facilitative effects of nurse shrubs. We hypothesize that nurse shrubs on mining soils can improve edaphic properties directly and indirectly by reducing the negative effects of trampling and grazing by ungulates. Thus, we assessed the combined effects of nurse shrubs (plots with vs without shrubs) and grazing (plots with vs without a fence for preventing browsing and trampling) upon soil properties in a reclaimed coal mine. Chemical properties such as electrical conductivity, K+, cation exchange capacity, and C/N ratio reached higher values beneath shrubs' canopies, so did total organic matter, total N, total organic C, total P, available P, and Mg2+ under shrubs but only with grazing. In contrast, pH was higher outside the shrubs; also Ca2+, though only in the absence of grazing. With grazing, Na+ decreased under shrubs. Among physical properties, bulk density increased and porosity decreased only in grazed plots, whereas sand content increased under shrubs in the grazed plots, and clay decreased in such locations. Water holding capacity and available water were the highest in ungrazed areas. Overall, we found that shrubs have a positive direct effect on soil fertility, especially relevant in grazed areas because nurse shrubs and grazing have synergistic effects, and a positive indirect effect on physical properties because they attenuate negative effects of grazing, particularly soil compaction, by reducing livestock and wild ungulates trampling. Therefore, these results demonstrate how nurse shrubs contribute to soil amelioration, helping to facilitate plant establishment in reclaimed mines, which has relevant restoration im-plications for pasture and forest recovery.

AB  - Forecasting the benefits of management interventions intended to improve ecological conditions requires a causal understanding of the factors that lead to system change. The causal attribution of a factor is defined as the difference between the outcome observed in the presence of the factor and the outcome that would have been observed in the factor's absence, that is, the counterfactual condition. Estimating this contrast is relatively straightforward, where matched or randomized controls are available to approximate the counterfactual condition. However, researchers must reason retrospectively from observational data where matched or randomized controls are not available. In this case, the challenge of establishing causal attribution is in estimating the true counterfactual, that is, the outcome that would have resulted from the absence of the factor, given that it was present. Causal analysis permits the estimation of counterfactuals from observational data, assuming that the model captures all common causes between exposure and outcome, that the exposure is independent of other factors in the model (i.e., exogenous), and that the exposure causes the same directional change for all units (i.e., monotonic). I estimated retrospectively the causal attribution of habitat-related factors to recruitment rates in Canada's boreal population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Aggregate habitat disturbance had low causal attribution (17.6%). Attribution was greater (29.5%) when habitat disturbance was disaggregated into different factors associated with different pathways of caribou decline. The causal attribution of all habitat factors considered nevertheless rarely exceeded 50%, suggesting that there are other systematic and/or stochastic factors that can limit the effectiveness of current habitat-related recovery actions. More effort is required to understand these factors and how they might be managed to improve the probability of successful caribou recovery.

AB  - Habitat selection is critical to informing wildlife management and conservation. However, different behaviors require the use of different habitat components. Not considering different behavioral states in habitat selection analyses can overlook factors influencing selection and misinterpretation of direction and strength of selection. We investigated how behavioral states influence habitat selection in female wood bison (Bison bison athabascae). Our objective was to expand the understanding of trade-offs animals make to meet their physiological requirements in a heterogeneous landscape. We visited bison and random locations, to quantify forest vegetation structure and nutritional components of bison's habitat. Bison locations were classified as foraging (23%), traveling (58%), or bedding (20%) based on signs of these behaviors. We then used resource selection functions to evaluate habitat preferences for each behavioral state and all bison locations. All behaviors indicated selection for open habitats consistent with what would be expected for this species. However, traveling and bedding activities were in areas with drier soils, while foraging activities selected for wetter soils. As expected, foraging sites also had plants with more crude protein and digestible energy. Traveling sites also had vegetation with significantly more crude protein than random locations. Our results highlight the importance of upland habitats for wood bison in boreal forests for particular behaviors and nutrition. We suggest consideration of multiple behavioral states when assessing habitat suitability. These considerations are especially important when evaluating habitat for reintroductions and/or habitat reclamation.

AB  - Simple Summary Among insects of the soil megafauna in the Arctic and Subarctic, the species of subgenus Cryobious have demonstrated a high abundance and wide distribution. The fossil remains of Cryobius are used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions of the Arctic and Subarctic in the Pleistocene and Holocene. However, the taxonomy, ecology, and distribution of Cryobius are insufficiently studied. Here, we report that Pterostichus (Cryobius) mandibularoides Ball, 1966, previously known from the Nearctic, was found in Chukotka and on Wrangel Island. Thus, it is a trans-Beringian species with a wide distribution in the western part of North America and a disjunctive range within the northeastern margin of Asia. The phylogeny of P. mandibularoides determined using a genetic approach revealed inconformity with previous conclusions regarding its differentiation within the brevicornis group stock of subgenus Cryobius. Considering the taxonomic complexity of subgenus Cryobius, the fossil samples of brevicornis group species with radiocarbon dating may not correspond to the real time of species differentiation; consequently, additional revision using genetic tools is required. Subgenus Cryobius is one of the most numerous among the megafauna of tundra soils, but studies on its species distribution, taxonomy, and ecology are lacking. Phylogeny and phylogeography reconstructions of insects with taxonomic complexity have become possible using an integrative approach. Here, we report that specimens of Pterostichus (Cryobius) mandibularoides, described from North America, were detected in Eurasia. Thus, this species has a trans-Beringian range with high distributions in North America, as well as a disjunctive part of the range on the northeastern edge of Asia within Chukotka and Wrangel Island. Eight COI haplotypes with closed relationships (1-2 mutation steps) were detected within the whole range, and one 28S rRNA haplotype was detected for Eurasia. Bayesian phylogeny revealed that P. mandibularoides had the most recent common ancestor with sister species P. brevicornis and P. nivalis. Mean genetic distances of both markers were similar and higher between P. mandibularoides and both P. brevicornis and P. nivalis (>5% +/- 1.0%) than between the latter species (<4% +/- 1.0%). The obtained results change the previous view about brevicornis group stock differentiation within Cryobius in the Arctic and require a revision of the phylogeny and phylogeography of brevicornis group species and Cryobius altogether.

AB  - Simple Summary Since there is currently little information on the distribution of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in Italy, we determined its seroprevalence among cattle and water buffalo in the Campania region of southern Italy. We found very high seroprevalence values of 30.8% and 76% at individual and herd levels, respectively. In both cattle and water buffalo, species, age, and origin were common risk factors that were positively associated with antibody detection. Only in water buffalo was a higher sero-prevalence observed in animals cohabiting with cattle, indicating that this practice is incorrect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BCoV serological survey performed in southern Italy as well as the first description of BCoV antibody detection in water buffalo in Italy. Cattle and water buffalo are the main livestock species that are raised in the Campania region, southern Italy, and they contribute significantly to the regional rural economy. Currently there are limited data on the prevalence of relevant impact infections, such as bovine coronavirus (BCov), an RNA virus that causes acute enteric and respiratory disease. Although these diseases are described primarily in cattle, there have been reports of spillovers to other ruminants, including water buffalo. Here, we determined the seroprevalence of BCoV in cattle and water buffalo in the Campania region of southern Italy. An overall seroprevalence of 30.8% was determined after testing 720 sampled animals with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A risk factor analysis revealed that the seropositivity rates in cattle (49.2%) were higher than in water buffalo (5.3%). In addition, higher seroprevalence rates were observed in older and purchased animals. In cattle, housing type and location were not associated with higher seroprevalence. The presence of BCoV antibodies in water buffalo was associated with the practice of co-inhabiting with cattle, demonstrating that this practice is incorrect and promotes the transmission of pathogens between different species. Our study found a considerable seroprevalence, which is consistent with previous research from other countries. Our results provide information on the widespread distribution of this pathogen as well as the risk factors that are involved in its transmission. This information could be useful in the control and surveillance of this infection.

AB  - Coral reefs are undergoing global phase shifts from coral-dominated to algae-dominated stages. The negative effects of this substratum shift on the diversity and abundance of fish have been well documented, but the influence on fish feeding is less studied, which may limit a deeper understanding of trophic pathways in such a disturbed system. In this study, we investigated the feeding response of a numerically dominant fish species Ctenochaetus striatus to different substrate types, including hard coral, short algal turfs (SATs, <= 5 mm), and long algal turfs (LATs, >= 5 mm), on reefs in the South China Sea. The biomass of C. striatus showed an inverted U-shaped relationship with coral coverage and a significant positive correlation with SAT coverage (p <= 0.05), indicating that rising SAT coverage associated with moderate coral loss provoked a feeding response in C. striatus. Stomach contents of C. striatus, analyzed using high-throughput sequencing (HTS), were dominated by algal sequences (relative read abundance, RRA >= 80.0%), including macroalgae, filamentous algae, and microalgae (e.g., Symbiodinium and Prorocentrum). The sequence number and diversity of microalgae (mainly dinoflagellates) tended to be abundant (RRA 13.5-36.5%) with increased SAT cover, but brown algae sequences (RRA 17.2-57.8%) or green algae sequences (RRA >= 50.7% except one site) dominated the stomach content DNA in reefs with high coral cover and high LAT or macroalgal cover, respectively. Considering the limited ability of C. striatus to remove mature algae, macroalgal DNA might be from algal debris. Our results indicate that C. striatus populations respond positively to conditions of moderate coral loss through increases in body condition identified as increased biomass. These responses are correlated to the expansion of SAT's as coral cover declined, however, this relationship reverses if coral loss is high due to the succession of LAT's over SAT's and a corresponding decrease in the quality of food available. Our use of HTS has nevertheless identified the importance of detritivory in the flow of energy through reefs in the Anthropocene which are increasingly becoming depauperate in hard coral.

AB  - The Tarim red deer Cervus hanglu has been recently recognized as a separate deer species with populations in China, Central Asia and Kashmir. These populations are few, isolated and at risk of extinction. The documented range of the Kashmir population of the hangul, now recognized as Cervus hanglu hanglu, is restricted to c. 808 km(2) and comprises < 200 individuals, confined mainly to the 141 km(2 )Dachigam National Park. A few relict herds inhabit the surrounding landscape. Here we analyse the results of almost 20 years of population monitoring (January 2001-March 2020). We found that this population is unable to increase despite full protection within Dachigam National Park. We performed a population viability analysis using both deterministic and stochastic simulations and found that further population decrease is likely. We recommend the use of improved monitoring methods to investigate the population dynamics of the hangul and the implementation of measures to reduce the risk of extinction faced by this small population. Science-based conservation policies, including ex situ conservation and reintroduction programmes, will be required to increase the hangul population size and range.

AB  - In low- and middle-income countries, agriculture is the major source of livelihood mainly through the simultaneous production of crops and rearing of animals. The main objective of the study was to investigate the implications of climate change and variability on fodder production and its implication on goat production in the Upper West Region. For livestock production, the major problem that continues to build up is the -year-round constraint of feed for livestock. As biodiversity continues to be threatened, there has been a paradigm inclusion from grass-based and crop residue-based feeds to tree-based feeds. Access to the tree-based feeds for livestock keepers especially livestock traders is associated with costs, bringing income to rural youth and women. The study used participatory approaches mainly Focus Group Discussions on separate groups of women and men in four districts of the guinea savanna agro-climatic zone of the Upper West Region to solicit in-depth information on fodder production and trade and climate change adaptation of goat production. The study revealed that different tree-based fodder species are being produced and traded in the study districts to improve goat production. Long time investment in the propagation of the tree-based fodder species is being recommended for two main reasons, first it takes many years to grow, and secondly, they are being competed for, for fuelwood.

AB  - Understanding the historical dynamics of wildlife distribution and abundance is essential to developing appropriate conservation measures. Here we investigate the occurrence and status of medium-to large-sized fauna (excluding avifauna) for the mountain Kingdom of Lesotho and immediate adjoining regions of South Africa, from the late Pleistocene to the present-day. We provide historical timelines and records of reported medium to large faunal taxa based on: data from eight published archaeological excavations, analyses of several hundred unpublished 19th and 20th century historical documents (including missionary letters, diaries, colonial reports and newspapers), and 58 recent oral history interviews. Vegetation and climate changes through the Holocene are also noted, based on archaeo-botanical records. Through these sources, we record 61 medium to large faunal species for Lesotho and surrounding regions over the past similar to 21 ka, of which only 22 are present today. Some species not previously known to the region are documented (e.g. Temminck's pangolin). Most species were present during the early 19th century, but many regional species extinctions and a major faunal population decline occurred between 1845 and 1850, owing mainly to settler hunting campaigns. Subsequent extinctions have taken place over a wider temporal interval, due to factors including overhunting, human-wildlife conflicts and habitat loss. It seems that some taxa were forced into unsuitable mountain refugia where species eventually succumbed to genetic erosion and/or harsh climatic conditions. Our results increase current understanding of regional faunal and environmental changes, such as the timing of species occurrences and extinction events and processes in Lesotho. Such work adds valuable knowledge to understanding the environmental heritage of the region. Information can be disseminated into wildlife records, national environmental reports, the WWF, the national school environmental educational curriculum and to National Parks and Heritage Sites.

AB  - Cuttings are an important way of propagating tea trees (Camellia sinensis). In this study, Dahongpao mother tree (MD) and cutting Dahongpao (PD) were used as research objects and their rhizosphere soil were collected and performed metabolomics analysis. At the same time, soil nutrient content, microbial physiological indexes, and microbial carbon source utilization were determined, which in turn obtained the effect of cuttings on metabolites, microorganisms, and nutrient cycling in rhizosphere soil of tea trees. The results showed that available nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium in the rhizosphere soil of MD were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in PD. Secondly, microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, microbial respiration, bacterial number, fungal number, and actinomycete number were also significantly higher in rhizosphere soil of MD than in PD. There were six groups of rhizosphere soil characteristic metabolites that differentiated MD from PD, of which the content of acid, amine, phenol, heterocyclic compound, alcohol and lipid was significantly higher in MD compared to PD, while carbohydrate content was significantly less in MD. There were five groups of rhizosphere soil microorganisms that differentiated MD from PD, in which microorganisms with carboxylic acid, amines, fatty acid and phenolic acid as carbon sources were significantly larger in MD than in PD, whereas microorganisms with carbohydrates as carbon sources were significantly smaller in MD than in PD. It can be seen that the number and content of rhizosphere soil characteristic metabolites were higher in MD than in PD. This enhanced the number of microorganisms with different carbon source utilization rates, increased microbial diversity and abundance, promoted nutrient transformation, increased the content of available nutrients, which in turn facilitated the growth of tea trees. This study provides an important reference for the use of metabolites to regulate soil microbial colonization, improve soil nutrient transformation, and maintain healthy growth of tea trees.

AB  - Mixed-species tree plantations have additional ecological benefits over single-species tree plantations, such as habitat restoration and increasing biodiversity. However, changes in the soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storages and stoichiometry after mixed afforestation with the N-fixing tree species under the "Grain for Green Project" in the Loess Plateau of China are not well understood. Typical restoration types, including the mixed plantations of Pinus tabuliformis with Hippophae rhamnoides (HrPt) and Robinia pseudoacacia with H. rhamnoides (HrRp), as well as the pure forests of P. tabuliformis (P-t) and R. pseudoacacia (R-p), were chosen to examine changes in the storages and stoichiometry of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in 0-100 cm soil layers. The results showed that compared with the corresponding pure forest, HrRp significantly increased the SOC content in the 0-20 cm soil layer and the SOC storage in the 0-100 cm layer, while HrPt significantly increased the SOC content in the 0-10 cm layer, but there was no significant difference for SOC storage in the 0-100 cm layer between P-t and HrPt. Similarly, HrRp significantly increased the TN content in the 0-10 cm layer and the TN storage in the 0-100 cm layer, but there was no significant difference in TN storage between P-t and HrPt. Furthermore, HrRp significantly increased the TP content in the 0-100 cm layer and TP storage was higher than that of R-p, while there were no significant differences in TP content and storage between P-t and HrPt. In the 0-10 cm soil layer, HrRp significantly reduced C:N and increased N:P, but HrPt significantly increased C:P. In addition, compared with the pure forest, the soil physical and chemical properties had a stronger control effect on the soil storages and stoichiometric ratios in the mixed forests. In summary, compared with P. tabuliformis, the introduction of N-fixing tree species into the R. pseudoacacia forest was more conducive to the accumulation of SOC, TN, and TP reserves and the improvement of the N and P utilization efficiency. These results have important implications for the restoration of degraded vegetation and scientific management of mixed plantations on the Loess Plateau and can provide basic data for the assessment of soil quality at the regional scale.

AB  - Disturbances can alter persistence trajectories of restored ecosystems. Resprouting is a common response of plants to disturbances such as fire or herbivory. Therefore, understanding a plant's resprouting response can inform successful restoration. We investigated patterns and drivers of resprouting following fire in fire-prone Banksia woodlands restored after sand mining in the Mediterranean-climate region of Western Australia. We applied experimental fire to samples of nine species with different resprouting types (rhizome, root crown, root sucker and lignotuber) across a 4- to 27-year-old restoration chronosequence. We investigated the influence of pre-fire plant size, restoration age and soil conditions on resprouting success, defined by: (i) the probability of resprouting (measured similar to 5 months after fire), (ii) the probability of surviving the first summer and, (iii) vigour (both measured similar to 12 months post-fire). We found that the probability of initial resprouting was high across most species, but summer survival was lower but comparable to that in other post-mining restored ecosystems following fire. Generally, pre-fire plant size did not influence probability of resprouting, while size and soil conditions were important for two species survival. Pre-fire plant size was a significant predictor of vigour for all species with soil conditions influencing four species. Restoration age significantly influenced survival of three species. However, as our models explained low amounts of variation in probabilities of resprouting and survival (R-2 = <0.11), other factors influencing resprouting success remain unidentified. Resprouting response to fire disturbance in restored Banksia woodlands are species and resprouter type specific, with plant size and soil conditions potentially more informative for understanding responses to disturbances than restoration age alone.

AB  - Wildlife conservation often focuses on mitigating disturbance in critical habitats like reproductive ranges. We studied lambing and nursery habitat selection by Stone's sheep (Ovis dalli stonei (J.A. Allen, 1897)) in the Cassiar Mountains in British Columbia. We estimated the timing of parturition and delineated lambing and nursery habitats based on movement behaviours of collared females (n = 18) and vaginal implant transmitters. We identified 23 lambing events in 2018 (n = 4), 2019 (n = 13), and 2020 (n = 6). The median birth date was 17 May and ranged from 3 May to 14 June. Females remained in lambing habitats from 1.5 to 11.3 days with a median of 5.5 days. We examined habitat selection during the lambing and nursery periods at the home-range scale using resource selection functions, and at a finer scale using integrated step-selection analyses. Females selected southwest slopes in rugged terrain at mid-elevations, suggesting selection for warmer micro-climates and features that facilitate predator avoidance. Females avoided habitats near roads during the lambing period but showed selection for habitats near roads during the nursing period. We developed predictive maps of suitable lambing and nursery ranges to inform land planning to help reduce overlap of anthropogenic disturbance with potential reproductive habitats.

AB  - The resource rule hypothesis predicts that geographic differences in body size among populations of organisms are due to the amount, availability, and quality of food resources. For instance, the body size of large herbivores is often correlated with soil characteristics because better soils produce better forage. In semiarid environments, rainfall variation is an important driver of forage availability, especially highly nutritious annual forbs. Thus, in such pulsed-resource environments, it is unclear whether the body size of large herbivores is influenced by fixed resources correlated with soil characteristics, irregular resource pulses correlated with rainfall, or both. Furthermore, it is not clear whether phenotypic expression is a function of forage quality or quantity. During the early autumns of 2011-2018, we captured 4554 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on seven rangeland sites in the semiarid climate of South Texas, USA. The sites range from coastal to 140 km inland and represent gradients in both soil texture and annual rainfall. We recorded age- and sex-specific indices of skeletal size, antler size, and body mass. Site-specific soil characteristics explained most of the variation in skeletal size; percent sand was inversely related to skeletal size. For environmentally sensitive phenotypes (antler size and body mass), both soil characteristics and rainfall were influencers; increases in rainfall reduced the negative effect of sand. Percent sand and rainfall were positively correlated with annual biomass of preferred forbs, yet all phenotypic traits declined with increases in forb quantity. Increases in percent shrub cover increased all phenotype sizes. Our data suggest that the phenotypic expression of large herbivores in semiarid environments is driven by forage quality via edaphic characteristics rather than forage quantity via rainfall. Specifically, less sand in the soil allows for the development of shrub communities, which in turn provide a consistent source of forage in a variable, pulsed-rainfall environment. Although forbs are of higher quality, they are highly ephemeral. The availability of a consistent source of forage may enable white-tailed deer to extend time invested in body growth, which results in greater phenotype size. Our findings align with the resource rule hypothesis that identifies resource availability as a fundamental element explaining geographical variation in phenotypic expression.

AB  - Simple Summary The biocultural diversity associated with Gaoligongshan pigs was investigated in the present paper. Six villages in Laowo Township of Lushui City in the Nujiang River watershed, where the Gaoligongshan pigs are primarily raised, were selected to collect information and data related to biocultural diversity. Participatory surveys and semi-structured interviews were conducted to document the semi-wild and free-ranging management pattern of Gaoligongshan pigs. The wild, cultivated, and medicinal plants used in rearing pigs were documented in terms of local knowledge. Most wild forage species are from Polygonaceae and Compositae while Poaceae dominated in cultivated forage plants. The local Bai and Lisu ethnic minorities have accumulated a wealth of biocultural knowledge related to diet, medicine, festivals, and rituals during their long-term rearing activities, and forming a cultural complex about Gaoligongshan pigs. This study demonstrated that the semi-wild and free-ranging management model of the Gaoligongshan pig is consistent with the local natural environment, traditional culture, economic level, and the breed's characteristics. Over 80% proteins consumed by the local people in Nujiang Prefecture of Southwest China, a remote and mountainous area in the Eastern Himalayas, are from pork, or Gaoligongshan pig (a landrace of Sus scrofa domestica Brisson). Previous research on the Gaoligongshan pig has focused on nutritional composition, production performance, and genetic resource characteristics, but neglected the reasons behind the local people's practice. From 2019 to 2022, we have used ethnobiological research methods to comprehensively document the traditional rearing and management patterns and the traditional culture associated with Gaoligongshan pigs. The results show that Gaoligongshan pigs graze in mixed herds with cattle and sheep during the day and prefer to eat 23 wild plant species, in which 17 species have medicinal values. At night, the pigs are artificially fed and rest in the pigsty. The local Bai and Lisu people have developed a creative food culture, rituals, and festivals culture associated with Gaoligongshan pigs. Overall, the biocultural diversity of Gaoligongshan pig contributes to the in situ conservation of genetic diversity of this important hog landrace, and supports rural development in this remote area.

AB  - This study delved into the analysis of hourly observed as well as future precipitation data in the towns of Willoughby and Buffalo on the Lake Erie Coast to examine the variations in IDF relationships over the 21st century. Several regional climate models (RCMs) and general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) Phases 5 and 6 were used. The study evaluated three RCMs with historical and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenarios for each CMIP5 and three GCMs with historical and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (126, 245, 370, and 585) scenarios for each CMIP6. The results suggested that the town of Willoughby would experience an increase of 9-46%, whereas Buffalo would experience an upsurge of 6-140% in the hourly precipitation intensity under the worst-case scenarios of RCP8.5 for CMIP5 and SSP585 for CMIP6. This increase is expected to occur in both the near (2020-2059) and far future (2060-2099), with a return period as low as 2 years and as high as 100 years when compared to the baseline period (1980-2019). The analysis indicated an increased range of 9-39% in the near future and 20-55% in the far future for Willoughby, while the Buffalo region may experience an increase of 2-95% in the near future and 3-192% in the far future as compared to the baseline period. In contrast to CMIP6 SSP585 models, CMIP5 RCP8.5 models predicted rainfall with an intensity value that is up to 28% higher in the town of Willoughby, while the reverse was true for the Buffalo region. The findings of this study are expected to be helpful for the design of water resource infrastructures.

AB  - The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is an ecologically important species in forests of North America. Effective management of forests requires accurate, precise estimates of deer population abundance to plan and justify management actions. Spotlight surveys in combination with distance sampling are a common method of estimating deer population abundance; however, spotlight surveys are known to have serious drawbacks such as high costs and sampling biases. Therefore, we tested the effectiveness of enumerating deer from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights, conducted 1 and 6 March 2018, to develop population and density estimates in 2 United States National Parks: Harpers Ferry National Historic Park (HAFE) and Monocacy National Battlefield (MONO). Concurrent spotlight surveys at MONO enabled us to compare estimates obtained by the 2 methods. Deer density estimates by 4 observers of UAV-obtained thermal imagery from HAFE were 94.5 +/- 3.9 deer/km(2). Concurrent UAV and spotlight surveys at MONO found 19.7 +/- 0.5 deer/km(2) and 6.4 +/- 4.9 deer/km(2), respectively; suggesting that spotlight surveys may significantly underestimate deer densities. Despite the logistical challenges to UAV operation, our findings demonstrate that UAVs will become an invaluable tool for wildlife management as technology improves. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The detachment of tree bark (i.e. bark-stripping) by wild ungulate species can be observed in many European forests and it can lead to significant damages to the wood. In our study, bark-stripping of different intensity and age was recorded for 110 European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees growing in the Harz Mountains, Germany. Our goal was to compare the performance of a conventional and a structure-from-motion approach to quantify the external damage and to evaluate whether bark-stripping damages on the outside may accurately reflect internal wood defects. Also, we wanted to know whether potential relationships between inner and outer damages are affected by the condition of the wound. Surprisingly, despite large difference between the two approaches (mean absolute error: 46%) the wood surface on the sawn boards (internal damage) could not be predicted more accurately using structure-from-motion, for the assessment of the external damage when compared to the conventional measurements based on damage height and damage width (rhombus formula). The internally damaged area was smaller than the externally damaged area across all wound categories. In contrast though, and most notably, the length of the stem section negatively affected by the damage was always greater inside than outside. We conclude that sophisticated measurements of the outside wound area do not allow for a better estimation of the internal wound area. Foresters may continue to rely on simple measures of damage extension on the outside of the tree to estimate internal damages. They should however consider the wound status as an additional information for a better prediction of internal damages.

AB  - One of the factors facilitating the expansion and proliferation of wild boar Sus scrofa is the plasticity of its reproductive biology. Nevertheless, the real influence of maternal and environmental factors on number and sex of the offspring is still controversial. While the litter size was shown to be related with the maternal condition, the strength of this relation remains to be understood, together with the possible role played by environmental conditions. Analogously, it is unclear whether wild boar females can adjust their offspring sex. We investigated multiple aspects of wild boar maternal investment by means of a 10-year dataset of female reproductive traits and a set of biologically meaningful environmental variables. The maternal condition slightly affected the litter size but not the offspring sex, and environment did not affect the litter size or the offspring sex. Moreover, mothers did not cope with the higher costs entailed by producing sons by placing them in the most advantageous intrauterine position, nor by allocating less resources on daughters. Our set of results showed that the female reproductive investment is quite rigid in comparison with other aspects of wild boar reproductive biology. Wild boar females seem to adopt a typical r-strategy, producing constantly large litters and allocating resources on both sexes regardless of internal and external conditions. Such strategy may be adaptive to cope with environmental unpredictability and an intense human harvest, contributing to explain the extreme success of wild boar within human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Scavengers likely play an important role in ecosystem energy flow as well as disease transmission, but whether they facilitate or reduce disease transmission is often unknown. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, scavengers are likely to reduce the transmission and subsequent spread of brucellosis within and between livestock and elk by consuming infectious abortion materials, thereby removing the infectious agent from the landscape. We used remote cameras to monitor the time to removal of simulated abortion materials by scavengers at 264 sites from February to June in 2017 and 2018 and assessed the effects of habitat and land management on time to removal in southwest Montana. Time to removal of fetal materials decreased in grassland habitats (x = 2.9 d, credible interval = [1.8-5.0]) in comparison to sagebrush habitats (x = 5.4 d [3.4-9.3]) and forest habitats (x = 5.2 d [3.3-9.0]). In addition, there was an 88% probability that time to removal of fetal materials was slower at sites where mammalian scavengers were actively reduced (x = 6.5 d [3.4-12.8]) compared to sites with no scavenger reduction (x = 4.1 d [2.3-7.8]). Our research indicates that if elk and livestock are commingling during the brucellosis risk period, there is a 90% probability that abortion materials will be removed by scavengers within 16 d across all sites. Coyotes, red foxes, golden and bald eagles, Corvus spp., and turkey vultures were the dominant scavengers, removing 90% of the fetal materials. Actions to maintain the breadth and diversity of scavengers on the landscape are potential management options that could reduce disease transmission risk to livestock in a system where the wildlife reservoir is difficult to address.

AB  - Macroevolutionary consequences of competition among large clades have long been sought in patterns of lineage diversification. However, mechanistically clear examples of such effects remain elusive. Here, we postulated that the limited phenotypic diversity and insular gigantism in lagomorphs could be explained at least in part by an evolutionary constraint placed on them by potentially competing ungulate-type herbivores (UTHs). Our analyses yielded three independent lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis: (1) the minimum UTH body mass is the most influential predictor of the maximum lagomorph body mass in modern ecoregions; (2) the scaling patterns of local-population energy use suggest universal competitive disadvantage of lagomorphs weighing over approximately 6.3 kg against artiodactyls, closely matching their observed upper size limit in continental settings; and (3) the trajectory of maximum lagomorph body mass in North America from the late Eocene to the Pleistocene (37.5-1.5 million years ago) was best modeled by the body mass ceiling placed by the smallest contemporary perissodactyl or artiodactyl. Body size evolution in lagomorphs has likely been regulated by the forces of competition within the clade, increased predation in open habitats, and importantly, competition from other ungulate-type herbivores. Our findings suggest conditionally-coupled dynamics of phenotypic boundaries among multiple clades within an adaptive zone, and highlight the synergy of biotic and abiotic drivers of diversity.

AB  - Livestock grazing and trampling have been shown to reduce arthropod populations. Among arthropods, defoliating lepidopterans are particularly important for their impact on trees, the keystone structures of agroforestry systems. This study investigates the impact of livestock on the community of defoliating lepidopterans in agroforestry systems. We conducted both experimental and observational studies in the mid-west and western regions of the Iberian Peninsula. In our field experiment, we sampled lepidopteran caterpillars in areas with livestock and in areas where livestock had been excluded for short and long periods. To validate our experimental results, we conducted a field survey across seven areas with and without livestock in the western Iberian Peninsula. Our findings revealed that after 2 years from the start of the experiment, the exclusion of livestock led to an increase in the abundance and species richness of lepidopterans, as well as shifts in their community composition. Our experimental findings were corroborated by our field survey. Interestingly, we found that the differences in community composition among exclusions were primarily due to species nestedness. Livestock exclusion consistently favored species that pupate in the ground, suggesting that livestock can alter the lepidopteran community by predating or accidentally trampling these species.

AB  - Migration is a behavioral strategy used by many ungulates to access resources and avoid predation in heterogenous landscapes. If migratory individuals access higher quality forage and avoid predation, then they should attain greater fitness. Migration can also expose individuals following distinct migratory tactics to differential mortality and harvest. We investigated how transboundary migration affected male elk (Cervus canadensis) survival and antler size when subjected to harvest with different antler point restrictions (APRs) and year-round harvest by treaty First Nations in a multi-carnivore system in Alberta, Canada. We measured antler size and age for 35 unmarked, harvested male elk and 90 global positioning system (GPS)-collared adult male elk. We also estimated radio-collared elk survival and cause-specific mortality (105 elk-years) from 2018 to 2020. Antler size increased as a non-linear function of age and exposure to high quality forage for migrants. The biological effect size of exposure to higher quality forage (i.e., lower biomass) obtained by migrants was variable but biologically equivalent to the antler size difference (i.e., 33-54 cm) predicted between 5- and 6-year-old male elk. Annual mortality rate was 0.304 and the primary cause of death was hunting (cumulative incidence functions [CIF] mortality rate = 0.203, n = 33 mortalities) of which a third was by First Nations treaty harvest (CIF = 0.101, n = 12). Non-human-caused mortality was rare (CIF = 0.015); only 2 males died because of predation by wolves (Canis lupus). Six-point APRs resulted in lower annual survival rates (S = 0.42) for male elk with >= 6 antler points, which were usually >4 years of age. Harvest risk increased by 20% for every 1-km closer to an access road. Elk harvested by licensed recreational or First Nations hunters were similar with respect to male elk age, antler size, date, and location. There was very little evidence that multiple species of large carnivores influenced male elk survival. These results indicate forage quality and vulnerability to harvest by humans influence male elk age structure, and hence antler size, of transboundary and partially migratory populations, even in carnivore-rich complex systems.

AB  - The caribou (Rangifer tarandus sspp.) is a keystone wildlife species in northern ecosystems that plays a central role in the culture, spirituality and food security of Indigenous People. The Arctic is currently experiencing an unprecedented rate of climate change, including warming temperatures and altered patterns of precipitation. These environmental changes can facilitate the transmission of arthropod-borne parasites, such as filarioid nematodes. Filarioids are an important cause of morbidity and occasional mortality in Rangifer in Fennoscandia, however, much of the ecology and epidemiology of these parasites in caribou in North America, including Canada, remains unknown. We aimed to determine the parasitic diversity and geographic distribution of filarioid nematodes in three Canadian designatable units (DU) of caribou (barren-ground, boreal and Dolphin & Union) from Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Newfoundland & Labrador. Genomic DNA extracted from 768 blood samples was screened for filarioid nematodes using real-time PCR. The positive samples were Sanger sequenced to identify the parasite present. Based on the sequencing results, we identified Setaria yehi and Onchocerca cervipedis s.l. We then standardized a TaqMan probe based duplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) protocol for the simultaneous detection of S. yehi and O. cervipedis s.l. Based on real-time PCR results, 8/768 samples were positive. Setaria yehi and O. cervipedis s.l. were present in 4 separate samples (0.5%) each. Using ddPCR, 68/192 samples were positive (35.4%). Setaria yehi DNA was detected in 57/192 positive samples (29.7%), O. cervipedis s.l. DNA was present in 22/192 samples (11.5%) and 11/192 samples (5.7%) had co-infections. Setaria yehi was detected in all three DUs tested. Onchocerca cervipedis s.l. were found in barren-ground and boreal caribou, but not from the Dolphin and Union caribou. Through this broad-based survey and through developing and implementing advanced molecular methodologies, we have documented the apparent distribution and diversity of S. yehi and O. cervipedis s.l. in parts of three Canadian DUs of caribou. The knowledge gained from this study provides baseline data and methodology for the further elucidation of the epidemiology of these parasites in North America.

AB  - Most sturgeon populations are imperilled and living in fragmented rivers. Here, we studied namew (lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens), fish important to Ililiwak (Moose Cree Peoples), in the North French River: a free-flowing, intact river in Kit Aski Nahnuun (the Moose Cree Homeland) in northern Ontario, Canada. This study was co-created alongside members of Moose Cree First Nation and used acoustic telemetry to passively track 20 tagged namew over 6 yr (2016-2022). Namew occupied the entire monitored river reach: about 45 km. Namew used 2 overwintering areas and occupied more overall river sections during spring and summer (out of 6 total seasons often used by Ililiwak). We did not detect namew moving upstream or downstream during freeze-up and winter. Generally, namew showed the greatest acceleration and travelled the longest distances during spring and summer, and they occupied shallower water during summer at lower water levels and deepest waters during freeze-up. We found an interaction between season and diurnal period, where namew occupied shallower depths and had higher acceleration at dawn and night relative to morning and afternoon in most seasons; dusk behaviour was variable among seasons. However, this pattern was absent in spring, when namew showed no diurnal pattern in acceleration and were in shallower water during morning and afternoon. Diurnal patterns were less pronounced, but detectable, during ice-affected seasons. This river provides year-round habitat for namew, and our data reveal distinct patterns of namew occupancy, movement, and behaviour in a free-flowing, intact river. Our work is an example of successfully co-creating research that addresses both scientific and community priorities.

AB  - A respiratory disease epizootic at the National Bison Range (NBR) in Montana in 2016-2017 caused an 85% decline in the bighorn sheep population, documented by observations of its unmarked but individually identifiable members, the subjects of an ongoing long-term study. The index case was likely one of a small group of young bighorn sheep on a short-term exploratory foray in early summer of 2016. Disease subsequently spread through the population, with peak mortality in September and October and continuing signs of respiratory disease and sporadic mortality of all age classes through early July 2017. Body condition scores and clinical signs suggested that the disease affected ewe groups before rams, although by the end of the epizootic, ram mortality (90% of 71) exceeded ewe mortality (79% of 84). Microbiological sampling 10 years to 3 months prior to the epizootic had documented no evidence of infection or exposure to Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae at NBR, but during the epizootic, a single genetic strain of M. ovipneumoniae was detected in affected animals. Retrospective screening of domestic sheep flocks near the NBR identified the same genetic strain in one flock, presumptively the source of the epizootic infection. Evidence of fatal lamb pneumonia was observed during the first two lambing seasons following the epizootic but was absent during the third season following the death of the last identified M. ovipneumoniae carrier ewe. Monitoring of life-history traits prior to the epizootic provided no evidence that environmentally and/or demographically induced nutritional or other stress contributed to the epizootic. Furthermore, the epizootic occurred despite proactive management actions undertaken to reduce risk of disease and increase resilience in this population. This closely observed bighorn sheep epizootic uniquely illustrates the natural history of the disease including the (presumptive) source of spillover, course, severity, and eventual pathogen clearance.

AB  - We aimed to study the responses of fish functional diversity to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in different environments from the upper Parana River floodplain (UPRF), Brazil. We predicted that (i) El Nino events intensify floods in the UPRF and, consequently, promote functional convergence of the fish assemblage and (ii) different functional traits will be favored in El Nino or La Nina events. The functional convergence was measured through functional dispersion and functional redundancy indexes, wherein lakes presented higher similarity during El Nino and lower similarity during La Nina. ENSO did not have a strong effect in rivers. The functional richness and functional evenness did not respond to ENSO events. Fish with parental care and invertivorous fish were favored during El Nino, while piscivorous and herbivorous fish were favored during La Nina. Due to their distinct lifecycles, long-distance migratory fish responded to this climatic oscillation 1 year after El Nino. Overall, the influence of ENSO on fish diversity in the UPRF is a complex phenomenon. However, even with other local and regional factors acting on the ichthyofauna, fish diversity responded to these climatic fluctuations.

AB  - In contrast to understanding spinescence in savanna woody species, little is known about the functions of plant secondary metabolites (PSM). Negative effects of PSMs on individual animal performance potentially translate into negative effects on herbivore population growth. Hence, understanding PSM functions is important for the conservation of savanna megafauna. We tested the view that black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) diet preference is not affected by spinescence or total phenolic abundance. We hypothesized that the composition of phenolic mixtures, however, would affect preference. Furthermore, we tested our data from 71 woody species for a trade-off between structural and chemical defenses. Spinescence type, and spinescence generally, did not deter black rhino feeding. Using eco-metabolomic data, we found that total abundance of phenolics did not affect preference, but mixture composition did and that the probability of spinescence trading off against phenolics depended on the mixture. We note that our study was restricted to black rhino and that diet preferences of other mammal herbivores might be influenced by subtle differences in phenolic mixtures. However, our results did support a previous, more detailed study of phenolic profiles of six species showing the same patterns in relation to preference generalised across mammal herbivore species in savannas. Our results represent substantial advancement in the understanding of the roles of PSMs, especially flavonoid compounds, in the functioning of savanna ecosystems, and highlight the need to dig deeper into broad groups of traits such as spinescence or total phenolics to improve understanding of woody plant defenses in savannas.

AB  - Climate change is one of the largest threats to grassland plant species, which can be modified by land management. Although climate change and land management are expected to separately and interactively influence plant demography, this has been rarely considered in climate change experiments. We used a large-scale experiment in central Germany to quantify the effects of grassland management, climate change, and their joint effect on the demography and population growth rate of 11 plant species all native to this temperate grassland ecosystem. We parameterized integral projection models with five years of demographic data to project population growth rate. We hypothesized that plant populations perform better in the ambient than in the future climate treatment that creates hotter and drier summer conditions. Further, we hypothesized that plant performance interactively responds to climate and land management in a species-specific manner based on the drought, mowing, and grazing tolerances as well as the flowering phenology of each species. Due to extreme drought events, over half of our study species went quasi extinct, which highlights how extreme climate events can influence long-term experimental results. We found no consistent support for our expectation that plants perform better in ambient compared with future climate conditions. However, several species showed interactive responses to the treatments, indicating that optimal management strategies for plant performance are expected to shift with climate change. Changes in population growth rates of these species across treatments were mostly due to changes in plant reproduction. Experiments combined with measuring plant demographic responses provide a way to isolate the effects of different drivers on the long-term persistence of species and to identify the demographic vital rates that are critical to manage in the future. Our study suggests that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain species with preferences for moister soil conditions, and that climate and land use can interactively alter demographic responses of the remaining grassland species.

AB  - Context. Accurate baseline data for wildlife populations are important to track trends of these populations over time and to identify threats to their long-term persistence. Aims. We aimed to assess the status and distribution of the little studied megapode (Megapodius laperouse laperouse) across the Mariana Islands. Methods. Using passive and call playback facilitated surveys in 2008 through 2010, we employed point-transect distance sampling to assess island-level and archipelago-wide status of this megapode. To assess conservation needs, we defined human presence as the current, recent, or intermittent occurrence of humans on islands. Key results. We recorded 657 megapode detections and estimated an archipelago level abundance of 11,542 individuals (95% CI: 5456-17,623) from 699 sampling points across 10 islands. Three islands supported 86% of the megapode population, but cumulatively comprise only 2% of the archipelago's land area. Conclusions. Micronesian Megapodes preferred native forest. Human presence and the availability of native forest may limit their abundance and distribution in the Mariana Islands. Although the probability of detecting megapodes was significantly greater on islands without high human presence, significantly more detections were recorded in forests with dense or closed understory on those islands that supported greater human populations. Implications. Given their status and confined distribution in the Mariana Islands, additional studies investigating megapode incubation sites and movement within and between islands would provide fundamental information on megapode ecology and enhance conservation efforts. Continued and expanded ungulate removal, predator control, and habitat restoration would further enhance the likelihood of megapode persistence in the archipelago.

AB  - The eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, a global biodiversity hotspot, is threatened by habitat degradation. Conservation actions are required in this region, but limited knowledge of large and medium-sized mammals is hampering conservation planning. Using 149 camera traps, we surveyed large and medium-sized mammals in Xionglongxi Provincial Nature Reserve and adjacent areas, on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, during September 2016-May 2017. We obtained 5,752 independent captures of 29 large and medium-sized mammal species, including 13 that are globally threatened and 22 that are nationally threatened in China. Carnivores were especially diverse, with 16 species recorded. Of particular significance was our detection of seven felid species, including the leopard Panthera pardus and the snow leopard Panthera uncia. Our record of the Chinese mountain cat Felis bieti extends the known range of this species. We documented new upper elevation limits for eight species. There was elevational overlap between the leopard and the snow leopard, suggesting potential competition between the two species. The grey wolf Canis lupus and the leopard were the dominant predators, and the woolly hare Lepus oiostolus and several species of ungulates were the most frequently photographed prey species. The study area maintains a significant community of large and medium-sized mammals, which is more diverse than in other areas on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. We recommend the establishment of a larger nature reserve of national protection status in the region of the Xionglongxi Provincial Nature Reserve, to protect the unique subalpine and alpine ecosystems in this area.

AB  - Present research was conducted to assess the anthropogenic impacts on wild mammalian diversity around river Chenab in Sialkot, Gujrat and Gujranwala districts, Punjab, Pakistan. The mammalian diversity was recorded from May, 2013 through April, 2014 along forested landscapes, cultivated plantations, semi-urban and urban areas. The data on diversity and distribution of various mammalian species of the study area were collected through linear count method viz., direct observation (personal count and record voices) and indirect observation (presences of carcasses, fecal pellets, pug marks and meeting with local communities). The habitat preferences of large, medium and small mammals varied significantly. A decrease in mammalian diversity was observed from forest habitat to urban landscapes. Indian wild boar, Asiatic jackal, Indian fox, jungle cat, Indian pangolin and long-eared desert hedgehog preferred forested areas as well as slightly modified habitats while northern palm squirrel, house mouse, house shrew and rat species preferred human habitations. Similarly, a few species like small Indian mongoose, soft-furred field rat, short tailed mole rat, Asiatic jackal and Indian gerbil preferred cultivated areas. It can be concluded from present study that many of the mammalian species area habitat specific and corridors and connections among different landscapes are important for the conservation of mammalian diversity.

AB  - Determining how cetaceans and other threatened marine animals use coastal habitats is critical to the effective conservation of these species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an emerging tool that can potentially be used to detect cetaceans over broad spatial and temporal scales. In particular, eDNA may present a useful complementary method for monitoring their presence during visual surveys in nearshore areas, and for co-detecting prey. In conjunction with ongoing visual surveys, we tested the ability of eDNA metabarcoding to detect the presence and identity of cetaceans in the New York Bight (NYB), and to identify fish species (potential prey) present in the area. In almost all cases in which humpback whales and dolphins were visually observed, DNA from these species was also detected in water samples. To assess eDNA degradation over time, we took samples in the same location 15 and 30 min after a sighting in seven instances, and found that eDNA often, but not always, dropped to low levels after 30 min. Atlantic menhaden were detected in all samples and comprised the majority of fish sequences in most samples, in agreement with observations of large aggregations of this important prey species in the NYB. While additional data are needed to better understand how factors such as behavior and oceanographic conditions contribute to the longevity of eDNA signals, these results add to a growing body of work indicating that eDNA is a promising tool to complement visual and acoustic surveys of marine megafauna.

AB  - The Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii), blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), and Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) are the dominant small ruminants in the Three-River-Source National Park (TRSNP). However, knowledge about the association between gut microbiota and host adaptability remains poorly understood. Herein, multi-omics sequencing approaches were employed to investigate the gut microbiota-mediated forage adaption in these ruminants. The results revealed that although wild ruminants (WR) of P. hodgsoni and P. nayaur were faced with severe foraging environments with significantly low vegetation coverage and nutrition, the apparent forage digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, and acid detergent fiber was significantly higher than that of O. aries. The 16s rRNA sequencing showed that the gut microbiota in WR underwent convergent evolution, and alpha diversity in these two groups was significantly higher than that in O. aries. Moreover, indicator species, including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, exhibited positive relationships with apparent forage digestibility, and their relative abundances were enriched in the gut of WR. Enterotype analysis further revealed that enterotype 1 belonged to WR, and the abundance of fatty acid synthesis metabolic pathway-related enzyme genes was significantly higher than enterotype 2, represented by O. aries. Besides, the metagenomic analysis identified 14 pathogenic bacterial species, among which 10 potentially pathogenic bacteria were significantly enriched in the gut microbiota of O. aries. Furthermore, the cellulolytic strains and genes encoding cellulase and hemicellulase were significantly enriched in WR. In conclusion, our results provide new evidence of gut microbiota to facilitate wildlife adaption in severe foraging environments of the TRSNP, China.
   This research reveals the gut microbiota-mediated severe foraging environment adaptation of wild small ruminants in the Three-River-Source National Park. Unlike Tibetan sheep (TS), blue sheep (PN and Tibetan antelope (TA) often grazed low-quality herbage in a wildness environment, and the higher microbial diversity and resilient network characteristics enabled the hosts to cope with flexible feeding environments. Environmental heterogeneity made the gut microbiota of PN and TA exhibit convergent evolutionary characteristics to adapt to nutritional stress from the habitats. Moreover, a study on microbial enterotypes revealed the two enterotypes, especially E1 exhibited by PN and TA, exhibit higher forage utilization potential and typical microorganisms involved in fatty acid and oxidative phosphorylation pathways play vital roles in energy production and maintaining the hosts' energy balance in the face of cold, anoxia, and food scarcity situation. Furthermore, the less abundant the microbial pathogens, the more abundant the forage-degrading microbiota, and the CAZymes genes encoding cellulose and hemicellulase enable wild small ruminants to better adapt to low quantity and poor-quality forage environments. image

AB  - The invasion of alien plant species threatens the composition and diversity of native communities. However, the invasiveness of alien plants and the resilience of native communities are dependent on the interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, such as natural enemies and nutrient availability. In our study, we simulated the invasion of nine invasive plant species into native plant communities using two levels of nutrient availability and suppression of natural enemies. We evaluated the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on the response of alien target species and the resistance of native communities to invasion. The results showed that the presence of enemies (enemy release) increased the biomass proportion of alien plants while decreasing that of native communities in the absence of nutrient addition. Furthermore, we also found that the negative effect of enemy suppression on the evenness of the native community and the root-to-shoot ratio of alien target species was greatest under nutrient addition. Therefore, nutrient-poor and natural enemies might promote the invasive success of alien species in native communities, whereas nutrient addition and enemy suppression can better enhance the resistance of native plant communities to invasion.

AB  - The use of seawater by terrestrial mammals is often overlooked, despite its ecological and habitat management significance. This study investigated whether sika deer Cervus nippon, which are capable of drinking highly concentrated saltwater, utilize seawater in coastal areas. Multiple deer tracks were found on a beach, indicating that at least three individuals had come from the forest edge to the tide pool. Although, this study did not provide conclusive evidence that the deer drank seawater, it did show that they use the beach, suggesting that they may be drinking seawater from the tide pools. This is an important finding, indicating that terrestrial mammals beyond Bovidae may also drink seawater.

AB  - Habitat loss is a major threat to biodiversity, but the effects of habitat fragmentation are less clear. Examining drivers of key demographic processes, such as reproduction, will clarify species-level responses to fragmentation and broader effects on biodiversity. Yet, understanding how fragmentation affects demography has been challenging due to the many ways landscapes are altered by co-occurring habitat loss and fragmentation, coupled with the rarity of experiments to disentangle these effects. In a large, replicated fragmentation experiment with open savanna habitats surrounded by pine plantation forests, we tested the effects of inter-patch connectivity, patch edge-to-area ratio, and within-patch distance from an edge on plant reproductive output. Using five experimentally planted species of restoration interest-three wind-pollinated grass species and two insect-pollinated forb species-we measured plant flowering, pollination rate, and seed production. All plant species were more likely to flower and produce more flowering structures farther from the forest edge. Connectivity and distance from an edge, however, had no effect on the pollination rate (regardless of pollination mode). Despite no influence of fragmentation on pollination, plant seed production increased farther from the edge for four of five species, driven by the increase in flower production. Synthesis. Altogether, we demonstrate that plant reproductive output (seed production) is decreased by habitat fragmentation through edge effects on flowering. Our work provides evidence that an important contributor to plant demography, reproductive output, is altered by edge effects in fragmented patches. These species-level impacts of fragmentation may provide insight into the mechanisms of fragmentation effects on community-level changes in biodiversity.

AB  - A systematic survey for myxomycetes was carried out in three regions of the Kamchatka peninsula (Russian Federation), all belonging to the National Park "Vulkany Kamchatki": A) around the Avachinsky volcano in southeastern Kamchatka (moist deciduous forests and subalpine shrub thickets); B) around Esso (dry larch forests); C) slopes of the Nikolka volcano (moist spruce forests). The latter two regions are situated in central Kamchatka. A total of 1389 records was determined to species. Of these, 1091 came from field collections and 298 were obtained from 245 moist chamber cultures prepared with samples taken from the bark surface of living trees, ground litter, coarse woody debris and weathered dung of cow and moose. Most (159) of the 170 taxa from 41 genera and 13 families were new for Kamchatka; 3 were new for Russia (Comatricha fragilis, Cribraria pertenuis, and Physarum bogoriense). Over two thirds (120 of 170) of taxa were classified as rare. A pattern of decreasing diversity with increasing elevation was found. The taxonomic composition of myxomycete assemblages of lowland poplar, spruce and larch forests was more diverse than that of montane shrub alder and dwarf pine thickets, and species diversity increased from dung, bark and ground litter to wood. We obtained 18S rDNA barcodes for 167 specimens from 85 taxa, with 9 species and 1 form not barcoded before; 102 of these barcodes represented new sequence variants.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Habitat simplification and use of pesticides in vineyard agro-ecosystems simplified arthropod communities, reducing natural pest control. In this context, habitat management practices could be useful strategies to provide fundamental sources for sustaining natural enemies. The effects of habitat management practices on pests and beneficial arthropods were evaluated in vineyards of North-eastern Italy through different field experiments. We reduced mowing frequency of inter-row spontaneous grasses, compared different timing of mowing of a green manure mixture, and different green manure mixtures. The abundance of key natural enemies (e.g., predatory mites, parasitic wasps and spiders) and some grapevine leafhoppers increased when the grass mowing frequency was reduced. Many beneficial arthropods increased in numbers in organic vineyards. Late mowing of green manure favored spiders and parasitic wasps but not herbivores associated with grapevines. The experiments on the comparison of green manure mixtures did not significantly affect the arthropod communities. Groundcover management practices could enhance beneficial arthropod abundance, but the adoption of this practice should be carefully evaluated when pests occur.
   In this study, the effects of habitat management practices on both pests and beneficial arthropods were evaluated in vineyards of North-eastern Italy through different field experiments: (1) mowing of inter-row spontaneous grasses in conventional and organic vineyards, (2) different timing of mowing of a green manure mixture, and (3) comparing different green manure mixtures. The first experiment followed a split-plot design, while randomized block design was used in the second and third experiment. In each experiment arthropods were sampled using different methods: leaf sampling, beating and sweep net sampling. Non-mowed spontaneous grasses in inter-rows of vineyards favored the abundance of natural enemies (e.g., predatory mites, parasitic wasps and spiders), and sometimes grapevine leafhoppers. Many arthropod species were recorded in higher numbers in organic vineyards. Late mowing of green manure favored beneficial arthropods (e.g., spiders and parasitic wasps), while it did not influence herbivore density. Groundcover management practices, aimed at increasing plant biodiversity in vineyards, could be a useful tool to enhance beneficial arthropod abundance, although the adoption of this practice should be carefully evaluated when pests occur. Semi-natural areas can contribute to create a more pest-stable agro-ecosystem and should be integrated with appropriate ecological infrastructures surrounding vineyards.

AB  - Understanding the consequences of global change for animal movement is a major issue for conservation and management. In particular, habitat fragmentation generates increased densities of linear landscape features that can impede movements. While the influence of these features on animal movements has been intensively investigated, they may also play a key role at broader spatial scales (e.g. the home range scale) as resources, cover from predators/humans, corridors/barriers or landmarks. How space use respond to varying densities of linear features has been mostly overlooked in large herbivores, in contrast to studies done on predators. Focusing on large herbivores should provide additional insights to understand how animals solve the trade-off between energy acquisition and mortality risk. Here, we investigated the role of anthropogenic (roads and tracks) and natural (ridges, valley bottoms and forest edges) linear features on home range features in five large herbivores. We analysed an extensive GPS monitoring database of 710 individuals across nine populations, ranging from mountain areas mostly divided by natural features to lowlands that were highly fragmented by anthropogenic features. Nearly all of the linear features studied were found at the home range periphery, suggesting that large herbivores primarily use them as landmarks to delimit their home range. In contrast, for mountain species, ridges often occurred in the core range, probably related to their functional role in terms of resources and refuge. When the density of linear features was high, they no longer occurred predominantly at the home range periphery, but instead were found across much of the home range. We suggest that, in highly fragmented landscapes, large herbivores are constrained by the costs of memorising the spatial location of key features, and by the requirement for a minimum area to satisfy their vital needs. These patterns were mostly consistent in both males and females and across species, suggesting that linear features have a preponderant influence on how large herbivores perceive and use the landscape.

AB  - Medium to large rainforest mammals are key conservation flagship groups that offer non-redundant ecosystem functions, but anthropic pressures, such as illegal hunting, may strongly affect their occupancy in Amazonia. We combined camera traps and occupancy models to assess the influence of distance from human settlements, the number of families per settlement and the synergetic effect of the average weight of 27 species on the occupancy probability of mammals. Specifically, we classified mammal species according to the game preferences of hunters (i.e. a group of species depleted for bushmeat, a group of species hunted for retaliation and a group of non-hunted species). We also accounted for the influence on the detection probability of each group of both the number of days each camera operated and the body weight of mammals. The occupancy probability of the bushmeat group (i.e. deer, peccaries, agoutis, pacas and armadillos) was lower at locations closer to human settlements. Still, the number of families correlated positively with occupancy, with the occupancy probability of the group being slightly higher at sites with more families. This difference was probably due to larger and more abundant crops and fruiting trees attracting wildlife at such sites. Conversely, the occupancy probability of the retaliation group (i.e. carnivores) and the non-hunted group (i.e. opossums, spiny rats, squirrels and anteaters) were indifferent to anthropogenic stressors. The detection probability of the non-hunted and particularly the most depleted species correlated negatively with body weight. This may suggest that larger species, especially those from the bushmeat group, are rarer or less abundant in the system, possibly because they are the preferable target of hunters. In the long term, locals will likely need to travel long distances to find harvest meat. Poaching also threatens food security since game bushmeat is an essential source of protein for isolated rural Amazonians.
   Our study focuses on investigating the impact of anthropogenic factors on the occupancy of medium and large mammals in unflooded forests of the Central Amazon. Through a camera trapping survey conducted across 47 sampling sites during the dry season, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the influence of anthropogenic stressors on mammal occupancy patterns in terra-firme forests. Our findings reveal compelling evidence that anthropogenic stressors have a strong influence on mammal occupancy, particularly with regard to game preference in the study area.image

AB  - It remains unclear how animals are affected by different environmental stressors, including climatic, anthropogenic and conspecific interactions. Assessing seasonal changes in hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in fallow deer from 10 populations across England, we found a negative correlation with precipitation in May-June and with average temperature in late winter (January-February). There was a positive correlation with precipitation in November-March and the number of days of airfrost, two measures which would also reflect increased environmental challenge over winter. While the same climatic factors appeared to influence HCC of both sexes, the primary social factor affecting HCC in females was the level of competition experienced for quality food resources. By contrast, the major factor affecting HCC in males was the proportion of males within the population overall, perhaps reflecting the degree of male-male competition.

AB  - Protected areas are the frontlines of biodiversity conservation, featuring critical landscapes and microhabitats that are fitted for the survival of the organisms that have restricted populations. The determination of land suitability and habitat connectivity in these protected areas are important for species with specialized adaptive behavior that requires favorable conditions to survive. The Bubalus mindorensis is a critically endangered bovine of the Philippines which utilizes mud or water puddles to address heat stress through body submersion, known as wallowing. With Mts. Iglit-Baco National Park (MIBNP) harboring the largest remaining subpopulation of the tamaraw, the preservation of its natural landscapes is critical for tamaraw survival. Here, the potential wallows in MIBNP were determined using the weighted overlay analysis (WOA) assisted by the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Using environmental variables that were influential to the creation of wallows, an equal-weighed scenario and an AHP-assisted scenario wallow suitability map was generated. Moderate and highly suitable areas were found at the north-central portion of the mountain, coinciding with the current and future conservation zones of the tamaraw, whereas low suitable areas dominate the other half, aggregating at the corners due to build areas and agriculture. The result of the study provides supplementary information in constructing future conservation strategies for an endemic species with global importance, particularly in its possible range expansion within the park. Furthermore, this study provides a framework for future conservation efforts, which helps in the management of critical landscapes for species with specialized adaptive behaviors through GIS-based multicriteria decision-making.

AB  - Soil nutrient availability and their spatial distributions are strongly related to land use and landscape morphology. This study aims to address the knowledge gap regarding the interaction between these factors and the underlying mechanisms. We selected five land uses (grassland with Artemisia gmelinii, woodland with Robinia pseudoacacia, shrubland with Caragana korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides, and apple orchard with Malus pumila) and nine slope positions across hillslopes in the Loess Plateau, China, to investigate their combined effects on the contents and stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were conducted to determine the significant differences in the means or the medians of the soil nutrient variables. Results showed that the SOC and TN contents of shrubland with Caragana korshinskii were statistically significantly greater than those of the grassland (p < 0.05). SOC and TN contents generally decreased from the upper slope to the middle slope, and to the foot slope for the grassland, woodland and shrublands, and on the contrary, an increasing trend from the upper slope, to the middle slope, and to the foot slope was identified for the apple orchard. This study highlights that land use, slope position and their interaction have significant effects on the spatial distributions of soil nutrients. It provides essential empirical evidence for the identification of the optimal vegetation type and slope positions in land management and vegetation restoration activities.

AB  - Leafing activity is a crucial part of the tree life cycle and is tightly linked to photosynthesis, gas exchange and biomass accumulation, among other processes. Despite this, many aspects of leafing phenology, such as climate drivers of community and species-level temporal patterns, are poorly understood in tropical rainforest species. Here, we present 18 years of above-canopy phenological observations of leafing phenology for Davidsonia pruriens, an important endemic species in the Wet Tropics, from January 1997 to December 2014. We assessed changes in leafing patterns through time and how they are being affected by climate drivers. We found that, while the tropical rainforest region is considered to have low seasonality in leaf production, leafing in this species was seasonal with a peak in the wet season. Analysis of climate drivers showed that increased leaf production was correlated with increased daily rainfall and decreased solar radiation. Interannual activity responded similarly to changes in annual rainfall and solar radiation but was also significantly impacted by cyclones and El Ni & ntilde;o events. Our results show that Davidsonia pruriens has seasonal leafing patterns which are strongly influenced by climate drivers. Our study is the first to present field-based measurements of long-term leafing phenology in Australia, which clearly demonstrate climate change sensitivity of leafing in an endemic plant, a plant that is a significant bush tucker species to Aboriginal traditional custodians of the rainforest region of Northern Australia.

AB  - Free-ranging grazers are increasingly being introduced to areas of high natural value, such as wetlands. There is also growing attention that has been paid to the historical role of herbivores in shaping ecosystems and landscapes. Even though studies on the grazing of free-range horses were carried out in different regions and climates, still little is known about their habitat selection on heterogeneous marshy areas in the temperate region of Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate the habitat use by contemporary Konik horses during the growing season on the basis of three-year GPS data for a semi-feral herd kept on wetlands. Almost 68% of the occurrence of Konik horses were in open habitats. The assessment of habitat selection by the horses confirmed their strong preferences for grasslands on mid-forest dunes and forest avoidance. Konik horses somewhat preferred mowed fen meadows, but the animals displayed differences in the selection of habitat, probably depending on its humidity and weather conditions in a given year which may limit the role of grazing in protecting these communities. Horses need different habitats in wetlands such as fen meadows, forest, and grasslands on the mineral hills. This should be taken into consideration for landscape management in areas where the introduction of wild or semi-wild horse populations is planned.

AB  - Predation risk is a function of spatiotemporal overlap between predator and prey, as well as behavioural responses during encounters. Dynamic factors (e.g. group size, prey availability and animal movement or state) affect risk, but rarely are integrated in risk assessments. Our work targets a system where predation risk is fundamentally linked to temporal patterns in prey abundance and behaviour. For neonatal ungulate prey, risk is defined within a short temporal window during which the pulse in parturition, increasing movement capacity with age and antipredation tactics have the potential to mediate risk. In our coyote-mule deer (Canis latrans-Odocoileus hemionus) system, leveraging GPS data collected from both predator and prey, we tested expectations of shared enemy and reproductive risk hypotheses. We asked two questions regarding risk: (A) How does primary and alternative prey habitat, predator and prey activity, and reproductive tactics (e.g. birth synchrony and maternal defence) influence the vulnerability of a neonate encountering a predator? (B) How do the same factors affect behaviour by predators relative to the time before and after an encounter? Despite increased selection for mule deer and intensified search behaviour by coyotes during the peak in mule deer parturition, mule deer were afforded protection from predation via predator swamping, experiencing reduced per-capita encounter risk when most neonates were born. Mule deer occupying rabbit habitat (Sylvilagus spp.; coyote's primary prey) experienced the greatest risk of encounter but the availability of rabbit habitat did not affect predator behaviour during encounters. Encounter risk increased in areas with greater availability of mule deer habitat: coyotes shifted their behaviour relative to deer habitat, and the pulse in mule deer parturition and movement of neonatal deer during encounters elicited increased speed and tortuosity by coyotes. In addition to the spatial distribution of prey, temporal patterns in prey availability and animal behavioural state were fundamental in defining risk. Our work reveals the nuanced consequences of pulsed availability on predation risk for alternative prey, whereby responses by predators to sudden resource availability, the lasting effects of diversionary prey and inherent antipredation tactics ultimately dictate risk.
   For neonatal ungulate prey, risk is defined within a short temporal window. Availability of other prey and reproductive tactics related to pulsed parturition each have the potential to determine risk, and each affect the predator-prey behavioural race based on their influence in defining encounters and predator behaviour.image

AB  - Climate change significantly impacted on the survival, development, distribution, and abundance of living organisms. The Chinese serow Capricornis milneedwardsii, known as the "four unlike," is a Class II nationally protected species in China. In this study, we predicted the geographical suitability of C. milneedwardsii under current and future climatic conditions using MaxEnt. The model simulations resulted in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values above 0.9 for both current and future climate scenarios, indicating the excellent performance, high accuracy, and credibility of the MaxEnt model. The results also showed that annual precipitation (Bio12), slope, elevation, and mean temperature of wettest quarter (Bio8) were the key environmental variables affecting the distribution of C. milneedwardsii, with contributions of 31.2%, 26.4%, 11%, and 10.3%, respectively. The moderately and highly suitable habitats were mainly located in the moist area of China, with a total area of 34.56 x 10(4) and 16.61 x 10(4) km(2), respectively. Under future climate change scenarios, the areas of suitability of C. milneedwardsii showed an increasing trend. The geometric center of the total suitable habitats of C. milneedwardsii would show the trend of northwest expansion and southeast contraction. These findings could provide a theoretical reference for the protection of C. milneedwardsii in the future.

AB  - In temperate habitats, the vegetation onset in spring affects the life cycle activities of large herbivores. For one species of large herbivore, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), parturition is tied to peak resource availability. However, recent long-term studies of the parturition date of roe deer found only limited support for its earlier occurrence with an earlier onset of spring. In this study, data from a long-term project (1973-2019) in southern Germany (Baden-Wurttemberg; elevation 101-1036 m; 16,130 tagged roe deer fawns) were used to investigate whether the advance in the roe deer parturition date reflected different environmental conditions and was thus explained by temporal and spatial factors. Our results showed a consistent advance toward an earlier parturition date (between 0.16 and 0.33 d/yr), especially for elevations above 750 m, that coincided with an advance in plant phenology. Up to 37% of the variance of the detrended time series of the mean annual parturition was accounted for by the detrended time series of the flowering date of forsythia. Our results suggest a plasticity that allows roe deer to cope with climate-induced changes along environmental gradients.

AB  - Studies of insect herbivory on fossilized leaves tend to focus on a few, relatively simple metrics that are agnostic to the distribution of insect damage types among host plants. More complex metrics that link particular damage types to particular host plants have the potential to address additional ecological questions, but such metrics can be biased by sampling incompleteness due to the difficulty of distinguishing the true absence of a particular interaction from the failure to detect it-a challenge that has been raised in the ecological literature. We evaluate a range of methods for characterizing the relationships between damage types and host plants by performing resampling and subsampling exercises on a variety of datasets. We found that the components of beta diversity provide a more valid, reliable, and interpretable method for comparing component communities than do bipartite network metrics and that the rarefaction of interactions represent a valid, reliable, and interpretable method for comparing compound communities. Both beta diversity and rarefaction of interactions avoid the potential pitfalls of multiple comparisons. Finally, we found that the host specificity of individual damage types is challenging to assess. Whereas bipartite network metrics are sufficiently biased by sampling incompleteness to be inappropriate for fossil herbivory data, alternatives exist that are perfectly suitable for fossil datasets with sufficient sample coverage.

AB  - Some tropical reefs are transitioning from coral to novel seaweed communities in response to human alterations of critical environmental drivers, highlighting the need to deepen our understanding of the functional ecology of seaweed. Trait-based ecology shows early promise for this purpose, motivating exploration of traits that reveal ecological strategies of seaweed on tropical reefs. We measured nine traits of 36 seaweed species from Mo'orea, French Polynesia that balance the need to acquire resources, resist herbivores, and resist physical disturbance. We selected a subset of four traits to evaluate whether this reduced set of traits revealed the same ecological strategies. For both the full and reduced set of traits, we used PCA to visualize multivariate trait data, quantified the contribution of traits to the first two PCs with loading plots, and explored bivariate trade-offs with correlation analysis. We identified one ecological strategy that trades off maximizing resource acquisition with resistance to disturbance and/or herbivory, and another that traded off between two resistance traits. We found some ecological strategies varied across environmental contexts as novel tradeoffs and orthogonal relationships emerged for our tropical algae compared to temperate findings, though species or trait selection may also play a role. Overall, four traits captured ecological strategies important to seaweeds subject to human impacts altering resources, herbivory, and disturbance. We hope this method of trait selection expedites exploration of ecological strategies and rapidly advances our understanding of the functional ecology of tropical seaweed.

AB  - PurposeHabitat selection in animals is a hierarchal process that operates across multiple temporal and spatial scales, adapting to changes in environmental conditions, human disturbances, and predation risks. Despite its significance, previous research often oversimplifies temporal dynamics by categorizing them into broad seasonal and diel patterns, overlooking the continuous nature of temporal variability and habitat specificity.MethodsWe investigated the temporal patterns in habitat selection of moose (Alces alces) in highly heterogenous landscapes at the southwestern edge of their European range using step-selection functions. Utilizing over 700,000 GPS locations from 34 adult moose, we aimed to assess seasonal and diel patterns in their selectivity for both natural and human-related habitats.ResultsOur findings revealed significant overall temporal variation in moose habitat selection at both seasonal and diel scales. Moose selectivity toward different habitats showed low repeatability over time, with 35% of cases displaying negative correlation between selectivity in different time windows. Diel changes were more pronounced, showing 5.6-fold difference in cumulative selectivity, compared to 1.4-fold difference in seasonal dynamics. Notably, moose exhibited lower selectivity during nighttime hours throughout the year compared to daytime hours. The study also highlighted distinct habitat selection patterns across different habitat types: natural habitats (deciduous forests, coniferous forests, wetlands) exhibited pronounced seasonal variation, while anthropogenic habitats (grasslands, arable land, roads and settlements) showed more diel variability. Moose generally avoided human-related habitats during daytime hours, but their preferences during nighttime varied depending on the habitat type and time of year.ConclusionThis research advances our understanding of the complex temporal patterns in habitat selection by large herbivores and underscores the importance of considering temporal dynamics in habitat selection modelling.

AB  - Simple Summary Forest animals can be used as a sensitive indicator of the real state of biodiversity. The research objective was to study the potential of drone planes equipped with thermal infrared imaging cameras for large animal monitoring in the conditions of Siberian winter forests with snow background at temperatures of -5 degrees C to -30 degrees C. The surveyed territory included the Salair State Nature Reserve in the Kemerovo Region, Russia. Drone planes were effective in covering large areas, while thermal infrared cameras provided accurate information in the harsh winter conditions of Siberia. The research featured the population of the European elk (Alces alces), which is gradually deteriorating due to poaching and deforestation. The designed technical methods and analytic algorithms are cost-efficient and they can be applied for monitoring large areas of Siberian, Canadian and Alaskan winter forests. There are two main reasons for monitoring the population of forest animals. First, regular surveys reveal the real state of biodiversity. Second, they guarantee a prompt response to any negative environmental factor that affects the animal population and make it possible to eliminate the threat before any permanent damage is done. The research objective was to study the potential of drone planes equipped with thermal infrared imaging cameras for large animal monitoring in the conditions of Siberian winter forests with snow background at temperatures -5 degrees C to -30 degrees C. The surveyed territory included the Salair State Nature Reserve in the Kemerovo Region, Russia. Drone planes were effective in covering large areas, while thermal infrared cameras provided accurate statistics in the harsh winter conditions of Siberia. The research featured the population of the European elk (Alces alces), which is gradually deteriorating due to poaching and deforestation. The authors developed an effective methodology for processing the data obtained from drone-mounted thermal infrared cameras. The research provided reliable results concerning the changes in the elk population on the territory in question. The use of drone planes proved an effective means of ungulate animal surveying in snow-covered winter forests. The designed technical methods and analytic algorithms are cost-efficient and they can be applied for monitoring large areas of Siberian and Canadian winter forests.

AB  - Livestock depredation is a common cause of human-carnivore conflicts. In Portugal, free-ranging dogs are increasingly abundant and overlap endangered Iberian wolf territories, with reports of livestock depredation. However, the lack of awareness about dogs' possible role as predators leads to bias against wolves in cases of damages. Our goal was to assess and compare wolf and free-ranging dog's diet composition at southern wolf range in Portugal, to offer insights on dogs' predatory role on livestock and its implications for the conservation of an endangered wolf subpopulation. We assessed diet composition from 107 to 95 genetically confirmed wolf and dog scats, respectively, and complemented the analysis with data from 40 attacks on livestock with successful genetic predator assignment. Scat analysis highlighted goats as the most consumed dog prey in all analysed regions, with lagomorphs, small mammals, and wild boars as second most consumed in each region, respectively. Wolves mainly relied on goats and wild boars in the west, whereas in the central region they mostly fed on birds. The dietary overlap between both canids was very high (Pianka's index O = 0.93), showing potential for competition. Additionally, we found that dogs were the sole predators detected in most attacks (62%). Our findings highlight dogs' role as predators of livestock, and possibly also wild species, posing a further challenge to wolf conservation. Alongside adequate husbandry practices, we emphasise the need for a stronger enforcement of the legislation on dog ownership and an effective management of the stray population to reduce human-wolf conflict.

AB  - Browsing ecology involving ungulates and their food resource is complex as consumption may reflect responses to various factors, such as quantity and quality of browse species. This study investigated winter browsing by moose Alces alces in a mountainous landscape of west-central Sweden, characterized by Norway spruce Picea abies production forests with high inclusion of deciduous species. Field data on tree species abundances as well as fresh and previous browsing were collected along moose tracks and control transects, to answer our questions regarding browse selection in relation to availability. The data were analyzed using mainly modelling (generalized linear mixed models) approaches. The results revealed greater amounts of available food trees (< 5 m) in young compared to older forests and along moose tracks compared to control transects. Downy birch Betula pubescens was the most abundant independent of forest age class and transect type (i.e. tracks versus controls). Quantitatively, the key winter browse in the study area was a mix of deciduous species, primarily downy birch and willows (Salix spp.) complemented by Eurasian aspen Populus tremula and grey alder Alnus incana. In young forest, aspen, rowan Sorbus aucuparia and willows were the most selected species, while common juniper Juniperus communis was the least selected. In older forest, alder was most selected, followed by willows and rowan, while aspen and downy birch were the least selected, except for spruce and lodgepole pine Pinus contorta. According to Jacobs selectivity index, downy birch, was underused while aspen, rowan and willows were overused in relation to their frequencies. The latter are often limited in today's cultivated forest landscape and thus an increased amount of those species may be utilized to a higher degree by moose than an increase of downy birch. No effect from snow depth was detected and browsing on dwarf shrubs was not observed.

AB  - The spatial and temporal avoidance of the predator is of the highest importance for the survival of the prey. In habitats where spatial avoidance is impossible, the differences in the temporal presence play a significant role in the survival strategy of the prey. As this behaviour is still understudied in Bulgaria, we used two types of camera trap analyses - an activity overlap and time-spacing to investigate the spatiotemporal avoidance of the wolf in Osogovo Mountain by its ungulate prey - the wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.). The results of the activity overlap showed that the wild boar and the roe deer had a high degree of activity overlap (& UDelta; = 0.70). The wolf and the roe deer activity overlap was higher (? = 0.61) than that of the wolf and wild boar (& UDelta; = 0.57). Time-spacing results further showed that it took a longer time for the wild boar to appear after the wolf (min = 14:24 h) than after the roe deer (min = 3:56 h). On the other hand, the wolf appeared sooner after a wild boar (min = 7:54 h) than after the roe deer (min = 11:19 h). Having in mind, that the wild boar prevailed in the wolf diet in Osogovo Mtn, the temporal analyses confirmed the hypothesis that the smaller wild boar-wolf activity overlap and the longer time required for the appearance of the wild boar after the wolf in the same place are part of the wild boar protective strategy to avoid the predator when present in the same areas. Unlike the wild boar, the roe deer is hunted by the wolf only if it is encountered by chance, which resulted in lower avoidance behaviour.

AB  - Marine microbial communities in coastal environments are subject to both seasonal fluctuations and anthropogenic alterations of environmental conditions. The separate influences of temperature and resource-dependency on phytoplankton growth, community, and ecosystem metabolism are relatively well understood. However, winners and losers in the ocean are determined based on the interplay among often rapidly changing biological, chemical and physical drivers. The direct, indirect, and interactive effects of these conditions on planktonic food web structure and function are poorly constrained. Here, we investigated how simultaneous manipulation of temperature and nutrient availability affects trophic transfer from phytoplankton to herbivorous protists, and their resulting implications at the ecosystem level. Temperature directly affected herbivorous protist composition; ciliates dominated (66%) in colder treatment and dinoflagellates (60%) at warmer temperatures. Throughout the experiments, grazing rates were < 0.1 d(-1), with higher rates at subzero temperatures. Overall, the nutrient-temperature interplay affected trophic transfer rates antagonistically when nutrients were amended, and synergistically, when nutrients were not added. This interaction resulted in higher percentages of primary production consumed under nutrient unamended compared to nutrient amended conditions. At the ecosystem level, these changes may determine the fate of primary production, with most of the production likely exported out of the pelagic zone in high-temperature and nutrient conditions, while high-temperature and low-nutrient availability strengthened food web coupling and enhanced trophic transfer. These results imply that in warming oceans, management of coastal nutrient loading will be a critical determinant of the degree of primary production removal by microzooplankton and dependent ecosystem production.

AB  - Among the various forms of pollution, anthropogenic debris has been widely documented to cause entanglement and premature death of sea turtles, in addition to being ingested by these animals. One of the most affected species is the green turtle, which is commonly found along the south-central coast of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), an area characterized by high human population density. This study aimed to assess the impact of anthropogenic debris on green turtles by analyzing the gastrointestinal tracts of 66 individuals stranded along the south-central coast of RJ, as documented by the Santos Basin Beach Monitoring Project. Pieces of debris (1,683 in total) were found in 69.7% of the individuals analyzed, with the highest concentration observed in the large intestine. The most common types of debris were flexible plastic waste (50.5%; 850 items) and amber/brown debris (36.5%; 614 items) within the size range of 0.5 mm to 2.5 cm (41.2%; 693 items). No significant differences in debris composition were observed between turtles encountered inside and outside the bays. The substantial number of individuals with debris in their gastrointestinal tract underscores the severity of the impact of these debris on sea turtles in this region.

AB  - Aim: Large carnivores are currently recolonizing parts of their historical ranges in Europe after centuries of persecution and habitat loss. Understanding the mechanisms driving these recolonizations is important for proactive conservation planning. Using the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) as examples, we explore where and when large carnivores are likely to expand into human-dominated landscapes and how varying levels of resistance due to human pressure might impact this recolonization process.
   Location: Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods: We used ensembles of species distribution models to relate species occurrence data to climate, topography and satellite-based land-cover predictors at a 10 km spatial resolution. Resulting predictions of suitable habitat areas were fed into a dispersal model to simulate range expansion over the 10 time-steps for different human pressure scenarios. Finally, we overlaid predictions with protected areas to highlight areas that are likely key for future connectivity, but where human pressures might hamper dispersal.
   Results: We found widespread suitable habitat for both species (bear: 30,000 km(2), lynx: 170,000 km(2)), yet human pressure limits potential range expansions. For brown bears, core habitats between the Cantabrian and Pyrenean populations remained unconnected despite suitable habitat in between. For lynx, we predicted higher range expansion potential, although high human pressures in southern coastal Spain negatively affected expansion potential.
   Main conclusions: Our results highlight that the recolonization potential of brown bears and lynx in the Iberian Peninsula is likely more constrained by lower permeability of landscapes due to human pressure than by habitat availability, a situation likely emblematic for large carnivores in many parts of the world. More generally, our approach provides a simple tool for conservation planners and managers to identify where range expansion is likely to occur and where proactively managing to allow large carnivores to safely disperse through human-dominated landscapes can contribute to viable large carnivore populations.

AB  - Distance sampling surveys are extensively used to estimate the abundance of wide-ranging species but are prone to detection biases. This may be particularly acute for strip-transect protocols, which assume perfect detection. We examined this assumption by quantifying the detection probability of a declining seabird (Scopoli's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea), with particular attention to time of day and observation conditions at sea. We found detection probability was negatively affected by sun glare but positively by cloud cover and considerably dropped during mid-day hours due to circadian changes in behaviour (reduced detectability while resting). This result urges for systematically assessing and correcting detection bias when using strip-transect data to derive abundance information. Here, we did so by building a detection-corrected presence-absence ensemble model and combining it with a compilation of colony sizes and locations. A Monte-Carlo simulation ensured uncertainty propagation within and across data sources. The corrected abundance map showed shearwaters were largely prevalent in the central Mediterranean, Tunisia hosting most of the population both at sea and at colonies (45% of the global population; 79% of breeding pairs). This first accurate map is an essential conservation tool, emphasizing the importance of transnational actions for such species, that know no political boundaries.

AB  - Effective wildlife management often relies on estimates of animal density, and cue counting is a viable estimation strategy. A key component of density estimation from dung, a form of cue counting, is estimation of the persistence time, t<^> $\hat{t}$, of dung piles. However, differences between observers on what constitutes a dung pile may alter subsequent density estimates. Additionally, many researchers studying white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have substituted for t<^> $\hat{t}$ the number of days between the date in which 98% of deciduous trees shed leaves in autumn and field sampling. To address these 2 concerns, we compared 3 methods for estimating t<^> $\hat{t}$ of white-tailed deer pellet groups: (1) a common modelling approach based on observations from a single observer (single-observer method), (2) a method that accommodates interobserver variation on the status of dung during field surveys (interobserver method), and (3) the days elapsed since 98% of deciduous trees shed autumn leaves (leaf-off method). We then applied these 3 t<^> $\hat{t}$ estimates to distance-sampling data on pellet groups from white-tailed deer that we collected along transects during 3 sampling seasons from 2019-2021 in west-central Indiana. We estimated habitat- and year-specific deer densities. Persistence probability of pellet groups varied across habitats and years, positively with age and number of pellets, and negatively with precipitation and temperature. In several instances, we found strong or marginal differences between densities estimated using the leaf-off method and the other 2 methods. The densities using the interobserver and single-observer methods were similar, with the latter being larger by an average of 8.0% (SE = 1.71). The latter also yielded coefficients of variation (CV) that averaged 16.6% (SE = 4.8) larger, attributable to interobserver discrepancies in scoring dung persistence. Density estimates from the leaf-off method were 32.6% (SE = 15.3) and 37.8% (SE = 13.0) less than the density estimates from the interobserver and single-observer methods, respectively. We encourage future researchers estimating density using multiple observers and dung sampling techniques to incorporate interobserver variation. We advocate that biologists relying on dung-based estimation of density for white-tailed deer abandon the conventional leaf-off method and adopt other modelling approaches.

AB  - Greenland's fjord ecosystems are strongly influenced by meltwater discharge from glaciers. Marine-terminating glaciers can significantly enhance primary production during the melt season (compared to land-terminating glaciers), but their impact on secondary producers is not well understood. Here, we study seasonal changes in the zooplankton community (>50 mu m) and grazing rates along two fjord transects in southwest Greenland influenced by different glacier types. Zooplankton biomass was comparable between the fjords, but community composition differed during summer. Nuup Kangerlua, a predominantly marine-terminating system, was characterized by large, herbivorous copepods and a longer summer grazing period in connection with the summer bloom. Ameralik, influenced by a land-terminating glacier, was characterized by small, omnivorous copepods, particularly Microsetella norvegica and Oncaea spp., and indicated a faster post-bloom transition towards regenerated production. Local hydrographic conditions also impact copepod biomass. A station with high biomass was found in Ameralik, potentially linked to a frontal zone where fjord water masses meet, providing favorable grazing conditions. We hypothesize that a future transformation from marine- to land-terminating glaciers could result in an increased abundance of smaller copepods, as observed in Ameralik. Such a community would constitute a less lipid-rich food source for higher trophic levels.

AB  - Globally, high-density populations of feral deer have been associated with a range of negative ecological consequences. Within Australia, limited quantitative research has assessed the impacts of deer, particularly in threatened ecological communities (TECs). Our study aimed to quantify the impact of feral deer on the herbivory of a range of woody plant species, non-woody growth forms and TECs; and assess whether feral deer increase herbivory in TECs above background rates caused by native herbivores. We surveyed 356 transects across 89 sites representing eight TECs and collected herbivory data for woody and non-woody plants. At each site, we recorded the presence or absence of deer sign and abundance of macropod pellets to account for variations in herbivory between groups of sympatric species. Generalised linear mixed models were developed to predict: (i) proportion of individual plants browsed (or grazed); and (ii) average browsing (or grazing) intensity for woody plant species and non-woody plants. Controlling for macropod abundance, we found the average grazing intensity and proportion of non-woody plants grazed was higher when deer were present compared to absent. Specifically, grazing pressure on rushes, cycads, sedges and grasses was significantly higher where deer were present. In contrast, we did not observe a significant impact of deer on woody plant species. The presence of deer resulted in higher grazing intensity in coastal saltmarsh, freshwater wetland, littoral rainforest and bangalay sand forest TECs. Although the deer population across our study region generally appears to be at low density compared to neighbouring regions, their presence is resulting in grazing pressure above that caused by native herbivores for a range of non-woody plants. Our results contribute to a growing body of research about the ecological impacts of feral deer in Australia and can be used as a baseline for ongoing regional monitoring of deer impacts in TECs.

AB  - Pereskia aculeata Miller (Cactaceae) is a primitive leafy cactus indigenous to Central and South America that has become a problematic invasive alien plant elsewhere in the world. In South Africa the plant invades established forests, clearings, thickets and plantations along the southern and eastern higher rainfall regions of the country. Pereskia aculeata is a woody vine (liana) that scrambles up existing vegetation competing for resources, often causing canopies to collapse under its weight. Similarly, to other invasive vines, mechanical and chemical control is challenging due to the plant growing intertwined with indigenous vegetation and therefore, biological control using specialist insect herbivores is considered essential for its management. Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are expected to favour weeds, however this response is likely to be influenced by projected changes to rainfall patterns. Pereskia aculeata were grown from truncheons for five months at three CO2 concentrations: 250 (sub-ambient), 400 (ambient) and 600 (elevated) ppm under two watering regimes, reduced water (200 ml wk(-1)) and ambient-water (400 ml wk(-1)), to simulate two annual rainfall scenarios of similar to 520 mm (below present optimal) and similar to 1040 mm (present optimal), respectively. Elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) increased growth rates, biomass accumulation and reduced leaf nutritional quality (nitrogen content and C:N ratios), but only for ambient-water treatment plants. Nevertheless, higher photosynthetic rates under eCO(2) improved water use efficiency for both water treatments, which was greatest for the reduced-water treatment plants. Management of P. aculeata in South Africa is already extremely challenging and with rising atmospheric CO2, P. aculeata has the potential to become more problematic, particularly in optimal rainfall areas. Furthermore, with improvements in water use efficiency, P. aculeata has the potential to expand into lower rainfall areas, although it is unlikely to pose the same risk as those plants invading higher rainfall sites.

AB  - Plant-insect interactions can differ between endophagous and exophagous insect guilds, and this can influence the response patterns of these guilds to anthropogenic changes in natural habitats. We compared the species richness, abundance, and species-level specialization of plant-herbivore assemblages composed of distinct insect guilds in Neotropical savannas. Assemblages of chewing insects were the richest in species, and the gallers were the most abundant. Galling species were more specialized than other guilds, and sucking insects were more specialized than chewers. Our results show that insect guilds are similarly influenced by disturbance, which decreased species richness and increased specialization of insect species.

AB  - Excessive grazing causes a decrease in plant diversity of grassland and also leads to changes in the functional traits of grassland plants. Based on the relationship between plant diversity and the functional traits of constructive species, the patterns of change in plant diversity can be predicted based on change in plant functional traits under different stocking rates. For the present study, Stipa breviflora desert steppe in Inner Mongolia was studied to characterize the plant community and population characteristics and plant functional traits of S. breviflora in grazing areas with different stocking rates [without grazing, light grazing (LG, 0.93 sheep unit hm(-2)half yr(-1)), moderate grazing (MG, 1.82 sheep unit hm(-2)half yr(-1)), heavy grazing (HG, 2.71 sheep unit hm(-2) half yr(-1))]. The results showed that: (1) LG significantly weakened the competitive advantage of the constructive species (S. breviflora) (P < 0.05), while HG significantly strengthened its competitive advantage in the community (P < 0.05); (2) Changes in plant diversity were generally significantly related to changes in S. breviflora root traits. The competitive advantage of S. breviflora in the community and the change in root traits could be used to predict the change in plant diversity in the desert steppe under different stocking rates. This research can provide a theoretical basis for maintaining plant diversity and sustainability in the desert steppe.

AB  - Expansion of drainage networks through the headward erosion of tidal creeks is an eco-geomorphologic response of salt marshes to accelerated sea-level rise (SLR). This response can counter the negative impacts of an elevation deficit by increasing drainage and encouraging plant health, thereby reducing potential for submergence and marsh platform loss. In the wetlands of Cape Romain, SC, intense bioturbation near creek heads by the common marsh crab Sesarma reticulatum has been found to facilitate sediment erosion and rapid creek growth. This keystone grazer has been recently observed to have increasing influence on landscape evolution throughout the southeast US coast. Here, we compare measurements taken at Sapelo Island, GA, with those previously collected at Cape Romain, to confirm that eco-geomorphic feedbacks facilitating creek growth at each location are similar, and to compare these processes under differing background conditions. We use sediment cores, precise elevation measurements and historical imagery to compare substrate properties, elevation within the tidal frame, creek growth rates and drainage morphology at both sites. Our results show identical processes; however, the higher elevation of the marsh at Sapelo Island leads to shallower and shorter periods of tidal inundation, explaining the greater soil strength and lower belowground biomass compared with the marsh at Cape Romain. The smaller tidal range at the site in Cape Romain compared with Sapelo Island translates to a proportionally shallower depth of tidal creeks, which therefore requires less erosion to produce headward creek extension. These effects are likely to have contributed to slower growth rates of tidal creeks at Sapelo Island during the past several decades of SLR. Our findings highlight the similarities in process but differences in rates in how marshes are responding to climate-related stress.

AB  - Cigarette butts (CBs) contain a plethora of chemicals, including many that are toxic. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the toxicity of CBs to aquatic organisms, there is less evidence that terrestrial organisms are severely impacted. Because CBs are commonly discarded on the ground, ground-dwelling organisms such as land snails may be especially affected. Many land snails are generalist detritivores/herbivores and ingest a variety of plant secondary compounds as they feed. This evolutionary exposure may render CBs (made principally of cured tobacco leaves) less toxic to these land snails than CBs are to less exposed aquatic animals. We investigated this possibility of reduced effects using a new behavioural assay to test the choice of 'flavoured' vertical resting sites in the land snail Cornu aspersum, which commonly rests on upright surfaces. In four experiments, regions of container walls were coated with different concentrations of CB and cured tobacco effluents, and effluents from three tree species and cured tobacco. Snails avoided high CB and tobacco effluent concentrations, which is consistent with toxicity. However, snails preferentially rested on dilute concentrations of both CBs and tobacco. Preference among tree leaf effluents was less evident, with a trend towards snails preferring the more readily eaten maple than the less readily eaten oak. Selection of the preferred tobacco concentration did not differ from that of tree leaves, indicating that C. aspersum was not repelled by dilute tobacco effluent. These results indicate that compounds leaching from discarded CBs may have little effect on snails and perhaps other soil organisms under environmentally realistic conditions.

AB  - Dictyocaulus is a globally distributed genus of lungworms of domestic and wild ungulates. Dictyocaulus adults inhabit the bronchi, frequently causing subclinical and clinical disease, and that impacts animal health and production. North American bison (Bison bison) and cattle (Bos taurus) share various parasitic nematode species, particularly in areas where co-grazing occurs. The current assumption is that North American bison share the lungworm D. viviparus with cattle, but this has not been confirmed on a molecular basis. The aim of this study was to molecularly characterize Dictyocaulus lungworm isolates from North American plains bison (Bison bison bison). Fecal samples were collected from 5 wild conservation bison herds located in Iowa, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Montana in 2019 and 2020, and from ranched and feedlot bison from 2 herds in Oklahoma and Texas. First-stage lungworm larvae (L1) were isolated via Baermann technique. Genomic DNA was extracted from L1s of up to 3 samples per herd and followed by PCR and sequencing targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA and the partial cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (cox1) of mitochondrial DNA. Phylogenetic analyses were performed in MEGA x 10.1. Sequences of North American plains bison Dictyocaulus belong to a single, uncharacterized species, clustering in well-supported clades (100% and 100% bootstrap support for ITS2 and cox1, respectively), differing from D. viviparus of cattle in North America and Europe, and European bison (Bison bonasus). Our results contradict previous assumptions regarding parasite identity, highlighting the need for characterization of this species through morphological and molecular methods, elucidating its biology and host range, and potential impact on host health. Further investigation into the biodiversity of Dictyocaulus species infecting bovids and cervids in North America is warranted.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed in dairy buffalo farms representative of Southern Italian farming systems, similar due to several characteristics, with the exception of wheat production. This work evaluated the impacts derived from this management choice, comparing farms with wheat crop (WWC) or not (NWC). In agreement with the literature, economic allocation was chosen as a useful strategy to attribute equivalents to by-products, i.e., culled animals; the same criterion was also adopted to assign pollutants to wheat grain, limited to WWC farms. Environmental impacts in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP, kg CO2 eq), Acidification Potential (AC, g SO2 eq), Eutrophication Potential (EU, g PO(4)(3-)eq), Agricultural Land Occupation (ALO, m(2)y) and Water Depletion (WD, m(3)) were estimated. The production of wheat crop significantly affected (p < 0.05) the Agricultural Land Occupation (ALO) category as WWC farms need adequate land. WWC farms could allow a significant reduction in eutrophication (EU) compared to NWC farms (p < 0.05).

AB  - Ensemble ecosystem models (EEMs) are powerful tools for assessing the impacts of ecological management decisions made under uncertainty. However, their simplicity means they can omit finer-scale spatial interactions and individual-level behaviours, potentially limiting the "what if" scenario experiments available to managers and the ability of EEMs to replicate observed dynamics in relatively data-rich case studies. In this article, we introduce a spatial agent-based model (ABM) to explore the benefits of integrating a more complex model into the EEM framework. The ABM-EEM is used to assess the impacts of rewilding at the Knepp Estate, UK, and predict future ecosystem states under various management intervention scenarios. A wide range of questions is explored, for example, how have species reintroductions impacted the ecosystem, and how might they continue to in the future? What is the chance of wood-pasture habitats being maintained in the long term? Can the addition of new species or changes to stocking densities affect this probability? The ABM-EEM approach had several advantages. Compared with a previous EEM of Knepp, calibrating the ABM-EEM was more efficient and identified a wider range of acceptable outputs. Incorporating space and individual-level dynamics enabled a more nuanced evaluation of the possible impacts of hypothetical European bison or elk reintroductions, and it revealed an emergent behaviour: woodland regenerated more frequently in thorny scrubland when large herbivores were present. Practical implication. While the ABM-EEM approach comes with disadvantages such as higher computational demands and reduced transparency, it shows promise for conservation planning and decision-making, particularly for relatively data-rich case studies that may require a more complex model.

AB  - Skewed sex ratios at birth are widely reported in wild populations, however, the extent to which parents are able to modulate the sex ratio of offspring to maximize their own fitness remains unclear. This is particularly true for highly polytocous species as maximizing fitness may include trade-offs between sex ratio and the size and number of offspring in litters. In such cases, it may be adaptive for mothers to adjust both the number of offspring per litter and offspring sex to maximize individual fitness. Investigating maternal sex allocation in wild pigs (Sus scrofa) under stochastic environmental conditions, we predicted that under favorable conditions, high-quality mothers (larger and older) would produce male-biased litters and invest more in producing larger litters with more males. We also predicted sex ratio would vary relative to litter size, with a male-bias among smaller litters. We found evidence that increasing wild boar ancestry, maternal age and condition, and resource availability may weakly contribute to male-biased sex ratio, however, unknown factors not measured in this study are assumed to be more influential. High-quality mothers allocated more resources to litter production, but this relationship was driven by adjustment of litter size, not sex ratio. There was no relationship between sex ratio and litter size. Collectively, our results emphasized that adjustment of litter size appeared to be the primary reproductive characteristic manipulated in wild pigs to increase fitness rather than adjustment of offspring sex ratio.

AB  - Effective utilization of organic resources to activate residual phosphorus (P) in soil and enhance its availability is crucial for mitigating P resource scarcity and assessing the sustainable use of P in agricultural practices. However, the mechanisms through which organic resources affect soil P conversion via microorganisms and functional genes remain unknown, particularly in long-term organic-inorganic agricultural systems. In this study, we examined the impact of combined organic-inorganic fertilizer application on P availability, carbon (C) and P cycling genes, and microbial communities (bacterial and fungal) in reddish paddy soil based on a 42-year field experiment. The results indicated that long-term straw returning and pig manure application significantly augmented soil organic carbon (SOC), Olsen-P, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP), enzyme-P, and CaCl2-P levels in paddy soils. Furthermore, these practices increased the abundance of soil C degradation genes, reduced the abundance of soil P cycling genes, and altered microbial community structure and network complexity. Notably, Module #3 ecological clusters in the fungal ecological co-occurrence network were significantly correlated with P cycling genes. Finally, our study demonstrated that long-term straw returning and pig manure application in paddy fields facilitated two robust and contrasting predictive relationships between C degradation (negative relationship) and P cycling (positive relationship) genes, respectively, and enzyme-P and HCl-P changes to improve soil P availability. This study can enhance our understanding of the role of soil microbial communities and functional genes in mediating P transformation to decipher the enhancement in P application efficiency driven by organic resources in reddish paddy soils.

AB  - The decomposition of carcasses by scavengers and microbial decomposers is an important component of the biochemical cycle that can strongly alter the chemical composition of soils locally. Different scavenger guilds are assumed to have a different influence on the chemical elements that leak into the soil, although this assumption has not been empirically tested. Here, we experimentally determine how different guilds of vertebrate scavengers influence local nutrient dynamics. We performed a field experiment in which we systematically excluded different subsets of vertebrate scavengers from decomposing carcasses of fallow deer (Dama dama), and compared elemental concentrations in the soil beneath and in the vegetation next to the carcasses over time throughout the decomposition process. We used four exclusion treatments: excluding (1) no scavengers, thus allowing them all; (2) wild boar (Sus scrofa); (3) all mammals; and (4) all mammals and birds. We found that fluxes of several elements into the soil showed distinct peaks when all vertebrates were excluded. Especially, trace elements (Cu and Zn) seemed to be influenced by carcass decomposition. However, we found no differences in fluxes between partial exclusion treatments. Thus, vertebrate scavengers indeed reduce leakage of elements from carcasses into the soil, hence influencing local biochemical cycles, but did so independent of which vertebrate scavenger guild had access. Our results suggest that carcass-derived elements are dispersed over larger areas rather than locally leak into the soil when vertebrate scavengers dominate the decomposition process.

AB  - A fundamental question about the ecology of herbivore populations pertains to the relative influence of biotic and abiotic processes on nutritional condition. Nutritional condition is influenced in important, yet poorly understood, ways by plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) which can adversely affect a herbivore's physiology and energetics. Here we assess the relative influence of various abiotic (weather) and biotic (intraspecific competition, predation risk and diet composition) factors on indicators of nutritional condition and the energetic costs of detoxifying PSMs for the moose population in Isle Royale National Park (USA). Specifically, we observed interannual variation in the ratio of urea nitrogen to creatinine (UN:C), an indicator of nutritional restriction, over 29 years and the ratio of glucuronic acid to creatinine (GA:C), an indicator of energetic investment in detoxifying PSMs, over 19-years. Both UN:C and GA:C were measured in samples of urine-soaked snow. Most importantly, climatic factors explained 66% of the interannual variation in UN:C, with moose being more nutritionally stressed during winters with deep snow and during winters that followed warm summers. None of the biotic factors (density, predation, diet composition) were useful predictors of UN:C or GA:C. The absence of a relationship between diet composition and either UN:C or GA:C suggests that the nutritional ecology of wild herbivores is probably complicated by fine-scale variation in protein content and concentrations of PSMs amongst plants of the same species. UN:C increased with GA:C at both the individual and population-level. That result is consistent with detoxification being energetically costly, such that it impairs nutritional condition and also highlights how spatio-temporal variation in the intake and detoxification of PSMs may influence population dynamics. Lastly, because we observed interannual variation in nutritional condition over three decades and detoxification over two decades these findings are relevant to concerns about how herbivore populations respond to climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Pollination is important for fertilization, setting fruits, seed development and the continuation of the life cycle of plants that eventually provide food for humans, livestock and wildlife. Agronomic practices, use of pesticides, lack of diverse flowering plant species, introduction of invasive plants, loss of habitat, climate change and disease have all led to the decline of important pollinator species. Decline of insect pollinators has increased the importance of accurately monitoring pollinator diversity and abundance over time. Sampling techniques using different color traps are used to sample bees and other insects, but their utility and effectiveness in different ecosystems still need to be determined. In this study, we examined four different colors of pan traps (blue, green, yellow, and purple) for their utility in sampling bees in a livestock pasture ecosystem consisting of native forage species. We analyzed the relative abundance, richness, similarity, and community assemblage patterns associated with aforementioned colors. We found that the blue color traps were the most attractive to bees and were effective for sampling bees in a livestock pasture ecosystem. Purple color traps were the second most effective, followed by yellow and green color traps.
   The decline in insect pollinators has increased the importance of accurately monitoring pollinator diversity and abundance over time. Sampling techniques include the use of passive insect traps such as pan traps, yet there is still discussion over their utility and effectiveness in different ecosystems. The objective was to examine four different colors of pan traps (blue, green, yellow, and purple) for their utility in sampling bees in native forages rotationally grazed by sheep and to compare the relative abundance, richness, similarity, and community assemblage patterns among the four trap colors. Most bees were from the Halictidae family (89%). The most abundant species were Lasioglossum imitatum (42.2%), Augochlorella aurata (8.3%), L. subviridatum (6.8), Agapostemon texanus (6.4), and L. birkmani (4.1%). Blue color traps exhibited the highest rates of bee capture and species accumulation. Purple and yellow colored traps were moderately effective in capturing bees, while the green color pan traps were least effective. Similarly, observed and extrapolated species richness was highest in blue trap, followed by purple, yellow, and green. Notably, the blue trap captured the highest number of unique species, followed by purple, yellow and green traps. Considering the total number of insects collected (including bees and other insects), yellow and green traps captured a significantly higher number of insects than other colored traps. The light reflectance from blue, purple, green and yellow pan traps had peaks at similar to 450, 400, 550, and 600 nm, respectively. Since different insects respond to different light intensities, wavelengths, and reflectivity, these results could be used to guide future trapping protocols targeting certain insect groups in livestock pasture and similar ecosystems.

AB  - Riparo Dalmeri is an Epigravettian high altitude rock shelter, seasonally occupied for specialized ibex hunting. Its occupation pattern indicates the mobility of human groups from the lowlands to the mountains, in order to exploit a territory which is inaccessible during the winter. This work presents the results of the taphonomic study carried out on the bird bone assemblages from Riparo Dalmeri, where birds play a secondary role as an economic resource, when compared to the intense seasonal exploitation of ibex. Despite its small size, the bird bone assemblage still provides valuable ecological information as well as information about anthropic traces con-nected with food exploitation and other resources. The most common human modifications detected on the bird bones are those related to butchery: stone tool cut-marks, fresh bone fracture, peeling, crushing, wrenching, and, more rarely, notches or chop-marks. Localized burning traces have also been detected.

AB  - Sporadic large outbreaks of herbivorous insects alter forest ecosystems via a top-down effect, and a high frequency of outbreaks led to the death of the trees on which the insects fed. The top-down effect of predators, such as other insects and birds, often regulates the outbreaks. Predator insects exert effective top-down control on outbreaks of herbivorous insects, but the effect of bird predation varies because birds have a broader diet range and higher mobility than insects. It was hypothesized that when large insect outbreaks occur during the breeding season of birds, most bird species would not respond owing to a fixed home range during this season and would, therefore, not exert top-down effects. To test this hypothesis, the relationship between bird and beech sawfly abundance was investigated for over nine years in the Tanzawa Mountains of central Japan, where temperate beech forests and large sporadic outbreaks of woody herbivorous insects occur. In this study, 28 649 female beech sawfly adults were captured, and 2515 individuals were identified from 50 bird species. The abundance of most bird species foraging on beech sawfly larvae, except Sitta europaea, did not increase proportionally with the number of beech sawfly adults. Many bird species did not respond to the unpredictable and temporary abundance of food resources in a way that would enhance their density, supporting the hypothesis. These results can be explained by examining the nesting and foraging guilds of the birds. S. europaea is less restricted in nesting sites and nests earlier in the season than other species; therefore, they could select nests in areas where beech sawfly larvae were abundant. Regarding foraging, S. europaea has a unique foot shape that allows it to move down the tree trunk freely and respond rapidly to fluctuations in beech sawfly abundance. Bird species that exert top-down effects on insects show promise for use in an integrated pest management approach to manage sporadic outbreaks of herbivorous insects in forest ecosystems.

AB  - North-East Arctic Siberia inspires interest in Quaternary science because of the poorly known natural and cultural history of this vast territory. The current field research has been prompted by progressing permafrost thaw due to climate warming. Investigations in the central Indigirka area (2014-2021) focusing on fossiliferous Late Pleistocene sites provided new knowledge on relief dynamics and ecosystems during the Last Glacial. Geo-contextual and biotic proxies recovered from stratified yedoma formations in the tributary valleys-Uyandina, Tirekhtyakh, Badyarikha, Ogorokha-document parkland and forest landscapes of meandering channels and marshlands during the MIS 3 interstadial (55,000-24,000 yr BP) analogous to the present-day. Frigid tundra and syngenetic ground ice development characterized the last glacial stadials (MIS 4 and 2) and the second half of the MIS 3 non-glacial. Remains of ungulate and carnivore animals with preserved soft-tissues sealed in permafrost grounds underscore the supreme conservation within the Pleistocene cryolithic contexts. The new data complement the existing records of palaeo-biota and environmental change within the Yana-Kolyma Lowlands. The associated archaeological evidence confirms a very ancient (>50,000 yr) peopling. The early MIS 3 interstadial was clearly the principal Late Pleistocene time span of the Palaeolithic dispersal within the Siberian Arctic.

AB  - Simple Summary Wildlife ecological patterns are driven not only by environmental and biological contexts, but also by landscape-management schemes that shape those contexts. The present study aims to determine the effect of different environmental factors (including management schemes) on the occurrence patterns of a southern African small mammal community. Based on a landscape where three land-use contexts that differ in their levels of human presence and/or where activities coexist (private ecotourism reserve, mixed farms and traditional communal areas), and by using a body-size-based approach (i.e., using two size-based rodent groups-medium and small-as models), we found that the mean relative abundance of medium-sized species did not differ across the management contexts, but small species' mean relative abundance was higher in the game reserve. The overall variation in rodent abundance was negatively affected by ungulate presence (possibly linked to a decrease in food availability) and by human presence (increased disturbance). Rodent abundance seems to be influenced by environmental gradients that are directly linked to varying management priorities across land uses, meaning that these communities might not benefit uniformly by the increased amount of habitat promoted by the commercial wildlife industry. South Africa's decentralized approach to conservation entails that wildlife outside formally protected areas inhabit complex multi-use landscapes, where private wildlife business (ecotourism and/or hunting) co-exist in a human-dominated landscape matrix. Under decentralized conservation, wildlife is perceived to benefit from increased amount of available habitat, however it is crucial to understand how distinct management priorities and associated landscape modifications impact noncharismatic taxa, such as small mammals. We conducted extensive ink-tracking-tunnel surveys to estimate heterogeneity in rodent distribution and investigate the effect of different environmental factors on abundance patterns of two size-based rodent groups (small- and medium-sized species), across three adjacent management contexts in NE KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a private ecotourism game reserve, mixed farms and traditional communal areas (consisting of small clusters of houses interspersed with grazing areas and seminatural vegetation). Our hypotheses were formulated regarding the (1) area typology, (2) vegetation structure, (3) ungulate pressure and (4) human disturbance. Using a boosted-regression-tree approach, we found considerable differences between rodent groups' abundance and distribution, and the underlying environmental factors. The mean relative abundance of medium-sized species did not differ across the three management contexts, but small species mean relative abundance was higher in the game reserves, confirming an influence of the area typology on their abundance. Variation in rodent relative abundance was negatively correlated with human disturbance and ungulate presence. Rodent abundance seems to be influenced by environmental gradients that are directly linked to varying management priorities across land uses, meaning that these communities might not benefit uniformly by the increased amount of habitat promoted by the commercial wildlife industry.

AB  - The conservation and management of wildlife populations, particularly for threatened and endangered species are greatly aided with abundance, growth rate, and density measures. Traditional methods of estimating abundance and related metrics represent trade-offs in effort and precision of estimates. Pedigree reconstruction is an emerging, attractive alternate approach because its use of one-time, noninvasive sampling of individuals to infer the existence of unsampled individuals. However, advances in pedigree reconstruction could improve its utility, including forming a measure of precision for the method, establishing required spatial sampling effort for accurate estimates, ascertaining the spatial extent of abundance estimates derived from pedigree reconstruction, and assessing how population density affects the estimator's performance. Using established relationships for a stochastic, spatially explicit simulated moose (Alces americanus) population, pedigree reconstruction provided accurate estimates of the adult moose population size and trend. Novel bootstrapped confidence intervals performed as expected with intensive sampling but underperformed with moderate sampling efforts that could produce abundance estimates with low bias. Adult population estimates more closely reflected the total number of adults in the extant population, rather than number of adults inhabiting the area where sampling occurred. Increasing sampling effort, measured as the proportion of individuals sampled and as the proportion of a hypothetical study area, yielded similar asymptotic patterns over time. Simulations indicated a positive relationship between animal density and sampling effort required for unbiased estimates. These results indicate that pedigree reconstruction can produce accurate abundance estimates and may be particularly valuable for surveying smaller areas and low-density populations.

AB  - The technology of slope vegetation system stability enhancement is an important part of the comprehensive ecological security improvement in small watersheds area of the Loess Plateau. The results of the comprehensive soil erosion improvement in the sub-basin are used to give an evaluation of the effectiveness of the gully slope vegetation restoration project. Soil erosion quantification distribution in the Sheep Sap Gully sub-basin of the Loess Plateau hilly gully area was simulated and explored by combining the modified universal soil loss equation RUSLE model with GIS and RS spatial information technology. The quantitative values of LS factor were extracted using DEM data, the R factor of rainfall erosion force was calculated using meteorological monitoring station data around this region, the K factor of erosion resistance was obtained based on the soil survey database, and the C factor and P factor of soil and water conservation measures were obtained by combining MODIS image data and previous research experience. The study concluded that (1) The erosion area ratio within the study area is 36.33%; (2) The quantitative grading standard of the pattern, the size of the erosion distribution area at all levels is ranked as light>moderate>very strong>strong>intense; (3) Under the conditions of land use and vegetation cover, strong erosion is mostly found in farming areas with sparse vegetation, while weak erosion is found in areas with lush vegetation such as forests and grasslands; (4) In terms of spatial distribution, erosion is greater in the south-western part of the basin than in the north-eastern part, and there is also strong erosion in the south-western part. The results of the study provide a reference for research into integration and synthesis of ecological security technologies for gully and slope management projects. The research content provides the basis and support for watershed governance and soil and water resource management and conservation.

AB  - The number of non-native invasive pests and pathogens has increased dramatically in recent years, with disastrous consequences for the health of forests worldwide. Multiple studies have shown that mixed forests may suffer less damage from insect pests than single species forest. This "associational resistance" can be notably explained by the fact that heterospecific neighbours make it more difficult for herbivores to locate and then exploit their host tree. However, the validity of these findings in the case of non-native, invasive pests and pathogens remains to be demonstrated. In this study, we monitored over two hundred Douglas firs in pure and mixed plots of a tree diversity experiment to assess the damage from the non-native gall midge Contarinia pseudotsugae and the non-native needle cast Nothophaeocryptopus gaeumannii. The probability of Swiss needle-cast infection was lower in Douglas fir trees surrounded by heterospecific neighbours. Gall midge damage was lower on Douglas firs surrounded by taller neighbours, consistent with the hypothesis of reduced host Apparency. Douglas fir trees that were more damaged by C. pseudotsugae were also more often infected by N. gaeumannii. Our study thus provides partial support of the associational resistance hypothesis of mixed forests against exotic pests and pathogens. Promoting forest species diversity at the stand level could, therefore, offer interesting prospects for reducing the im-pact of biological invasions, especially those involving both pests and pathogens.

AB  - In shared environments, where different species interact depending on overlapping resources, complex interspecific interactions emerge, with human activities impacting these dynamics and influencing wildlife abundance and distribution. In the Alps, the presence of multiple species of ungulates, such as roe deer and red deer, and a predator, the wolf, creates a web of spatial and behavioral interactions in an area where farming, hunting and tourism have persisted over time, with tourism recently experiencing a substantial growth. Accounting for these multiple interactions, we modelled the co-occurrence probabilities of roe deer, red deer and wolves in an area of the Maritime Alps using data derived from 60 camera traps. We applied multi-species occupancy models to investigate (i) the role of species co-occurrences in explaining the occupancy of model species across the landscape, (ii) the role of human presence and activities on species occupancy and (iii) the potential effect of the hunting season on the species detection probabilities. Among the identified species, roe deer reported the highest frequency of recorded events and were the most widespread species. We provided important evidence of interspecific dependence, revealing that pairwise interactions among species had a greater impact than only considering individual environmental effects. We documented that the setting of cameras on trails increased the likelihood of detecting wolves but decreased the likelihood of detecting ungulates. Most importantly, the hunting season significantly reduced the likelihood of capturing roe deer, while having no effect on either red deer or wolves. Our results confirmed the relevance of including prey, predators, and human dynamics as a whole. Since the sharing of habitat makes human activities significantly important in defining predator-prey mechanisms, our insights are particularly relevant for defining solutions to optimize human-wildlife coexistence, especially in a highly anthropogenic system such as Europe.

AB  - Plastic pollution is ubiquitous and not even remote protected islands are safe from it. Floating debris can adsorb toxic compounds that concentrate on their surface, being available to the animals that ingest them. For this reason, a baseline study of plastic pollution was conducted in the remote Revillagigedo Archipelago, in the Mexican Pacific Ocean. In 47 manta net samples an average of 4.8 plastics/1000m2 was found, 73% of the pieces being <5 mm. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the most common polymers found. The chemical analysis of organic pollutants revealed that organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls are adsorbed on the plastics collected in the area. Filter feeding megafauna such as humpback whales, manta rays and whale sharks could ingest contaminated micro and macroplastics. Plastics were found also on the beach, where they are available to the ingestion by terrestrial animals, including endemic species endangered to extinction.

AB  - Predicting changes in suitable areas under climate and land use changes, and identifying persistent suitable areas for economically valuable plant species, are critical for future conservation and cultivation. Camellia chekiangoleosa, Camellia drupifera, Camellia oleifera and Camellia reticulata serve as important woody oilseed species in China, providing both economic and ecological benefits. Here, we predict the distributions of the four species under climate and land use changes (SSP126, SSP245 and SSP585 in 2070) combining two dispersal constraint scenarios (full dispersal and 20 km/decade) by using ensemble species distribution models. The results showed that the current potential suitable areas of the four species coincided with their current known distribution regions; most of these areas are of high suitability. Among the environmental variables, climatic factors have stronger effects on the distribution of the four species than land use factors. In response to climate and land use changes, the range sizes of C. chekiangoleosa and C. drupifera were projected to increase, while for C. oleifera and C. reticulata the range would contract. In addition, the centroid of the suitable range would shift in different directions and distances for different species. As a result of distinctive range shifts, the studied species have their own specific areas of persistent suitability in southern China. Notably, except for the widespread C. oleifera, there is almost no overlap in the persistent suitable areas among the other three species. This study gives us a better understanding of the impact of climate and land use changes on the major Camellia oilseed species in China, thus guiding the selection of sites for oil tea plantations and the conservation of germplasm resources.

AB  - Ecological processes at local to global scales impact spatial patterns in abundance and distribution of megafauna. Fine-scale patterns have rarely been investigated through explicitly spatial analytical methods in the deep sea and have been assumed random, uniform, or similar to neighbouring areas. We used spatial statistics (Moran's I, Gi*, and local Moran's I) to identify significant megafaunal patterns (0-100s of meters; 8 focal taxa) in the Laurentian Channel Marine Protected Area, based on imagery from a remotely operated vehicle, using 8 parallel transects at each of 7 stations. Our results included 2 spatial scales, station level (0.256 km2) and paired transect level (0.004 km2). We found local areas with significant aggregations (e.g., Pennatula sp. 2 and Hexacorallia (SC.) spp.) and patches extending for -7-27 m, and in one case for -155 m. Patchiness also existed between neighbouring images (<= 10 m apart). Patterns varied among taxa within stations and for the same taxon among transect pairs. Station-level patterns appear to be related to geological factors, such as BPI (bathymetric position index), benthoscape, pockmarks, and slope. We propose that patterns at the transect level were likely caused by biological factors, possibly related to reproduction due to local currents and retention, or community interactions (e.g., competition). Fine-scale patterns should be considered to ensure effective sampling designs when using fine-scale tools (e.g., imagery), and for establishing accurate community metrics (e.g., abundance and diversity). Our study is relevant to future ecological research, linking patterns to processes, as well as monitoring and conservation in deep-sea ecosystems.

AB  - This study proposes monitoring methods of wild boars in plains or mountain forest areas using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with infrared cameras. It is recommended to monitor in winter when the canopy layer is thin and the temperature difference between the ambient temperature and the body temperature of the wild boar is distinct, so that the infrared camera can better detect the wild boars. In flat land, the plane movement of the UAV can be easily monitored using the line transect, the point count survey, the plot sampling method, and the belted transect. In the mountain forest, there are variations in elevation due to slopes. Therefore, we introduced the WAYPOINT function to reflect the difference in altitude. After the investigator designates the waypoint, various information can be modified according to the terrain, and the WAYPOINT can be transmitted to other UAVs, so the utilization is high. In this method, once a route is created using the WAYPOINT, there is no need for additional operation after the start of the flight, and it helps to re-monitor the site by using the WAYPOINT record repeatedly. Therefore, this technical note provides a more repeatedly sustainable and scalable monitoring method than the conventional UAV method.

AB  - The present study used molecular and morphological approaches to investigate hidden diversity within the Hippopotamyrus ansorgii species complex in southern Africa. Phylogenetic reconstructions and three species delimitation methods based on two mitochondrial markers (cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase I) and one nuclear marker (S7) revealed 12 Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs), with two of them representing two recently described species, Hippopotamyrus longilateralis and Hippopotamyrus szaboi. The highest diversity occurred in the Kwanza River system, which contained five MOTUs, and the Upper Zambezi River system that had two MOTUs. Five other river systems contained a single MOTU each. A major impediment to the review of this complex has been the uncertainty surrounding the type locality of the specimens that were used for the description of H. ansorgii. The present study has, through a careful examination of published literature and synthesis of information on the travel activities of Dr. William Ansorge who collected the specimens, identified the Kwanza River system as the most plausible source of the syntypes. The resolution of the type locality of H. ansorgii facilitates future work on the review of this complex which is critical for providing reliable biodiversity estimates, identifying effective conservation management strategies and understanding the evolutionary history and biogeographic patterns of the fishes of this region.

AB  - The evolutionary history of African ungulates has been explained largely in the light of Pleistocene climatic oscillations and the way these influenced the distribution of vegetation types, leading to range expansions and/or isolation in refugia. In contrast, comparatively fewer studies have addressed the continent's environmental heterogeneity and the role played by its geomorphological barriers. In this study, we performed a range-wide analysis of complete mitogenomes of sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) to explore how these different factors may have contributed as drivers of evolution in southcentral Africa. Our results supported two sympatric and deeply divergent mitochondrial lineages in west Tanzanian sables, which can be explained as the result of introgressive hybridization of a mitochondrial ghost lineage from an archaic, as-yet-undefined, congener. Phylogeographical subdivisions into three main lineages suggest that sable diversification may not have been driven solely by climatic events affecting populations differently across a continental scale. Often in interplay with climate, geomorphological features have also clearly shaped the species' patterns of vicariance, where the East Africa Rift System and the Eastern Arc Mountains acted as geological barriers. Subsequent splits among southern populations may be linked to rearrangements in the Zambezi system, possibly framing the most recent time when the river attained its current drainage profile. This work underlines how the use of comprehensive mitogenomic data sets on a model species with a wide geographical distribution can contribute to a much-enhanced understanding of environmental, geomorphological and evolutionary patterns in Africa throughout the Quaternary.

AB  - Biodiversity loss is a consequence of socio-ecological processes. Observations on anthropogenic actions toward ecosystems coupled to observations on ecosystem metrics are needed to help understand these processes so that ecosystem management policies can be derived and implemented to curb such destruction. Such data needs to be maintained in searchable data portals. To this end, this article delivers a first-of-its-kind relational database of observations on coupled anthropogenic and ecosystem actions. This Ecosystem Management Actions Taxonomy (EMAT) database is founded on a taxonomy designed to support models of political-ecological processes. Structured query language scripts for building and querying these databases are described. The use of episodes in the construction of political-ecological theory is also introduced. These are frequently occurring sequences of political-ecological actions. Those episodes that test positive for causality can aid in improving a political-ecological theory by driving modifications to an attendant computational model so that it generates them. Two relational databases of political-ecological actions are described that are built from online news articles and published data on species abundance. The first concerns the management of the East African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) population, and the second is focused on the management of rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) in South Africa. The cheetah database is used to study the political drivers of cheetah habitat loss, and the rhino database is used study the political drivers of rhino poaching. An EMAT database is a fundamental breakthrough because is provides a language for conservation science to identify the objects and phenomena that it is about. Therefore, maintaining political-ecological data in EMAT databases will advance conservation science and consequently, improve management policies that are based on that science.

AB  - Holothurians are the dominant megabenthic deposit feeders in the Peru Basin (SE Pacific) and feed to various degrees of selectivity on a heterogenous pool of sedimentary detritus, but drivers of feeding selectivity and diet preferences for most holothurian species are unknown. This study reconstructs the diets of 13 holothurian species of the orders Elasipodida, Holothuriida, and Synallactida. Bulk stable isotope analyses (delta 13C, delta 15N) of holothurian body wall and gut wall tissues, gut contents, and feces were combined with compound-specific stable isotope analyses of amino acids, phospholipid-derived fatty acids, and neutral-lipid-derived fatty acids in the body wall. We further assessed how holothurians in the Peru Basin partition their resources and calculated how much of the daily particulate organic carbon (POC) flux to the area is ingested by them using information about gut contents of nine species. To assess the dependence of holothurians on fresh phytodetritus, we performed in situ pulse-chase experiments using 13C- and 15N-enriched phytodetritus. By measuring the uptake of this phytodetritus in fatty acids and amino acids and by comparing it with the presence of these compounds in the sediment, we calculated net accumulation and net deficiency for specific fatty acids and amino acids and discussed how climate change might affect the dependence on specific compounds. A Sorensen-Dice coefficient-based cluster analysis using data from trophic levels, levels of heterotrophic re-synthesis of amino acids, feeding selectivity, and food sources/diet suggested two major trophic groups with two optional subgroups each. Species-specific traits of locomotion, tentacle morphology, and gut structure likely allow resource partitioning and differences in selectivity among the holothurians, of which a subpopulation of 65% of all specimens can ingest 4 to 27% of the daily POC flux to the Peru Basin. Holothurians are specifically dependent on the uptake of arachidonic acid from phytodetritus, while most essential amino acids are available in the Peru Basin in sufficient concentrations.

AB  - This paper presents the results of research conducted on chasmophytic vegetation occurring within the alpine belt (approx. 1,850-4,000 m a.s.l.) in the eastern part of Middle Asia. We specifically focused on the diversity and syntaxonomy of rock vegetation as well as on environmental variables determining its distribution. Altogether, 242 releves were sampled in rock fissures, ledges, and clefts during field surveys conducted in 2013-2019. The size of each recorded vegetation plot was 1 m(2). Five main groups of chasmophytic vegetation were distinguished in the studied area. Each group was confined to a specific combination of substrate type and climatic conditions. Altogether, 16 specific plant communities representing chasmophytic vegetation were defined in the study area. For each community diagnostic, constant and dominant species as well as its taxonomic composition and habitat characteristics are given. Seven communities were described: community of Androsace villosa var. dasyphylla, and associations of Crepidifolio tenuifolii-Stipetum tianschanicae, Parryetum schugnanae, Corydalideto bucharicae-Hippolytietum schugnanicae, Drabetum darvasicae, Acantholimonetum alexeenkoani, and Inuletum schmalhausenii are newly coined. Due to the extremely high endemism of the chasmophytic flora of the eastern part of Middle Asia, it is difficult to find strong relationships between the rock vegetation recorded in the region and that occurring in neighboring areas.

AB  - Plant pathogens are often hypothesized to promote species coexistence by generating conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). However, the relative importance of fungal versus oomycete pathogens in maintaining plant species coexistence and community composition remains unresolved, despite their recognized effects on plant performance. Here, we use fungicide application to investigate how fungal versus oomycete pathogens affect plant species coexistence in an alpine meadow. We found that the severity of foliar fungal disease was density-dependent at both intra- and interspecific levels. Fungal pathogen-exclusion treatment successfully decreased the severity of foliar fungal diseases, with no detectable effects on root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or on soil chemical properties. Fungal pathogens were important factors shaping CNDD across 25 coexisting plant species. Exclusion of fungal pathogens significantly reduced plant species richness and Shannon's evenness. Treatments that excluded fungal pathogens also led to significant shifts in plant community composition toward more Poaceae and Cyperaceae. These results indicate that fungal pathogens, especially those affecting aboveground plant parts, may play a larger role in maintaining species coexistence and shaping community composition than has been previously recognized.

AB  - The future of reproductive biotechnologies in water buffalo in Southeast Asian countries holds significant promise for enhancing genetic quality and productivity. Fixed-time artificial insemination remains the commonly used technology, with advances in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro embryo production (IVEP), embryo transfer (ET), and the use of sex-sorted sperm increasingly adopted to improve breeding efficiency. These technologies overcome traditional breeding limitations, such as low reproductive rates, genetic diversity constraints, and the production of sex-predetermined offspring. The application of multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) is constrained by poor embryo recovery in this livestock species. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) offers great potential for producing sex-predetermined and genetically superior buffalo but requires further research to increase efficiency. Cryopreservation of buffalo genetics is bolstered by the establishment of Gene Banks. Challenges such as high costs, the need for skilled personnel, and infrastructure development remain constraints. Integration of genomic selection, automation, and expansion of ET programs are clear directions. Strengthening research and collaboration among Southeast Asian countries is essential to fully realize the benefits of these biotechnologies and ensure sustainable and profitable buffalo farming.

AB  - This paper describes the results of research at Volchia Griva, the largest site in Asia containing mammoth fauna in situ. It is situated in the south of the West Siberian Plain in the Baraba forest-steppe zone, and occupies an area of several hectares. Analysis of sediments and taphonomy of the site allows us to suggest that thousands of megafaunal remains were buried here in mud pits and erosional depressions. The favorable geochemical landscape of Volchia Griva attracted animals during periods of mineral starvation. This is reflected in the high mortality in two intervals, ca. 20-18 C-14 ka BP and ca. 17-11 C-14 ka BP. The results of palynological analysis of samples from the upper part of the Volchia Griva section made it possible to reconstruct the history of landscape changes of the Baraba Lowland during the MIS 2. Forb-mesophytic meadows were common at the beginning of this period, with taiga type forests. At ca. 20 C-14 ka BP, an abrupt and significant aridization of the climate occurred, which led to the degradation of forests. The mammoth steppe was widely developed, dominated by forb-grass association and with areas of alkali meadows and soils. Such conditions existed probably until the mid-Holocene.

AB  - Top-down effects of predators and bottom-up effects of resources are important drivers of community structure and function in a wide array of ecosystems. Fertilization experiments impose variation in resource availability that can mediate the strength of predator impacts, but the prevalence of such interactions across natural productivity gradients is less clear. We studied the joint impacts of top-down and bottom-up factors in a tropical mangrove forest system, leveraging fine-grained patchiness in resource availability and primary productivity on coastal cays of Belize. We excluded birds from canopies of red mangrove (Rhizophoraceae: Rhizophora mangle) for 13 months in zones of phosphorus-limited, stunted dwarf mangroves, and in adjacent zones of vigorous mangroves that receive detrital subsidies. Birds decreased total arthropod densities by 62%, herbivore densities more than fivefold, and reduced rates of leaf and bud herbivory by 45% and 52%, respectively. Despite similar arthropod densities across both zones of productivity, leaf and bud damage were 2.0 and 4.3 times greater in productive stands. Detrital subsidies strongly impacted a suite of plant traits in productive stands, potentially making leaves more nutritious and vulnerable to damage. Despite consistently strong impacts on herbivory, we did not detect top-down forcing that impacted mangrove growth, which was similar with and without birds. Our results indicated that both top-down and bottom-up forces drive arthropod community dynamics, but attenuation at the plant-herbivore interface weakens top-down control by avian insectivores.

AB  - Forensic entomology is an important component of criminal investigations, providing information surrounding a death using region-specific data on the local necrophagous community. To understand the community within the Metro Vancouver region of British Columbia, Canada, a field study monitored the abundance and diversity of necrophagous Calliphoridae (Diptera) over a nine-month period in distinct terrestrial environments. Baited bottle traps (n = 9) were deployed weekly for 12-hour intervals in three different environments. Species, sex, and gravidity of collected specimens were determined. Bivariate analyses revealed significant relationships between species, geographic location, and month of collection, suggesting that Calliphoridae species composition is influenced by habitat type and seasonal shifts in temperature. Sex ratios and reproductive ranges of Calliphoridae differed among the habitats sampled.

AB  - African forests have been negatively affected because of human impacts. The use of forest products is high for lower-income communities. Excessive logging alters the forest patch structure and composition, causing degradation. In addition, increases in bushmeat hunting for sustenance and trade result in increased pressures on forest mammalian species. We investigated forest use by rural communities residing around forest patches in uMthatha, Eastern Cape, and iNgeli and Creighton, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We selected villages to conduct interviews based on their proximity to forest patches sampled during our camera trap surveys (May 2018 - June 2019). We conducted 303 interviews using semi-structured questionnaires and analysed these. A higher proportion of respondents (38%, n = 117) conveyed that the forest extent increased over ten years, mainly because the settlement residents did not use the forest often. Afrocarpus falcatus and Ptaeroxylon obliquum were the preferred native tree species to be logged because of their sturdiness and durability for building structures and fencing. The most hunted mammalian species included the southern bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia). The most significant reason for residents hunting was for consumption, followed by financial gain. According to respondents, ungulates are the most frequently targeted for consumption in lower-income settlements and are an important source of protein. Some participants in our study expressed that mammalian species' numbers are dwindling because of people overhunting. An emerging trend in our study was the high cultural importance placed on the forest. Forest resources are more likely to be used sustainably if appropriate measures such as capacity building for security guards as well as clear rules and regulations about hunting and plant harvesting are applied. Incorporating socio-economic aspects into ecological management is of benefit for forest conservation.

AB  - Northern shrimp Pandalus borealis occur throughout Canada's Atlantic Ocean, where they are thought to form a single population spanning from Baffin Bay to the tail of the Grand Bank. Here, they play an important role in the ecosystem as prey for many taxa and have been targeted by a lucrative large-scale fishery since the 1970s. Yet, we still understand little about which (and how) ecosystem and environmental factors influence their distribution and abundance. We used survey data collected over 29 yr throughout 23 degrees of latitude to develop a spatiotemporal model predicting northern shrimp density. We confirmed that both top-down drivers (e.g. predation pressure), as well as bottom-up drivers (e.g. bottom temperature) play important roles in determining both the presence and abundance of northern shrimp. The model was used to predict the density of northern shrimp throughout the entire study area from 2005 to 2022. Our results highlight the importance of understanding ecosystem and environmental dynamics in relation to northern shrimp population patterns and trends within resource assessments.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate warming affects plant communities by changing community structure and function. Studies on climate warming have primarily focused on individual effects of warming, but the interactive effects of warming with biotic factors could be at least as important in community responses to climate change. In addition, climate change experiments spanning multiple years are necessary to capture interannual variability and detect the influence of these effects within ecological communities. Our study explores the individual and interactive effects of warming and insect herbivory on plant traits and community responses within a 7-year warming and herbivory manipulation experiment in two early successional plant communities in Michigan, USA. We find stronger support for the individual effects of both warming and herbivory on multiple plant morphological and phenological traits; only the timing of plant green-up and seed set demonstrated an interactive effect between warming and herbivory. With herbivory, warming advanced green-up, but with reduced herbivory, there was no significant effect of warming. In contrast, warming increased plant biomass, but the effect of warming on biomass did not depend upon the level of insect herbivores. We found that these treatments had stronger effects in some years than others, highlighting the need for multiyear experiments. This study demonstrates that warming and herbivory can have strong direct effects on plant communities, but that their interactive effects are limited in these early successional systems. Because the strength and direction of these effects can vary by ecological context, it is still advisable to include levels of biotic interactions, multiple traits and years, and community type when studying climate change effects on plants and their communities.

AB  - Syngnathids are vulnerable fishes closely associated with seaweeds and seagrass, which provide shelter and food resources. Even though most syngnathids commonly feed on small crustaceans, the feeding regimes may differ depending on the species and prey availability. This is the first monitoring study to explain syngnathid abundances and dietary regimes within macroalgal beds in Cies Archipelago (Atlantic Islands Marine National Park, North West Iberian Peninsula). We sampled the epifaunal assemblages in seaweed communities dominated by the canopy-forming macroalgae Gongolaria baccata and Codium spp. seasonally during 2 years. The epifaunal structure was mostly represented by harpacticoid copepods, amphipods (especially gammarids) and gastropods. Epifauna exhibited low plant-host specificity and a higher dominance of amphipods on the more structurally complex macroalgae G. baccata. The epifaunal assemblages and syngnathid specimens were assessed for trophic structure using stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15). The three syngnathids (Hippocampus guttulatus, Syngnathus acus, and Entelurus aequoreus) inhabiting Cies Archipelago were sympatric. They occupied highly similar trophic positions (TPs), but differed in niche size, in such a way that the snake pipefish E. aequoreus would likely feed on smaller prey. The assessment of the feeding regime in the dominant great pipefish S. acus revealed that amphipods mostly contributed to bulk diet, followed by isopods, carideans, and copepods, whereas mysidaceans were not highly consumed. Seasonal changes in both epifaunal structure and syngnathids abundance confirmed that syngnathids are seasonal residents in Cies Archipelago, migrating to other areas in autumn when the seaweed cover is drastically reduced and the epifaunal structure modified. This study showed the importance of Gongolaria assemblages in Cies Archipelago, providing rich dietary sources and potentially contributing to higher abundances and diversity of syngnathids. Ongoing cover reduction in Gongolaria assemblages in certain regions (e.g., Mediterranean) should be considered a potential ecological concern for syngnathids and accompanying fauna, requiring further investigations.

AB  - Sexual selection is thought to be an important driver of adaptation, speciation and extinction. Empirically testing these predictions across macroevolutionary timescales first requires an understanding of the morphology of secondary sexual traits in extant taxa. We used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyse a large sample of the skull of the blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, in which horns are found in both sexes but only used in intrasexual competition in males. We show that the horns fit several predictions of secondary sexual traits; overall skull shape is significantly correlated with size (R-2 = 0.38, p = 0.001), and the sexually selected horns show drastically higher growth rates and variation than any other skull element, supporting previous findings. We also find that despite showing significant sexual dimorphism in shape and size (R-2 = 0.21, p = 0.001), allometric growth trajectories of sexes are identical (R-2 = 0.01, p = 0.635) and dimorphism is not readily detectable without prior knowledge of sex, and is not possible when shape is corrected for size. Our results show that even with strong sexual selection operating in only one sex, the expression of secondary sexual traits may show characteristic and indistinguishable patterns of growth and variance in both sexes.

AB  - Interest in oak species in European forestry has been increasing as they are regarded as having high ability to cope with accelerating anticipated climate changes during the next 50 years. However, improvements in regeneration and silvicultural methods are needed due to oak stands' high management costs and vulnerability to browsing. Thus, three methods of establishing oak stands were compared in terms of effects on growth and browsing damage in an area of north-eastern Poland with high browsing pressure of roe and red deer. The treatments were traditional monoculture, double-row planting and group planting, each at initial planting densities of 6600, 3300 and 2400 seedling per hectare. Three precommercial thinnings (PCTs) were applied in each planting treatment to reduce competition from early successional species: traditional removal close to the ground in spring, topping in spring and topping in summer. Observed frequencies of oak saplings damaged by browsing depended on both the planting method and PCT treatment. The frequencies were lower under group planting than under the traditional and double-row planting treatments. The frequencies also decreased with increases in the oaks' height. The results indicate that the optimal PCT treatment to minimise browsing damage depends on the planting pattern. The lowest frequency of damage was in plots where group or double-row planting was combined with spring topping and traditional planting was combined with summer topping. Under heavy herbivory pressure, group planting might be optimal due to its potential to both reduce browsing damage and improve profitability by eliminating fencing costs.

AB  - The seagrass ecosystem is among the most efficient natural carbon sinks that can contribute to climate change mitigation. However, little is known about the effects of coastal nutrient enrichment caused by anthropogenic activities and/or climate change on the capacity of the seagrass blue carbon sink. Our experimental manipulations of sediment nutrient enrichment shifted the blue carbon sink capabilities of seagrass meadows. Sediment nutrient enrichment significantly increased the nutrient content of seagrass litter, stimulating the decomposition of rhizome + root litter by similar to 10% while retarding the decomposition of leaf litter by similar to 5%. Sediment N + P enrichment increased seagrass growth and litter production, while enrichment of N or P alone did not. Organic carbon (C-org) stocks in the surface sediments (0-5 cm) were 34% higher than those in the control with N + P enrichment due to high litter production and the low decomposition rate of nutrient-enriched leaf litter. However, C-org stocks in the subsurface sediments (5-20 cm) did not increase with sediment nutrient enrichment, which is likely due to accelerated decomposition of rhizome + root litter. Our findings suggest that nutrient loading in coastal sediments alters the blue carbon sink and storage capacities in seagrass meadows by changing the rates of carbon sequestration and decomposition.

AB  - Purpose The discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) has revolutionized the traditional understanding of two-step nitrification. However, little is known about the ecological niches and environmental driving factors of comammox Nitrospira in acidic tea plantation ecosystems. Methods We investigated the occurrence and community composition of comammox Nitrospira in a typical acidic tea plantation soil in Anji County, China. This was achieved through a combination of microcosm incubation, addition of specific nitrification inhibitors, molecular biology assays, phylogenetic analysis based on functional gene sequences, and statistical correlation with soil chemical properties. We compared comammox Nitrospira with ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) and evaluated the combined or individual impacts of soil pH gradients and/or chlorate and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Results Quantitative analysis showed that AOA were the dominant ammonia oxidizers. Comammox Nitrospira were detected in all tested soils across three pH gradients, exhibiting greater gene abundance than AOB, and were significantly reduced by both chlorate and DMPP. Clade A2 comammox Nitrospira comprised the majority groups, with operational taxonomic units (OTUs) 547, 526, and 521 emerging as the dominant floras. The abundance of comammox Nitrospira was mainly affected by pH and ammonium concentrations. AOB abundance, nitrate contents, and AOA abundance were identified as vital factors affecting the comammox Nitrospira community under control, chlorate-added, and DMPP-added conditions, respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated the presence and biodiversity of comammox Nitrospira in tea plantation soils with different pH gradients, indicating that comammox Nitrospira may play a significant and previously underestimated role in microbial nitrification in strongly acidic tea soils.

AB  - Understanding the social feasibility of wildlife conservation approaches is essential to reducing social conflicts over wildlife and public backlash toward wildlife agencies and organizations. The Potential for Conflict Index(2) (PCI2) and geospatial analyses of conflict can help wildlife practitioners strategically engage their publics, but these two tools have yet to be combined. Using data from a 2021 survey about white-tailed deer in Indiana (n = 1806), we analyzed conflict levels among stakeholder self-identities and political ideologies regarding the acceptability of six possible management methods, three lethal and three nonlethal. We then conducted a hotspot analysis of gridded PCI2 values to map areas of high and low social conflicts across the state. Conflict potentials showed more consistent covariation with political ideologies than with stakeholder self-identities, aligning with urban-rural divides in wildlife experiences. Data on political leanings and residency may thus be more reliable than stakeholder categories to predict social conflicts over wildlife management. Hotspots of conflict over lethal methods clustered around urban areas, indicating that agencies should focus on engaging urban residents about deer management. Our conflict hotspots can be combined with other spatial data to create social units of analysis, which can help practitioners develop targeted and socially accepted strategies for wildlife conservation and management.

AB  - Tree shelters are used in forestry to prevent large herbivores from browsing on young trees. Although tree shelters can generally prevent browsing damage while the young trees are within the tree shelters, they have been observed to fail in some cases. In this study, to clarify the protective capacity of tree shelters against damage due to deer browsing, the condition of tree shelters on planted Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) seedlings 2 to 7 years after installation was investigated at 42 sites in southwestern Japan where the density of sika deer (Cervus nippon) is high. The results showed that tree shelters failed for three reasons. Firstly, the shelter had collapsed or incline and could no longer protect the saplings within. Secondly, the saplings in the shelters died relatively shortly after they were planted. Thirdly, and possibly most importantly, the saplings are browsed upon by deer after they extended beyond the top of the shelter. Since there was no correlation between the damage rate and the number of years after planting, it is likely that the damage occurred immediately after the young trees protruded form the shelter. Shelters with a height of only 140 cm, which are widely used in Japan, may be too short to completely prevent herbivory damage by deer.

AB  - In China, the treatment of pig manure for land application is an important issue. In this paper, green synthesized iron nanoparticles (G-nFe) were evaluated for their effectiveness in the aerobic composting of pig manure. G-nFe were evenly mixed into the compost, and the pH and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of the compost in the presence of G-nFe both decreased. FTIR showed that G-nFe promoted the formation of humus during composting. The addition of G-nFe (200 mL kg(-1)) to the compost also promoted bacterial growth, significantly increasing the colony-forming units (CFU, up to 25.6 x 10(4) CFU mL(-1)) and OD600 (up to 0.634) in 5 days. Furthermore, G-nFe promoted the fermentation of the pig manure, thus reducing the phytotoxicity of the compost produced. For example, the final volatile solids (VS) degradation rate and seed germination index (GI) of the compost were the highest and reached 20.8% and 0.76%, respectively. Finally, G-nFe improved both the bacterial diversity and community richness of the compost. This indicated that the addition of G-nFe could result in the prolonging of the acidic fermentation time during composting, leading to increased compost maturity. Overall, the beneficial impact of G-nFe on compost was far greater than the potential harm to bacterial communities in the compost and perceived phytotoxicity.

AB  - CO2-fertilisation is implicated in the widespread and significant woody encroachment of savannas due to CO2-stimulated increases in below-ground reserves that enhance sapling regrowth after fire. However, the effect of CO2 concentration ([CO2]) on tree responses to the other major disturbance in savannas, herbivory, is poorly understood. Herbivory responses cannot be predicted from fire responses, as herbivore effects occur earlier during establishment and are moderated by plant palatability and defence rather than below-ground carbon accumulation. The relationship between herbivory and [CO2] is explored here using a widespread, strongly encroaching savanna tree, Vachellia karroo. Using greenhouse-grown seedlings under past-through to predicted future-[CO2] (180-1000 ppm) and field-grown seedlings under ambient [CO2], we assessed plant survival, growth, defence and palatability. Increasing [CO2] improves the tolerance of greenhouse-grown seedlings to herbivory by stimulating growth and allowing a critical size threshold associated with survival to be reached earlier, thereby decreasing the probability of fatal herbivory during the vulnerable recruitment phase. Elevated [CO2] also decreases the time taken to reach a second size threshold linked to accelerated recovery of field-grown seedlings following herbivory. Seedling growth responses to increasing [CO2] are nonlinear, suggesting that historic growth and survival enhancements are smaller than those predicted for the future. Increasing [CO2] is associated with greater resistance to herbivores (more branched shoot architecture) but not leaf palatability (C:N ratio) or defence (leaf tannins and spine density). Increasing V. karroo densities already constitute a major land management problem in southern African savannas. However, encroachment by this species, and likely other savanna tree species, may be greatly exacerbated under future [CO2], as tolerance to herbivory at the recruitment stage is further enhanced.

AB  - The southern Brazilian Pleistocene fauna exhibited a rich diversity of large mammalian herbivores, which are now extinct or locally extinct. In this study, we employed stable isotope analysis to investigate the past ecology of these animals. Specifically, we examined the carbonate fraction of bones and teeth and utilized compiled carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios from previous research publications. The delta 13C values indicated that most specimens inhabited grassland environments, which aligns with environmental reconstructions based on pollen records of the "Campos" region. The dominant food resource for these herbivores consisted of C3 photosynthesizers, mainly cool-season grasses. This preference can be attributed to the higher abundance and nutritional quality of cool-season grasses compared with warm-season grasses employing C4 photosynthesis. The variability in delta 18O values within and between taxa may suggest a seasonal climate. Based on these findings, we conclude that the environmental changes during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition were detrimental to the survival of these large herbivores.

AB  - Understanding the genetic architecture underpinning quantitative traits in wild populations is pivotal to understanding the processes behind trait evolution. The 'animal model' is a popular method for estimating quantitative genetic parameters such as heritability and genetic correlation and involves fitting an estimate of relatedness between individuals in the study population. Genotypes at genome-wide markers can be used to estimate relatedness; however, relatedness estimates vary with marker density, potentially affecting results. Increasing density of markers is also expected to increase the power to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL). In order to understand how the density of genetic markers affects the results of quantitative genetic analyses, we estimated heritability and performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on five body size traits in an unmanaged population of Soay sheep using two different SNP densities: a dataset of 37,037 genotyped SNPs and an imputed dataset of 417,373 SNPs. Heritability estimates did not differ between the two SNP densities, but the high-density imputed SNP dataset revealed four new SNP-trait associations that were not found with the lower density dataset, as well as confirming all previously-found QTL. We also demonstrated that fitting fixed and random effects in the same step as performing GWAS is a more powerful approach than pre-correcting for covariates in a separate model.

Invasive plants threaten the function of cross-scale interactions that exist when multi-scale effects such as fire and grazing interplay to form patterns of grassland structural heterogeneity. Objectives We investigated how grazing pressure and time since fire at the patch scale influenced patch utilization and production as well as forage quality in experimental grassland pastures dominated by an invasive grass, tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceous). We also assessed the response of tall fescue utilization and production to interactive fire-and-grazing under moderate and heavy grazing pressure. Methods We collected data on vegetation quantity and quality over two grazing seasons to evaluate the role of fire and grazing across time in shaping structural heterogeneity among patches in invaded tallgrass prairie in Iowa, USA. We anticipated greater initial patch-scale utilization in patches burned for the first time in two years than patches not burned in two years in our experimental pastures. We expected that greater utilization in recently-burned patches would reduce tall fescue production, mostly where grazing pressure was highest. Results The contrast in the availability of live herbage between patches was half the level typical for native-dominated tallgrass prairie. Under increased grazing pressure, the interplay between fire and grazing did not result in greater broad-scale heterogeneity (among-patch heterogeneity) or an invasive grass reduction in experimental pastures. Yet, increased grazing early in the season did promote native-grass production in this invaded grassland landscape. Conclusion Our results suggest that the dominance of tall fescue mediates the lack of structural heterogeneity induced by patch-level prescribed fire and grazing. Unlike native perennial grasses, tall fescue provides access to forage in unburned patches through its low-stature growth form. Diminished cross-scale interactions through a weak coupling of fire and focal grazing in invaded tallgrass prairie may facilitate structural homogenization of fire-dependent grassland.

AB  - Arthropod diversity of different taxonomic groups and ecosystem services are declining, yet current measures to counteract losses are often restricted to small areas of land or field margins, particularly in agricultural systems. At the same time, large areas of land will be required to feed a growing global population. Intercropping has been proposed as a potential solution to maximize both biodiversity and yield at large scale, but experimental evidence is scarce.
   In a three-year field experiment, we manipulated crop diversity and management intensity in a cereal-legume intercropping experiment in Germany, where 50% of wheat was replaced by faba beans. We measured arthropod abundance and diversity of different functional groups (pollinators, natural enemies, herbivores) and crop yield. We found that increasing crop diversity increased abundance and diversity of arthropods. Notably, pollinator and natural enemy abundances increased in intercropped systems. Low management intensity generally had positive effects on arthropod abundance and especially on pollinator diversity, indicating benefits of reduced inputs of fertilizers and herbicides. While wheat yield was higher in monocultures and for high management intensity, total grain yield of the intercrop (indicated by land equivalent ratio) was higher in mixtures.
   We found that trade-offs were stronger between arthropod diversity and wheat yield than between arthropod abundance and wheat yield. Specialist wheat herbivores and generalist herbivores were more abundant at higher wheat yields. Conversely, pollinator and natural enemy diversity were negatively associated with wheat yield.
   Our results show that diversification can promote both higher yields and greater diversity of arthropods. Intercropping can thus be an opportunity to support biodiversity without risking significant yield losses. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Gesellschaft fur

AB  - Orthohantaviruses (genus Orthohantavirus, family Hantaviridae) are the etiologic agents of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in the Americas. In South America, orthohantaviruses are highly diverse and are hosted by sigmodontine rodents (subfamiliy Sigmodontinae, family Cricetidae), an also diverse group of rodents. The aims of this work were to (1) identify orthohantavirus hosts and (2) to study the spatial and temporal variations in the prevalence of infection and their associations with community, environmental and individual characteristics, in different environments of Misiones province, northeastern Argentina. Live-capture sessions were carried out during two years in different land uses, with a trapping effort of 31,653 trap nights. We captured 719 individuals from the species Akodon montensis, Rattus rattus, Mus musculus, Calomys tener, Thaptomys nigrita, Oligoryzomys nigripes, Euryoryzomys russatus, Oligoryzomys flavescens, Brucepattersonius sp., and Juliomys pictipes. Antibodies against orthohantavirus were detected in Akodon montensis in one natural protected and one periurban areas, and it was the most abundant species in almost every study sites. We observed the presence of spatial focality of orthohantavirus infection and a positive association with host abundance suggesting the existence of a threshold density. At the individual level, large, reproductively active, and male individuals were more likely to have antibodies against orthohantavirus. This is the first record of orthohantavirus infection in A. montensis in Argentina, which shows the importance of investigations about emerging diseases.

AB  - The abundances of herbivorous, canopy-visiting, and predatory and parasitic insects were compared between injected and untreated trees to investigate the detrimental effects of dinotefuran trunk injection, used to control beech sawflies, on forest ecosystems. The numbers of Syneta adamsi Baly (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and lepidopteran larvae, the proportion of leaves infested with Hartigiola faggalli (Monzen) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) galls and those deformed by Phyllaphis fagifoliae Takahashi (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and the proportion of acorns with traces of insect-feeding were significantly lower in injected trees than in untreated trees. However, no significant differences were observed between treatments regarding the number of plant-feeding insects, such as Aphthona perminuta Baly (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), the proportion of leaves with galls formed by Cecidomyiidae sp., those infested with Platyaphis fagi Takahashi (Hemiptera: Aphididae), or the number of canopy-visiting insects, such as hemipteran, dipteran, and lepidopteran adults. The numbers of hymenopteran parasitoids and small-(<= 1 cm) and medium-to-large-sized (>1 cm) predatory cantharid beetles were lower in injected trees than in untreated trees, which could be attributed to an indirect effect due to the number of prey. These findings revealed that the effects of dinotefuran trunk injection were limited to insects that fed on leaves and seeds.

AB  - The contemporary mammalian communities of South America were defined by the rise of the Isthmus of Panama and by the deep climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene. Gomphotheres are a conspicuous group of North American immigrant mammals that came to South America during the late Pliocene and did not survive the great megafauna extinction approximately twelve thousand years ago. The present study compiles updated data on the phylogeny, systematics and ecology of this group in South America. Both genera reached South America in two independent dispersal events, Cuvieronius spread across the Andean corridor, while Notiomastodon extent along the eastern route. Cuvieronius hyodon is geographically restricted to the Andean Region in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Notiomastodon platensis was recorded in Ecuador, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, and Argentina, especially the Pampean Region.

AB  - Despite enormous efforts, complete animal tuberculosis (TB) eradication has only been achieved in few regions. Epidemiological analyses are key to identify TB risk factors and set up targeted biosecurity measures. Here, we conducted an in-depth characterization of 84 extensive beef cattle farms from a high TB prevalence region in Western Spain, and assessed how farm management and wildlife presence on farms contribute to cattle TB risk. Twenty-six out of 84 variables were associated with cattle farm TB positivity. Farm management variables associated with TB positivity included older cattle, larger herd size, highly fragmented farm structure and greater connectivity between farms. TB-positive farms provided supplemental feed over a higher number of months, used calf feeders, and had higher number of waterholes. Detecting Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), or Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) on cattle farms was also associated with farm TB positivity. The best ordinal regression model indicated that in farms with a large herd size (> 167 animals) the odds of being positive or recurrently positive (versus negative) was 7.34 (95% CI = 2.43-23.51) times higher that of farms with small herd size. Further, for every additional host species detected in the farm premises, the odds of being TB-positive increased 56%. We conclude that both cattle management and wildlife need to be targeted for successful TB control in grazing-based farming systems.

AB  - With many species interacting in nature, determining which interactions describe community dynamics is nontrivial. By applying a computational modeling approach to an extensive field survey, we assessed the importance of interactions from plants (both inter- and intra-specific), pollinators and insect herbivores on plant performance (i.e., viable seed production). We compared the inclusion of interaction effects as aggregate guild-level terms versus terms specific to taxonomic groups. We found that a continuum from positive to negative interactions, containing mostly guild-level effects and a few strong taxonomic-specific effects, was sufficient to describe plant performance. While interactions with herbivores and intraspecific plants varied from weakly negative to weakly positive, heterospecific plants mainly promoted competition and pollinators facilitated plants. The consistency of these empirical findings over 3 years suggests that including the guild-level effects and a few taxonomic-specific groups rather than all pairwise and high-order interactions, can be sufficient for accurately describing species variation in plant performance across natural communities.

AB  - There is still limited information available regarding the patterns and extent of bycatch mortality in heavily-fished marine systems. To address this gap, we conducted an interview-based study to investigate the bycatch of five marine megafaunal species/categories in the northern South China Sea. Approximately two-thirds of the interviewed fishers reported encountering bycatch events, with sea turtles being the most commonly reported megafauna (33.6 % of respondents), followed by Indo-Pacific finless porpoises and whale sharks (both 12.4 %), and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (8.5 %). Dugongs were only reported by one respondent. Bycatch of these taxa was mainly associated with gillnets, trawl nets, and seine nets. Our estimates indicated a total of 7464 bycatch events annually, resulting in 1391 deaths for these five taxa. These numbers underscore the alarming impact of fisheries on marine megafauna, particularly on small cetaceans, which accounted for 66.1 % of the reported annual deaths, including 690 finless porpoises and 230 humpback dolphins. Lower bycatch levels were reported for all taxa in winter, potentially due to temporary reductions in fishery activity and/or animal mi-grations. Random forest model revealed that bycatch of humpback dolphins, finless porpoises, and sea turtles was primarily influenced by water depth and distance from the coast, while whale shark bycatch was influenced by administrative region. This study demonstrates that local ecological knowledge can provide a rapid means of obtaining basic information on the bycatch of marine megafauna, and serves as a sobering reminder that fisheries-related mortality contributes to the population declines of coastal small cetaceans.

AB  - Kelps (Phaeophyceae, Laminariales) are ecosystem engineers along Arctic rocky shores. With ongoing climate change, the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves are increasing. Further, extensive meltwater plumes darken Arctic fjords. Assessing the effect of a sudden temperature increase at the cold-distribution limit of cold-temperate kelp species, we compared the responses of two kelp species (Agarum clathratum, Saccharina latissima) to realistic Arctic summer heatwave scenarios (4-10 degrees C) under low- and high-light conditions (3; 120 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) for 12 days. We found high-light causing physiological stress in both species (e.g., lower photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II), which was enhanced by cold and mitigated by warm temperatures. Under low-light conditions, we found no temperature response, probably due to light limitation. Both species acclimated to light variations by adjusting their chlorophyll a concentration, meeting cellular energy requirements. A. clathratum had similar to 150% higher phlorotannin concentrations than S. latissima, possibly acting as herbivore-deterrent. Our findings suggest competitive advantages of kelps on different Arctic coasts with ongoing warming: A. clathratum has advantages in future areas, with low-light intensities, and possibly high grazing pressure and S. latissima in areas with high-light intensities and low grazing pressure. Species composition changes might have cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Large carnivores can represent the ultimate challenge for conservation in developed landscapes because of their large area requirements and potential for conflict with humans. Some large carnivores such as mountain lions (Puma concolor) can use a wide range of biomes and vegetation types, and in southern California, USA, they persist in metropolitan Los Angeles, a megacity of 18 million people. Understanding how large carnivores use highly altered landscapes is important for their conservation and management. We estimated home range size, landscape use, and landscape selection for mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains and surrounding areas for 29 subadult and adult animals from 2002 to 2016, using 128,133 locations from global positioning system (GPS)-collars. Home range size was similar to that reported by other researchers; home ranges averaged 372 km(2) for adult males and 134 km(2) for adult females, except for 2 adult males in isolated habitat fragments that maintained 2 of the smallest adult male home ranges ever recorded (24 km(2) and 54 km(2)). Mountain lions very rarely entered developed areas, consistently avoided altered open areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, or other landscaped spaces, and showed a positive relationship between home range size and amount of development, all indicating that developed areas have reduced value for mountain lions. Mountain lions from all sex and age classes selected areas closer to development than expected by chance, which could be related to the presence of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) or other prey in or adjacent to urbanization. For 2 adult males that occupied home ranges within the most urban portions of our study area, their response to urban development differed strongly across diurnal periods, ranging from avoidance during the day to selection at night. Shrub vegetation types, especially chaparral, were important in terms of habitat use and resource selection, highlighting their importance for conservation of the species in southern California. North America's largest felid can thrive in shrublands and persist even in one of the world's largest cities, although they only very rarely venture into developed areas within that city.

AB  - The importance of human behavior in biodiversity conservation is widely recognized, but there is little published evidence about how conservation professionals make decisions when conservation values are at stake. We take a behavioral economics approach, administering simplified decision problems ("choice experiments"), questions about choice-relevant preferences and views ("elicitation questions"), and a psychometric scale (the New Ecological Paradigm scale) to a difficult-to-recruit sample (n = 100) of Canadian professionals involved in managing Rangifer tarandus caribou (Woodland Caribou). Our choice experiments reveal the importance of several decision biases (risk aversion, commission bias, and a bias towards fairness) in this influential group of conservation stakeholders. We then examine in-sample differences between categories of professional affiliation (e.g., resource industry, environmental nongovernmental organization, or federal/provincial government), finding significant variation in responses to one elicitation question (reference points) and in psychometric scores. We discuss the implications of our findings for choice in conservation practice and for multistakeholder conservation policy. Comparing our findings to prior work on choice under uncertainty in nonconservation contexts suggests a possible replication problem in applying behavioral science insights to conservation problems, pointing to the need for a systematic research program. Results from development testing with a convenience sample of university students are presented for comparison throughout the study.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) parasites not only significantly impact goat health and productivity but can also affect human health due to the zoonotic potential of some species. This study investigates the prevalence of internal parasites within the tropical monsoon ecosystem of southern Thailand, focusing on both phenotypic and molecular characteristics of the parasites and identifying associated risk factors in caprine farming systems. A total of 276 meat goats from Nakhon Si Thammarat province were examined, indicating an overall GI parasite prevalence of 88.8% (245/276), with strongyles and Eimeria spp. identified as the dominant parasites. In addition, mixed parasitic infections were observed in 72.2% of cases, whereas single infections comprised 27.8%. Strongyle-positive fecal samples were cultured and genetically sequenced, revealing the presence of Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, and Oesophagostomum asperum. For associated risk factors, gender and grazing with other herds significantly impacted overall GI parasitic infections, while the gender, breed, and packed cell volume (PCV) affected the strongyle infection. A correlation analysis revealed a substantial relationship between strongyle egg per gram (EPG) counts and clinical parameters, indicating that monitoring animals with low body condition scores (BCS) and high Faffa Malan Chart (FAMACHA) scores could be an effective strategy for controlling strongyle infections. These findings highlight the importance of continued research and effective farm management practices to address strongyle infections in meat goats, improving their health and agricultural productivity in tropical regions. Moreover, the detection of four zoonotic parasites (Giardia spp., H. contortus, T. colubriformis, and Fasciola spp.) indicates the necessity for the routine surveillance and monitoring of zoonotic parasites in goats to mitigate potential human health risks.

AB  - The rapidly growing industry of crop biostimulants leverages the application of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to promote plant growth and health. However, introducing nonnative rhizobacteria may impact other aspects of ecosystem functioning and have legacy effects; these potential consequences are largely unexplored. Nontarget consequences of PGPR may include changes in resident microbiomes, nutrient cycling, pollinator services, functioning of other herbivores, disease suppression, and organic matter persistence. Importantly, we lack knowledge of whether these ecosystem effects may manifest in adjacent ecosystems. The introduced PGPR can leave a functional legacy whether they persist in the community or not. Legacy effects include shifts in resident microbiomes and their temporal dynamics, horizontal transfer of genes from the PGPR to resident taxa, and changes in resident functional groups and interaction networks. Ecosystem functions may be affected by legacies PGPR leave following niche construction, such as when PGPR alter soil pH that in turn alters biogeochemical cycling rates. Here, we highlight new research directions to elucidate how introduced PGPR impact resident microbiomes and ecosystem functions and their capacity for legacy effects.

AB  - Alien plants grown in urban areas can spread through natural and anthropogenic ecosystems, adversely impacting native biota. Propagule pressure (i.e., seed, individual, and introduction number) increases the spreading probability, but native herbivorous predators can limit it via biotic resistance. Parrots are primary consumers, and although they interact antagonistically with alien plants, their role in biotic resistance seems overlooked. Here, we highlight the potential role of urban parrots in biotic resistance based on florivory activity in Gliricidia sepium (Fabaceae), an alien tree with invasive traits. We performed focal observations on four G. sepium trees planted in an urbanized area in Brazil to assess parrot florivory magnitude. As a complement, we performed road transects to record food plants and determine whether parrots prefer G. sepium over native plants, a significant fact from the perspective of biotic resistance. Parrots prey on 33% of G. sepium flower crops in 16 h, presumably resulting in seed loss for recruitment - florivory occurs before fruit and seed formation and may characterize a type of predispersal seed predation. Three parrot species preferred G. sepium flowers to some native food plant species. Our investigation suggests that parrots potentially provide biotic resistance in urbanized areas by exerting high predation pressure on the reproductive structures of alien plants. Maintaining native urban parrots can be a conservation tool to resist invasion by alien plant species. Parrot food plants, mainly native ones, should be urban greening options to enhance this ecological function.

AB  - Mobile metazoans in the Phanerozoic transformed shallow coastal habitats covered in biofilms into bioturbated mixed grounds. Benthic biofilms during this time rarely preserved into the fossil record as microbialites, and more specifically their layered form, stromatolites. Living microbialites are rare for this reason, in addition to other factors such as unfavourable modern geochemical conditions. Counterintuitively, macroinvertebrate grazers and laminated stromatolites coexist along the Nelson Mandela Bay coastline, South Africa. Here we aimed to determine if nutritional qualities of algae in these microbialite pools are linked to the diet of a dominant amphipod grazer, Melita zeylanica Stebbing, 1904. We assessed this in 3 microbialite pools using stable isotopes coupled to seasonal shifts in abundant food resources of microbialite biofilms and exposed (bleached and rimstone) or submerged (pool) macroalgae, Ulva spp. Amphipod diet was proportional to the quantity available (biomass) and nutritional properties of available algal food (energy, protein, total phosphorus and C:N ratios). Macroalgae in all states were the most nutritious, and the diet of M. zeylanica was dominated by submerged macroalgae. Although microbialite material had the worst nutritional profile, it was consumed in larger quantities compared to exposed bleached and rimstone macroalgae. Therefore, factors unrelated to nutritional profiles, such as predation, allelopathy or exposure risks, likely drive food choices. High levels of grazing on nutritious pool macroalgae likely releases most of the grazing pressure on the microbialite biofilm, therefore partially explaining why the microbialites can persist in this environment instead of being bioturbated through foraging.

AB  - Cryptic species (evolutionarily distinct lineages that do not align with morphologically defined species) are being increasingly discovered but are poorly integrated into ecological theory. In particular, we still lack a useful understanding of if and how cryptic species differ in ways that affect community recovery from disturbances and responses to anthropogenic stressors, such as the removal of consumers and pollution from nutrients. On coral reefs, nutrient pollution increases the growth of macroalgae that displace corals. Reductions in herbivorous fishes reduce the suppression of macroalgae, while reductions in coralivorous fishes reduce predation on corals. An unresolved question is if and how cryptic coral species respond differently to these impacts, thereby differing in their ability to influence coral community dynamics and maintain coral dominance. Therefore, we assessed how the response of cryptic Pocillopora species over a period of three years following a simulated disturbance from a cyclone depended on the experimental reduction of fish consumer pressure and nutrient addition. After three years, five morphologically cryptic, but genetically distinct, Pocillopora species recruited to the reef. However, recruitment was dominated by two species: Pocillopora tuahiniensis (46%) and Pocillopora meandrina (43%). Under ambient conditions, recruitment of P. tuahiniensis and P. meandrina was similar, but experimentally reducing consumer pressure increased recruitment of P. tuahiniensis by up to 73% and reduced recruitment of P. meandrina by up to 49%. In both species, nutrient enrichment increased recruitment and colony growth rates equally, but colonies of P. tuahiniensis grew faster and were up to 25% larger after three years than those of P. meandrina, and growth was unaffected by reduced consumer pressure. Predation by excavating corallivorous fish was higher for P. meandrina than for P. tuahiniensis, especially under nutrient enrichment. In contrast, polyp extension (an indicator of elevated heterotrophic feeding as well as susceptibility and attractiveness to corallivores) was lower for P. meandrina than for P. tuahiniensis, especially under low to medium consumer pressure. Overall, we uncovered ecological differences in the response of morphologically cryptic foundation species to two pervasive stressors on coral reefs. Our results demonstrate how cryptic species respond differently to key anthropogenic stressors, which may contribute to response diversity that can support ecological resilience or increase extinction risk.

AB  - Despite the important roles that animals play in ecosystems, their functions in urban green spaces are often overlooked. To fill this gap, this study explored the effects of four animal species on the mental restorative quality of urban green spaces by comparing observers' response to pictures with and without animals. The results indicated that swans, deer, and pigeons which were unthreatening to humans could significantly improve mental restoration of observers, and comparatively, swans had the strongest effect. Conversely, unleashed dogs were a potential threat to humans, and decreased the mental restorative quality of urban green spaces. The mechanism of animals' effects on mental restoration and the differential effects of four animal species were discussed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study addressing the mental health impacts of animals in landscapes, and the results suggest that "animal-inclusive landscape design" has a positive impact on urban green spaces.

AB  - To compensate for mineral deficiencies in food sources, numerous ungulate species use various methods, such as salt licking, soil ingestion, and gnawing on antlers or bones. While osteophagia, the act of gnawing on antlers or bones, is well-documented in cervid species, it has only been observed in sika deer (Cervus nippon) on Mageshima Island in southern Japan despite their widespread distribution. This study aimed to provide an initial account of the observations of osteophagia in sika deer from central Japan. One of the 15 camera traps deployed in the Hakone Nature Forest of Tamagawa University for wildlife monitoring serendipitously captured multiple instances of adult female sika deer gnawing on a four-tined antler on July 9th and 16th in 2018. These occurrences coincided with the fawning season of the species during which mineral deficiencies in the diet are prevalent, suggesting that osteophagia serves as a response to nutrient deficiencies in the diet of sika deer in central Japan. Thus, systematic surveys may yield additional evidence of this behavior in sika deer across diverse geographical areas given the absence of studies on osteophagia in sika deer conducted in other regions.

AB  - Despite their importance for biodiversity and other ecosystem services, many semi-natural grasslands deteriorate or have even disappeared due to insufficient grazing and neglect. Preservation of grassland habitats depends on a good understanding of sustainable grazing management as well as effective agricultural policy measures that ensure long-term economic sustainability for the farmer. Through meta-evaluation and synthesis of previous investigations and discussion of scientific literature, we aimed to evaluate factors that determine the extent to which cattle and sheep in Sweden graze semi-natural grasslands instead of more productive land and what this means for biodiversity and sustainability. We also aimed to propose which practises and policy measures may be the most cost-effective to promote habitat quality and the sustainable use of grasslands. Results from a nationwide survey of Swedish farmers' attitudes towards agri-environmental payment schemes are discussed in relation to farm characteristics and other factors influencing the use of cattle and sheep for sustainable grazing. This study supports recommendations by environmental economists that payments should be targeted more strongly at the most valuable grasslands, emphasising the need for a more detailed and nuanced framework for classifying grasslands in Europe. A comparison with independent estimates of the area of agricultural land from nation-wide, sample-based monitoring shows that the data from official statistics normally used for nationwide evaluations are partly biased and of insufficient quality, underscoring the need for more sophisticated and precise methods for monitoring both overall trends and detailed environmental effects related to the preservation of semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae (Aphodiinae, Scarabaeinae) and some Geotrupidae) provide important ecosystem services on pastures by disrupting and burying deposits of cattle dung. The extent of these services is influenced by the number of individuals and species present, which may differ with habitat type. In the present study, we compared dung beetle assemblages in a mosaic of open grassland and wooded habitats on native fescue pastures in the Cypress Hills of southern Alberta, Canada. Using pitfall traps baited with cattle dung and operated from spring through autumn for two years at each of the two sites, we collected 4944 individuals representing 14 dung beetle species. More individuals and species were recovered in grassland habitat, which was dominated by nonnative species associated with cattle dung. Wooded habitat was dominated by a native species associated with deer dung. Dwellers (species that develop within the dung deposit) comprised 93% of the beetles recovered during the study. Significant variation in annual beetle counts in the two habitats highlights the value of studies conducted over multiple years. These results emphasise the importance of habitat diversity and interspecific habitat preference in structuring dung beetle assemblages on fescue grasslands, which are among the most threatened ecosystems in Canada.

AB  - We describe the temporal and spatial patterns of three tetrapod groups (sea turtles, seabirds, and cetaceans) stranded in southeast Brazil, based on daily beach surveys of over >800 km of coastline between 2015 and 2020. Patterns were analysed by stranding rates (individuals/1000 km of coastline) of groups and species; for the 14 most numerous species, we also fitted generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) using temporal and spatial explanatory variables. We recorded 53850 animals (22738 sea turtles, 28155 birds, and 2957 cetaceans) of 78 species. Higher stranding numbers were observed during winter/spring for all groups, and could be an effect of a higher occurrence/abundance at the region, driven by productive waters, jointly with higher stranding probabilities due to stronger drifting forces. Most modelled species showed temporal and spatial stranding patterns most likely related to their general occurrence/abundance cycles in southeast Brazil, but for Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, Pontoporia blainvillei, and Sotalia guianensis local mortality factors may be influencing stranding numbers. By using intensive, wide ranging beach surveys and including survey effort in the analysis, we provide a comprehensive baseline for stranding numbers in the region, and open a pathway for future hypothesis-testing studies to investigate its drivers.

AB  - Habitat conversion to agricultural land is one of the main threats to terrestrial biodiversity and can affect ecosystem processes and cause changes in ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs). Yet, studies often rely only on the abundance and diver-sity of the service providers; the effects on ecological processes of habitat conversion are rarely directly monitored. In this study, we used the sentinel approach to evaluate how habitat conversion from native forest to agricultural land affected ESs and EDs on an oceanic island. We quantified herbivory on lettuce plants, invertebrate and vertebrate predation rates on artificial caterpillars, pollination on strawberry plants, seed predation on wheat and mustard seeds, and leaf decomposition rates in native forests, maize fields and pastures on Terceira Island, Azores (Portugal). Herbivory, invertebrate predation rates, and pollination service were not significantly different between habitats. Vertebrate predation rates in native forests (mean 6.1% d-1) were sig-nificantly higher than that in pastures (0.3% d-1), or high-elevation maize fields (0.5% d-1), and marginally higher than in low-elevation maize fields (2.2% d-1). Overall seed predation after 48 h was significantly higher on wheat (mean 16.8%) than mustard seeds (5.6%). High-elevation maize fields also had higher seed predation (27.8%) than low-elevation ones (0.6%) or pastures (3.6%), but did not differ from the native forest (12.9%). Decomposition after 90 days was highest in pastures (78.4% and 45.9%, for tea and rooibos, respectively); although no significant differences between habitats were detected, except for low-elevation maize fields (64.4% and 33.6%). Conversion from native forest to cultivated land did not cause a clear decrease in the intensity of the studied ESs/EDs except for vertebrate predation.

AB  - Seed dispersal influences plant community dynamics and regeneration. Zoochory by cattle is a particularly important type of dispersal in grasslands, but still poorly understood in subtropical grasslands. We studied endozoochory in a native grassland area with different grazing intensities, defined by distinct forage allowance levels. On one day in each of the four seasons of the year, dung samples were collected and kept in a greenhouse for germination over one full year. At each dung collection date, a survey of reproducing plants was conducted to relate the species composition of seed within dung to the community in dispersal phase. We used randomisation tests to compare grazing intensities and seasons in terms of dung community richness, abundance and composition. We recorded 93 species in the dung samples, with 65 species in the spring samples, 61 in summer samples, 45 in the autumn samples and 37 in the winter samples. Of the 90 species identified in the vegetation, almost 50% (43 species) also occurred in dung samples. Graminoid herbs presented the largest number of species in all samples. Grazing had no effect on overall seed and species number, but was related to compositional differences in the cattle dung communities. Grazing also influenced the species composition in relation to life cycle, by the increase of annual species at the extremes of our grazing gradient (very high or very low grazing intensities). We conclude that endozoochory by cattle is an important process for the dispersal of native species in the studied system, with potential applications in grassland management and restoration. A better understanding of the strategies involved in seed dispersal is essential to improve knowledge about grassland vegetation regeneration and maintenance.

AB  - Understanding how domestic mammal species evolved through time provides insight into the artificial and natural selection processes that have shaped the diversity of domestic animals. The focus of this article is the morphometric evolution of sheep, goats and suids in the Northwestern Mediterranean Basin over the last 8000 years, employing a 2D geometric morphometrics protocol applied to the third lower molars. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising 2798 archaeological specimens from 176 sites in Southern France and Spanish Catalonia, along with 1303 modern specimens, we aim to identify and contrast the environmental and anthropic factors influencing species evolution linked to past husbandry practices. Each of these three taxa follows its own evolutionary trajectory, exhibiting variations over time and across different regions. Notably, reduction in the centroid size of sheep molars between the Neolithic and the early Iron Age could potentially be associated with an increased demand for meat and/or shifts in male-to-female ratios. A clear geographical structuring of caprines between the Neolithic and Antiquity is observed, likely influenced by a combination of factors including artificial selection, environmental changes and socio-economic dynamics, as corroborated by previous studies. Moreover, a reduction in molar size during the Middle Ages is observed across all three species, possibly linked to extensive agropastoral practices. Furthermore, divergent processes of breed improvement and standardization are identified in pigs and caprines. This study highlights the complex nature of morphological variations in domestic species, emphasising the multifactorial influences involved. It underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in understanding the factors contributing to morphological transformations over time.

AB  - While benthic characteristics of coral reef habitats are a major driver of the structure of coral reef fish assemblages, non-reef habitats adjacent to coral reefs (e.g., mangroves, seagrass beds, and macroalgal beds) can affect reef fish assemblages. Here, we investigate how reef fish assemblages respond to local-scale benthic habitats within a coral reef and larger-scale adjacent seascape features (habitats within 500 m of coral reefs) on Siquijor Island in the Philippines. We examined an abundance of species for the entire reef fish assemblage and within the assemblages of parrotfishes (subfamily Scarinae) and wrasses (family Labridae). Five distinct habitat types were identified in a cluster analysis, which incorporated benthic characteristics within coral reefs and habitats adjacent to coral reefs. We found that the diversity and structure of coral reef fish assemblages were affected by benthic characteristics within coral reefs and also by benthic habitat types adjacent to coral reefs. Individual species responses and juveniles of certain species demonstrated uniquely high abundances in habitat clusters characterized by the non-reef habitats surrounding coral reefs. Considering coral reef habitats and adjacent non-reef habitats as a holistic, interconnected seascape will provide better estimations of the drivers of the structures of coral reef fish assemblages.

AB  - We examined some factors that might allow for the coexistence of two sympatric skunk species, southern spotted skunks (Spilogale angustifrons) and striped hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus semistriatus), in a dry forest of northwest Costa Rica (Santa Rosa Sector of Guanacaste National Park) by comparing distribution of captures and occurrence in cover-types derived from 56 camera traps monitored from June 2016-June 2017, as well as relative activity patterns derived from these and 45 other cameras in the same area monitored irregularly from 2011 to 2016. Photo rates of spotted skunks in our study area were twice those of striped skunks. At no camera were both species photographed over the course of a year, but both species were commonly recorded in the same cover types. Photo rates of spotted skunks, however, were higher than expected in Secondary Forest and lower in Riparian Forest, whereas for striped skunks the rate was higher than expected in Mangrove and Beach Forest. Both species were clearly nocturnal, and the plots suggesting that spotted skunks were more active than striped skunks before midnight, and striped skunks were more active after midnight, were not significantly different. Differences we observed in the distribution of photos by cover types and camara location for the two skunk species were notable and suggest local allopatry, likely the result of interspecific avoidance. Species-specific food habits, predation, and competition with other species may also be an important factor affecting these observations, and other techniques should be used to investigate these factors. Still, cameras can provide important insights into cryptic species' ecology.

AB  - African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) have been recognised as ecosystem engineers, where their feeding habits have been shown to alter landscapes. Within small, fenced reserves, studies exploring elephant damage on trees and their recovery have overlooked secondary damages that could be contributing to tree mortality. The aim of this study is to assess the significance of both elephant damage and secondary damage, and the subsequent tree recovery. We identified secondary damage as insects and considered wood borers and termites in this study. This was conducted in in the small fenced Karongwe Private Game Reserve, South Africa. We analysed the level of damage, recovery and insect presence using vegetation transects, where all trees >= 2 m in height were surveyed (n = 1278 trees). Forty tree species were recorded, with 5 species accounting for 77% of the data set and used for further analysis. Termites were found to be more likely to colonise damaged trees without signs of recovery. However, wood borers were more likely to colonise damaged trees showing signs of recovery. Termites and wood borer presence on damaged trees was not dependent on tree height. We suggest carefully considering management approaches for elephant-induced termite and wood borer damage on trees.

AB  - Spatiotemporal distribution of batoids was studied from the samples collected monthly using an Otter trawl during survey 2009-2011 and seasonally during survey 2014-2015 on the shelf and upper slope (shelf break) of the Gulf of Antalya. The study area had both a fishing zone and a non-fishing zone. Eleven batoid species were found. Seven species was found only on the shelf, one on the shelf break, and two in both zones. Recently, abundance and number of species have decreased by year. Distribution of the skates was contrasted to that of the rays along the bottom depth gradient. Raja clavata, Raja miraletus, and Dasyatis pastinaca were common and frequent species. Dasyatis centroura was an occasional visitor. The batoid abundance had two minimum periods, early summer and late autumn. Maximum values occurred in April and July. There were two types of the dispersal distribution of the batoids along the bottom depth gradient: the unimodally-distributed species peaked abundance at 75-100 m or at 300 m, and the bimodal distribution was composed of ubiquitous species of the batoids. This distribution was more pronounced in survey 2014-2015. The batoid assemblages were discriminated by a seafloor depth of 125 m, comprising the assemblages of the shallower and greater depth. The species-environment relation was correlated positively with bottom depths, near-bottom chl-a, and finest bioseston and negatively correlated with Secchi disk depth and water salinity. However, seasonal discrimination did not occur. The fishing effort, which was low in the present area, was not significantly correlated with any of the faunistic characters (abundance, biomass, and diversity indices). In relation of the batoids to the megafauna, the batoids were positively correlated with cephalopods, holoturids, and decapods but negatively correlated with stomatopods and bivalves.

AB  - Simple Summary: To develop conservation programs for the taruka (Hippocamelus antisensis d'Orbigny), and to evaluate the impacts that this rare species of deer could have in agricultural areas of the Andean foothills of Tarapac & aacute;, we studied the composition of its diet, its relative diversity, and its quality in two contrasting seasons, the wet and the dry season. The main components of its diet were alfalfa, followed by herbaceous dicotyledons and shrub species from rangelands, with the presence of grasses and horticultural crop species being very scarce. The above generates a relatively low dietary diversity, with characteristic traits of a concentrate selector herbivore, which could represent a competitive disadvantage for this species. The quality of the diet was relatively stable; however, during the last stage of pregnancy and the beginning of lactation, protein intake, estimated through fecal nitrogen, could limit these processes. The success of conservation programs for the taruka (Hippocamelus antisensis d'Orbigny), an endemic and endangered deer, depends on many factors, highlighting anthropogenic and ecological effects. Among the latter, how this herbivore interacts with forage resources is important. The objective of the study was to describe the main attributes of the diet of this deer in rangelands adjacent to agricultural areas of the foothills of the Tarapac & aacute; Region, Chile. The botanical composition of the diet (BCD) was determined by microhistology of feces and fecal nitrogen (NF, %) was measured in two contrasting seasons (rainy summer and dry winter). From the BCD and FN, their relative diversity (J) and crude protein percentage were estimated. In the BCD, Medicago sativa dominated (27.6 +/- 8.2% vs. 53.9 +/- 9.2%, in rainy summer and dry end winter, respectively), followed by herbaceous dicots (46.2 +/- 9.4% vs. 19.4 +/- 8.7%) and shrubby species (21.5 +/- 7.8% vs. 23.4 +/- 7.0%), from rangelands. The contribution of grasses and graminoid species was low, not exceeding 3% and 0.4% of the diet, respectively, with no differences between seasons of the year. Intake of horticultural crop species was marginal (1.3 +/- 1.3%), being detected only in the wet season. Diet relative diversity was higher during the wet period (0.75 +/- 0.07) compared to the dry period (0.58 +/- 0.06), since in the first period it was possible to find a greater number of palatable species. There were no significant differences in the FN attributed to the time of the year (average of 1.8 +/- 0.19%), which indicates that the diet of this deer would be stable in terms of its protein quality. These FN levels estimate sufficient dietary protein content to satisfy maintenance and early pregnancy, but these could be limiting during late gestation and lactation.

AB  - Fishing-down-marine-food-webs has resulted in alarming declines of various species worldwide. Benthic rays are one examples of such overexploited species. On tidal flats, these rays are highly abundant and play an ecologically important role. They use tidal flats as refuge, feeding and resting grounds, during which they bury into the sediment, which results in sediment bioturbation. Changes in bioturbation intensity, following ray removal, may affect the biogeomorphology of tidal flats with possible cascading effects on the macrozoobenthic community. However, it is poorly understood how these indirect effects could influence ecosystem function. We therefore studied the geomorphic impact of benthic rays (specifically the pearl whipray/stingray Fontitrygon margaritella) on the tropical tidal flats of the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau, on a landscape scale. We investigated 1) bioturbation rates by rays using drone and ground surveys, 2) the spatial distribution of ray pits on multiple tidal flats, 3) the impact of rays on sediment properties and macrozoobenthos by experimental exclusion (15 months). Benthic rays bioturbated 3.7 +/- 0.35% of the tidal flat's sediment surface per day over one single 24-h period, which equals a complete top-sediment-surface turnover every 27 days. The spatial distribution of ray pits was affected by tidal flat geomorphology since pits decayed faster at areas exposed to strong hydrodynamic forces. Predator exclusion altered sediment properties, leading to changes in sedimentation (- 17%) and erosion (- 43%) rates. In addition, macrozoobenthic species composition changed, marked by an increase in Capitellidae worms and a greater biomass of Malacostraca over time. These changes indicated substantial effects of ray bioturbation on the biotic and geomorphic landscape of tidal flats. Overall, we conclude that changing abundances of benthic rays can have clear landscape-wide geomorphological effects on intertidal ecosystems. These indirect consequences of fisheries should be incorporated in integrative management plans to preserve tidal flats and connected ecosystems.

AB  - The prevention and control of invasive of alien species is an important work for nature reserves. This study analyzes the development trend of the alien species sika deer in Liancheng National Nature Reserve. From October 2019 to June 2020, 3523 valid photos and videos of terrestrial animals were acquired from 130 camera traps, and sika deer were recorded in 21 photos from 13 traps. The survival of the sika deer population was investigated by means of morphological identification, population structure analysis, species relative abundance indices, and species spatial association analysis. A total of 13 sika deer individuals were identified by camera trapping, including two kids and three subadults representing the reproductive capacity of the population. Spatially, sika deer is not associated with any local species and was outside the spatial association network of terrestrial animals in Liancheng National Nature Reserve, indicating that the sika deer population has not been integrated into the local community and has failed to perform its ecological function. It is worth noting that the reserve provides habitat suitable for sika deer and that the population has adequate reproductive capacity. Due to the lack of large apex predators in the reserve, the population size of ungulates such as sika deer, red deer, and Siberian roe deer may expand and lead to population outbreaks and the associated problems for the ecosystem. To restore large- and medium-sized carnivores and avoid the population outbreak of the species, the present challenges require immediate attention in Liancheng National Nature Reserve.

AB  - Deep-sea marine fishes support important fisheries but estimates of their distributions are often incomplete as the data behind them may reflect fishing practices, access rights, or political boundaries, rather than actual geographic distributions. We use a simple suitable habitat model based on bottom depth, temperature, and salinity to estimate the potential distribution of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). A large presence-only dataset is examined using multivariate kernel densities to define environmental envelopes, which we link to spatial distribution using a pan-Arctic oceanographic model. Occurrences generally fit the model well, although there were gaps in the predicted circum-Arctic distribution likely due to limited survey activity in many of the ice-covered seas around the Arctic Ocean. Bottom temperature and depth were major factors defining model fit to observations, but other factors, such as ecosystem interactions and larval drift could also influence distribution. Model predictions can be tested by increasing sampling effort in poorly explored regions and by studying the connectivity of putative populations. While abundances of Greenland halibut in the High Arctic are currently low, some areas are predicted to be suitable habitat for this species, suggesting that on-going sea-ice melt may lead to fisheries expansion into new areas.

AB  - Throughout the last decades, the emergence of zoonotic diseases and the frequency of disease outbreaks have increased substantially, fuelled by habitat encroachment and vectors overlapping with more hosts due to global change. The virulence of pathogens is one key trait for successful invasion. In order to understand how global change drivers such as habitat homogenization and climate change drive pathogen virulence evolution, we adapted an established individual-based model of host-pathogen dynamics. Our model simulates a population of social hosts affected by a directly transmitted evolving pathogen in a dynamic landscape. Pathogen virulence evolution results in multiple strains in the model that differ in their transmission capability and lethality. We represent the effects of global change by simulating environmental changes both in time (resource asynchrony) and space (homogenization). We found an increase in pathogenic virulence and a shift in strain dominance with increasing landscape homogenization. Our model further indicated that lower virulence is dominant in fragmented landscapes, although pulses of highly virulent strains emerged under resource asynchrony. While all landscape scenarios favoured co-occurrence of low- and high-virulent strains, the high-virulence strains capitalized on the possibility for transmission when host density increased and were likely to become dominant. With asynchrony likely to occur more often due to global change, our model showed that a subsequent evolution towards lower virulence could lead to some diseases becoming endemic in their host populations.
   During disease outbreaks, pathogenic virulence is a key trait for successful spread. Global change comes with an increasing frequency of novel zoonotic diseases or disease outbreaks. Here, we use an individual-based host-pathogen model to study how global change drivers affect virulence in a directly transmitted evolving pathogen in a social host. Our results show an increase in pathogenic virulence as an effect of increasing landscape homogenization.image

AB  - Unraveling factors that enable the coexistence of species occupying similar niches is a challenge in Ecology. In the Amazon basin, several piranha species (Serrasalmidae) co-occur in floodplain lakes, providing a model to understand how similar species manage coexisting. We employed a combination of classic and molecular stomach contents analysis, and stable isotope analysis to evaluate the use of resources and isotopic niche breadth among three co-occurring piranha species (Serrasalmus altispinis, S. maculatus, and Pygocentrus nattereri), and the influence of the hydrological cycle (low vs. high water) in resources partitioning. A higher diversity of prey and lower isotopic niches was found during low water, likely due to prey concentration. Cannibalism occurred in all three species, and although piscivores, these species feed on different trophic levels, with P. nattereri consuming omnivores, S. maculatus detritivores, and S. altispinis herbivores. Coexistence was mediated by changes in resource availability associated with the hydrologic cycle. Trophic niche overlap was higher during the high water compared to low waters due to high prey availability when lakes connect to river channels and floodplain forests. Here, we identified strategies used by piranhas to avoid competition under different environmental conditions. Understanding species interactions is fundamental to managing biodiversity conservation in a changing world.

AB  - Cycles of glacial expansion and contraction throughout the Pleistocene drove increases and decreases, respectively, in the geographical range and population size of many animal species. Genetic data have revealed that during glacial maxima the distribution of many Eurasian animals was restricted to small refugial areas, from which species expanded to reoccupy parts of their former range as the climate warmed. It has been suggested that the extinct eastern moa (Emeus crassus)-a large, flightless bird from New Zealand-behaved analogously during glacial maxima, possibly surviving only in a restricted area of lowland habitat in the southern South Island of New Zealand during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, previous studies have lacked the power and geographical sampling to explicitly test this hypothesis using genetic data. Here we analyse 46 ancient mitochondrial genomes from Late Pleistocene and Holocene bones of the eastern moa from across their post-LGM distribution. Our results are consistent with a post-LGM increase in the population size and genetic diversity of eastern moa. We also demonstrate that genetic diversity was higher in eastern moa from the southern extent of their range, supporting the hypothesis that they expanded from a single glacial refugium following the LGM.

AB  - AimEcological state shifts that alter the structure and function of entire ecosystems are a concerning consequence of human impact. Yet, when, where and why discrete ecological states emerge remains difficult to predict and monitor, especially in high-diversity systems. We sought to quantify state shifts and their drivers through space and time in the most ecologically complex marine ecosystem: tropical coral reefs.LocationWorldwide.Time Period1987-2019.Major Taxa StudiedCoral reef communities.MethodsUsing a global dataset of 3375 coral reef surveys, along with 13 time series datasets ranging between 1987 and 2019, we applied a novel double-dichotomy approach to classify coral reefs into four simplified and discrete states based on the relative contributions of corals versus algae to benthic cover and small-bodied versus large-bodied fishes to fish standing stock. We then examined state shifts considering a range of spatial predictors and tested whether states have shifted directionally over time, and the nature of the most common transitions.ResultsWe show that geographic, environmental and anthropogenic context fundamentally shapes coral reef states at the local scale, which explains disparities among case studies, and stakes out critical baseline expectations for regional management efforts. We also reveal clear multi-decadal state shifts on coral reefs: over time, systems dominated by reef-building corals and small-bodied, planktivorous fishes tend to have been replaced with reefs characterised by algae and larger-bodied fishes.Main ConclusionsOur results suggest a previously unrecognised transition from systems that harness external subsidies through small-bodied consumers associated with structurally complex live corals, to herbivore-dominated systems with stronger bottom-up dynamics. Overall, the partitioning of complex reef ecosystems into a small suite of discrete ecological states suggests that spatial context-dependency, shifting baselines and changes in reef functioning are crucial considerations for coral reef management in the 21st century.

AB  - Pubescence has significant ecological roles modifying herbivory or physiology. Effects of mechanical ice damage on a small scale, such as loss of pubescence, are typically neither observed nor investigated. The objective of this study is to determine whether microscale ice damage occurs at a degree sufficient for potential ecological impacts. I documented differential loss of pubescence in the field on leaves and stems experiencing frequent snow and freezing rain. I also experimentally demonstrated in the lab the potential for hair loss due to ice formation under windy conditions. Observations in the field document that pubescence is removed from plants exposed above the snowpack, but plants beneath the snowpack are less affected. Plants in low-elevation sites not experiencing snow or ice show little loss of pubescence. Hair loss can be replicated experimentally with glaze ice, but only under windy conditions. These results extend the potential impacts of snow and ice damage to small scales. Given the multiple ecological roles of pubescence, such impacts may be important for plant success and may potentially influence community composition shifts under changing climates.

AB  - Population densities are an important consideration for wildlife management. For hunted species, estimates of population size are essential for establishing quotas. There are limited data regarding sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii) abundance, and few studies have used camera traps for estimating population densities. We estimated sitatunga density in the Mayanja River area of central Uganda using the time in front of the camera (TIFC) method, which yields population density estimates using camera-trap data without having to identify each individual. Density estimates from the TIFC method averaged 11.1 sitatunga/km(2), similar to estimates from a spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) study, which requires perfect identification of individuals. These results suggest that TIFC methods accurately estimate population densities and might be an alternative for species where individual identity cannot be determined, or in habitats where typically identifiable species might not be accurately identified to meet the requirements of SECR. In addition, the resulting density estimates can influence management decisions and quotas for hunting.

AB  - Understanding parasite epidemiology is essential for managing endoparasite infections in free-ranging animals. However, such epidemiological knowledge is limited for feral cattle and is usually derived from farmed populations. We assessed endoparasite infection in a feral cattle population in Hong Kong. This population does not receive any routine care or anthelminthic treatment, although some cattle are provisioned with water and hay by local citizens. We assessed three indices of endoparasite infection (parasite richness, prevalence and fecal egg/ oocyst count) and their associated risk factors (season, provisioning, marshland access, group size, sex and body condition) in adult cattle. We conducted sedimentation, McMaster and coproculture techniques on 262 samples collected from 177 cattle. We identified eleven taxa of nematodes, two taxa of trematodes, one taxon of protozoan and one taxon of cestode. Median parasite richness was two parasite taxa per individual. Trematode infections were the most prevalent (91.22 %), followed by protozoan (67.17 %), nematode (23.22 %) and cestode (12.97 %) infections. Counts averaged 144.85 oocysts per gram for Eimeria oocysts, 20.61 eggs per gram (EPG) for strongyle-type eggs, 11.83 EPG for Moniezia and 1.91 EPG for Trichuris. Provisioned herds were more likely to be infected with Eimeria, but had lower prevalence of Trichostrongylus. Eimeria prevalence and strongyle-type egg counts were higher in the wet season, while Fasciola eggs, Cooperia and Trichostrongylus larvae were more prevalent in the dry season. Larger herds had higher Eimeria oocyst prevalence but lower Fasciola egg prevalence. Marshland access decreased Fasciola egg prevalence while it increased prevalence of Cooperia larvae. Males were more infected with strongyle-type eggs than female cattle. We show that the seasonal dynamics of infection and consequences of provisioning differ between endoparasite taxa. Our findings highlight complex interactions between endoparasites and their hosts, providing new insights into wild ruminants' health and the impacts of anthropogenic provisioning.

AB  - Epibiosis among plankton communities and the role of environmental forcing therein are discussed in this study. We hypothesized that a sub-surface thermal inversion phenomenon and associated hydrographical changes during winter monsoon promoted group/species-specific epibiosis among the plankton in the western Bay of Bengal. Plankton samples were collected from discrete depths along five transects placed perpendicular to the coast. Water column profiling revealed thermal inversion below the mixed layer depth along three southern transects (APB, APV and APK) and its absence along the two northern transects (ODP and ODG). Multivariate analysis revealed a significant difference in hydrographical properties between these areas. The warmer, highly saline waters of the thermal inversion layer, sandwiched at 10-20 m, between the colder, less saline waters of surface and bottom, supported higher density and diversity of epibionts on copepods and diatoms. The density of epibionts and intensity of epibiosis were significantly lower outside the thermal inversion layer and in the northern transects. Epibionts preferred copepods over diatoms and carnivorous/omnivorous copepods over herbivorous copepods of comparable size. These results suggest that hydrographical variability associated with thermal inversion during winter monsoon support epibiosis among the plankton in the coastal waters of the western Bay of Bengal (BoB). The present investigation is the first-ever study from a coastal marine ecosystem connecting hydrographical features with epibiosis among the plankton. Further studies are warranted to explore the higher frequency of epibiosis in the thermal inversion layer, the nutrient preference and indicator properties of epibionts, and their ecological role in the coastal and open ocean ecosystems.

AB  - Clarifying the influence of disturbances by biotic and abiotic agents on long-term changes in forest structure and demographic rates is an important task of forest ecology. Here, we investigated changes in forest structure and demographic rates and the effects of biotic and abiotic factors (sika deer, ambrosia beetle, neighborhood trees, and indices of strong wind and wetness) in a 4-ha long-term ecological study plot in a lowland warm temperate rain forest on Yakushima Island, Japan, from 1996 to 2019 for three regeneration groups related to gap dynamics (gap demander: GD, light shade tolerant: LS, and strong shade tolerant: SS). GD had relatively lower recruitment and survival than LS and/or SS. Changes in demographic rates were not significantly correlated with those in the index of strong wind in any regeneration group. The effects of sika deer on demographic rates did not differ among groups. Stems of Fagaceae species belonging to LS attacked by ambrosia beetles recorded in 2013 did not significantly differ in RGR and survival rates. Our results indicate that despite the relatively long monitoring period of 23 years, we did not detect significant effects of strong winds on demographic rates among regeneration groups, and shade-tolerant species (LS and SS) showed better demographic performance than light-demanding species (GD) and an increase in total basal area over time. We need longer monitoring of forest dynamics to understand forest responses to disturbances considering several factors, including the time lag of demographic responses to disturbances and the long-term effects of disturbances.

AB  - African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are the largest extant terrestrial mammals, with bodies containing enormous quantities of nutrients. Yet, we know little about how these nutrients move through the ecosystem after an elephant dies. Here, we investigated the initial effects (1-26 months postmortem) of elephant megacarcasses on savanna soil and plant nutrient pools in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We hypothesized that (H1) elephant megacarcass decomposition would release nutrients into soil, resulting in higher concentrations of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and micronutrients near the center of carcass sites; (H2) carbon (C) inputs into the soil would stimulate microbial activity, resulting in increased soil respiration potential near the center of carcass sites; and (H3) carcass-derived nutrients would be absorbed by plants, resulting in higher foliar nutrient concentrations near the center of carcass sites. To test our hypotheses, we identified 10 elephant carcass sites split evenly between nutrient-poor granitic and nutrient-rich basaltic soils. At each site, we ran transects in the four cardinal directions from the center of the carcass site, collecting soil and grass (Urochloa trichopus, formerly U. mosambicensis) samples at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 m. We then analyzed samples for C, N, P, and micronutrient concentrations and quantified soil microbial respiration potential. We found that concentrations of soil nitrate, ammonium, delta 15N, phosphate, and sodium were elevated closer to the center of carcass sites (H1). Microbial respiration potentials were positively correlated with soil organic C, and both respiration and organic C decreased with distance from the carcass (H2). Finally, we found evidence that plants were readily absorbing carcass-derived nutrients from the soil, with foliar %N, delta 15N, iron, potassium, magnesium, and sodium significantly elevated closer to the center of carcass sites (H3). Together, these results indicate that elephant megacarcasses release ecologically consequential pulses of nutrients into the soil which stimulate soil microbial activity and are absorbed by plants into the above-ground nutrient pools. These localized nutrient pulses may drive spatiotemporal heterogeneity in plant diversity, herbivore behavior, and ecosystem processes.

AB  - Understanding wildlife spatiotemporal dynamics at protected area boundaries is critical to conservation. In SE Asia, protected areas are often bordered by indigenous communities whose traditional practices result in increased landscape heterogeneity within their community managed forests (CF). Because SE Asian forests exhibit supra-annual mast fruiting (3-7 yrs) and sustained fruit scarcity, wildlife using CF may benefit from greater availability of fruits and seeds encouraged by traditional management, but incur greater risk of being hunted. We examined shifts in wildlife activity in forests within and adjacent to Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary (LEWS), in Sarawak, Malaysia. Using camera traps and surveys of fruiting phenology, we related presence of fruits and seeds to shifts in large mammal activity over 3 years (October 2016-2019). We first compared relative frequency of five focal species (sun bear, bearded pig, muntjac, mouse deer, and sambar) by forest type for a given survey year and season (rainy vs. dry). We then modeled activity to assess how fruit availability, landscape features, and proxies for hunting risk, influence seasonal shifts in habitat use. Our results suggested seasonal variation in concert with increased landscape heterogeneity influenced patterns of activity. We found no evidence that CF excluded any detected mammal species, suggesting CF contribute important habitat to wildlife, particularly during periods of fruit scarcity in primary forest. However, our findings also imply increased hunting risk for wildlife attracted to resources near human settlements, emphasizing the need to consider the influence of both annual and supra-annual seasonality when developing best practices for the sustainable management.

AB  - Taxonomy is a dynamic and evolving scientific field in biological and paleontological research, which describes and systematises species and other taxa and thus lays the foundation to solve and structure biological questions. The study of past (fossil) and modern (present) seafloor traces holds huge potential for understanding the composition, behavioural ecology, and ecosystem impact of benthic communities, e.g., in terms of bioturbation and carbon cycling. In trace fossil research (paleoichnology), ichnotaxonomical analysis is based on the application of ichnotaxobases, morphology being the most important and useful criterion. However, marine neoichnological analyses (modern traces; lebensspuren) have no standardised ichnotaxobases. In the literature, classification based on morphological descriptions or behavioural assignations can be found, but without consensus. This lack of standardised terminology hinders comparisons among studies and regions. Through this manuscript, we discuss the limitations of marine lebensspuren characterisation through underwater observations and how further classification could be done (i.e., possible ichnotaxobases). Considering that most of the classifications will be based on marine still images, we propose a classification for marine lebensspuren based on a combination of three labels: 1) morphology (e.g., M-ridged trail), 2) behaviour determination (e.g., locomotion and feeding), and 3) tracemaker taxonomy (e.g., Echinocrepis rostrata). Accordingly, the classification will be 1) M-ridged trail 2) Locomotion and feeding 3) Echinocrepsis rostrata. A set of recommendations is given to address all three labels. Also, we describe some of the contrasting positions of paleo- and neoichnology, particularly where a solution presently seems difficult to find, and argue that open nomenclature could be useful as still images contain large amounts of information. Finally, we provide examples of the usage of this classification for input to a marine lebensspuren online repository and how this nomenclature can help to compare worldwide lebensspuren in a consistent way.

AB  - Interspecific competition, a fundamental ecological process characterized by negative interactions between species, plays a vital role in shaping ecological communities. Despite the co-occurrence of the snow leopard Panthera uncia and the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx across vast landscapes in Asia, their interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how the presence of snow leopards affected site-use by lynx and whether the presence of snow leopards resulted in behavioral adaptations by the lynx. Between 2017 and 2022, we conducted camera trap-based surveys across six sites in southern Mongolia and evaluated species co-occurrence by snow leopards and lynx using the occupancy framework. We assumed snow leopards to be the dominant species while using topographical and land cover variables as covariates. Our results show that the presence of snow leopards influenced site-use by lynx, leading to a shift in space use when snow leopards were present. Specifically, lynx used the entire range of ruggedness and did not select for shrubby areas in the absence of snow leopards, whereas they avoided rugged areas and had a strong preference for shrubby areas when snow leopards were present. Our findings emphasize the influence a larger predator can have on the space use of a smaller predator, and how the presence of snow leopards can alter the space-use of lynx. Understanding these interactions and behavioral adaptations can be useful for developing effective conservation strategies in the region.

AB  - Conservation managers frequently set goals and monitor progress toward them. This often becomes a routine annual exercise, and periodic reflection over longer periods is done less often, if at all. We report on the annual monitoring of fire patterns in the Kruger National Park between 2012 and 2020, and examine how these compared with desired thresholds of spatial extent and intensity. These thresholds were based on decades of research and were aimed at achieving specific ecological outcomes. The patterns were outside of thresholds in two out of five fire management zones. In one (Zone 1), the goal was to encourage frequent burning, and this was marginally not achieved due to a severe drought during the period assessed. In Zone 3, a reduction in extent and intensity was desired, but thresholds for both were substantially exceeded. An exceedance in any given year might not trigger a management response, but if this occurs over multiple years it should trigger an examination of whether these exceedances affected the desired ecological outcomes. On reflection, we recommend that current management in four zones need not change, but that Zone 3 would require appropriate interventions. The available options can simultaneously produce positive and negative conservation outcomes, so trade-offs become necessary. By reflecting on research findings and management challenges, the advantages and disadvantages of available options have become clear, providing a basis for prioritization and compromise.

AB  - Reeves' muntjac, either deliberately released or escaped from collections, was present in a few areas of southern England in low numbers by the 1960s and was generally regarded as a benign introduction. As their numbers and distribution increased their impact on amenity woodland, forest plantations, ground flora and their potential competition with native herbivores became apparent. Their reproductive capabilities and ability to thrive in various habitats enabled them to become extremely successful invasive aliens, now established throughout much of England (887 10 km squares, almost all contiguous, in 2016), and a few locations in Wales and Northern Ireland. The species is included within the E.U. list of Invasive Aliens of Union Concern stemming from Regulation (EU) 1143/2014. The UK has the longest experience with free-living muntjac, so it is useful to examine in detail the history of introduction, subsequent spread and aspects of its ecology. This offers a useful case-history and exemplar for possible future range expansion in other European countries where the species is now becoming better-established.

AB  - 1. Tropical tree communities are among the most diverse in the world. A small number of genera often disproportionately contribute to this diversity. How so many species from a single genus can co-occur represents a major outstanding question in biology. Niche differences are likely to play a major role in promoting congeneric diversity, but the mechanisms of interest are often not well-characterized by the set of functional traits generally measured by ecologists.
   2. To address this knowledge gap, we used a functional genomic approach to investigate the mechanisms of co-occurrence in the hyper-diverse genus Ficus. Our study focused on over 800 genes related to drought and defence, providing detailed information on how these genes may contribute to the diversity of Ficus species.
   3. We find widespread and consistent evidence of the importance of defence gene dissimilarity in co-occurring species, providing genetic support for what would be expected under the Janzen-Connell mechanism. We also find that drought-related gene sequence similarity is related to Ficus co-occurrence, indicating that similar responses to drought promote co-occurrence.
   4. Synthesis. We provide the first detailed functional genomic evidence of how drought-and defence-related genes simultaneously contribute to the local co-occurrence in a hyper-diverse genus. Our results demonstrate the potential of community transcriptomics to identify the drivers of species co-occurrence in hyper-diverse tropical tree genera.

AB  - Context. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) sometimes occurs as an overabundant folivore in south-eastern Australia, where high-density populations have caused defoliation of preferred food trees, threatening habitat. Kangaroo Island, South Australia and Budj Bim National Park, Victoria, are two regions where such eruptive population dynamics have arisen. One way of mitigating their damage is through management via fertility control.
   Aims. This paper examines the outcomes of fertility control (surgical sterilisation and treatment with levonorgestrel implants) on breeding dynamics at the population level, using data obtained from two separate koala management programs conducted by State Government wildlife agencies, South Australia Department for Environment and Water and Parks Victoria.
   Methods. The relationships between female body condition, reproductive status, fertility control, age and population density were examined using linear mixed effects models. Population density (koalas/ha) was estimated using annual census data and modelled in a Bayesian framework.
   Key results. Body condition was a key influence on breeding success in female koalas, with sexual maturity being defined by both age and body condition, whereas the effect of reproductive experience was minimal. It is likely that reduced densities have led to decreased intraspecific competition for food resources and territory, leading to increased breeding success at one management site (BBNP) and by allowing females to begin breeding at a lower overall body condition. The reduction in densities to sustainable levels at both management sites, despite differing fertility-control methods, supports the use of the less invasive and more cost-effective levonorgestrel implants as the preferred fertility-control method.
   Conclusions. In addition to contraceptive effects, broad-scale fertility control may have resulted in a compensatory higher breeding success in the untreated population, possibly in response to decreasing densities, increased resource availability or behavioural responses to population management.

AB  - Simple Summary Buffalo is a domesticated large ruminant that can be raised for beef, dairy, and work. In some systems, these animals can be raised with a dual purpose (beef and dairy). The present review describes the characteristics of the dual-purpose water buffalo production system in Mexico's humid wetlands. This article provides extensive information on the water buffalo and includes comparisons with other species to note similarities and differences. The aim is to describe the buffalo handling procedures used in this system, particularly during breeding, milking, confinement, and mobilization, relating them to the neurological processes involved and analyzing the productive results. Understanding these processes will allow us to obtain a more precise vision of the advantages that this species can offer, and the possible implications of the development of this type of livestock under tropical conditions.
   Abstract The purpose of this paper is to describe the characteristics of the dual-purpose water buffalo production based on the Mexican production system as a model in tropical wetlands. It includes a broad literature review emphasizing the most recent and specialized publications examining key findings to improve our understanding in the performance of the buffalo species (Bubalus bubalis). The complementary topics addressed include reproductive management, parturition, the dam-calf bond, milking routines, and models of confinement and management, in addition to aspects related to milk commercialization. This article summarizes the advances made to date in this production system and its current margins for improvement. The development of dual-purpose water buffalo production systems in Mexico's tropical wetlands is a relatively recent phenomenon that has progressed and improved due to herd management. Buffaloes are an interesting alternative for dual purpose systems that offer several advantages. The lower milk production of this species compared to cattle is its main limitation. However, the properties of their milk allow one to obtain an added value and make this type of farms competitive. In synthesis, consolidating buffalo production in Mexico's tropical wetlands will require broadening our knowledge of this species, and perfecting the most appropriate handling procedures. The activities of government agencies and processing enterprises will play vital roles in achieving the integral modernization of this potentially important economic activity.

AB  - Background The world's fast disappearing mangrove forests have low plant diversity and are often assumed to also have a species-poor insect fauna. We here compare the tropical arthropod fauna across a freshwater swamp and six different forest types (rain-, swamp, dry-coastal, urban, freshwater swamp, mangroves) based on 140,000 barcoded specimens belonging to ca. 8500 species. Results We find that the globally imperiled habitat "mangroves" is an overlooked hotspot for insect diversity. Our study reveals a species-rich mangrove insect fauna (>3000 species in Singapore alone) that is distinct (>50% of species are mangrove-specific) and has high species turnover across Southeast and East Asia. For most habitats, plant diversity is a good predictor of insect diversity, but mangroves are an exception and compensate for a comparatively low number of phytophagous and fungivorous insect species by supporting an unusually rich community of predators whose larvae feed in the productive mudflats. For the remaining tropical habitats, the insect communities have diversity patterns that are largely congruent across guilds. Conclusions The discovery of such a sizeable and distinct insect fauna in a globally threatened habitat underlines how little is known about global insect biodiversity. We here show how such knowledge gaps can be closed quickly with new cost-effective NGS barcoding techniques.

AB  - Our analyses utilized data from the latest National Forest Inventory conducted in Slovak forests in 2015-2016. Specifically, we included data on approximately 21,737 trees grown on forest land and 3,342 trees on non-forest land, all with a height of up to 1.3 meters. Browsing emerged as the second most frequent limiting factor for regeneration on forest land, following light deficiency, whereas on non-forest land, it ranked third after ground vegetation and light deficiency. Our results revealed the highest browsing rates on goat willow (47.8%), silver fir (39.3%), and rowan (35.1%). Conversely, certain commercial tree species exhibited relatively low browsing rates, notably Norway spruce (13.9%), European beech (8.1%), and oaks (6.2%). Among abiotic factors, exposition and slope were found to be significant, the south aspect was associated with the highest browsing rates, while browsing rates decreased with increasing slope steepness. Planted trees were more frequently browsed than those of natural origin. At the same time, higher trees (height between 0.5 m and 1.3 m) were browsed more frequently than small trees (under 0.5 m). Furthermore, significant differences in browsing frequency were observed among specific territories (hunting sub-regions), with the heaviest browsing occurring in the southwestern and northeastern parts of Slovakia, as well as in the Rimavsk & aacute; Sobota district. Given that reducing browsing pressure primarily relies on hunting activities, which are outside the forestry sector, close collaboration between foresters and hunters is essential. Additionally, hunting strategies in the near future must consider also the needs of other sectors such as forestry, agriculture, and nature conservation.

AB  - Males usually compete to gain access to prospective mates. Through this male-male competition, superior males have a higher chance of passing on their traits to the next generation of male offspring. One category of male traits is armaments, which are weapons used during competition, for example, the chelae of fiddler crabs and the antlers of deer. One consequence of intrasexual selection is the exaggerated evolution of armaments, which can be limited by trade-offs, such as trade-offs with male body size. Here, we formulate a game-theoretic sexual selection model to explore the exaggerated evolution of armaments through male-male competition. The model is used to determine how competition affects the evolution of an armament that is subject to trade-offs. Our simulation can be used to support the exaggerated evolution hypothesis, that is, male-male competition escalates the rate of evolution of armaments.

AB  - Culicoides (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae) are small biting midges and are known as vectors for many arboviruses, including bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV). Tengchong County of Yunnan Province, China, which borders Myanmar, has many private farms with goats, sheep, and cattle. To estimate the risk of Culicoides-borne viral diseases such as bluetongue (BT) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in this area, an investigation of the diversity and abundance of Culicoides in Tengchong between May 2024 and April 2025 was performed. As a result, 70 collections totaling approximately 93,000 Culicoides were carried out at five farms (cattle + Asian buffaloes, goats, and sheep, respectively). Nineteen species were identified, and eight potential cryptic species were found. A total of 13 cox1 sequences and 4 28S sequences for 13 specimens were generated. The most dominant species were Obsoletus (44.1%), C. homotomus (23.3%), and C. arakawae (12.9%) at the bovine farm; C. tainanus (68.0%), C. orientalis (12.6%), and C. newsteadi (Asia) (6.3%) at the goat farm; and C. tainanus (73.6%), C. fenggangensis (7.3%), and C. sp. nr palpifer (6.3%) at the sheep farm. In this investigation, C. tainanus, Obsoletus, and C. orientalis were the most dominant potential BTV vectors, and the period between July and October may be the main period for epidemics of Culicoides-borne viruses in Tengchong.

AB  - Rabies is one of the zoonoses with the most significant impact on domestic herbivores, representing a mortality of 100,000 individuals and an economic loss of US$97 million per year in Latin America. The common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is the primary reservoir for livestock rabies and is naturally distributed in Latin America. The concern arises from the possibility that climate change could facilitate the species' arrival to the southern USA. In this study, we used ecological niche modeling to estimate the distribution of D. rotundus in the present time and under future climate change scenarios. We analyzed whether rabies cases in Mexico were related to D. rotundus climatic suitability, and other factors such as livestock density and an ecological impact index. Our results suggest that climate change could facilitate the colonization of new sites in northern Mexico and the southern USA, which could threaten animal and human health. Further, we found that rabies cases are explained mainly by the reservoir suitability. However, national- and state-level policies may also play a key role in explaining the rabies cases in Mexico. There is a possibility that D. rotundus may expand its range to northern and northeastern Mexico, implying a high risk for the presence of rabies virus-free areas in the southern USA.

AB  - Migration is an evolutionarily stable adaptation when movement costs are outweighed by fitness gains. Migration is defined as the predictable movement between seasonal ranges in response to differential resource availability. However, migrations to locate suitable mates, and calving or nursery grounds are also common across taxa. For ungulates, the growth of new vegetation (i.e., green-wave) has been identified as a key mechanism influencing migration between seasonal ranges. We investigated how the green-wave influenced migration in a wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) population in northern Alberta, Canada, while also considering risk of calf predation by wolves (Canis lupus). Each year, all collared females in the population migrated an average of 28-kilometers over 6-days to a region at the western edge of their annual range between late-May and early-June. By late-June they migrated back to their core range, averaging a 40-kilometer migration distance over 10-days. We found that the green-wave influenced both the timing of migration and selection of habitats during migration. Risk of predation was not found to influence habitat selection during migration. However, the herd congregating and leaving their spring range as a group suggests risk of predation may be an evolutionary mechanism contributing to this migratory behavior. The timing of migration and congregation aligns with the expected timing of parturition giving further support that both the green-wave and predation risk influence migration. We provide a framework to assess interrelated mechanisms influencing migration, which is important to those studying, managing, and/or conserving migratory ungulates.

AB  - Callitropsis nootkatensis (D. Don) Oerst. ex D.P. Little and Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don are ecologically and culturally important tree species in the forests of Southeast Alaska, and there is great interest in maintaining both species across the landscape. This study investigated the impact of browsing and nearby vegetation as a potential limitation for regenerating both species. Three different stock types of both species were planted on five recently clearcut sites. There were four browsing treatments, including a control, chemical repellent, physical protection, and delayed planting until after the spring browsing season. Browsing levels varied among sites, and on sites with higher browsing levels only seedlings with tree shelters benefited from browsing protection. Browsing during the first year was lower for seedlings with obstructions and slash that limited accessibility for deer. Seedlings protected from browsing by tree shelters and slash exhibited greater height and diameter and lower probabilities of seedling mortality after eight growing seasons. On the site with low incidence of severe browsing, most seedlings grew well regardless of browsing treatments. The benefits of larger seedling stock were evident eight years after planting on all sites. The results suggest good regeneration potential for both species in clearcuts with low browsing levels. In contrast, on sites with higher browsing levels, installing tree shelters at time of planting appears to be an effective treatment to reduce the impact of browsing on seedling growth and survival.

AB  - Human -elephant conflict (HEC) is a significant issue in Sri Lanka and many parts of the world where elephants and humans coexist. To address HEC, this study integrates remote sensing and GIS analysis, focusing on monitoring changes in greenery. The study prepared the latest land cover and land use (LCLU) maps with Sentinel -2 satellite data, correlating them with reported HEC incidents reported in 2021 and 2022 to identify HEC hotspots in two forest -dominated regions of Southeast Sri Lanka. High -resolution sentinel -2 satellite imagery were used to detect areas of human activities and elephant habitats in proximity to each other. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification methods were used for LCLU classification. The overall accuracy of the classification was 97.31 and 94.62, and kappa was 0.95 and 0.90 for RF and SVM, respectively. Multi -temporal normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis provided insights into vegetation health and coverage, offering a clear picture of greenery changes. Monthly changes in vegetation cover readings were quantified using NDVI values derived from MODIS data, identifying suitable regions for elephants to forage frequently. Furthermore, Kernel density estimation identified high -density areas for reported incidents of human and elephant deaths. This process involved assigning weight to conflict incidents within a 5 km radius, considering the proximity to the forest, and evaluating greenery changes using NDVI values, revealing varying levels of HEC risk, ranging from very high to low. The LCLU map, created using the RF classifier, indicates that all potential HEC hotspots for very high and high HEC risks are closely aligned with forest boundaries. The findings support HEC mitigation strategies through community awareness, HEC hotspots mapping and restoration practices to ensure a sustainable human -elephant coexistence. This method will help policymakers in wildlife conservation to identify high risk HEC zones to support HEC mitigation. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of integrating remote sensing and GIS techniques in demarcating HEC hotspots in Sri Lanka to support conflict mitigation efforts.

AB  - We examined the cultural significance of commensal avian scavenger species-vultures, kites, and crows-and their exploitation of anthropogenic resources and sentiments within Delhi's urban landscapes. For this, we investigated the intrinsic values attributed to these birds by people, which are indicative of complex, rapidly urbanizing social-ecological systems. Semi-structured interviews revealed folk perceptions intertwined with socio-cultural narratives and traditions, shaped by observations of avian morphology, ecology, and behavior. Birds' nesting habits, habitats, home ranges, and foraging behaviors affected people's perceptions, while ecosystem services inspired zoomorphism and anthropomorphism via vernacular-nomenclature (e.g., chidiya collectively for songbirds, giddha for scavenging raptors). Culturally rooted perceptions, which informed ritual feeding practices and shaped prevalent attitudes toward commensal species, fostered mutual tolerance, and brought people into closer contact with urban biodiversity. Such physical and cultural proximity is a defining characteristic distinguishing tropical urban ecosystems from their Western counterparts. We also uncovered the web of social-technological influences on animal-related folk stories. The urbanization of perceptions in vulture extinction zones revealed shifts in social-ecological relationships with wildlife. It adds cultural dimensions to the currently appreciated keystone status of vultures, vital for their erstwhile co-existence at extremely high densities in South Asia. Urban transformations, technological advancements, and media exposure potentially reshaped human-animal interface, with media misinformation affecting personalized ecologies. Conflicts and health concerns arose from media narratives on garbage-consuming animals. Our findings offer insights to prevent severing of people and nature connections due to urbanization (e.g., technological applications can integrate scientific knowledge with biocultural narratives and folklore), promoting a newage eco-literacy.

AB  - Understanding habitat selection is critical for the conservation of ungulate species. Our aim was to (1) quantify herd-specific habitat selection for American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in the southwestern United States and (2) produce a habitat suitability map that can aid in the prioritization of management actions. We used GPS telemetry locations for individual pronghorn from 2007-2013 representing six herds and remotely sensed habitat covariates to model habitat selection. To determine the effect of each habitat covariate on habitat selection, we fit integrated step selection functions (iSSFs) to the data for each pronghorn herd using a mixed-effects modeling framework. We included random effects of individual pronghorn to account for intra-specific variability in selection. We used the coefficient values from iSSFs to produce a habitat suitability map averaged across the six herds and then evaluated the predictions against data from independently tracked pronghorn herds. Our findings indicated that while there is between-herd variability in pronghorn habitat selection in northern Arizona, there were also some common relationships. All herds selected for areas with a greater proportion of grassland and shrubland, however the magnitude of that selection varied between herds. Most herds also selected areas with low topographic diversity and a lower proportion of developed land with different magnitudes of response between herds. The responses to these two covariates seem to be related to function responses to local limiting factors. The average habitat suitability map indicated large swaths of unsuitable area separating some herds with large areas of habitat in the northeast. Our results demonstrate the importance of investigating herd-level variation in habitat selection analyses for herd-forming species, meaning managers can make decisions that are tailored to a herd's unique situation but also contextualize those decisions within conservation efforts across the landscape.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is a critical factor influencing the survival and ecological roles of large terrestrial herbivores within dynamic ecosystems. Yet, the increasing fragmentation of habitats due to human activities, such as agricultural expansion and infrastructure development, disrupts natural movement patterns and limits access to essential resources. This is particularly concerning in mesic protected areas, where moderate rainfall supports diverse vegetation but is often bordered by human-dominated landscapes. To address this challenge, the use of Spatial Absorbing Markov Chain (SAMC) provides a robust framework to simulate the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) dispersal and identify critical connectivity nodes within fragmented landscapes. Additionally, assessing and understanding the regenerative potential of these landscapes is vital for evaluating their capacity to sustain wildlife populations and maintain ecological balance. The objectives of this study were to (i) model the ecological connectivity of Mana Pools National Park (MPNP) by assessing spatial and functional linkages among African savannah elephant herds and (ii) predict the regenerative potential of the park's range. We used multi-temporal satellite data (2003, 2013, and 2023), GPS collar data, road transects, and plot-based surveys. The study employed a cellular automata artificial neural network (CA-ANN) to forecast the regenerative potential of the range. Connectivity maps illuminated vital pathways that sustain the elephants' migratory and foraging behaviours, underscoring the holistic interplay of land cover, slope, and terrain in shaping movement patterns. The study identified core micro-corridors and broader sub-landscape linkages essential for maintaining the park's ecological vitality. This interconnectedness serves as a testament to the resilience and regenerative power of the semi-arid savannah. CA-ANN projections predicted a high landscape regenerative capacity by the year 2083. Highlighting diverse geographical priorities for connectivity conservation, the research advocates for integrated, multi-scale actions to preserve these vital linkages. Such insights are pivotal in nurturing the relational integrity of MPNP, ensuring its long-term viability as a sanctuary for elephants and other coexisting life forms. By integrating connectivity modelling and habitat regeneration predictions, this study advances conservation strategies. It highlights the importance of maintaining functional landscapes to preserve ecosystem resilience, enhance biodiversity, and mitigate human-wildlife conflicts in increasingly fragmented ecosystems.

AB  - We report the first record of mutual allogrooming in free-ranging wild northern red muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis) from dense tropical forests of Similipal Tiger Reserve, Odisha, India. This observation is similar to reciprocal allogrooming behaviour between social partners, reported only in Impala (Aepyceros melampus) in free-ranging conditions. We video-recorded cooperative allogrooming between two female (one adult and another juvenile) northern red muntjacs. Behavioural quantification suggests that although both individuals exchanged equal numbers of grooming bouts, the adult female received a greater share of grooming time and episodes, respectively. The time spent on grooming as well as the number of tongue strokes delivered were found to be negatively correlated between the two individuals. The grooming pattern could possibly be attributed to kin selection and detailed work is required to understand this behaviour in this poorly-studied primitive deer. Our record indicates the possible existence of cooperative allogrooming in other ungulates of the Order Artiodactyla.

AB  - Grasslands are globally declining due to habitat conversion, overgrazing, climate change, and changes in fire and drought regimes. Degraded grasslands are less able to support wildlife species, which contributes to the imperilment of many species. Biosolids are used by some ranchers as an organic amendment to support more plant growth and in turn more livestock. We worked on a large cattle ranch in central British Columbia, Canada, to determine how biosolids amendment affected small mammal populations, as mice and voles are major prey for many predators and contribute to seed dispersal and underground dynamics. We found that biosolids-amended pastures had more grass cover and supported fewer deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus) than did unamended pastures. Voles were scarce, likely due to a cyclic low. Although we sampled sites that had had biosolids applied 1 or 3 years prior to our work started, deermouse populations were similarly low across these sites. The reduction in deermice on sites with biosolids relative to unamended sites could be a signal of habitat restoration, because deermice prefer disturbed habitats rather than ones with high plant cover. Grass cover was more than twice as high on sites amended with biosolids, making these sites less suitable for deermice.

AB  - The Paleozoic evolution of a complex terrestrial biota has been among the most important events in Earth history. Here, we synthesize paleontological and neontological information across the different threads of the biota-including microbial life, fungi, animals, and plants-addressing discrepancies between the fossil record and time-calibrated molecular phylogenies. Four fundamental patterns are emphasized: (1) Most terrestrial animal lineages consist of diminutive inhabitants of soil and litter, with the soil fauna exhibiting remarkable continuity between the Paleozoic and present. (2) Faunal evolution tracks the ecological opportunities afforded by the evolution of the land flora. Flora and fauna alike were initially confined to the thin interface between soil and air, but animals explored both flight and burrowing as vascular plant size increased to encompass tree stature and deep rooting. (3) Skewed nutrient ratios of land plants present a fundamental challenge for animals that are accommodated through contrasting size-based dietary strategies. Detritivory and cell-by-cell herbivory are the diets most readily available for primary consumers but impose limits on the largest possible body sizes; only with subsequent evolution of herbivory in insects and then vertebrates could the dramatic increases in size in the Permian and Mesozoic have been achieved. (4) A second pulse of animal terrestrializations is apparent in the Cretaceous and Cenozoic that might be attributed to increased terrestrial productivity associated with angiosperm evolution. However, environmental changes to nutrient availability earlier in the Mesozoic prevent an unambiguous causal attribution, and the pulse may just be an artifact of our modern vantage point.

AB  - Variation in behavior within marine and terrestrial species can influence the functioning of the ecosystems they inhabit. However, the contribution of social behavior to ecosystem function remains underexplored. Many coral reef fish species provide potentially insightful models for exploring how social behavior shapes ecological function because they exhibit radical intraspecific variation in sociality within a shared habitat. Here, we provide an empirical exploration on how the ecological function of a shoaling surgeonfish (Acanthurus triostegus) may differ from that of solitary conspecifics on two Pacific coral reefs combining insight from behavioral observations, stable isotope analysis, and macronutrient analysis of gut and fecal matter. We detected important differences in how the social mode of A. triostegus affected its spatial and feeding ecology, as well as that of other reef fish species. Specifically, we found increased distance traveled and area covered by shoaling fish relative to solitary A. triostegus. Additionally, shoaling A. triostegus primarily grazed within territories of other herbivorous fish and had piscivorous and nonpiscivorous heterospecific fish associated with the shoal, while solitary A. triostegus grazed largely grazed outside of any territories and did not have any such interactions with heterospecific fish. Results from stable isotope analysis show a difference in delta 15N isotopes between shoaling and solitary fish, which suggests that these different social modes are persistent. Further, we found a strong interaction between social behavior and site and carbohydrate and protein percentages in the macronutrient analysis, indicating that these differences in sociality are associated with measurable differences in both the feeding ecology and nutrient excretion patterns. Our study suggests that the social behavior of individuals may play an important and underappreciated role in mediating their ecological function.

AB  - Snaring poses a significant threat to terrestrial animals in many parts of Southeast Asia. However, long-term population monitoring data to determine the impact of snaring on wildlife populations is limited. We used distance sampling to estimate wildlife densities and population trends and data collected from ranger patrols to assess snare numbers across two protected areas in Cambodia's Eastern Plains Landscape. We found that the populations of three ungulate species, including the globally endangered banteng (Bos javanicus), steeply declined as snare numbers appeared to increase. In the same time period, the populations of two globally threatened arboreal primates remained similar or increased. Our findings indicate that snaring likely impacts ground-dwelling ungulates whilst sparing arboreal primates. Current ungulate densities are at critically low levels with several species at the brink of extirpation in our study area. We recommend urgent and comprehensive conservation actions to restrict snaring and prevent irreversible wildlife population collapses in this landscape and across the broader region.

AB  - Urbanization is a global threat to biodiversity due to its large impact on environmental changes. Recently, urban environmental change has been shown to impact the evolution of many species. However, much remains unknown about how urban environments influence evolutionary processes and outcomes due to the non-linearity and discontinuity of environmental variables along urban-rural gradients. Here, we focused on the evolution of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production and its components (presence/absence of cyanogenic glycosides and the hydrolytic enzyme linamarase) in the herbaceous plant white clover Trifolium repens, which thrive in both urban and rural areas. To comprehensively elucidate how plants evolve and adapt to heterogenous urban environments, we collected 3299 white clover plants from 122 populations throughout Sapporo, Japan. We examined the spatial variation in environmental factors, such as herbivory, sky openness, impervious surface cover, snow depth, and temperature, and how variation in these factors was related to the production of HCN, cyanogenic glycosides, and linamarase. Environmental factors showed complex spatial variation due to the heterogeneity of the urban landscape. Among these factors, herbivory, sky openness, and impervious surface cover were highly related to the frequency of plants producing HCN in populations. We also found that impervious surface cover was related to the frequency of plants producing cyanogenic glycosides, while herbivory pressure was not. As a result, the cyanogenic glycoside frequency showed a clearer trend along urban-rural gradient rather than HCN frequency, and thus, the predicted spatial distributions of HCN and cyanogenic glycosides were inconsistent. These results suggest that urban landscape heterogeneity and trait multifunctionality determines mosaic-like spatial distribution of evolutionary traits.

AB  - In the past decades, agricultural land abandonment and declining land-use intensity became common, especially in the Mediterranean countries of southern Europe. In some areas, this development opened up possibilities for rewilding and the recolonisation or expansion of large mammal populations. Yet, in some instances, co-occurrence of wild mammals and free-ranging domestic herbivores might lead to potential conflicts. It is, therefore, necessary to study the ecological interactions between wild and domestic mammal species to understand the effects of land abandonment and rewilding on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Camera traps are an effective tool for studying species interactions and occupancy dynamics as they allow for long-term monitoring with minimal interference. We conducted a long-term monitoring programme with camera traps substantial land-use changes following the abandonment of agricultural areas in the past 60 years. While agro-pastoral activities, especially the breeding of free-ranging horses and

AB  - Grant's gazelles (Nanger granti) are classified as of least concern by the IUCN, although their number is declining due to several factors. A few research studies have been conducted on Grant's gazelle in Ethiopia. Thus, the present study was carried out to determine the population size and habitat association of Grant gazelle in the Ene Forest of western Ethiopia, comprising the dry and wet seasons. The study area was stratified into four habitats: woodland, mixed woodland, riverine forest, and grassland habitats. The data were collected using the direct observation technique. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson's chi-square (chi 2) test. The average estimated Grant gazelle population was 136 +/- 23 individuals, with a density of 9/km2. The adult male-to-adult female sex ratio was 1:1.40 and 1:1.26 during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The largest herd size (N = 6) was observed during the wet season, and the smallest (N = 4) was observed during the dry season. The highest numbers of Grant gazelles were observed in the grassland habitat during the wet season and in the woodland during the dry season. More Gazelles (N = 65) were observed in the woodland habitat compared to the other habitat types. The continued existence of the Grant's gazelle population in the area and the suitability of the environment depend significantly on ongoing assessments of habitat change and management intervention.

AB  - Although Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae) consumption has been considered a health hazard for many livestock species, its true feeding value for ruminants should not be disregarded. The present work describes the feeding behavior of 36 Criollo goats towards L. camara in the heterogeneous grazing/browsing context of the low deciduous forest (LDF). An observational methodology focusing on the bite-scale (frequency, size, height, and part of plant) was implemented for eight weeks. Almost all experimental goats (35 of 36) consumed freely and consistently L. camara, including bites (up to 30 cm) directed to leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. Goats possess anatomical, physiological, and behavioral strategies that help them select a wide range of plant species, and the nutritional context could play an important role on their dietary decisions. Considering the heterogeneity present in the LDF, mixing plant species, avoiding large intake of specific feed resources, and maintaining a constant intake of diverse plant secondary metabolites seems to be the foundation of goat feeding behavior. In conclusion, voluntary L. camara consumption by Criollo goats in the LDF is constant, albeit small. Future works should focus on its phytochemical profile and relationships with the nutritional and health status of goats.

AB  - Silvoarable agroforestry systems (AFS) with short rotation coppice strips (CS) combine fast-growing trees with croplands, offering potential biodiversity benefits in agricultural landscapes. However, their actual impact on biodiversity remains underexplored. This study investigated the use of CS within a modern silvoarable AFS in northern Germany by large and medium-sized mammals in different seasons (winter, summer) and various tree strip variants (Conventional, Aspen, Ecological). A total of ten species were detected during camera trapping surveys, including farmland (European hare) and forest species (e.g. pine marten, wildcat) along with generalists (e.g. beech marten, raccoon). The European hare showed the highest activity (detected on nearly 90% of days in winter and on all days in summer), followed by roe deer (almost 40% of days in winter and 80% in summer) and red fox (about 60% resp. 40% of days in winter/summer), while most other species were detected sporadically or only in one season. Mammal activity was higher in summer than in winter, with minor differences between the tree strip variants in both seasons. The results indicate that CS in modern AFS are used by a wide range of mammal species and could especially benefit the threatened European hare, while potentially supporting forest species like the strictly protected wildcat with regard to woodland connectivity. However, this study does not provide information on the habitat function and quality of CS compared to other habitats like hedgerows. Therefore, and due to the spatial and temporal limitations of the study, there is a great need for further research on the use of CS by mammals.

AB  - Forest ecosystem models, being widespread science tools and used for forest management decision support are usually evaluated individually against field data sets, while model intercomparison and joint evaluation studies are rare. We tested five forest models according to a harmonized protocol against data from nine forest compartments in the Sn?z?nik region, in Slovenia. The suite of models included stand-and landscape-scale, empirical and process-based models used across Europe. The test dataset originated from inventory data covering 50 years (tree measurements 1963, 1983 and 2013) and included annual harvesting records at tree level. Uncertainties in data and forest conditions were considered by defining 12 scenarios varying initial regeneration, browsing pressure and harvest modalities. We evaluated the models` ability to initialize forest conditions accurately, whether management interventions could be implemented based on harvest records, and how well basal area and diameter structure could be predicted. Simulation results for basal area development showed good to satisfactory performance for all models, at which SAMSARA2, SIBYLA and PICUS showed the best agreement. Comparison of simulated and observed diameter distributions showed good performance of ForClim, PICUS, SAMSARA2 and SIBYLA. Model output variability was between 6% and 24%, indicating the relevance to consider uncertainties that can be attributed to specific sources. There was no clear hierarchy between more empirical or more process based models regarding accuracy of stand development projections. The cohort-based landscape model LandClim showed the lowest stand-level accuracy and scenario sensitivity, but results nevertheless qualified it for complementary application at landscape scale. Within individual-based models, spatially explicit models seemed to be more suitable for heterogeneous mixed mountain forests. The findings demonstrated the usefulness of inventory datasets for model testing and intercomparison.

AB  - Conservation initiatives strive for reliable and cost-effective species monitoring.1-3 However, resource constraints mean management decisions are overly reliant on data derived from single methodologies, resulting in taxonomic or geographic biases.4 We introduce a data integration framework to optimize species monitoring in terms of spatial representation, the reliability of biodiversity metrics, and the cost of implementation, focusing on tigers and their principal prey (sambar deer and wild pigs). We combined information from unstructured ranger patrols, systematic sign transects, and camera traps in Sumatra's largest remaining tropical forest and used integrated community occupancy models to analyze this multifaceted dataset in a unified way. Data integration improved the precision of species occupancy estimates by 14%-42%, enhanced the accuracy of species inferences, expanded the spatial scope of inference to the landscape level, and cut operational costs up to 51-fold. Our framework demonstrates the underappreciated value of integrating unstructured observations with monitoring data derived from traditional wildlife surveys.

AB  - The ecological responses of plant populations along a successional gradient have been intensively examined; however, the evolutionary responses received much less attention. Here, I explored genetic changes of key phenotypic traits of a dominant clonal plant (Elytrigia atherica) along a saltmarsh successional gradient by collecting samples along the successional gradient in the high and low marsh and growing them in a common environment (greenhouse). Additionally, to explore whether changes in traits are driven by abiotic (e.g. clay thickness) and biotic (e.g. grazing intensity) variables along the successional gradient, I measured these two variables in the field. I found that clay thickness (a proxy of total nitrogen) increased along the successional gradient both in the high and low marsh; grazing intensity from hares (the most important herbivores) decreased along the successional gradient in the high marsh but did not change in the low marsh. Meanwhile, I found that growth in number of leaves and ramets decreased, while rhizome length increased, along the successional gradient for E. atherica collected from the high marsh. Opposite trends were found for E. atherica collected from the low marsh. Results suggest that, in the high marsh, herbivores may overrule nutrients to drive trait changes. That is, at the early successional stages, E. atherica had higher growth in number of leaves and ramets to compensate for high-intensity grazing. In the low marsh, nutrients may be the dominant driver for trait changes. That is, at the late successional stages, E. atherica had higher growth in number of leaves and ramets but shorter rhizomes to maximize its expansion under the favorable conditions (higher nutrient availability). Results suggest that ecologically important abiotic and biotic variables such as nutrients and herbivores may also have a substantial evolutionary impact on plant populations.

AB  - Char is any accretion in a river course that extends or establishes new land. A well -planned integrated land -use system combining woody perennials (agroforestry) can ensure sustainable, environmentally friendly climate resilience land -use systems and livelihood options on charland. To date, no systemic investigation of charland land agroforestry has been undertaken. A comprehensive study of the potential of agroforestry systems in charland areas was conducted using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Two methods were employed: structured questionnaire interviews and botanical surveys. Findings revealed that considerable variation exists in both charland and mainland areas in terms of socio-demographic characteristics. Both tree and agroforestry knowledge of mainland farmers is greater than that of charland farmers. Charland dwellers sell almost all their farm products, while most mainland farmers consume their products. Agroforestry-related communication between extension workers and farmers is limited in both ecosystems. However, farmer interaction with extension workers is far less common in charland areas. Mainland farmers are satisfied with their homestead production systems, whereas cha land farmers face huge problems with the free grazing of cattle and goats. Mainland farmers think quality planting materials and fencing systems are key issues. Leafy short -rotation vegetables and climbing vegetables are more common in charlands. Other common marketable vegetables are tomato, brinjal, carrot, cauliflower, and cabbage. All fruit trees common on charland are more frequently found in the mainland areas. In the case of timber, eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus camaldulensis ) is more common on charland, whereas mahogany ( Swietenia macrophylla ) frequency is higher in the mainland. Medicinal trees are uncommon in both ecosystems except for neem ( Azadirachta indica ). Through proper training and motivation of farmers, there is a vast scope to increase tree and vegetable diversity in charland farms.

AB  - Background Predicting how natural and anthropogenic drivers shape different ecological indicators, such as plant populations along environmental gradients, can be a relevant tool for establishing management and conservation criteria of tropical wetlands. We aimed to assess the effects of seasonal flood disturbance, type of grasslands and topographical conditions on Croton trinitatis population distribution in a tropical wetland. Methods The study was carried out in a seasonally flooded grassland (Central-West Brazil). We conducted samplings of soil on the dry and flood hydrophases of the Pantanal. We took the samples in eight seasonal ponds, with 1 km interval between them. Transects were marked during the flood period, observing the water level, one in the lowest zone, in the middle of the pond = low (ca. 60 cm deep), one at the pond edge = mid (ca. 30 cm deep) and one in the higher zone, on the external part = high (ca. 1 cm deep). Results The results showed that the topography, seasonality, and types of grassland determine differences in the abundance patterns of adult plants and seedlings, and seed bank and seed predation. The abiotic factors can shape plant population-related ecological processes and patterns, with outputs (germination and predation) and inputs (local dispersion and from neighbouring areas) of proportional seeds for the population maintenance in this environment. Conclusion We emphasize the importance of these findings, to show that abiotic factors are not the only ones to be considered in ecological studies of distribution and structuring of populations in habitats with extreme seasonal events.

AB  - Substituting chemical fertilizer with organic alternatives has been proven to improve soil fertility and crop yield and mitigate adverse environmental effects. However, the impact of different organic materials, such as animalsourced organic fertilizer (AOF) and plant-sourced organic fertilizer (POF), on soil quality index (SQI) and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) in perennial systems like tea plantations remains unclear. This study evaluated the impact of partially substituting (30 %) chemical fertilizer with AOF (SM, sheep manure; PM, pig manure; CM, cow manure) and POF (SC, soybean cake) on soil properties, enzyme activity, enzyme stoichiometry, SQI, and EMF in a tea plantation of China. Partial substitution with AOF improved soil pH, total C content, and (3-1,4-glucosidase, (3-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, and acid phosphatase activities. In contrast, chemical fertilizer alone (CF) and POF substitution reduced these parameters. Compared with the control, CF, and POF, AOF substitution treatments effectively alleviated soil microbial C limitation but increased N limitation. Additionally, all fertilizer treatments enhanced the SQI and EMF of the tea plantation. Among the organic treatments, partial substitution with AOF resulted in the maximum increase in SQI (60 %- 134 %) and EMF (157 %-177 %) compared with no fertilization, while POF substitution resulted in a comparatively lower improvement (53 % in SQI and 50 % in EMF). Random forest modeling identified five soil variables and eight enzyme variables as key contributors to the differences in EMF under partial organic substitution. Partial least squares path modeling further revealed that the changes in enzyme properties and microbial metabolic limitations directly influenced EMF in these treatments. Thus, the study proves that partially substituting chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers, especially composted manure, enhances the soil quality and ecosystem functionality of tea plantations. These findings provide a scientific basis for developing effective soil management strategies to improve crop production sustainably.

AB  - The Oostvaardersplassen nature reserve in the Netherlands is grazed by large herbivores. Due to their increasing numbers, the area became dominated by short grazed grasslands and biodiversity decreased. From 2018, the numbers are controlled to create a diverse landscape. Fine-scale mapping and monitoring of the aboveground biomass is a tool to evaluate management efforts to restore a heterogeneous and biodiverse area. We developed a random forest model that describes the correlation between field-based samples of aboveground biomass and fifteen height-related vegetation metrics that were calculated from high-density point clouds collected with a handheld LiDAR. We found that two height-related metrics (maximum and 75th percentile of all height points) produced the best correlation with an R-2 of 0.79 and a root-mean-square error of 0.073 kg/m(2). Grassland segments were mapped by applying a segmentation routine on the normalized grassland's digital surface model. For each grassland segment, the aboveground biomass was mapped using the point cloud and the random forest AGB model. Visual inspection of video recordings of the scanned trajectories and field observations of grassland patterns suggest that drift and stretch effects of the point cloud influence the map. We recommend optimizing data collection using looped trajectories during scanning to avoid point cloud drift and stretch, test horizontal vegetation metrics in the model development and include seasonal influence of the vegetation status. We conclude that handheld LiDAR is a promising technique to retrieve detailed height-related metrics in grasslands that can be used as input for semi-automated spatio-temporal modelling of grassland aboveground biomass for supporting management decisions in nature reserves.

AB  - Giant clams that protected by CITES Appendix II is the important marine organism as a stock in and also has potential as marine tourism. This study aims to analyze the potential of clams which are part of the coral reef ecosystem as an alternative ecotourism management of diving and snorkeling and analyzing appropriate management strategies for the development of tourism areas in Morella, Central Maluku. The method used for the analysis of clams is 1) the density of clams Di = ni / A; 2) diversity index H '= -(& sum;ni (ln (ni / N)); 3) dominance index D = & sum; [Ni / N] 2, and Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. There are five types of clams such as Tridacna maxima, T. squamosa, T. gigas, T. crocea and Hippopus hippopus. The widest distribuiton was T. maxima and the lowest was H. Hippopus. The population of clams was found at Lettang Beach with the most species being T. squamosa. The highest percentage of coral reef cover was found at Lubang Buaya Beach at 81.10% and the lowest at station I at 55.53%. The highest number of species of reef fish is found at Lettang Beach, which is 197 types. The management strategy that needs to be prioritized is integrated management, which takes into account all aspects of ecological, economic, social and institutional aspects.

AB  - We assessed changes in the population size, density, and diet composition of wolves inhabiting the Romincka Forest (RF), an area of 480 km2 situated along the state border between Poland, Russian Federation (Kaliningrad), and Lithuania. We compared the results of our research in 2020-2021 with data from other projects conducted since 1999. We found that both packs living in RF had transboundary territories. The number of packs was stable over 21 years; the average pack size almost doubled (from 4-4.5 to 7.5-8 wolves per pack); the total wolf numbers increased 1.8 times, reaching 15-16 wolves; and the density increased 1.5 times up to 3.1-3.3 wolves/100 km2 in winter 2020/2021. Our analyses of 165 scats revealed that beavers Castor fiber made up 45.6% of food biomass in the wolf diet in 2020, which was 3.4 times more than in 1999-2004 (n = 84 scats,13.4%). Wild ungulates constituted 44.8% of the wolf food biomass in 2020, 1.6 times less than before (71.1%). In our study, among wild ungulates, wolves primarily consumed roe deer Capreolus capreolus (22.6% of food biomass), then wild boars Sus scrofa (13.7%), and red deer Cervus elaphus (5.0%), while moose Alces alces was eaten rarely (0.4%). We also recorded domestic dogs (4.9% of food biomass) and cattle (3.1%). The food niche breadth was wider (B = 2.31) than in the earlier period (B = 1.84), and the Pianka index showed moderate similarity in food composition between both periods (alpha = 0.816). In November 2022, due to the migration crisis, a 199 km impermeable fence along the state border with Kaliningrad was erected, which blocked access to 48% of the RF area that was regularly used by the resident wolf packs. This may cause wolf numbers to decrease and isolation from the central part of the Baltic wolf population to which they belong, according to our DNA analyses.

AB  - Population dynamics are functions of several demographic processes including survival, reproduction, somatic growth, and maturation. The rates or probabilities for these processes can vary by time, by location, and by individual. These processes can co-vary and interact to varying degrees, e.g., an animal can only reproduce when it is in a particular maturation state. Population dynamics models that treat the processes as independent may yield somewhat biased or imprecise parameter estimates, as well as predictions of population abundances or densities. However, commonly used integral projection models (IPMs) typically assume independence across these demographic processes. We examine several approaches for modelling between process dependence in IPMs and include cases where the processes co-vary as a function of time (temporal variation), co-vary within each individual (individual heterogeneity), and combinations of these (temporal variation and individual heterogeneity). We compare our methods to conventional IPMs, which treat vital rates independent, using simulations and a case study of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). In particular, our results indicate that correlation between vital rates can moderately affect variability of some population-level statistics. Therefore, including such dependent structures is generally advisable when fitting IPMs to ascertain whether or not such between vital rate dependencies exist, which in turn can have subsequent impact on population management or life-history evolution.

AB  - Conventional fertilization in the greenhouses of North China used excessive amounts of chemical and organic fertilizer, resulting in soil degradation and severe agricultural non-point source pollution. A nine-year study was conducted on a loamy clay soil in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, to investigate the effects of reduced-fertilizer input regimes on soil property, bacterial diversity, nitrogen (N) cycling and their interactions. There were four treatments, including high organic + chemical fertilizer application rate and three reduced-fertilizer treatments with swine manure, maize straw or no substitution of 50% chemical N. Treatments with reduced-fertilizer input prevented soil salinization and acidification as in local conventional fertilization after being treated for nine years. In comparison to chemical fertilizer only, swine manure or maize straw substitution maintained higher nutrient availability and soil organic C contents. Fertilizer input reduction significantly increased bacterial richness and shifted bacterial community after nine years, with decisive factors of EC, Olsen P and C/N ratio of applied fertilizer. Soil chemical characteristics (EC, pH and nutrients), aggregation and C/N ratio of applied fertilizer selected certain bacterial groups, as well as N-cycling functions. Reduced-fertilizer input decreased the potential nitrification and denitrification functioning of bacterial community, but only in organic substitution treatments. The results of this study suggested that fertilizer input reduction combined with organic C input has potential in reducing non-point source pollution and increasing N-use efficiency in greenhouse vegetable production in North China.

AB  - IntroductionCystic echinococcosis (CE) is a serious global health concern. CE is an endemic zoonotic disease in Iran. The substantial genetic diversity of Echinococcus granulosus is closely linked to its life cycle, transmission mechanisms and pathogenesis. This study aimed to explore the phylogenetic structure of the genotypes of E. granulosus sensu lato (s.l.) in southwestern Iran (SWI).MethodsSeventy-two hydatid cyst samples were collected from various intermediate hosts, including goats, cattle, sheep, camels, buffalo and humans, primarily from the lungs, liver, spleen and heart of livestock slaughtered in local and industrial abattoirs, as well as from patients in several hospitals (Namazi, Golestan, Arvand and Shahid Beheshti) in southwestern Iran (Bushehr, Fars, Kohgiluyeh and Boyerahmad and Khuzestan provinces).ResultsSequence analysis revealed three genotypes of E. granulosus s.l. in the SWI: G1 (n = 69, 95.8%), G3(n = 1, 1.4%) and genotype like G6/G7 (n = 2, 2.8%). Twenty-one different haplotypes were identified in this study. According to the phylogenetic tree topology, the cox1 gene sequence similarities can be shown for some G1 and G6/G7 isolates in some vast areas, but these genotypes generally show a heterogeneous population worldwide. High similarity was shown between G3 isolates from some countries (Spain, Turkey, India and Iran) and different hosts (sheep, human and buffalo).ConclusionsThe presence of the G6/G7 genotype in the SWI may be due to the transmission of this genotype from other regions or the role of camel/wild boar and other possible intermediate hosts in the expansion of this genotype in the SWI. The results of the present study can be used in CE control programs, molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic studies in Iran and other countries for future goals.

AB  - Recolonization by native species following removal of invasive plant species can often be uneven and lead to the rapid increase of one or a few native plant species. This can result in the formation of a significant resource pulse that may consequently affect populations of herbivorous species and their natural enemies. Here we present results from observations of parasitism rates during a localized outbreak of the Asimina webworm moth, Omphalocera munroei, a locally monophagous herbivore of the common paw-paw. Asimina triloba. This outbreak initiated from locations of increased understory growth of A. triloba, following the removal of Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii ). Parasitism rates during the outbreak reached 50%, with higher parasitism rates observed in larvae collected at the end of the local outbreak relative to those the year following the peak of the outbreak. Parasitism rates remained high 3 y after the end of the local O. munroei outbreak, indicating >7 y of high parasitoid densities. O. munroei emerges late in the growing season, making it fairly inaccessible as a host or prey to many generalist predators/parasitoids, which emerge earlier the following year. This suggests the O. munroei outbreak potentially contributed to an increase in natural enemy pressure of other native species in the community.

AB  - Sheep and goat may become carriers of some zoonotic diseases. They are important livestock and experimental model animals for human beings. The fast and accurate identification of genetic materials originating from sheep and goat can prevent and inhibit the spread of some zoonotic diseases, monitor market product quality, and maintain the stability of animal husbandry and food industries. This study proposed a methodology for identifying sheep and goat common specific sites from a genome-wide perspective. A total of 150 specific sites were selected from three data sources, including the coding sequences of single copy genes from nine species (sheep, goat, cow, pig, dog, horse, human, mouse, and chicken), the dbSNPs for these species, and human 100-way alignment data. These 150 sites exhibited low intraspecific heterogeneity in the resequencing data of 1450 samples from five species (sheep, goat, cow, pig, and chicken) and high interspecific divergence in the human 100-way alignment data after quality control. The results were proven to be reliable at the data level. Using the process proposed in this study, specific sites of other species can be screened, and genome-level species identification can be performed using the screened sites.

AB  - Female abundance, which is directly related to population dynamics through recruitment, is crucial for population management, and female culling is an effective means of reducing populations. This study identified a method to preferentially attract females of a large herbivore based on sex differences in mineral requirements, with the aim of facilitating female culling. Given that female sika deer (Cervus nippon) experience greater sodium deficiency than males, we attempted to attract female deer using salt water. Containers filled with salt water (with water used as a control) were placed in a forest, and the numbers of occasions on which the adult deer drank from each container were counted. A total of 80 drinking occasions by adult deer were recorded, and 82.5% was drinking of salt water by female deer. Although females clearly preferred salt water to water, no such preference was seen in males. This indicates that salt water is an effective attractant that can promote female-biased culling of sika deer. The identification of minerals in which females tend to be deficient and use thereof for attraction may be beneficial for female-biased culling in a variety of herbivores. Our approach could serve as an efficient female-biased culling method to address declining herbivore populations.

AB  - The global decline of terrestrial species is largely due to the degradation, loss and fragmentation of their habitats. The conversion of natural ecosystems for cropland, rangeland, forest products and human infrastructure are the primary causes of habitat deterioration. Due to the paucity of data on the past distribution of species and the scarcity of fine-scale habitat conversion maps, however, accurate assessment of the recent effects of habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation on the range of mammals has been near impossible. We aim to assess the proportions of available habitat within the lost and retained parts of mammals' distribution ranges, and to identify the drivers of habitat availability. We produced distribution maps for 475 terrestrial mammals for the range they occupied 50 years ago and compared them to current range maps. We then calculated the differences in the percentage of 'area of habitat' (habitat available to a species within its range) between the lost and retained range areas. Finally, we ran generalized linear mixed models to identify which variables were more influential in determining habitat availability in the lost and retained parts of the distribution ranges. We found that 59% of species had a lower proportion of available habitat in the lost range compared to the retained range, thus hypothesizing that habitat loss could have contributed to range declines. The most important factors negatively affecting habitat availability were the conversion of land to rangeland and high density of livestock. Significant intrinsic traits were those related to reproductive timing and output, habitat breadth and medium body size. Our findings emphasize the importance of implementing conservation strategies to mitigate the impacts caused by human activities on the habitats of mammals, and offer evidence indicating which species have the potential to reoccupy portions of their former range if other threats cease to occur.
   This study investigates the impact of habitat degradation on terrestrial mammal species. By comparing historic and current distribution maps for 475 species, we found that 59% of them have less available habitat in their lost ranges, suggesting habitat loss contributed to range declines. Factors like land conversion to rangeland and high livestock density negatively affected habitat availability. Intrinsic traits such as reproductive timing, habitat breadth and medium body size also played a role.

AB  - Niche theory predicts high specialisation in species-rich environments such as neotropics, where plant-herbivore interactions are ubiquitous in all terrestrial systems. However, there is much to be explored on how different insect guilds respond to plant phenology in these specialised environments. Using a Fabaceae-herbivore community as an ecological model, we evaluated how plant phenology affects the abundance and shapes the temporal distribution of exophytic (folivore chewers) and endophytic (seed chewers) insects. We tested the specialisation hypothesis, predicting insect species on only one or a few host plants, with a seasonal pattern of occurrence, many rare and few abundant species. Additionally, we analysed the relationship between plant phenology and environmental factors (temperature and precipitation). We conducted fieldwork with five species and 97 individuals of Fabaceae in Brazilian Savannah and performed an insect-rearing study in the laboratory. We found an immediately synchronised relationship between endophytic insects and plant phenology in the dry season, whereas exophytic were throughout the year. Only six species from the exophytic guild, out of a total of 87 species for both guilds, fed on more than one host plant, showing a specialised network. Endophytic herbivores are more abundant, ephemeral and predictable than exophytic ones. We also found a negative relationship between fruiting and precipitation and a positive relationship between new leaves and temperature and precipitation. Our study shows that the temporal distribution of insect-herbivore guilds responds to plant phenology. In a scenario of global warming with effects on the annual precipitation, endophytic insects are most vulnerable to local extinction due to temporal changes in plant phenology than the exophytic ones.

AB  - Janzen-Connell effects state that the accumulation of host -specific natural enemies near parent plants can negatively affect their offspring. Negative plant -soil feedbacks can produce patterns of seedling performance predicted by Janzen-Connell effects and influence plant populations, but their relevance in field conditions remains unclear. Here, using spatial point -pattern analysis, we examine the spatial distribution of Jacobaea vulgaris to assess whether distance- and density -dependent predictions of Janzen-Connell effects are evident in the field. We established 27 replicated 64 m2 plots at two grassland sites and mapped positions of rosette -bearing and flowering J. vulgaris plants within each plot. To investigate temporal distribution patterns, we tracked plant positions repeatedly in three plots during a single season. Additionally, we tested whether these patterns are soilmediated. Soil samples were collected underneath flowering plants and at a distance of 0.5 meter, and used to compare seed germination, seedling survival, and growth under controlled conditions. Furthermore, we measured J. vulgaris growth in soil from patches with high J. vulgaris densities and in soil from areas outside these patches. The density of rosette -bearing plants was lower at close distances from flowering plants than expected from null models, suggesting negative distance -dependent plant recruitment. The degree of clustering decreased over time from rosette -bearing to flowering plants, indicating density -dependent self -thinning. Seed germination was higher in soil further away from flowering J. vulgaris plants than in soil underneath plants at one site, but soil distance was not an overall significant factor in explaining seed germination. However, seedling mortality and biomass did not differ between soils collected at the two distances, and plants produced similar biomass in soil collected from inside and outside J. vulgaris patches. Our study demonstrates conspecific distance- and densitydependent plant recruitment in J. vulgaris in the field, but we found no evidence this depends on belowground natural enemies.

AB  - Insect phenology consists of the timing of life events, as well as the number of generations (voltinism). While several studies have focused on the impact of climate on the timing of seasonal events, or the voltinism of single species, we have few insights into the factors that shape patterns of voltinism within ecological communities. Importantly, voltinism can have a major impact on population growth, species interactions, and rate of evolution. We investigated the relative importance of spatial variation in temperature and species traits in shaping patterns of voltinism within an herbivore community feeding on deciduous oaks across a temperature gradient in Europe. Voltinism increased with temperature, where the probability for a species to be univoltine decreased with temperature, whereas the probability for a species to be strictly multivoltine increased with temperature. The relative abundance of the first and subsequent generations of multivoltine species did not significantly change along the temperature gradient. Resource specialisation affected voltinism, where oligophagous and polyphagous species were more likely to be strictly multivoltine than narrow oligophagous species. Overwintering stage and body size did not affect voltinism, and there was no evidence that species traits influenced the relationship between temperature and voltinism. Our findings highlight that temperature and species traits shape variation in voltinism within an herbivore community associated with oak trees. These temperature-induced shifts in voltinism within the oak-associated herbivore community may have profound effects on the synchrony within and between trophic levels, and consequently for food web structure and outbreak dynamics.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has been implicated in global biodiversity declines. In the European Union, agri-environmental schemes are designed to address this. For pollinating insects, funding has been provided to sow wildflower mixes. However, previous research indicates that a suite of agricultural weeds are also of great importance to pollinators. Here, we compare the biodiversity associated with the species which are considered harmful to agricultural production and legally deemed as 'injurious' by the United Kingdom 1959 Weeds Act (common ragwort Jacobaea vulgaris, creeping thistle Cirsium arvense, spear thistle C. vulgare, curled dock Rumex crispus and broadleaved dock R. obtusifolius), with plant species recommended for pollinator-targeted agri-environmental options. In our field study, the abundance and diversity of pollinators visiting the weed species averaged twice that of the recommended plants and included the main insect orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera). This relationship was also seen in a meta-analysis of literature data, which indicates that fourfold more flower-visitor species and fivefold more conservation-listed species are associated with the weeds. Additionally, the literature shows that twice the number of herbivorous insect species are associated with these plants. We suggest that several factors are responsible for this pattern. Injurious weed species are widely distributed, their flower morphology allows access to a wide variety of pollinator species, and they produce, on average, four times more nectar sugar than the recommended plant species. Freedom of information requests to public bodies such as local councils, Natural England and Highways England indicate that c. 10 pound million per year is spent controlling injurious weeds. Meanwhile, the cost of the four pollinator-targeted agri-environmental options in the United Kingdom exceeds 40 pound m annually. Synthesis and applications. Our results clearly show that weeds have an underappreciated value to biodiversity. Unfortunately, current UK agricultural policy encourages neither land sparing for nor land sharing with weeds. The UK government is, however, currently committed to overhauling agricultural payments to encourage more wildlife- and climate-friendly practices. Thus, the challenge of reconciling the conflicts between agricultural production and these native and biodiverse species should be a renewed priority to land managers, researchers and policymakers.

AB  - The domestication of animals is a major milestone in human history and has been studied in various fields. Pig domestication, in particular, has been widely studied, and it is believed that India is one of at least six domestication centers. However, there is a lack of systematic studies using high-resolution genetic markers, including complete mitogenomes, to investigate the domestication and genetic roots of pigs in India. In the present study, we investigated the origin and evolution of Indian pigs using mitochondrial genetic data to complement archaeological data sets. The phylogenetic status of Indian pig breeds was determined by analyzing all available mitochondrial data, incorporating a global data set of 239 mitogenomes. The Bayesian and maximum likelihood tree analyses unveiled at least eight haplogroups diverging from three main branches, two of which are geographically restricted to India. We propose that the North Indian domestic haplogroup might represent an independent in situ domestication event in North India, probably dating before similar to 5,000 YBP. An additional North East Indian domestic haplogroup is nested within a widespread Asian clade that also includes Indian mitogenomes from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands that diverged more recently from distinct East and Southeast Asian roots. In conclusion, we propose that North Indian farmers could have been responsible for the independent domestication of local wild boars giving rise to the current domestic lineage identified in North India. At least one additional domestic lineage arrived in India more recently and remained mainly localized in the northeast. Domestic mitogenomes from the Indian islands show a notable connection with pig populations from Vietnam, and their arrival might be related to Austroasiatic-speaking human populations. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of pig domestication in India.

AB  - Untangling the abiotic and biotic feedback mechanisms driving animal movements and ranges is a core question in ecology, yet progress is hampered by inadequate modelling procedures. Here we show how a recently developed process-based modelling approach, combining step-selection functions and individual-based models, enables a flexible method to infer movement drivers and multi-scale emergent space use patterns. As a case study, we examine the movement behaviours of a highly invasive social generalist (wild pigs, Sus scrofa) in relation to conspecific space use and multiple land cover types in a complex agricultural landscape, showing that social interactions are predominantly more important to this species than selection for land cover. Thus, animal movement studies should not neglect the effects of sociality when inferring resource driven movements and, crucially, use multi-scale techniques that incorporate movement processes to untangle drivers of animal space use.

AB  - Improved climate-resilient strains of indigenous sheep and goats were introduced in the Nyando basin of western Kenya in 2013. This study evaluated the performance of the breeds five years after their first introduction, and their contribution to household revenues. Red Maasai and Red Maasai x Dorper sheep and Galla goats introduced in Nyando adapted to the environment and retained performance levels exhibited in their original environments. They have been widely adopted by the farmers and are used for upgrading local breeds through crossbreeding, yielding offspring that are 50% heavier than local breeds at one year of age. Costs for producing the small ruminants tend to increase with land size owned, mainly due to higher costs for managing the health of more livestock. The costs of producing goats are significantly higher than for sheep. Revenues accrued from goat milk contribute to 10% of the revenue from goats. The introduced breeds provided a significant productivity lift in the local livestock population, resulting in higher returns to the smallholder farmers. For long-term sustainability of the productivity gains, a community-based selective mating program using reference sire flocks with an overall goal of good growth, adaptability, and milk production should be adopted.

AB  - Dahongpao mother tree (Camellia sinensis) is nearly 400 years old and is the symbol of Wuyi rock tea. It is unclear whether the structure and function of the rhizosphere soil microbial community of Dahongpao mother tree (MD) and its cutting Dahongpao (PD) change after planting. In this study, macrogenomics was used to analyze the structure and function of rhizosphere soil microbial communities, as well as to explore their relationship with soil nutrient transformations in MD and PD tea trees. The results showed that pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, available nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium were significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil of MD than in PD by 1.22, 3.24, 5.38, 1.10, 1.52, 4.42 and 1.17 times, respectively. Secondly, soil urease, sucrase, protease, cellulase and catalase activities were also significantly higher in MD than in PD by 1.25-, 2.95-, 1.14-, 1.23-, and 1.30-fold. Macrogenomic analysis showed that rhizosphere soil microbial richness and diversity were higher in MD than in PD. There were eight characteristic microorganisms that significantly differed between MD and PD rhizosphere soils, and the results of functional analysis showed that MD rhizosphere soil microorganisms had higher carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus biotransformation capacity, were more conducive to the accumulation and release of nutrients in the soil, and were more conducive to the promotion of tea tree growth. The results of PLS-SEM equation analysis showed that characteristic microorganisms positively regulated soil microbial function (1.00**), enzyme activity (0.84*) and nutrient content (0.82*). It can be seen that the abundance of soil characteristic microorganisms in the rhizospehre soil of MD increased significantly compared with that of PD, prompting a significant enhancement of their corresponding functions, which was more conducive to soil improvement, increased soil enzyme activity, enhanced soil nutrient biotransformation, and then increased soil nutrient accumulation and effectiveness, and promoted the growth of tea trees. This study provides an important theoretical basis for microbial regulation of tea tree cuttings management.

AB  - The guanaco, a wild South American camelid, is renowned for its remarkable resilience to extreme conditions. Despite this, little is known about how reproductive hormones in female camelids are influenced during their seasonal breeding period, which occurs during long photoperiod. To explore this, the study investigated the response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in female guanacos during short days (10L:14D; July) and long days (16L:8D; December) in the Mediterranean ecosystem (33(degrees)38 ' 28 '' S, 70(degrees)34 ' 27 '' W). Blood samples from 14 adult animals were collected, and measurements of melatonin, 178-estradiol, FSH, and LH concentrations were taken. The results showed that melatonin concentration was lower (P < 0.05) during long days than short days, whereas 178-estradiol, FSH, and LH concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) during long days compared to short days. Furthermore, the study detected the expression of the melatonin receptor 1A and kisspeptin in the hypothalamus and pituitary, suggesting that the pineal gland of female guanacos is sensitive to seasonal changes in day length. These findings also indicate a seasonal variation in the concentration of reproductive hormones, likely linked to the distinct modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of female guanacos during short and long days.

AB  - Yak has evolved specific adaptative mechanisms to high-altitude environment. Up to date, only a few studies reported the DNA methylation in yak. In the present study, genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome profiles in lung, mammary, and biceps brachii muscle tissues were compared between yak and three cattle breeds (Tibetan cattle, Sanjiang cattle, and Holstein cattle). The association between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was analyzed, and the biological functions of DEGs potentially driven by DMRs were explored by KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, we found that yak-specific DMRs-driven DEGs were mainly involved in neuromodulation, respiration, lung development, blood pressure regulation, cardiovascular protection, energy metabolism, DNA repair, and immune functions. The higher levels of the key genes associated with these functions were observed in yak than in cattle, suggesting that DNA methylation might regulate these genes. Overall, the present study contributes basic data at the DNA methylation level to further understand the physiological metabolism in yak.

AB  - Atlas Barbary sheep, Ammotragus lervia lervia, are the only wild caprinid of Northwest Africa. Some studies have investigated their feeding ecology, but there is no information on intraspecific dietary variation. Therefore, we determined the spring diet and its variation between age-sex classes in Atlas Barbary sheep within a fenced nature reserve in the Western High Atlas mountain range, Morocco. We used faecal microhistological analysis to assess diet composition based on a reference epidermis catalogue. The habitat was a highly diversified open mixed forest with 61 identified species (55 genera; 24 families). The herbaceous layer was dominated by grasses, mainly Stipa capensis. Atlas Barbary sheep revealed to be opportunistic grazers, consuming 44 forage species; grasses and forbs constituted 87% of the overall diet. There were significant intraspecific dietary differences. Rams showed a more diverse (42 species) and distinct diet compared to those of ewes (22 species) and juveniles (lambs + yearlings) (only 10 species). All sex-age classes were mostly grazers, adults feeding on grasses and forbs in similar proportions, whereas juveniles feeding basically on grasses (more than 70% of their diet) and almost no forbs. Ewes and juveniles feed on browse at a higher proportion than rams do. Our findings would be useful for the restoration and management of the habitat and food resources within the reserve.

AB  - Coimbatore Reserve Forest forms an integral and important part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, India. The forest areas in the Mettupalayam range and Sirumugai range of Coimbatore Forest Division were selected as study areas. It was approached in a systematic-random sampling method. Two methods viz., i) transact line survey method and ii) sample plot method, were used to document the native fodder species in the study area. Totally, 128 sample plots with the size of 20 x 20 m and 17 transact line surveys at 0.2% sampling intensity were used. Based on the survey, 25 fodder tree species were documented; Fabaceae is the most dominant family with 12 species. In diversity analysis, S IV showed higher tree fodder diversity in terms of Simpson D (0.69), Shannon H index (2.72) and evenness index (0.44). With respect to the grass density, the maximum grass density was observed in Oplismenus burmannii followed by Dichanthium aristatum and Enteropogon monostachyus which is due to geographical condition of the Coimbatore Elephant Reserve.

AB  - Increasingly, drone-based photogrammetry has been used to measure size and body condition changes in marine megafauna. A broad range of platforms, sensors, and altimeters are being applied for these purposes, but there is no unified way to predict photogrammetric uncertainty across this methodological spectrum. As such, it is difficult to make robust comparisons across studies, disrupting collaborations amongst researchers using platforms with varying levels of measurement accuracy. Here we built off previous studies quantifying uncertainty and used an experimental approach to train a Bayesian statistical model using a known-sized object floating at the water's surface to quantify how measurement error scales with altitude for several different drones equipped with different cameras, focal length lenses, and altimeters. We then applied the fitted model to predict the length distributions and estimate age classes of unknown-sized humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, as well as to predict the population-level morphological relationship between rostrum to blowhole distance and total body length of Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis. This statistical framework jointly estimates errors from altitude and length measurements from multiple observations and accounts for altitudes measured with both barometers and laser altimeters while incorporating errors specific to each. This Bayesian model outputs a posterior predictive distribution of measurement uncertainty around length measurements and allows for the construction of highest posterior density intervals to define measurement uncertainty, which allows one to make probabilistic statements and stronger inferences pertaining to morphometric features critical for understanding life history patterns and potential impacts from anthropogenically altered habitats.

AB  - Ticks are vectors that transmit zoonotic pathogens via wildlife hosts. Although the distribution of ticks varies with the expansion of wildlife populations, few studies in Japan have tracked changes in the distribution of hosts, ticks, and infectious diseases on a regional scale. We conducted a follow-up investigation of a previous study conducted from 1988 to 1993 on the distribution of ticks as potential vectors of spotted fever group rickettsiae on Boso Peninsula, Japan, a Japanese spotted fever (JSF)-endemic area. Haemaphysalis cornigera, H. kitaokai, and H. megaspinosa ticks expanded their distribution to the west of Futtsu City following the expansion of sika deer (Cervus nippon) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations. The distributions of H. flava and H. longicornis remained almost unchanged from 1988 to 1993. None of the tick species showed a distribution that completely coincided with the area of JSF occurrence at any time point. Rickettsia species, the causative agent of JSF, might have been transmitted by multiple tick species in this region.

AB  - A literature review was conducted on plastic debris in megafauna of the Humboldt Current System, one of the most productive marine systems in the world that encompasses the marine-coastal zones of Peru and Chile. The information was obtained from Scopus and Google Scholar and included the analysis of macro, meso and microplastics that have been ingested or have caused entanglement in mammals, birds, turtles and fish. We found 32 publications in this regard, and plastic debris was detected in six species of mammals, 22 birds, two turtles, and two fish. Among them, five species that had interacted with plastic waste were identified as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Given the scarcity of research on plastic waste and megafauna in the southern hemisphere, it is essential to promote collaboration between specialized centers and to have the support of the public and private sectors to carry out adequate monitoring of the impact of plastic waste in the Humboldt Current System.

AB  - High sedimentation rates have well-documented, deleterious impacts on coral reefs. However, few previous studies have attempted to quantitatively describe a coral reef community across a large continuous sediment gradient. In this study distinct benthic assemblages in Fouha Bay, Guam, were identified using a Moving Window Analysis conducted along a two-order of magnitude sediment gradient, with transition boundaries that were generally consistent with sediment thresholds identified in the literature. Coral richness dropped exponentially with increasing sedimentation rate. Richness was nearly three times greater in assemblages with sedimentation rates <10 mg cm(-2) d(-1) compared to assemblages experiencing rates between 10 and 50 mg cm(-2) d(-1), and nearly 30 times greater than assemblages experiencing rates between 50 and 100 mg cm(-2) d(-1). No corals were found in assemblages with sedimentation rates >110 mg cm(-2) d(-1). Reducing sedimentation in this area could result in a shift of more diverse and abundant coral assemblages toward the head of the bay.

AB  - Rhizomatous growth and associated physiological integration can allow a clonal dune species to potentially compensate for the selective removal of leaves associated with herbivory. Hydrocotyle bonariensis is a rhizomatous clonal plant species that is abundant in the coastal dune environments of the southeastern United States that are inhabited by large feral horse populations. H. bonariensis has been shown to integrate resources among ramets within extensive clones as an adaptation to resource heterogeneity in sandy soils. In this study, we hypothesized that clonal integration is a mechanism that promotes H. bonariensis persistence in these communities, despite high levels of herbivory by feral horses. In a field experiment, we used exclosures to test for herbivory in H. bonariensis over a four-month period. We found that feral horses utilized H. bonariensis as a food species, and that while grazing will suppress clonal biomass, H. bonariensis is able to maintain populations in a high grazing regime with and without competition present. We then conducted an experiment in which portions of H. bonariensis clones were clipped to simulate different levels of grazing. Half of the clones were severed to eliminate the possibility of integration. We found that after 12 weeks, the mean number of leaves and ramets increased as the grazing level increased, for integrated clones. Integrated clones had significantly increased biomass production compared to the severed equivalents. Our research suggests that rhizomatous growth and physiological integration are traits that allow clonal plant species to maintain populations and to tolerate grazing in coastal dune environments.

AB  - Macroalgae are becoming dominant on coral reefs worldwide, replacing corals as key habitat formers. Incre-menting consumption rates by herbivores, such as sea urchins, has been identified as a viable strategy for pro-moting coral recovery. By means of a 28-day experiment, we assessed the grazing effects of the sea urchins, Tripneustes gratilla and Diadema setosum, on the macroalgal assemblages of shallow reefs at Bora-Bora (French Polynesia). In particular, each urchin species was either absent or maintained, using cages (n = 10), at a density of 5 individuals/m2. T. gratilla exerted stronger negative effects than D. setosum on all the examined macroalgae (i.e., Turbinaria ornata, Padina boryana, Halimeda spp, Dictyota spp). In addition, the grazing effects by T. gratilla on macroalgae emerged shortly after the start of the experiment, more rapidly than those of D. setosum. Despite an apparent lower food preference for T. ornata in D.setosum, all macroalgae were consumed by both species and the composition of the macroalgal assemblages (i.e., the proportion of each species) did not change after 28 days. Overall, our study suggests that herbivorous sea urchins, when at relatively high densities, could contribute to sustaining coral-dominance on coral reefs by keeping macroalgae under control.

AB  - Species of the family Phytoseiidae (Acari: Mesostigmata) inhabit a wide range of herbs, shrubs, and trees. Horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanum, is an important ornamental tree in Europe and, in addition to its importance for pollinators, it can serve as a host plant of these predatory mites. Little is, however, known about the factors affecting spatiotemporal variability in the density of phytoseiids on A. hippocastanum in an urban environment. We therefore assessed the species composition and the spatial and seasonal variability in the abundance of Phytoseiidae species in the city of Ceske Budejovice, South Bohemia, Czech Republic. Compound-leaf samples were randomly collected from horse chestnut tree branches at eight sites, five times during the vegetation season in 2013. The mites were collected by washing technique and mounted on slides for identification. In total, 13,903 specimens of phytoseiid mites were found, and eight species were identified: Amblyseius andersoni, Euseius finlandicus, Kampimodromus aberrans, Neoseiulella tiliarum, Phytoseius macropilis, Paraseiulus talbii, Paraseiulus triporus, and Typhlodromus (Typhlodromus) pyri. The predominant species was E. finlandicus (96.25%). The mean number of mites per compound leaf was 2.53, 10.40, 23.54, 11.59, and 9.27 on the sampling dates in each month between May and September, respectively. The results further revealed that the mite abundance varied significantly among sampling sites and that it was negatively related to percentage of greenery area, intensity of greenery care, distance to water body, and density and age of horse chestnut trees, while it was positively related to air pollution index. The importance of leaf micromorphology for the attractiveness of A. hippocastanum to Phytoseiidae is discussed.

AB  - During a limited period in the summer of 2021, 17-year cicada species (Magicicada cassini, M. septendecula, M. septendecim) represented a large pulse of easily accessible food unique to forest ecosystems in the eastern United States. Using trail cameras and acoustic recorders, we tested whether the activity levels of 8 mammal species in northwestern Indiana shifted in response to spatial and temporal variation in cicada densities from 18 May to 20 June 2021. Cicada densities varied temporally and spatially across all study sites. Most mammal species with sufficient data showed no response to cicada emergence, including 2 tree squirrel species, Peromyscus mice, Eastern Chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and 2 species of bats. Raccoons (Procyon lotor), likely cicada predators, showed a quadratic or more complex activity response to cicada abundance, indicating a potential saturation point at densities near 1 cicada per m2. Surprisingly, White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) activity decreased to almost 0 at the same cicada densities when we expected no change in activity. While size or accessibility may exclude cicadas as prey for small and volant mammals, our results suggest predation and satiation by Raccoons. In contrast, deer may be avoiding areas of cicada abundance due to other stimuli, such as high noise output, which may decrease their ability to detect predators.

AB  - Information on diet breadth and preference can assist in understanding links between food resources and population growth and inform habitat restoration for rare herbivores. We assessed the diet of the endangered Pacific pocket mouse using metabarcoding of fecal samples and compared it to plant community composition in long-term study plots in two populations on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, San Diego County, CA. Fecal samples (n = 221) were collected between spring 2016 and fall 2017 during monthly live-trap surveys. Concurrently, percent cover and plant phenology were measured in plots centered on trap locations. Fecal samples were sequenced with paired-end reads of the internal transcribed spacer 2 region of the nuclear ribosomal gene, and the resulting amplicons were matched to a regionally specific database. Seventy-three plant taxa were detected, which were mostly forbs and perennial herbs (70-90%). Diet composition differed between populations, years, seasons, and plots. Overall, diet and local habitat composition in plots were significantly correlated. However, we detected some differences in above-ground seed availability and proportion in fecal samples that indicate diet preferences for some forbs, perennial herbs, and native bunch grasses over perennial shrubs and non-native grasses. This is the first study of PPM to pair plant phenology surveys with diet metabarcoding to estimate resource selection, and results suggest that managing habitat for diverse native forb communities and reducing non-native grass cover may be beneficial for this critically endangered species.

AB  - Throughout much of its range, northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L., hereafter cedar) has experienced a bottleneck in recruitment: cedar seedlings are often abundant in these stands, particularly in lowland settings, yet cedar sapling densities are quite low, leading to concerns that cedar canopy trees are not being replaced. Several barriers to cedar recruitment have been suggested; however, findings from previous studies have been inconsistent with regard to limiting factors. Our objective was to characterize the microsite conditions associated with the establishment of cedar seedlings and saplings. We achieved this objective by mapping the location of seedlings, saplings, and overstory trees in 15 lowland cedar stands at five sites in Maine, USA, and examining the fine-scale site conditions (microtopographic features, canopy openness) in which cedar seedlings and saplings occurred. In particular, we recorded the occurrence of seedlings and saplings on microtopographic mounds, pits (small depressions), and flats (transitional features between mounds and pits). Substrate moisture content in these features decreased in the order pits > flats > mounds. Contingency-table results demonstrated that live cedar seedlings, and to a slightly lesser extent saplings, were found more often than expected by chance on mounds, and less often on flats and pits. Logistic regressions using status (live vs. dead) as the response variable generally supported these findings: dead seedlings were strongly associated with pits; however, the occurrence of live seedlings and saplings did not differ between flats and mounds. A companion planted-seedling experiment strongly supported these results, showing that after two growing seasons, survival was significantly lower in pits (12%) when compared to flats and mounds, which had similarly high levels of survival (62 and 80% respectively). Logistic regressions also showed live seedlings and saplings to be prevalent under more open canopy conditions (mean 19%, range 6 to 42% openness); though results from a planted-seedling experiment suggested that greater canopy openness (mean 32%, range 13 to 57%) was detrimental to survival. Regressions also showed that browsed seedlings were more likely to be found dead. These findings point to management prescriptions that maintain microtopographic diversity, create moderately open canopy conditions, and protect stands from browsing to promote viable cedar populations in these ecologically and economically important forests.

AB  - Context Within Rangifer ranges, many studies focus on expanding infrastructure and human activity negatively influencing habitat use. Little documentation exists on how disturbances act in synergy (i.e. cumulative effects), nor methods to test such effects. Objectives (1) Investigate how cumulative disturbance at different distances affects reindeer habitat use and (2) at what disturbance levels and distances loss of habitat functionality occurs. Methods Disturbance intensity levels for trails and infrastructure were based on expected amount of human activity, on a scale from 1 to 6. To test cumulative disturbance, we adapted the multi-grain method and summed-up disturbance intensity levels within "disturbance distance intervals" (0-0.25, 0.25-1, 1-2 km, etc. instead of 0-0.25, 0-1, 0-2 km, etc.), and tested reindeers' avoidance using GPS data for 2011-2018. Results We found decreased habitat use within 0.25 km with increasing cumulative disturbance for snow free and winter seasons. For spring, a similar effect occurred up to 1 km. Reductions in use in areas with highest cumulative disturbance within these zones were between 92 and 98%. Strongest avoidance during spring supports previous studies. Comparatively, the multi-grain approach showed negative effects up to 3 km. Conclusions Our approach provides novel results and precisely estimates where cumulative effects actually occur. Reindeer in our study tolerate low intensities of human disturbance, while further increase in disturbance intensity reduces habitat functionality. We suggest clustering future human developments within areas of high disturbance, i.e. where functional habitat use is already lost or highly reduced. Our method can be used for other areas and species.

AB  - ContextEnvironmental heterogeneity across species distributions creates diverse conditions that individual populations encounter. As a result, local selective pressures vary across a species range, leading to individual populations becoming locally adapted and therefore better suited to their environment. Recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics allow us to identify genetic signatures of selection.ObjectivesWe searched for genetic signals of selection in populations of the chisel-toothed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys microps), a species that occupies two distinct plant assemblages and a wide range of climatic conditions in the American southwest.MethodsWe used double digest Restriction Site Associated DNA sequencing to generate a dataset of 42,890 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 180 individuals belonging to 30 populations. We used genome-environment association and gene ontology methods to identify genetic loci showing significant association with environmental variables, compare the strength of selection across the species distribution, and link loci under selection to genes and gene functions.ResultsWe identified over 2000 genetic loci that show correlation with climatic conditions (mean temperature of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, precipitation of the coldest quarter, and precipitation of the warmest quarter) and vegetation (represented by normalized difference vegetation index or a binary classification). Candidate loci were located within gene transcripts associated with development, thermal tolerance, and behavior. We detected the strongest signals of selection in populations that expanded into novel habitat after the Last Glacial Maximum. Our results corroborate the phenotypic differences among populations identified in previous studies.ConclusionsOur results show how environmental heterogeneity drives selection-driven intraspecific variation. This highlights the importance to consider local adaptation of individual populations in assessing conservation needs and developing species management plans.

AB  - The main aim of this study is to produce a modern analog for pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) preserved in soil in relation to the different vegetation types and herbivore impact in the Kaziranga National Park (KNP). The pollen data obtained reflects both the extant vegetation types in each habitat as well as landuse, but some site-by-site variation was observed with respect to the coprophilous fungal spores present in the palynoassemblage. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) analysis of pollen data reveals the presence of five significantly different vegetation types, while the non-pollen palynomorphs are relatively similar in relation to the different vegetation types. The long-term association of the wildlife and their impact on different vegetation types is one of the main reasons for the variation seen in the depositional pattern in the assemblage. The openland area is one of the most important areas for wildlife in the KNP as indicated by the presence of marker pollen and coprophilous fungal spores in the palynoassemblages. Coprophilous fungal spores were most abundant in this vegetation type reflecting the higher density of herbivores. The representation of pollen and coprophilous fungal spores from the swamp samples reflected the overall composition of all vegetation types existing in the KNP. This data can be utilized as a baseline for the interpretation of paleoecological and paleoherbivory studies in other parts of the Indian subcontinent as well as its potential application at a global level.

AB  - Benthic cyanobacterial mats (BCMs) are conspicuous components of coral reef communities, where they play key ecological roles as primary producers among others. BCMs often bloom and might outcompete neighboring benthic organisms, including reef-building corals. We investigated the cyanobacterial species composition of three BCMs morphotypes from the marginal reef complex of Abrolhos Bank (Southeastern Brazil). Also, we assessed their allelopathic effects on coral zooxanthellae, their susceptibility to herbivory by fish, and their toxicity to brine shrimp nauplii. Morphology and 16S rDNA sequencing unveiled the cyanobacteria Moorena bouillonii, Okeania erythroflocculosa, Adonisia turfae, Leptolyngbya sp., and Halomicronema sp. as components of BCMs from Abrolhos. BCMs cell-free filtrates and extracts exerted an allelopathic effect by reducing the growth of the ex hospite Symbiodinium sp. in culture. BCMs-only treatments remained untouched in field susceptibility assays in contrast to macroalgae only and mixed BCMs-macroalgae treatments that had the macroalgae fully removed by reef fish. Crude aqueous extracts from BCMs were toxic to brine shrimps in acute assays. Besides unveiling the diversity of BCMs consortia in Abrolhos, our results cast some light on their allelopathy, antiherbivory, and toxicity properties. These antagonistic interactions might promote adverse cascading effects during benthic cyanobacteria blooms and in gradual shifts to BCMs-dominated states.

AB  - PurposeHuman-wildlife conflicts worldwide are arising, representing significant challenges for conservation biologists, decision-makers, and agropastoralist communities. Extreme climatic events, disease outbreaks, and land-use change could be intensifying these conflicts. The multi-species and mountainous landscapes seem prone to conflicts due to a lack of territory planning. These complex, dynamic, and multi-layered conflicts require a multidimensional approach. Currently, in Chile, mountainous landscapes have several threats, such as a lack of territory planning, mega-mining projects, and recently (last 10 years) the effects of the Mega-drought. Many transhumant agropastoralists have been forced to quit their livelihoods while increasing livestock-wildlife conflicts. We aim to build territorial planning within a holistic approach to strengthening the agropastoralists' competence to coexist with local wildlife (puma, condor, and guanaco) in Central Chile's Andes mountains. MethodologyWe conducted participatory mapping workshops with two agropastoralist communities in 2020. They were randomly divided into 4 to 7 people groups and told to draw a map representing their territory, including four elements: (1) natural and human components of the landscape, (2) natural wildlife conflict areas, (3) active grazing areas, and (4) their ideal future scenario, regarding their activity. FindingsResults showed different spatial perceptions of the natural and human components of the territory. All agropastoralists (100%) indicated similar wildlife conflict areas: focusing in the Summerlands. All agreed that Mega-drought was the primary threat to their production, increasing the conflict with wildlife. Summerland areas are identified as suitable areas for working in conflict with wildlife. Research Limitations/ImplicationsThis study highlights the need for a multidimensional approach to conflict and territory planning to address conservation conflicts. The study's implications show that agropastoralists decided to reduce Summerland use and improve Winterland planning to increase livestock productivity and reduce conflict with wildlife. Participatory mapping could help to prioritize areas to mitigate conflicts with wildlife. Originality/ValueThis study is the first in the Aconcagua valley to conduct a transdisciplinary & participatory approach toward coexistence between transhumant agropastoralists and wildlife. It also provides a baseline for similar schemes in semi-arid and mountainous landscapes worldwide facing rapid climate shifts and increasing human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - Studies on the Copepod community structure and function under oceanographic influences and anthropic impacts was carried out in the narrowest continental shelf of Brazil. A total of 65 taxa were identified, of which 39 were Calanoida. The most abundant species was Temora turbinata (65.26%) followed by Centropages velificatus, Paracalanuspavus, Undinula vulgaris and Clausocalanus furcatus. A mixture of coastal and oceanic species of Copepods was registered being difficult to separate both populations, however predominated the oceanic species due the narrow shelf and low influence of rivers flux. The frequency of occurrence showed that 24.62% of the species were constants, 13.85% accessories and 61.53% were accidentals. A diversity and abundance gradient were registered from neritic to oceanic waters, however diversity was very low to a shelf area under oceanic influence. The narrow shelf from the studied area permitted the movement of oceanic copepods to coastal areas. The reduced density was caused by the oligotrophic characteristic of the Tropical Water mass present in the area; however, the very low diversity was possibly caused by anthropic impacts (sewage outfalls), mainly in stations closer to the continent. Calocalanus pavo, Undinula vulgaris and Temora stylifera were the best indicators of the area and they were associated to phytoplankton abundance. The Copepod functional traits analyzed presented two sets separated by the reproductive behavior, the biggest set grouped small broadcasters, filter feeders mostly with an omnivore-herbivore strategy and a smaller group, sac-spawner that carry their eggs until hatching. The present study observed that the anthropogenic inputs had a great influence on copepods species and distribution, causing a different dominance pattern between nearshore and offshore.

AB  - The rapid increase in the rarity of species is an alarming threat that the world is facing today. Like other mountainous regions of the world, fragile mountains in the Himalayas are facing tremendous pressure for species extinction. The studied data at the locality site-specific level in comparison to the global and country-level status has realized us to analyze the extinction rate for monitoring. By realizing the importance, criteria based survey analysis of each species on various habitats, distribution range patterns, population size, use pattern, extraction trend, native and endemic species were evaluated. A total of 255 threatened species (20 critical endangered, 30 endangered, 60 vulnerable, and 144 near-threaten) were identified from the Lahaul valley in parts of the Cold desert north-western Himalaya, India. The studies themselves suggest the occurrence of maximum biotic and abiotic pressures with limited diversity. The altitudinal zone 2800-3800 m AMSL; habitats (forest, shady moist, dry, rocky, bouldery, and grassland); and communities of trees (Cedrusdeodara-Acer cappadocicum mixed, Juglans regia-Ulmus wallichiana-Acer acuminatum mixed, Salix fragilis-Fraxinus xanthoxyloides mixed, Abies pindrow-Pinus wallichiana mixed and Crataegus songarica), shrubs (Juniperus indica, Juniperus communis-Rosa webbiana mixed, Spiraea canescens, Salix pycnostachya, Lonicera obovata, Cassiope fastigiata, Juniperus communis-Lonicera obovata mixed, Hippophae rhamnoides ssp. turkestanica and Rhododendron anthopogon-Salix lindleyana mixed), and herbs (Waldheimia glabra-Leontopodium himalayanum-Rhodiola heterodontata-Agrostis stolonifera mixed and Leontopodium brachyactis-Saxifraga jacquemontiana-S. brunonis mixed) showed maximum conservation prioritization index value of threatened species, which requires monitoring attention for future conservation. The information is useful for the site-specific mapping of rare plants, communities, and habitats for quick planning and implementation program.

AB  - Ingested soil may expose free-range animals to environmental pollutants. In pigs, soil ingestion is few described whereas their burrowing behaviour suggests that it could be high. Although highly productive pigs are generally reared indoor, free-range farming is increasing in view of ethical considerations for animal welfare and is a common practice for subsistence agriculture systems. The experiment lasted 8 weeks (2 for adaptation, 6 for measurements) with 24 growing pigs of Guadeloupean Creole (CR) or Large White (LW) breeds. Pigs were assigned to 3 outdoor treatments: high pasture HP (> 60 days of regrowth), low pasture LP (35 days of regrowth), and sweet potato SP (sweet potato field). Titanium (soil marker) and chromium (faecal output marker) contents of faeces, vegetation and soil samples were used to estimate individual daily soil ingestions. The average, 10th and 90th percentiles were 440, 200 and 726 g of dry soil per 100 kg body weight, respectively, without significant differences between the 3 outdoor treatments or the 2 breeds but with a significant period (i.e. week of measurements) x treatment interaction (P < 0.001). In the French West Indies, animals may be exposed to chlordecone (CLD), a very persistent organochlorine insecticide. Simulations of CLD tissue contamination due to ingestion of contaminated soil were carried out and compared to the maximum residue limit. These results show that grazing management needs to be adapted to effectively limit soil ingestion by pigs and the impact of a contaminated environment on the sustainability of pig systems.

AB  - Morphological variation in widely distributed plants may be driven by phenotypic plasticity or underlying genetic differences. In the brackish to fresh open waters of San Francisco Estuary, there are at least two distinct growth forms of a native pondweed in the genus Stuckenia. We determined that all plants collected from throughout the region are S. pectinata by sequencing the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. This led us to question if different morphologies result from intraspecific genetic differentiation or differences in water flow, which we explored using microsatellites and a common garden experiment, respectively. As only four of nine microsatellite loci developed in Europe were polymorphic for our samples, there was low resolution to detect differences; however, some multilocus genotypes found only in narrow-leaf samples hinted of within-species variation. Further, while morphological traits were plastic in response to flow manipulation, distinct morphotypes did not converge under the same conditions, implicating genetic differences. Regardless of mechanisms for contrasting growth forms, leaf size and quantity may affect available habitat for ecologicallyimportant invertebrates. We found narrow/dense leaves supported greater invertebrate densities at both a low-salinity, and especially, a brackish site. The latter was dominated by an amphipod that we determined strongly prefers to consume narrower leaves. We conclude that both environmental conditions and genetic differentiation play a role in S. pectinata morphology. That these differences propagate to higher trophic levels calls for further investigation into the genetic basis for, as well as spatial extent of, the two morphotypes.

AB  - The microbiome-the community of microorganisms that is associated with an individual animal-has been an important driver of insect biodiversity globally, enabling insects to specialize in narrow, nutrient-deficient diets. The importance of maternally inherited, obligate bacterial endosymbionts in provisioning nutrients missing from these narrow dietary niches has been well studied in insects. However, we know comparatively little about the processes that dictate the composition of non-maternally inherited bacteria in insect microbiomes, despite the importance of these bacteria in insect health, fitness, and vector competence. Here, we used two species of obligate insect ectoparasites of bats, the bat flies (Streblidae) Trichobius sphaeronotus and Nycterophilia coxata, to examine whether the microbiome, beyond obligate bacterial endosymbionts, is conserved or variable across geographic space, between ectoparasite species, or covaries with the external microbiome of their bat hosts or the cave environment. Our results indicate that ectoparasite microbiomes are highly conserved and specific to ectoparasite species, despite these species feeding on the blood of the same bat individuals in some cases. In contrast, we found high geographic variation in the fur microbiome of host bats and that the bat fur microbiome mimics the cave microbiomes. This research suggests that there is a constraint on blood-feeding insect ectoparasites to maintain a specific microbiome distinct from their host and the environment, potentially to meet their nutritional needs. Given that many of these bacteria are not known to be maternally inherited, this research lays the foundation for future examinations of how blood-feeding arthropods acquire and maintain bacteria in their microbiomes.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are a leading driver of biodiversity loss worldwide, and have negative impacts on human societies. In most countries, available data on monetary costs of IAS are scarce, while being crucial for developing efficient management. In this study, we use available data collected from the first global assessment of economic costs of IAS (InvaCost) to quantify and describe the economic cost of invasions in Mexico. This description was made across a range of taxonomic, sectoral and temporal variables, and allowed us to identify knowledge gaps within these areas. Overall, costs of invasions in Mexico were estimated at US$ 5.33 billion (i.e., 109) ($MXN 100.84 billion) during the period from 1992 to 2019. Biological invasion costs were split relatively evenly between aquatic (US$ 1.16 billion; $MXN 21.95 billion) and terrestrial (US$ 1.17 billion; $MXN 22.14 billion) invaders, but semi-aquatic taxa dominated (US$ 2.99 billion; $MXN 56.57 billion), with costs from damages to resources four times higher than those from management of IAS (US$ 4.29 billion vs. US$ 1.04 billion; $MXN 81.17 billion vs $MXN 19.68 billion). The agriculture sector incurred the highest costs (US$ 1.01 billion; $MXN 19.1 billion), followed by fisheries (US$ 517.24 million; $MXN 9.79 billion), whilst most other costs simultaneously impacted mixed or unspecified sectors. When defined, costs to Mexican natural protected areas were mostly associated with management actions in terrestrial environments, and were incurred through official authorities via monitoring, control or eradication. On natural protected islands, mainly mammals were managed (i.e. rodents, cats and goats), to a total of US$ 3.99 million, while feral cows, fishes and plants were mostly managed in protected mainland areas, amounting to US$ 1.11 million in total. Pterygoplichthys sp. and Eichhornia crassipes caused the greatest reported costs in unprotected aquatic ecosystems in Mexico, and Bemisia tabaci to terrestrial systems. Although reported damages from invasions appeared to be fluctuating through time in Mexico, management spending has been increasing. These estimates, albeit conservative, underline the monetary pressure that invasions put on the Mexican economy, calling for urgent actions alongside comprehensive cost reporting in national states such as Mexico.

AB  - Biological invasions are among the most serious threats to ecosystems. The golden apple snail Pomacea canaliculata (Lamarck, 1822) is considered one of the top 100 worst invasive alien species in the world. These snails consume benthic primary producers, including submerged macrophytes, which may lead to an increase in nutrient concentration in the water, enhance growth of phytoplankton, and decrease growth of macrophytes, thereby shifting the primary production from benthic to pelagic habitats in shallow systems. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a short-term experiment with and without the invasive P. canaliculata in mesocosms with high abundance of the native submerged macrophyte Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara. Compared with snail-free control, the snail increased the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), total and organic suspended solids (TSS and OSS), decreased the concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP), but had no effect on total phosphorus (TP) and the TN:TP ratio. In addition, the snails decreased the biomass, leaf length and tiller number of V. natans, and decreased light intensity. Although snail presence did not change the biomasses of nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton, it did increase the biomass of microphytoplankton leading to an increase in total phytoplankton biomass. Our study shows that P. canaliculata shifted primary production from benthic to pelagic habitats, altered the phytoplankton community size structure, and decreased water quality. The results add further evidence of negative ecosystem impacts of this invasive apple snail and call for its control in invaded shallow lake ecosystems.

AB  - These days, high-density cities are facing growing challenges related to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Greening can be a nature-based solution for UHI effect mitigation. This study aims to evaluate the potential of nature-based solutions to improve the urban living environments in Baishizhou, a high-density neighbourhood in Shenzhen. An integrated 3D visualisation research method was proposed in this study. Rhino 7, Grasshopper, and ENVI-met software were combined to evaluate environment characteristics before and after design, as well as compare differences in the outdoor thermal comfort index and the building surface temperature. The greening design scenarios include adding trees, green roofs, and green facades. The simulations ran for 24 h during the test period from 01:00 to 24:00 on 9 August 2019, which was the hottest day in Shenzhen. Baishizhou was selected as the test area for this study and environmental simulation. Results indicated that (1) vegetation has a positive cooling effect, providing outdoor thermal comfort, while shade "trees" provide significant cooling effects on hot days in tropical and subtropical climates; (2) adding green roofs and green facades to a building can significantly affect the cooling effect.

AB  - Tooth cementum rings often have been considered the most reliable method for aging larger mammals. Tests of this approach have used samples of known ages, but to ensure objectivity this needs to be carried out as truly blind tests. That has not always been the case, including for North American wild sheep in studies that concluded that cementum ring aging provided highly accurate ages. This study reexamined cementum ring aging accuracy for bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) via a blind test of known- age samples from two ecologically different regions in California, using three different laboratory techniques (histological, petrographic, and grinding), and different individuals applying each of those methods. Overall, there were considerably more errors than previously reported. The grinding method performed particularly poorly, but statistical analyses of aging errors for the other two methods found differences between those methods and between the two data sets used. While the histological method had the highest overall rate of correct ages at 31%, its error range was twice that of the petrographic method. Given the error rates we found, cementum-based ages of bighorn sheep should not be treated as accurate ages. It is therefore unlikely that cementum-based ages will improve ages based on horn rings for most male specimens. Cementum-based ages may be useful for female bighorn sheep older than 4-6 years because of difficulties in aging by horn rings.

AB  - This manuscript critically examines the history of non-native aquatic species introductions in Uruguay, emphasizing the role of public institutions. Despite global concerns about biodiversity threats from these introductions, Uruguay's reliance on animal production and aquaculture involving non-native species has grown since the 1980s. State institutions, despite past failures, have promoted these introductions without comprehensive risk assessments. Notable cases, including failed attempts with species like the herbivorous carp, American bullfrog, Nile tilapia, Australian redclaw crayfish, and American mink, raise concerns about invasive populations due to a lack of proper risk assessments and prevention measures. Previous examples were deficient in escape monitoring, oversight of specimens after farm closures, and considerations for the presence of new pathogens. This highlights the need for more informed and responsible approaches to prevent invasive species' establishment, advocating for rigorous analysis and risk assessments before any introduction. We propose overcoming historically fragmented decision-making processes by establishing a bridging structure that coordinates inter- and intra-institutional efforts, engages with the academic sector and social organizations, and evaluates the introductions. This platform can prioritize protecting aquatic ecosystems, fostering sustainable growth, and maintaining ecological balance, contributing to the solution of the problem by facilitating coordinated efforts and engaging diverse stakeholders.

AB  - Semi-arid forests need cost-effective restoration strategies to address their severe degradation. Tree shelters are often used to minimize abiotic and biotic stress during seedling establishment. We asked if early-successional weeds act as a natural shelter by facilitating native seedlings, contingent on abiotic and biotic stressors and seedling ecological strategy. We conducted a manipulative weed exclusion experiment at a semi-arid site in South Texas targeted for large-scale forest restoration to discern the net effect of weeds on the growth and survival of target thornscrub tree and shrub seedlings. We assessed the roles of contrasting seedling ecological strategies (fast vs. slow growth habit), temporal variation in abiotic stress, microclimate and mammalian herbivory in modulating weed-seedling interactions. Ungulate herbivory on seedlings was common, of similar frequency across most species, but not diminished by the presence of weed neighbours. On average, seedlings growing adjacent to weed neighbours experienced modest but non-significant increases in both height and mortality after 6 months, relative to weed-excluded areas. However, seedlings without significant herbivory and adjacent to weed neighbours grew more vigorously (increased height and branching) during hot and dry periods, particularly those species with a fast growth habit. Although seedling light-saturated photosynthetic capacity (A(sat)) and air temperature were unaffected by weed presence during hot and dry periods, afternoon light levels were reduced by approximately 50%, possibly indicative of lower leaf temperatures and improved seedling water status. Our results show that realizing the facilitative potential of weeds in semi-arid forest restoration requires minimizing mammalian herbivory and temporally separating competition for resources. Managing for intermediate but not excessive levels of forb canopy cover is likely required to reduce high radiation loads and reduce transpiration without adverse competitive effects. Longer-term experiments manipulating cover crop identity, cover and mammalian herbivory will inform whether forbs can be effectively exploited to enhance restoration success at large scales.

AB  - In conservation biology, flagship species are defined as species that can raise support for biodiversity conservation in a given place or social context. In the newly established Gishwati-Mukura National Park in Rwanda, the Eastern chimpanzee was considered such an ambassador. To test whether the flagship species concept was effective in the park, we studied species richness, relative abundance, and species distribution (occupancy) of medium- to large-sized, ground-dwelling mammals using camera trapping technology. The impact of three environmental and three anthropogenic variables on species distribution was investigated and the ecological diversity of the fauna in the national park assessed. Over a period of 9 months, two 4 x 4 camera trapping grids were deployed in Gishwati and Mukura Forest. Sampling effort in each forest equated to 32 and 29 camera trapping locations, yielding 258 and 242 independent photographic events of eight and six species, respectively. In both forests, the Emin's giant poached rat was the most frequently encountered species, while all other species showed high relative abundance only in Gishwati Forest. The relative abundance of the endangered Eastern chimpanzee in Gishwati Forest was 0.54, the estimated occupancy was 0.31. Single-species, single-season occupancy models revealed that forest cover, altitude and distance to forest edge influenced the detectability of L'Hoest's monkey and squirrel species, while no effect was found on their occupancy. Notably, no larger herbivore or carnivore species were observed in the park, while the flagship species, i.e., the Eastern chimpanzee, was relatively abundant. Moreover, in both forests, all detected carnivores were small- to medium-sized, suggesting a meso-predator release phenomenon, i.e., populations of medium-sized predators increased after the removal of larger, top carnivores, due to relaxed competition. It appears that the prioritization of the flagship species resulted in the neglect of other mammalian species, leading eventually into the demise of entire functional guilds. Based on these results, the Gishwati-Mukura NP was categorized as a 'depleted forest'. We, therefore, strongly object chimpanzees as a suitable flagship species-at least in the Gishwati-Mukura NP-and recommend collating more knowledge on the release of meso-predators and the loss of forest ungulates to improve their future conservation in Afro-montane forest habitats.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with ruminant livestock production is important for climate change mitigation. Regenerative Agriculture (RA) practices are increasingly promoted to improve forage pro-duction and livestock performance in temperate livestock systems. These practices include i) rotational grazing (RG) of livestock around multiple subunits of pasture to achieve ungrazed periods of 'rest', and ii) herbal leys (HL), where perennial forbs such as chicory, lucerne and trefoils are included as components in multi-species swards. While there are plausible mechanisms for adoption of these practices to improve agricultural productivity, quantitative syntheses of their impacts are required. Here, we conduct a systematic review and meta -analysis of the effects of RG and HL practices on herbage dry matter (DM) production, animal daily live -weight gain (DLWG), and sheep wool growth in temperate oceanic regions. We use quantitative predictors in our Bayesian hierarchical models to investigate the role of rest period and stocking density in RG systems, and specific plant traits and sward diversity in HL. We found that herbage DM increased by 0.31 t.ha(-1) over a growing season as the proportion of rest in an RG grazing system increased from 0 to 1. Stocking density significantly moderated the effect of rest period on sheep and cattle DLWG; at higher stocking densities, longer rest periods were required to maintain livestock growth rates. In HL studies, herbage DM yielded 1.63 t.ha(-1) more per metre of increased sward root depth and a sward entirely comprised of legumes yielded 2.20 t.ha(-1) more than when no legumes were present. Sheep DLWG increased by 3.50 g.day(-1) per unit increase in leaf nitrogen concentration (mg.g(-1)), but we could not determine an effect of leaf condensed tannin content on animal performance. Although there remain differences between the RG and HL study treatments meta-analysed here and RA in practice, our results provide empirical support for some of the mechanisms attributed to increased pasture and livestock productivity following adoption of selected RA grazing practices.

AB  - Camera traps are widely used to study wildlife. However, theft and vandalism are frequent, resulting in millions of dollars in financial losses and large data gaps in research. Here we report on the impacts of camera-trap theft on a study examining wildlife movement under highway bridges in south-west Costa Rica. Even with metal cases, locks and signs installed on all camera traps, 65% were stolen. The working camera traps accumulated a total of 167 trap-nights and detected only two wild mammal species, eight bird species and one reptile species, as well as three domestic animal species and people. This limited number of wild species was unexpected given the known presence of wide-ranging megafauna and a diverse terrestrial mammal community in the region. The pervasive theft of camera traps leads to data gaps and impairs the potential for research in the region, and we discuss the potential additional reasons for detecting only a small number of species. Our findings highlight the need for solutions to camera-trap theft, to limit financial and data losses for conservation.

En este art & iacute;culo, reportamos los impactos de robos de c & aacute;maras trampa en un estudio enfocado en movimiento de vida silvestre en pasos de fauna subterr & aacute;neos localizados en carreteras del suroeste de Costa Rica. A & uacute;n con protecci & oacute;n de cajas met & aacute;licas, cerraduras y se & ntilde;alizaci & oacute;n instalada en todas las c & aacute;maras trampa, el 65% de las c & aacute;maras fueron robadas.

Este n & uacute;mero limitado de especies silvestres fue inesperado dada la presencia conocida de una megafauna con grandes distribuciones y una comunidad diversa de mam & iacute;feros terrestres en la regi & oacute;n.

AB  - Mitigating habitat loss of western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) often involves relocation from California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi) burrows to offsite nest boxes. Naval Air Station Lemoore (NASL), Kings and Fresno counties, California, initiated this approach to displace a regionally important population from airfield grasslands. We examined monitoring data of burrowing owls and fossorial mammals at NASL to assess mitigation options. Occupied nests increased by 33 (61%), with 47 nest box installations in 1997-2001, peaked at 87 in 1999, then declined by 50 through 2013. Although >= 13 nest boxes were occupied in 2000, none were occupied in 2003-2013. Within a 43.1 ha isolated grassland monitored for 13 years, nest site reuse in ground squirrel burrows averaged only 17% between any 2 consecutive years. Compared to the average density across grassland study areas, ground squirrel burrow systems/ha numbered 43% higher within 60 m of occupied nests and non-breeding-season burrows. Vegetation clearing to restore kangaroo rat (Dipodomys n. nitratoides) habitat preceded a 7.4-fold increase in ground squirrel burrow systems and a 4-fold increase in occupied nests, but drought-induced extirpation of ground squirrels eliminated occupied nests from the 43.1 ha grassland study area. Ground cover near occupied nests averaged 58% of the mean vegetation height and 67% of the mean percentage of bare ground in the field. Both nest sites and non-breeding-season burrows occurred >60 m interior to field edges 1.4 times more than expected. Non-breeding-season burrows averaged 328 m from same-year nest sites, and only 7% of non-breeding-season burrows were also used as nest sites. Mitigating habitat loss should be made more effective by fostering natural burrow construction by fossorial mammals on patches of short-stature vegetation that is sufficiently expansive to support breeding colonies of >= 12 pairs averaging >= 60 m from the field's edge and a separation between non-breeding-season burrows and nest burrows minimally equal to mean nearest-neighbor distances among nests.

AB  - What do animals eat? What animals are present in a habitat? How many animals are present? How was the habitat different years ago? How old is this animal? These are all questions that scientists want to answer. We know the answers to questions like these from data collected by scientists in a variety of ways. Science is evidence based, and conclusions are arrived at after multiple replicable experiments. Presented here are six ecological scenarios that demonstrate how scientists arrive at answers to population ecology questions. These lessons can be implemented as single activities that supplement a high school ecology or environmental science curricular unit or as a multiday rotation of stations in which students practice field sampling techniques used in population and community ecology, designed to answer ecological questions. Student scientists learn how to use indirect sampling methods to estimate abundance, density, age, and population size using mark-recapture, transects, and quadrats to model authentic field methods. They calculate species richness and biodiversity with a simplified Simpson's diversity index and describe species age structure and distribution using tree rings, sheep horns, and camera trap images. Students also learn to display population data appropriately, graphing survivorship and richness vs. area and studying trophic pyramids.

AB  - Objectives: Based on the analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of bone collagen, stable carbon isotopes of bone apatite and an extensive AMS dating series (similar to 10,000-299 years cal BP), the human paleodiets of 34 individuals from the Central Pampean Dunefields (Argentina, South America) are evaluated.
   Materials and methods: These data are interpreted from the isotopic ecology of animals with archaeofaunal evidence of consumption and isotopic models of human diet. Multivariate carbon and nitrogen stable isotope model and Bayesian stable isotope ellipses were used to interpret human diets.
   Results: Analysis of isotopic values indicates intake of enriched lipids and/or carbohydrates in relation to the proteins consumed throughout the Holocene. The isotopic values of Middle Holocene humans in relation to the values of exploited resources point out that individuals obtained protein mainly from guanaco. Subsequently, there was an increase in the human breadth diet during the Late Holocene, with a greater relevance of small prey of high trophic levels and vegetables. This contrasts with zooarchaeological information indicating generalist human diets during the Middle Holocene and specialized human diets in guanaco during the Late Holocene.
   Conclusions: It is proposed that during the Middle Holocene arid period, the combination of low human population density and high residential mobility in wide foraging ranges allowed the guanaco to be the main source of protein. During the Late Holocene humid period, there was an increase in human population density and a decrease in residential mobility, which caused greater pressure on foraging territories and increased dietary breadth.

AB  - Forest understory complexity is important for many species, from large herbivores such as deer to small mammals such as mice and voles. For species that utilize the forest understory on a very small scale, it is often impractical to conduct correspondingly fine-grained manual surveys of the understory, and thus few studies consider this small-scale variation in understory complexity and instead work with average values on a larger scale. We explored the use of a mobile laser scanning derived understory complexity measure-understory roughness-to predict the capture probability of two representative small mammal species, the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). We found a positive relationship between capture probability and understory roughness for both bank voles and yellow-necked mice. Our results suggest that mobile laser scanning is a promising technology for measuring understory complexity in an ecologically meaningful way.

AB  - This article examined the relationships between information sources (used and perceived importance) and factual knowledge about chronic wasting disease (CWD). Data were obtained from an online survey of North Dakota deer permit holders from the 2020-2021 seasons (n= 3,242, response rate = 29%). Over 90% of respondents knew that CWD exists in North Dakota and three-quarters (75%) knew that infected deer can look healthy. Respondents were less knowledgeable about the causes and transmission of CWD. Bivariate correlations between all information sources and a knowledge index were significant and positive. Multiple regression analyses, however, revealed that while 7 of the 8 betas for agency-based sources were significant and positive, only 4 of the 20 coefficients for non-agency sources were significant. Two of these were positive and associated with sportsmen's club meetings. The other two were negative and associated with listening to the radio and the importance of word of mouth in learning about CWD.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the diet of African manatees in Cameroon to better inform conservation decisions within protected areas. A large knowledge gap on diet and seasonal changes in forage availability limits the ability to develop informed local management plans for the African manatee in much of its range. This research took place in the Sanaga River Watershed, which includes two protected areas in the Littoral Region of Cameroon: the Douala-Edea National Park and the Lake Ossa Wildlife Reserve. We analyzed 113 manatee fecal samples and surveyed shoreline emergent and submerged vegetation within the Sanaga River Watershed. We used microhistological analyses to determine the relative contribution of each plant species to African manatee diets and compared across locations and across seasons (wet vs. dry season). We found that the shoreline vegetation is diverse with over 160 plant species, unevenly distributed across space and season, and dominated by emergent vegetation mostly represented by the antelope grass (Echinochloa pyramidalis). We recorded a total of 36 plant species from fecal samples with a spatial and temporal distribution mostly reflecting that of the corresponding shoreline vegetation. African manatees appear to be primarily opportunistically feeding on available vegetation across the seasons and habitat. This work documents the current, but changing, state of plant availability in the Sanaga River Watershed and reports the African manatee diet in Cameroon for the first time. This information can play a critical role in successfully managing the species and these protected areas. If we wish to protect the African manatee and the aquatic ecosystems within the Sanaga River Watershed, we must understand how forage availability changes over time, especially as its waters become nutrient enriched, eutrophic, and exposed to invasive species of plants in a changing world.

AB  - Hybridization can create novel chemical traits and enhance plant adaptability to diverse environments. This study examined the effects of hybridization on chemical diversity and ecological interactions in Salix albaxfragilis hybrids from the Elbe River basin (Czechia). We analysed leaf metabolites of hybrids and their parental species for concentration, richness, and structural alpha- and beta-diversity, linking them to herbivorous insect assemblages and soil conditions. Hybrids exhibited intermediate metabolite concentration and richness but showed higher structural alpha-diversity and distinct structural beta-diversity compared with their parents. Hybrid-specific metabolites were structurally related to parental metabolites, indicating minor structural modifications rather than major changes to metabolic pathways following hybridization. Herbivore assemblages were influenced by metabolite richness or structural alpha-diversity. However, insect group responses varied, and herbivory damage did not correlate with leaf chemistry or differ between hybrids and parents. Soil nitrogen correlated with metabolite structural beta-diversity, with hybrids displaying greater chemical variation along nitrogen gradients. These results highlight that hybridization significantly altered structural metabolite diversity. Yet, the structural changes were relatively minor which, together with group-specific responses of herbivores, could explain their modest effect on herbivory. Instead, they may enable these hybrids to flexibly respond to soil conditions, possibly contributing to their widespread occurrence.
   Hybridization in Salix albaxfragilis increases structural metabolite diversity, enhancing adaptability to soil conditions and subtly influencing interactions with herbivores, factors that may help explain the widespread ecological success of the hybrids.

AB  - Woody plant encroachment into rangeland ecosystems is a widespread and often unwelcomed circumstance affecting rangeland management decisions worldwide. In the rangeland management profession, varying philosophies have been employed in the management of woody plant encroachment. Following World War II, total eradication of woody plant cover was commonly practiced, eventually giving way to a mosaic approach that benefits livestock, wildlife, and recreational objectives, with cover increasing or even stabilizing in many areas. Cultural practices such as land fragmentation, lifestyles not dependent on agricultural income, and shifts in herbivory from predominately browsers to grazers may also be contributing factors. Modern image analysis technologies, such as object-oriented feature extraction and patch metric analyses, can shed light on past paradigm shifts through spectral and textural assessment of modern and historical aerial photography. In this study, woody plant cover and patch metrics were analyzed for a period spanning from 1938 to 1940 through 2018 in the Bennett and Sulphur Creek watersheds of the Lampasas Cut Plain of Central Texas. Object-based feature extraction was used to calculate woody plant cover, and Fragstats was used for landscape patch metrics. Total woody cover was compared with past stewardship paradigms. There was a net decrease of total woody plant cover from 1938 to 1940 through 2018, with variation in between as management paradigms shifted. A pattern of decline, regrowth, and stabilization, like that observed in other research, was noticed for the Bennett Creek watersheds but was not apparent in Sulfur Creek. Patch size/shape varied as well, but fractal patch complexity was relatively stable through time. Raster algebra analysis showed that < 10% of the initial woody cover from 1938 to 1940 remained in 2018, although total cover went through various expansion/reduction phases. This research underscores the importance of long-term datasets and locally based knowledge in the application and interpretation of historical management paradigms. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Highly abundant ungulate populations are widely observed in heavily browsed habitats; however, few studies have investigated the effects of chronic browsing on the life-history traits of large herbivores. We assessed the nutritional quality (crude protein [CP] contents) of staple foods, reproductive success, fawn recruitment, winter body mass, and body size in an introduced population of sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1938) on Nakanoshima Island, Lake Toya, Japan, which underwent repeated irruptions with shifting alternative foods and maintained high densities (>20 deer/km(2)). Our evaluation covered each irruptive dynamical phase, including initial irruption (Phase 1), second irruption (Phase 2), and subsequent phase (Phase 3). CP contents of staple foods (plum yew and litterfall in Phases 2 and 3, respectively) were at the same level as that of dwarf bamboo in Phase 1 during summer but were lower in autumn and winter, suggesting a decline in diet quality after initial irruption. The deer herd exhibited density-dependent changes in life-history traits, including delayed sexual maturity, lower fawn recruitment, and delayed body growth. The mean adult female (>= 3 years old) body mass in Phases 2-3 was marginally above the 50% pregnancy rate threshold. The deer herd tolerated substantial declines in food quality, which involved trade-offs between survival, growth, and reproduction as adaptations to life-history traits. This phenotypic plasticity is the main factor in maintaining high deer densities under severe food resource limitations. This suggests that the sika deer population will not reach equilibrium with their food resources without hunting or predators.

AB  - Carcass scavenging by vertebrates is a critical ecosystem service that is influenced by environmental factors such as season and habitat. However, there is limited understanding of the role that these factors play in shaping scavenging patterns across different bioregions. We used camera traps to monitor vertebrate scavengers at 120 kangaroo (Family: Macropodidae) carcasses that were positioned across different seasons (warm/cool) and habitats (open/closed canopy) in three disparate desert, subalpine and temperate bioregions in Australia. Our survey identified 27 species that scavenged carcasses and revealed clear differences in scavenging patterns across the three bioregions. Carcass use was highest for feral cats, birds of prey, corvids and red foxes in the desert bioregion; for reptiles and dingoes in the temperate bioregion and for feral pigs, possums and dingoes in the subalpine bioregion. Bioregional differences in scavenger guild composition explained >4.6 times more variation in scavenger guild dissimilarity than season and >9.8 times more variation than habitat. Further, habitat had few effects on scavenger communities or carcass detection and use, whereas season was a strong predictor of these responses. Across bioregions, there were some general seasonal and habitat scavenging trends, with mammals and birds often using carcasses more frequently in cooler seasons and birds detecting carcasses faster in open habitat. However, there was also extensive within-bioregion seasonal variation. For example, depending on bioregion, some animals scavenged more frequently or detected carcasses faster in warmer seasons (i.e. birds and reptiles). Our results show that vertebrate scavenging is mediated by a complex interplay of environmental variables, especially seasonality, which may operate differently across bioregions. These findings have implications for understanding variability in vertebrate scavenging patterns and, in turn, functionally redundant or complementary scavenging processes.

AB  - Global warming is deeply influencing various ecological processes, especially regarding the phenological synchronization pattern between species, but more cases around the world are needed to reveal it. We report how the forest leaf phenology and ungulate molting respond differently to climate change, and investigate whether it will result in a potential phenology mismatch. Here, we explored how climate change might alter phenological synchronization between forest leaf phenology and Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) molting in northeast China based on a camera-trapping dataset of seven consecutive years, analyzing forest leaf phenology in combination with records of Siberian roe deer molting over the same period by means of wavelet analysis. We found that the start of the growing season of forest leaf phenology was advanced, while the end of the growing season was delayed, so that the length of the growing season was prolonged. Meanwhile, the start and the end of the molting of Siberian roe deer were both advanced in spring, but in autumn, the start of molting was delayed while the end of molting was advanced. The results of wavelet analysis also suggested the time lag of synchronization fluctuated slightly from year to year between forest leaf phenology and Siberian roe deer molting, with a potential phenology mismatch in spring, indicating the effect of global warming on SRD to forest leaf phenology. Overall, our study provides new insight into the synchronization between forest leaf phenology and ungulate molting, and demonstrates feasible approaches to data collection and analysis using camera-trapping data to explore global warming issues.

AB  - Concerns that climate warming may drive the spread of ectoparasites into previously uninhabited areas have increased the need for baseline knowledge of their distributional history. For species of wildlife health concern, presence data are often lacking or outdated, thus limiting our ability to assess range changes and subsequent host impacts. We reconstructed the past and present distribution of the winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus, through the compilation of a spatiotemporal database to create the first full baseline map of its occurrence throughout its North American range. The ongoing impacts of winter tick epizootics in moose (Alces alces) and recent mortality events in elk (Cervus canadensis) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have led to a resurgence in interest in the future of this parasite in a warming climate. Over 3400 unique records of winter tick occurrence were compiled from multiple data sources, dating from 1869 to 2020 and spanning from 16.5 to 66.2 degrees N latitude. Both conventional published sources and natural history records were included along with new records from previously unpublished datasets and citizen science observations, to make this a comprehensive occurrence dataset for this species. Along with standardized location information and year of observation, the dataset includes associated host species and descriptive categorization of the type and source of each record, providing new opportunities to examine host-parasite interactions in the winter tick system over time and space. In presenting these data, we discuss the potential sampling biases and lacunas in our integrated database records, particularly at the winter tick's northernmost range. We also document changes in the types and sources of winter tick information from past to present, highlighting potential issues that should be considered before using these data in further analyses and when collecting ongoing records. Our database demonstrates that the collation and synthesis of records beyond conventional sources can shed light on the distributional history of tick species and serve as a useful baseline for prioritizing future research and management decisions.

AB  - Purpose Applying excessive N is a common strategy in tea plantations. Fungal and bacterial responses to N fertiliser addition in tea plantations, especially their relationship with tea growth, quality, and soil microbiome composition, remain unclear. Methods We performed a field experiment using different N fertiliser application rates for 5 years (2016-2020) in a tea-producing region of China. Results The N application rate of 360 kg ha(-1) y(-1) achieved the highest tea yield and quality. Bacterial diversity and community responses to N addition were more apparent than fungal diversity and community responses. Partial least square path modelling suggested that N addition directly affected the diversity and communities of bacteria and fungi and indirectly affected bacterial community and fungal diversity by altering soil contents. N fertiliser application contributed to tea growth but did not maintain high microbial diversity. Conclusion Fungal alpha and beta diversity had a greater effect on tea yield and quality than bacterial diversity; therefore, more attention should be given to fungi such as ligninolytic and cellulolytic taxa, which play a stable role in nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition in tea plantations, favouring tea growth in the long term.

AB  - Host contact structure affects pathogen transmission in host populations, but many measures of host contact do not distinguish contacts that are relevant to pathogen transmission from those that are not. Scrapes are sites for chemical communication by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) during the breeding season and potential sites of transmission of prions, the causative agent of chronic wasting disease (CWD). Scrape-related behaviors vary in their probability of transmitting prions to or from the environment, suggesting that behavior be combined with contact structure to better reflect potential heterogeneity in prion transmission at scrapes. We recorded visits and behaviors by deer at scrapes throughout DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, Nebraska in 2005 and 2006. We recorded 2013 interactions by 169 unique identifiable males and 75 females. Adult males performed the most scrape-related behaviors and spent the most time at scrapes, especially smelling the overhanging branch (70%), smelling the scrape (59%), licking/grasping the overhanging branch (44%), and scraping (36%). We used social network analysis to test the effect of behavior on indirect contact networks among deer at scrapes. By weighting edges based on the frequency and duration of behaviors, we produced networks representing sources of variation in scrape use and compared these networks to evaluate the effects of behavior on network contact structure. Social networks based on scrape-related behavior were highly connected and dependent upon the frequency, duration, and type of behavior exhibited at scrapes (e.g., scraping, interacting with a scrape or overhanging branch, rub-urinating, grazing) as well as the age of the deer. Accounting for contact frequency produced networks with lower variation in contact, but higher ability to facilitate contact among disparate groups. Including behavior when defining edges did not preserve the network properties of simpler measures (i.e., unweighted networks) suggesting that heterogeneity in behaviors that affect transmission probability is important for inferring transmission networks from contact networks. High connectivity through indirect contacts suggests that scrapes may be effective targets for management. Adult male deer had the highest connectivity, suggesting that management strategies focused on reducing their interaction with scrapes through density reduction or behavioral modification could reduce the connectivity of indirect contact networks.

AB  - Research on economic, ecological and relative benefits from organic and conventional farming systems has gained significant importance. Organic farming increases species diversity, enhances biological control services, and thus complements sustainable pest management. However, published literature is scarce on cotton crops grown organically with respect to the abundance and diversity of biological control agents and their effects on herbivore populations, typically from developing nations. To address the question, the non-transgenic cotton variety CIM-573 was cultivated under two fertility management systems, that is, organic and conventional in 2019 and 2021, and subsequently, differences in the abundance and diversity of arthropod communities were carried out. We applied cattle manure in organic fields 1 month before planting; however, synthetic fertilizers were used in conventional fields. We sampled arthropods weekly after 7 weeks of sowing from the middle rows of treatments for both types of fields. We recorded 10 herbivores as well as eight natural enemy species. Herbivores were more abundant in conventional cotton. However, natural enemies were higher in organic cotton fields. Principal component analysis of herbivores assemblages depicted that Shannon diversity and abundance were positively correlated in the conventional cotton while Menhinick richness and Simpson dominance index were higher in organic cotton. Likewise, natural enemies' abundance, Shannon diversity, Menhinick richness and Simpson dominance were typically more concentrated in organic cultivated cotton. Regression analysis confirmed that the abundance and diversity of natural enemies played a significant role in lowering herbivores populations. Seed cotton yield was significantly higher in conventional cotton and the yield difference between organic and conventional cotton was 27.98%. Our study clearly demonstrates that organic cotton provides more functional and complementary niches to natural enemies and plays a crucial role in pest suppression. Implications of our results for future pest management with respect to ecosystem services in organically grown cotton crops are also discussed.

AB  - Zooarchaeological mollusc assemblages can show communities as they existed prior to any extensive modern impacts, representing an ecological baseline against which current populations can be evaluated. Here data are presented from the Pruitt Shelter sites (Late Woodland-Early Mississippian; ca. AD 700-1300), located on the Buffalo National River (Arkansas), where over 1000 freshwater mussels and over 20,000 gastropods (aquatic and terrestrial combined) were recovered. To date, these archaeofaunas represent the most detailed and robust mollusc assemblage from the Ozark Highlands, while also demonstrating biogeographical, paleoenvironmental, and population characteristics that should be valuable to modern conservation efforts in the region.

AB  - The outcome of encounters between predators and prey affects predation rates and ultimately population dynamics. Determining how environmental features influence predation rates helps guide conservation and management efforts. We studied where gray wolves (Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758) and coyotes (Canis latrans Say, 1823) killed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) in northern Wisconsin, USA. We monitored 499 white-tailed deer for cause-specific mortality between 2011 and 2014 using VHF radio collars. We investigated the locations of 125 deer mortalities and determined that 63 were canid (wolf or coyote) kill sites. We analyzed spatial patterns of kill sites using resource selection functions in a model selection framework, incorporating environmental variables including vegetative cover, human development, snow depth, and water. We found no evidence that vegetative cover or human development affected predation risk; however, we did find that increasing snow depth resulted in increased relative predation risk. This finding is consistent with existing research on the influence of snow cover on white-tailed deer survival. Our results suggest that understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of white-tailed deer predation requires a better understanding of snow depth variation in space and time. As climate change scenarios predict changes in snowfall throughout the northern hemisphere, understanding the effect on predator-prey spatial dynamics will be important for management and conservation efforts.

AB  - The Solega community living in the Biligiri Rangan Hills (B. R. Hills) of Karnataka State, southern India, have noticed significant changes to the ecosystem of their forest homeland over the last four or five decades. Originally hunter-gatherers, who carried out swidden agriculture at a subsistence level, they were forced to abandon the semi-nomadic ways of their ancestors, and settle in permanent villages when these forests were first declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1974. In this paper, we present the views of Solega elders on the ecological changes that have taken place in the B. R. Hills, along with the subsequent changes in their interactions with the animals that also inhabit this landscape. The Solega way of life is accustomed to co-existing with wildlife, and they worship several animal deities. Their folklore and traditional ecological knowledge are also replete with ways of avoiding dangerous encounters with wildlife. Many of the detrimental ecological changes observed by Solega people are ascribed by them to the halting of their traditional litter fire regime, and the subsequent rampant growth of the exotic invasive plant Lantana camara, which now dominates the understorey in large swathes of the forest. These factors combine, according to Solega elders, to negatively impact the well-being of both animals as well as their own people. We hope to demonstrate how a deeper understanding of Solega language and culture, both essential facets of everyday life, as well as of their traditional ecological knowledge-can allow a full appreciation of the interactions between small Indigenous communities, such as the Solega, and the natural environment. We argue for a greater appreciation of, and engagement with, Indigenous knowledge in conservation efforts in countries such as India, where the protection of charismatic species, such as tigers, is often perceived to be at odds with the rights of small minority groups, such as the Solega.

AB  - Levels of biodiversity are globally underestimated, especially in tropical ecosystems. This is particularly so for bats compared to other mammalian taxa, due to morphological conservatism. Here, we investigate West African bats of the Hipposideros caffer complex, an insectivorous bat group occurring throughout the Afrotropics. From samples collected in Ghana, we aim to resolve the cryptic diversity identified by mitochondrial (mt) DNA using nuclear genetic, acoustic, and external morphometric data. We confirmed the presence of four previously established mtDNA lineages within the H. caffer complex and found significant genetic divergence among lineages based on nuclear microsatellite data and significant differences in frequencies of echolocation calls and morphometric measures. From these new data, we conclude that H. caffer complex in West Africa consists of at least four distinct species. While the small-sized species from coastal savanna could be assigned to H. caffer tephrus, the taxonomic identity of the three sympatric, similarly sized species pertaining to H. ruber from the forest zone of Central Ghana is yet to be assessed.

AB  - Bio-telemetry from small tags attached to animals is one of the principal methods for studying the ecology and behaviour of wildlife. The field has constantly evolved over the last 80 years as technological improvement enabled a diversity of sensors to be integrated into the tags (e.g., GPS, accelerometers, etc.). However, retrieving data from tags on free-ranging animals remains a challenge since satellite and GSM networks are relatively expensive and or power hungry. Recently a new class of low-power communication networks have been developed and deployed worldwide to connect the internet of things (IoT). Here, we evaluated one of these, the Sigfox IoT network, for the potential as a real-time multi-sensor data retrieval and tag commanding system for studying fauna across a diversity of species and ecosystems. We tracked 312 individuals across 30 species (from 25 g bats to 3 t elephants) with seven different device concepts, resulting in more than 177,742 successful transmissions. We found a maximum line of sight communication distance of 280 km (on a flying cape vulture [Gyps coprotheres]), which sets a new documented record for animal-borne digital data transmission using terrestrial infrastructure. The average transmission success rate amounted to 68.3% (SD 22.1) on flying species and 54.1% (SD 27.4) on terrestrial species. In addition to GPS data, we also collected and transmitted data products from accelerometers, barometers, and thermometers. Further, we assessed the performance of Sigfox Atlas Native, a low-power method for positional estimates based on radio signal strengths and found a median accuracy of 12.89 km (MAD 5.17) on animals. We found that robust real-time communication (median message delay of 1.49 s), the extremely small size of the tags (starting at 1.28 g without GPS), and the low power demands (as low as 5.8 mu Ah per transmitted byte) unlock new possibilities for ecological data collection and global animal observation.

AB  - Land-use and local field management affect pollinators, pest damage and ultimately crop yields. Agroecology is implemented as a sustainable alternative to conventional agricultural practices, but little is known about its potential for pollination and pest management. Sub-Saharan Africa is underrepresented in studies investigating the relative importance of pests and pollinators for crop productivity and how this might be influenced by surrounding landscapes or agroecological practices. In Malawi, we selected 24 smallholder farms differing in landscape-scale shrubland cover, implementation of manual pest removal as an indicator of an agroecological pest management practice, and the number of agroecological soil practices employed at the household level, such as mulching, intercropping and soil conservation tillage. We established pumpkin plots and assessed the abundance and richness of flower visitors and damage of flowers (florivory) caused by pest herbivores on flowers. Using a full-factorial hand pollination and exclusion experiment on each plot, we investigated the relative contribution of pollination and florivory to pumpkin yield. Increasing shrubland cover decreased honeybee abundance but increased the abundance and richness of non-honeybee visitors. Manual removal of herbivores considered to be pests reduced flower visitors, whereas more agroecological soil management practices increased flower visitors. Neither shrubland cover nor agroecological management affected florivory. Pollinator limitation, but not florivory, constrained pumpkin fruit set, and increasing visitor richness decreased the relative differences between hand-and animal-pollinated flowers. We recommend improved protection of shrubland habitats and increasing agroecological soil practices to promote pollinator richness on smallholder farms.

AB  - In North America, some moose populations are declining, and meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) infections may be contributing. Moose are aberrant hosts for meningeal worm and develop severe pathology whereas white-tailed deer (WTD) are definitive hosts that experience minimal pathology and spread parasite larvae into the environment. Analyses of harvested WTD heads confirmed meningeal worm in Western Manitoba, Canada including in areas where moose have experienced population declines and are currently of management concern. The prevalence of larval meningeal worm from WTD feces in these areas are unknown, particularly because the dorsal-spined larvae (DSL) are morphologically indistinguishable from muscle worm (Parelaphos-trongylus andersoni). To assess transmission risk of DSL, we investigated the spatial and temporal variation of prevalence in WTD feces from four areas (two with historical moose population declines and two without) sampled across two summers. We predicted higher prevalence of DSL in areas where moose are of management concern and surveys have shown higher meningeal worm prevalence in WTD heads. Further, we expected to only recover meningeal worm, as muscle worm has only been reported from caribou in more northern areas of Manitoba. We collected WTD feces by transect sampling, used the Baermann technique to obtain larvae, and sequenced partial cytochrome oxidase 1 and internal transcribed spacer 2 genes to confirm species identity. Zero inflated models revealed that DSL prevalence did not differ temporally but was higher in areas where moose are of management concern. Genetic analyses revealed that meningeal worm and muscle worm were both present in Western Manitoba and co-occurred in three areas. Our results reveal novel insights into the geographic distribution of muscle worm and emphasize the importance of DNA sequencing for DSL identification. We suggest that concern for moose populations is warranted given the increased risk of parasite infection in some management areas.

AB  - Long-term fitness effects of parental age could affect population dynamics, as age structure can vary considerably over time. Few studies of wild animals, however, have examined the possible long-term fitness consequences of parental age. Based upon 50 years of data on wild bighorn sheep, we investigated how parental age affected three offspring traits-mass at three years, longevity, and female lifetime reproductive success. We also tested for a survival filter which could mask or increase fitness effects of parental age. Our results showed a significant, quadratic negative association between maternal age, offspring longevity and female lifetime reproductive success. Offspring born to mothers aged 5 to 6 yr lived about 2 yr longer and weaned about 1.5 lambs more than siblings born to mothers aged 12 to 13 yr. The effect of paternal age was not significant. There was also a positive association between the longevity of mothers and offspring. We did not detect any effects of parental age on mass at three years for offspring of either sex. These results demonstrate the presence of persistent maternal age effects in a long-lived species. The sex-specific effects support the importance of analyzing maternal and paternal age effects separately, as well as effects on female and male offspring. This study advances our understanding of evolutionary processes and population dynamics in wild long-lived mammals.
   In bighorn sheep, offspring of older mothers had shorter life expectancy and lifetime reproductive success than their siblings born when the mother was younger. There was no effect of paternal age on offspring traits. The age of mothers and fathers did not affect offspring adult mass. Age structure of mothers could affect population dynamics over the long run: if most mothers are old, subsequent life expectancy and reproductive success will be reduced.

AB  - Insect herbivory on plant leaves is a major determinant of plant fitness, especially the growth and survival of tree seedlings in forests. Leaf size is believed to significantly affect the intensity of herbivory. Studies often assume the relationship between leaf size and herbivory to be monotonic; however, this relationship is influenced by many factors-the magnitude and direction of which are different-indicating a complex non-monotonic pattern. In this study, we investigated the herbivory of 5754 leaves of 422 seedlings belonging to 42 subtropical tree species over two seasons in southwest China. The effects of leaf size on herbivory differed among seasons; a hump-shaped pattern was detected in December, while a pattern of monotonic increase was detected in September. A variety of patterns, including complex non-monotonic hump-shaped patterns, as well as patterns indicating monotonic decrease and increase existed among species, although most species displayed no significant corre-lations. The relationship between leaf size and insect herbivory did not follow a constant rule, but differed across species and seasons, indicating that the effects of leaf size on the foraging preferences of insect herbivores may be contingent on both external (e.g., temperature) and intrinsic (e.g., other leaf traits) factors. Therefore, a one-off survey focusing on few species may not provide complete understanding of the overall pattern of the effect of leaf size on herbivory. Similar variations may also exist in other ecological processes, which should be given due consideration in future studies on biotic interactions.

AB  - Replanting broadleaved trees in monoculture conifer plantations has been shown to improve the ecological environment. However, not much is known about the distribution properties of soil phosphate-mobilizing bacteria (PMB) under different mixed plantings or how PMB affects biometabolism-driven phosphorus (P) bioavailability. The phoD and pqqC genes serve as molecular markers of PMB because they regulate the mobilization of organic (Po) and inorganic (Pi) P. Differences in soil bioavailable P concentration, phoD- and pqqCharboring PMB communities, and their main regulators were analyzed using biologically-based P (BBP) and highthroughput sequencing approaches after combining coniferous trees (Pinus massoniana) and five individual broadleaved trees (Bretschneidera sinensis, Michelia maudiae, Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Manglietia conifera, and Camellia oleifera). The findings revealed that the contents of litter P, soil organic carbon (SOC), available Pi (CaCl2-P), and labile Po (Enzyme-P) were significantly higher in conifer-broadleaf mixed plantations than those in the monospecific Pinus massoniana plantations (PM), especially in the mixed stands with the introduction of Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Michelia maudiae, and Camellia oleifera. Conifer-broadleaf mixing had little effect on the abundance of phoD and pqqC genes but significantly altered species composition within the communities. Conifer-broadleaf mixing improved soil microbial habitat mainly by increasing the pH, increasing carbon source availability and nutrient content, decreasing exchangeable Fe3+ and Al3+ content, and decreasing the activation degrees of Fe and Al oxides in acidic soils. A small group of taxa (phoD: Bradyrhizobium, Tardiphaga, Nitratireductor, Mesorhizobium, Herbaspirillum, and Ralstonia; pqqC: Burkholderia, Variovorax, Bradyrhizobium, and Leptothrix) played a key role in the synthesis of P-related enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphomonoesterase, ALP) and in lowering the levels of mineral-occluded (HCl-P) and chelated (Citrate-P) Pi. Overall, our findings highlight that mixing conifers and broadleaves could change the PMB communities that produce ALP and dissolve Pi to make P more bioavailable.

AB  - We investigated the effect of anthropogenically-driven habitat modifications on insectivorous bat activity and diversity along a stretch of the Eerste River, Stellenbosch, South Africa, by determining insect abundance, water quality and vegetation and river characteristics at four sites of varying anthropogenic impact. Passive acoustic monitoring was used to determine species composition and activity of bats at each of the sites. A total of 14,457 bat passes was recorded, with the same six species being found at each of the sites: four clutter edge foragers ( Myotis tricolor, , Eptesicus hottentotus, , Miniopterus natalensis and Laephotis capensis) ) and a single clutter forager ( Rhinolophus clivosus) ) and open-air forager ( Tadarida aegyptiaca). ). Bat activity was greater at the lower two most eutrophied sites, and greatest at the residential (urban) site. Laephotis capensis, , an urban-adapted species, was by far the most active, probably on account of both insensitivity to light pollution, and roost-site availability. The highest and most pristine site (Eiland) and the lowest and most polluted site (Spier) displayed the greatest diversity, despite highly elevated levels of chloride and nitrate at the latter site. So anthropogenic effects on water quality appear not to have negatively affected bat diversity along this stretch of the Eerste River. As these effects are likely to increase, this study serves as a baseline for future monitoring of bats along its course.

AB  - Understanding the spatial dynamics of animal movement is an essential component of maintaining ecological connectivity, conserving key habitats, and mitigating the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance. Altered movement and migratory patterns are often an early warning sign of the effects of environmental disturbance, and a precursor to population declines. Here, we present a hierarchical Bayesian framework based on Gaussian processes for analysing the spatial characteristics of animal movement. At the heart of our approach is a novel covariance kernel that links the spatially varying parameters of a continuous-time velocity model with GPS locations from multiple individuals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by first applying it to a synthetic data set and then by analysing telemetry data from the Serengeti wildebeest migration. Through application of our approach, we are able to identify the key pathways of the wildebeest migration as well as revealing the impacts of environmental features on movement behaviour.

AB  - Warming temperatures are increasing rainfall extremes, yet arthropod responses to climatic fluctuations remain poorly understood. Here, we used spatiotemporal variation in tropical montane climate as a natural experiment to compare the importance of biotic versus abiotic drivers in regulating arthropod biomass. We combined intensive field data on arthropods, leaf phenology and in situ weather across a 1700-3100 m elevation and rainfall gradient, along with desiccation-resistance experiments and multi-decadal modelling. We found limited support for biotic drivers with weak increases in some herbivorous taxa on shrubs with new leaves, but no landscape-scale effects of leaf phenology, which tracked light and cloud cover. Instead, rainfall explained extensive interannual variability with maximum biomass at intermediate rainfall (130 mm month(-1)) as both 3 months of high and low rainfall reduced arthropods by half. Based on 50 years of regional rainfall, our dynamic arthropod model predicted shifts in the timing of biomass maxima within cloud forests before plant communities transition to seasonally deciduous dry forests (mean annual rainfall 1000-2500 mm vs. <800 mm). Rainfall magnitude was the primary driver, but during high solar insolation, the 'drying power of air' (VPDmax) reduced biomass within days contributing to drought related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Highlighting risks from drought, experiments demonstrated community-wide susceptibility to desiccation except for some caterpillars in which melanin-based coloration appeared to reduce the effects of evaporative drying. Overall, we provide multiple lines of evidence that several months of heavy rain or drought reduce arthropod biomass independently of deep-rooted plants with the potential to destabilize insectivore food webs.

AB  - The Atlantic sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus supports one of the most valuable federal fisheries in the USA, with annual ex-vessel values of US$400-600 million since 2010. Among other strategies, the fishery utilizes rotational area management to protect juvenile sea scallops, increasing yield per recruit and spawning potential. While generally successful, area management was challenged by 2 extremely high-density recruitment events. Juveniles at both study sites, the Nantucket Lightship Closed Area and the Elephant Trunk portion of the Mid-Atlantic Access Area, persisted at high densities (up to 39 and 5 sea scallops m-2, respectively) and initially exhibited poor growth, yield, and gamete production. The effect of sea scallop population density on reproduction was investigated through quarterly sampling from May 2018 through January 2020 in low-, medium-, and high-density strata. Reproductive effort, i.e. the proportion of energy devoted to gamete production, was quantified to investigate differences in energy allocation across density, depth, shell height, reproductive stage, and sex. Reproductive activity was limited in the Nantucket Lightship high-density stratum, where the percentage of sea scallops staged as mature or spawning reached 50% during only 1 of 7 sampling trips, compared to 4-6 sampling trips in other strata. Population density was a significant predictor of reproductive effort, with a 28% reduction in reproductive effort from the highest densities to more typical densities. These results illustrate the complexities of managing fisheries for heterogeneous populations of sessile benthic invertebrates. Negative density-dependent effects should be monitored and accounted for in future extreme recruitment events.

AB  - Hybridization is a natural process at species-range boundaries that may variably promote the speciation process or break down species barriers but minimally will influence management outcomes of distinct populations. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) have broad and overlapping distributions in North America and a recognized capacity for interspecific hybridization. In response to contemporary environmental change to any of one or multiple still-unknown factors, mule deer range is contracting westward accompanied by a westward expansion of white-tailed deer, leading to increasing interactions, opportunities for gene flow, and associated conservation implications. To quantify genetic diversity, phylogenomic structure, and dynamics of hybridization in sympatric populations of white-tailed and mule deer, we used mitochondrial cytochrome b data coupled with SNP loci discovered with double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing. We recovered 25,018 SNPs across 92 deer samples from both species, collected from two regions of western Kansas. Eight individuals with unambiguous external morphology representing both species were of hybrid origin (8.7%), and represented the product of multi-generational backcrossing. Mitochondrial data showed both ancient and recent directional discordance with morphological species assignments, reflecting a legacy of mule deer males mating with white-tailed deer females. Mule deer had lower genetic diversity than white-tailed deer, and both mitochondrial and nuclear data suggest contemporary mule deer effective population decline. Landscape genetic analyses show relative isolation between the two study regions for white-tailed deer, but greater connectivity among mule deer, with predominant movement from north to south. Collectively, our results suggest a long history of gene flow between these species in the Great Plains and hint at evolutionary processes that purge incompatible functional genomic elements as a result of hybridization. Surviving hybrids evidently may be reproductive, but with unknown consequences for the future integrity of these species, population trajectories, or relative susceptibility to emerging pathogens.

AB  - Azeri water buffalo is a species of great interest due to the high quality of its products such as milk. Due to the decreasing trend of its number and risk of extinction in the future, our attention is directed towards ensuring the preservation of its genetic reserves by keeping its sperm. Using antioxidants in semen extender is one of the ways to reduce the detrimental effects of freezing process on post-thawed quality of spermatozoa. This study was conducted to determine the effect of.-carrageenan (k-CRG) and C60HyFn supplemented semen extender on the quality of post-thawed Azari water buffalo spermatozoa. A total of 30 semen samples were obtained from three buffaloes using an artificial vagina (twice a week for five weeks = 10 replicates). The samples (n = 3) from each replicate were pooled and divided into equal aliquots to prepare 14 extender groups, including control (C), k-0.2, K-0.4, K-0.6, K-0.8 (containing 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 mg K-CRG/mL, respectively), C-0.1, C-0.2, C-0.4, C-0.8, C-1, C-5, C-10, C-20, and C-40 (containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40 mu M C60HyFn, respectively), and then frozen. After thawing, motility and velocity parameters, plasma membrane integrity (PMI) and functionality (PMF), DNA damage, Hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) test, malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase glutathione activities and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging were evaluated. In vivo fertility was compared between k-0.6, C-1 and control groups. 60 buffalo were inseminated 24 h after the onset of estrus. The diagnosis of pregnancy was performed rectally at least 60 days after fertilization. Total and progressive motility and velocity parameters were improved by k-0.4, k-0.6, k-0.8, C-0.4, C-0.8, C-1, C-5, and C-10 groups) compared to the other groups. Plasma membranes integrity and PMF were improved by k-0.4, k-0.6, C-0.4, C-0.8, C-1, C-5, and C-10 groups compared to other groups, while in terms of sperm DNA damage K-0.4, K-0.6, K-0.8, C-0.2, C-0.4, C-0.8, C-1, C-5, and C-10 groups showed better results compared to the control group. The evidence also showed that k-0.4, k-0.6, k-0.8, C-0.4, C-0.8, C-1, C-5, and C-10 groups could improve TAC, and decrease MDA levels. Also, k-0.4, k-0.6, k-0.8, C-0.2, C-0.4, C-0.8, C-1, C-5, and C-10 groups could improve GPx, CAT, and GSH levels, but no significant difference was found regarding SOD compared to the other groups. DPPH scavengers were tested by K-0.6, K-0.8 and C-1, C-5, C-10, C-0.8, C-0.4 and C-0.2 groups and compared to other groups improved. The fertility rate [70% (14/20)] was higher in C-1 than other groups. To conclude that k-CRG and C60HyFn supplementation can increase the quality parameters of cryopreserved buffalo semen after thawing and that 1 M C60HyFn can increase in vivo fertility of buffalo semen.

AB  - A solid phylogenetic framework is the basis of biological studies, yet higher level relationships are still unresolved in some major vertebrate lineages. One such group is Crocodylia, where the branching pattern of three major families (Alligatoridae, Crocodylidae and Gavialidae) has been disputed over decades due to the uncertain relationship of two slender-snouted lineages, gavialines and tomistomines. Here, we report a bizarre crocodylian from the Bronze Age of China, which shows a mosaic of gavialine and tomistomine features across the skeleton, rendering support to their sister taxon relationship as molecular works have consistently postulated. Gavialine characters of the new Chinese crocodylian include a novel configuration of the pterygoid bulla, a vocal structure known in mature male Indian gharials. Extinct gavialines have repeatedly evolved potentially male-only acoustic apparatus of various shapes, illuminating the deep history of sexual selection on acoustic signalling in a slender-snouted group of crocodylians. Lastly, a cutmark analysis combined with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating of bone remains demonstrated that two individuals from Shang and Zhou dynasties in Guangdong, China, suffered head injuries and decapitation. Archaeological evidence together with historical accounts suggests the human-induced extinction of this unique crocodylian only a few hundred years ago.

AB  - The effects of conspecific densities on dispersal have been well documented. However, while positive and negative density-dependent dispersal based on conspecific densities often are shown to be the result of intraspecific competition or facilitation, respectively, the effects of heterospecific densities on dispersal have been examined far less frequently. This gap in knowledge warrants investigation given the potential for the analogous processes of interspecific competition and heterospecific attraction to influence dispersal patterns and behavior. Here we use a long-term live-trapping study of deer mouse (Perotnyscus maniculatus), eastern chipmunk (Tamias striaius), red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi), and jumping mice (Napaeozapus insignis and Zapus hudsonius) to examine the effects of variation in conspecific and heterospecific abundances on dispersal frequency. In terms of conspecific abundance, jumping mice were more likely to disperse from areas with fewer conspecifics, while red-backed voles and chipmunks did not respond to variation in conspecific abundances in their dispersal frequencies. While there were no statistically significant effects of variation in heterospecific abundances on dispersal frequency, some effect sizes for heterospecific abundance effects on dispersal met or exceeded those of conspecific abundances. Conspecific abundances clearly can affect dispersal by some species in this system, but the effects of heterospecific abundances on dispersal frequency are less clear. Based on effect sizes, it appears that there may be potential for heterospecific effects on dispersal by some species in the community, although the strength and causes of these relationships remain unclear.

AB  - Rangeland degradation is a persistent decline in the productivity of vegetation that supports wild or domestic herbivores. However, rangelands often exhibit highly variable climates and dynamic, resilient vegetation, making it difficult to discriminate between lasting degradation and natural variability. Here, we introduce a new and flexible index to distinguish management-driven rangeland degradation from the influence of environmental variability using freely available remote sensing-derived datasets. We use quantile regression forests to estimate the potential gross primary productivity as a continuous function of biophysical conditions including climatic, soil and topographic variables. The relative productivity index (RPI) is then defined as the ratio between observed and potential productivity in each grid cell and year. This provides a dynamic reference point against which variation in rangeland condition across space and through time can be quantified consistently within a single framework. We test the method in the arid and semi-arid rangelands of East Africa and compare its performance to three other widely used methods to distinguish management impacts from natural variability: rain use efficiency, local gross primary production scaling, and residual trend analysis. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches both in explaining spatial differences in productivity and in controlling for climatic variability through time. In combination with other remote sensing and field-derived metrics, the rangeland productivity index has the potential to become a valuable indicator for quantifying rangeland condition and supporting sustainable management and utilisation of these landscapes.

AB  - Functional diversity measures help to understand the underlying mechanisms explaining the relationship between organisms and environment. This work examined the mesozooplankton community of an estuary under the hypothesis that the upper (< 25 psu) and lower (> 25 psu) zones are functionally different in terms of feeding strategies, trophic groups, camouflage, buoyancy, and defense against predators, due to the salinity gradient. We used the 'community-weighted mean trait values' (CWM) and a fuzzy correspondence analysis (FCA) in combination with three functional indices (FRic: functional richness, FEve: functional evenness, FDiv: functional divergence) to test our hypothesis. Zooplankton samples were taken in the tropical Sontecomapan estuary, southern Gulf of Mexico, in June 2018 and October 2019. A total of 21 zooplankton groups were recognized, all of them present in the lower estuary. Results showed significant differences (p< 0.05) in the FRic and FDiv values between the two zones, as well in the CWM metric. Results of the FCA showed that the lower estuary was characterized by herbivorous filter feeders that use watery bodies, flattened body forms, mucus houses, or 'wings' for buoyancy; highly transparent bodies (associated with gelatinous body structure) for camouflage and predators' avoidance and, shells or carapaces as antipredator tactics. The upper estuary was characterized by omnivorous cruising predators that use their appendages or swim bladders for buoyancy, with 'medium' and 'low' levels of transparency, associated with chitinous and skin-protected body structures, which provide alternative ways for camouflage and spines or fast swimming behavior to protect from predators. These findings evidenced that the upper and lower zones of an estuary exhibit differences in the function of the zooplankton community and shed new light on the comprehension of estuaries' ecological function.

AB  - Jacks are highly prized tropical marine fish. Most of them complete their whole life cycle at sea but some use estuaries at the juvenile stage before moving back to coastal waters and joining the adult exploited stocks. Little is known about jacks' trophic ecology in estuaries, although their juveniles' ability to successfully exploit available resources in these productive environments may strongly affect stock recruitment success in the species concerned. In this study, stomach content and stable isotope analyses were combined to investigate diet and food niche overlap of juveniles from two sympatric species of jacks (Caranx latus and C. hippos) in three contrasted estuaries (Suape, Sirinhae & acute;m and Santa Cruz) spread along the northeastern Brazilian coast. Overall, although the juveniles of C. latus exhibited a more piscivorous diet than those of C. hippos, the two species had very similar isotopic niches, with mean delta 13C and delta 15N values of -19.35 +/- 2.10%o and 11.03 +/- 1.11%o and of -19.10 +/- 1.82%o and 10.21 +/- 1.21%o, for C. hippos and C. latus respectively. In all the estuaries sampled, both species mostly ate fish (Ni = 20.1-46.2%, Wi = 60.1-75.1%, essentially Gobiidae and Clupeidae) and crustaceans (Ni = 26.0-65.9%, Wi = 23.3-38.2%, mainly Penaeidae shrimps). As a result, the overlap between their global estuarine isotopic niches was >68%. However, diet composition for the two species varied among estuaries, indicating that their juveniles partly adapt their food preferences to local prey availability. Notably, prey preferences differed significantly between the two species only in the Santa Cruz estuary, where delta 15N values were the highest for both species. Conversely, interspecific differences in delta 13C ratios were greater in the Suape and the Sirinhae & acute;m estuaries, likely reflecting a wider diversity in the carbon sources sustaining local food webs. Thus, combined differences in juvenile diet and food web structure at each location resulted in much-reduced local isotopic niche overlaps between the two species (from 27% in Suape to 57% in Santa Cruz). These results have important implications for resource and ecosystem management in northeastern Brazil and call for systematic cross-site comparisons when evaluating fish ecology and resource partitioning within estuarine systems.

AB  - Background Insect herbivory has profound impacts on ecosystem processes and services. Although many efforts have been made to recognize the main drivers of insect herbivory at different scales, the results are inconsistent. One likely reason is that studies have insufficiently captured the spatially heterogeneous factors such as soil type and forest stratum within the stand that may significantly affect insect herbivory. In particular, there is a lack of studies that address the detailed spatial patterns of insect herbivory which are influenced by these factors. Methods We measured the detailed spatial patterns of insect herbivory on cork oak (Quercus variabilis Bl.) in response to soil type (gravel soil and loam) and forest stratum (the upper, lower, and sapling stratum), and correlated these patterns with a set of influencing factors (litter coverage, coverage of shrubs and herbs, soil nutrients, soil moisture, and leaf traits) in a forest landscape. Results Generally, insect herbivory was spatially heterogeneous within stands. Herbivory was significantly lower in gravel soil areas than in loam soil areas and the highest herbivory occurred in the lower stratum. However, there were also 41 individual plots in which the highest herbivory occurred in the upper stratum and 29 plots in which the highest herbivory occurred in the sapling stratum. There were significant differences in soil nutrient and water status between soil types, but no significant differences in leaf traits. The effects of forest stratum on leaf traits were also inconsistent with those on insect herbivory. Conclusions Leaf traits may not be the main factors influencing insect herbivory in the field. Soil type may have major effects on herbivory patterns by influencing litter coverage while higher coverage of shrubs and herbs may reduce herbivory in the sapling stratum. These findings may advance our understanding of tree-herbivore interactions in real-world situations and have important implications for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems.

AB  - The use of eco-organic ingredients as a source of protein in aquaculture diets needs important attention due to the growing demand for organic seafood products. The present study evaluated the effects of fish meal substitution by different organic ingredients on the growth, body composition, retention efficiency, enzyme activity, and nutrient digestibility of white shrimp Penaeus vannamei. The four dietary formulations tested were formulated with organic ingredients and the fish meal was replaced by the following organic protein meals: Iberian pig viscera meal (PIG), trout by-product meal (TRO), insect meal (FLY), and organic vegetable meal (WHT), in addition to a control diet (CON) that included 15% fish meal. A growth trial was carried out for 83 days, raising 1 g shrimp to commercial size (20 g). Shrimp were stocked at 167 shrimp/m3 (15 individuals per 90 L tank). The results showed that the growth obtained by shrimp fed with TRO (19.27 g) and PIG (19.35 g) were similar in weight gain to the control diet (20.76 g), while FLY (16.04 g) and WHT (16.73 g) meals resulted in a significant lower final weight. The FLY diet showed significantly lower protein digestibility (68.89%) compared to the CON, PIG, TRO, and WHT diets, and significantly higher trypsin activity (0.17 mU/g) compared to shrimp fed with the PIG, TRO, and WHT diets. Shrimp fed with WHT have a significantly lower body weight percentage of protein (19.69%) than shrimp fed with the WHT and TRO diets, and some significant differences in dietary aminoacidic levels affecting amino acid body composition. These results indicate that Iberian pig viscera and trout by-product meal can successfully replace fish meal in Pacific white shrimp aquaculture.

AB  - Heavy metals are major stressors for benthic macroalgal communities in marine ecosystems. In this study, the effects of copper and cadmium on some physiological parameters along with antifouling defense of the marine macroalga Ulva reticulate were assessed under laboratory conditions. Macroalgal samples were treated with three concentrations mg 3 mg l(-1) and 5 mg l(-1)) of copper and cadmium for 2 and 7 days. After treatment, algal samples were analyzed for chlorophyll-o, carotenoid, total polyphenol and total antioxidant capacity, Also, algal extracts were tested against biofilm-forming bacteria strains to understand differences in antifouling activity. The results indicated that exposure of U. reticulate to copper and cadmium, P on the one hand, induced protective mechanisms such as total phenol production and antioxidant capacity against metal stress and, on the other hand, reduced photosynthesis. While the extract obtained from control algal samples showed a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of biofilm-forming bacteria, treatment with heavy metals resulted in reduced antibiofilm activity. In general, the results revealed that exposure of macroalgae to heavy metals can affect antifouling defense traits in addition to changes in photosynthetic pigment content.

AB  - Reduced levels of the survival of large trees (& GE;5 m height) in Africa's savannas are a conservation concern, particularly where large trees co-occur with African elephants (Loxodonta africana). Elephants, as ecosystem engineers, can structurally modify and lesson the savanna large tree component. Wire-netting, which involves wrapping chicken-mesh around a tree's main stem, has been used as a mitigation method to increase tree sur-vival. We assess the trends in survival of three large tree species of conservation importance, namely Lannea schweinfurthii, Senegalia nigrescens and Sclerocarya birrea, within the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We consider survival trends linked by both elephant impact, as well as external environmental factors. We conducted four field assessments on 2,758 trees in 2008 (baseline), 2012, 2017, and 2020, where we recorded i) elephant impact levels on each tree, ii) whether the tree had wire-netting, and iii) the tree's survival status. We then modelled tree survival status as a dependent variable against multiple environmental factors. We found that tree survival was lowest when mean annual rainfall was lowest due to the drought, particularly amongst L. schweinfurthii and S. nigrescens. Wire-netting significantly increased large tree survival in comparison to control trees over the 12-year period, however, this effect decreased after four years if the wire-netting had lost its structural integrity. We illustrate how various environmental factors, in combination with elephant impact, affect large tree survival in an African savanna with a high density of artificial water points. We also provide results on the longest known study on wire-netting as a mitigation method for elephant impact on large trees and provide evidence on how a period of drought may have accelerated large tree decline in a southern African savanna.

AB  - Tigers are a conservation-reliant species, as multiple populations face the risk of local extinction due to poaching arising from the continued demand for their body parts. Preventing tiger poaching poses a challenge for the rangers responsible for their protection, particularly in Southeast Asia, where the protected areas are typically large, mountainous tropical forests guarded by small teams of rangers. Improving counter-wildlife crime tactics is hindered without robust evaluations, and inefficient approaches are perpetuated. We evaluate an eight-year project aiming to recover a tiger population in Peninsular Malaysia. Three distinct poaching problems by Vietnamese, Thai and Cambodian groups, differing by organisation, target species and tactics, were prioritised, and ranger counter-poaching tactics were tailored to reduce these. Applying a framework developed to evaluate crime prevention known by the acronym EMMIE, here we: (1) examine evidence our intervention was Effective in reducing the poaching threat; (2) resolve the Mechanisms by which our intervention caused a reduction in harm from poaching and how intervention effectiveness is Moderated by the three poaching types; (3) define the elements necessary for Implementation and the Economic costs involved. We found poaching incursion frequency fell 40% from baseline years to treatment years across all poaching types while poaching incursion depth declined, with disrupted incursions on average, 2.6 km (Thai) and 9.1 km (Cambodian) closer to the forest edge. However, wire snares increased from baseline to treatment years as Vietnamese poachers increased the number of snares per incursion eightfold. No poaching incursions were observed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Tiger density remained below recovery potential (0.48/100km2 in 2014 to 0.53/100 km2 in 2021) but stabilised as key females survived and were detected breeding. Leopard, sun bear, muntjac and wild boar densities remained stable. Disarming active snares and seizing an increased proportion of snares before being deployed directly reduced the potential risk of mortality to medium-large mammals once a poaching incursion began. Attributing the decline in poaching attempts to our intervention is supported for Cambodian poachers via three plausible mechanisms: increased cost of reoffending by repatriated poaching team leaders; reduction of detailed knowledge sharing and imitation by peers; general deterrence at community level from increased awareness of the elevated risk of arrest and low likelihood of enjoying rewards. We found ranger performance enhancements at three critical stages of counter-poaching were instrumental in increasing arrest certainty, this was made possible by institutionalising a learn-and-adapt cycle underpinned by a dedicated site analyst. This study highlights how investing in problem analysis and going beyond simple assumptions of deterrence can greatly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of small wildlife protection teams.

AB  - We examined the entanglement of biodiversity conservation, human-animal interactions, zootherapy, and local beliefs among Sumatran Healers and their local community by completing an ethnography of 43 Indigenous Healers across 8 tribes in Bengkulu Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Data collection tools were interviews, observations, videos, photographs, and a researcher journal. Of the 43 Healers, 30 used animals and mentioned 62 species. Of the animals identified, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List lists 34% (n = 21) as endangered, decreasing, or vulnerable, including Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus), and Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis). Of the 30 Healers using animals, 50% (n = 15) practiced healing with at least one endangered, decreasing, or vulnerable animal. We defined 3 personas: Healer self-persona, Healer-imposed persona, and community-imposed persona. A persona represented a group's opinions and sentiments related to Healers killing animals for medicinal purposes. Using an iterative data analysis process, we grouped the data across the 3 personas into 5 themes: ease of killing and preparing animals, emotions related to killing animals, animal value, relationship to religion, and Healers are tricksters. The complexity of merging the identities of Healers and the community within an actor-network embodies the relationality of actions, interactions, and feelings among Healers, between Healers and animals, and between Healers and the community. Conservationists should be cognizant of Healers' medicinal use of animals, views of human-animal interactions, and zootherapy from all social and emotional perspectives. The data led to defining Indigenous Healer ecological knowledge components of zootherapy, human-animal interactions, and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Context Habitat selection is a fundamental process that shapes animal spatial ecology. Species with wide geographic distribution that occupy diverse habitats have to adapt their resource acquisition strategies to maximise their effectiveness under local ecological constraints, leading to intraspecific behavioural variability. Identifying environmental determinants of habitat use pattern and regional intraspecific differences advances our understanding of the ecological underpinnings of animal behaviour and is important in strategising effective conservation and management of free-ranging populations. Aims The aim of this study was to assess individual heterogeneity of habitat selection and use by African elephants under different seasonal and ecological constraints, in order to better understand the processes underlying their spatial behaviour. Methods We investigated the habitat selection pattern of 19 African elephants equipped with satellite-linked GPS-collars in two different ecosystems, resource-rich bushveld bordering Kruger National Park, South Africa (six individuals) and arid savannah of Etosha National Park, Namibia (13 individuals). By constructing individual-specific and population-level resource selection functions (RSFs), we examined seasonal differences of elephant habitat use pattern to identify the underlying ecological mechanisms. Key results Elephants were attracted to surface water in both study areas; but when water availability decreased in arid environment, they showed individual-specific preference in using natural vs artificial water sources. Road networks enabled efficient travel among resource patches, but its use differed between individuals. Areas with higher and more predictable vegetation productivity were generally preferred by elephants in dry season, but in more competitive arid savannah system there were individual/group-specific seasonal differences in resource selection patterns, likely reflecting the social dynamics among individuals. At population-level, the habitat selection pattern was less apparent due to considerable intra-population variability. Conclusions The substantial differences in model coefficients within and between our study populations demonstrate the spatio-behavioural plasticity of elephants under various environmental conditions and suggest that population-level RSFs may over-simplify elephants' socio-ecological complexity. Implications Within the resource competition paradigm, individual-specific habitat selection may be as essential in maintaining population resilience as is the population-level pattern of resource use. Consequently, spatio-behavioural heterogeneity within and between populations should be accounted for in resource selection studies and all subsequent conservation management policies.

AB  - For riparian woodlands, occasional floods provide geomorphic disturbance that creates barren colonization sites, and river stage patterns that enable seedling establishment. To investigate impacts from river damming and instream flow regulation on these processes, we studied the lower Red Deer River in the semi-arid region of Alberta, Canada. Dickson Dam was implemented in 1983 and although major flood peaks in June 2005 and June 2013 were attenuated by about one-quarter, substantial seedling establishment of plains cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) was observed. Cross-sectional transects in 2014 and 2015 revealed the reproductively mature cottonwood band from 2005, while the 2013 colonization was limited to low elevations of 0.3-1.3 m above the base river stage. Seedling numbers and the elevational ranges were probably reduced by abrupt (>4 cm/day) river stage reductions in July 2005 and in July 2013. In addition to direct seedling establishment on barren sandbars, we observed "coupled colonization" with cottonwood recruitment within sparse patches of sandbar willows (Salix exigua). The flood-tolerant willows stabilize the bars and increase aggradation through sediment trapping. Thus, cottonwood colonization persisted after damming, indicating that the pattern of downstream flow regulation was important, rather than damming per se. To sustain riparian recruitment along regulated rivers in dry regions, we recommend: (1) that floods be allowed as feasible, (2) higher river stages during seed dispersal, (3) flow ramping (gradual summer recession) for seedling survival, (4) sufficient growing season flows to avoid drought-induced mortality, and (5) that willows be encouraged as well as cottonwoods.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides is widely known for its important ecological, economic, and social benefits. It is known as the pioneer plant of soil and water conservation, with homology in food and medicine. With the climate warming in recent years, the numbers of this species and countries with this plant have decreased steadily. H. r. sinensis and H. r. turkestanica have the widest distribution area in China, which account for more than 90% of the total national Hippophae rhamnoides resources. We firstly screened the presence data and downscale the environment variables (climate and soil) by correlation analysis. Secondly, based on the 232 occurrence data of H. r. sinensis and 10 environmental variables, the 73 occurrence data of H. r. turkestanica and 11 environmental variables, we simulated and predicted their suitable habitats in China, both at the current time and in the 2050S (2041-2060), and analyzed the dominant factors effecting its distribution by using MaxEnt. Finally, we studied the habitat variations and centroid migrations of these subspecies under future climate scenarios using the spatial analysis function of ArcGIS. The results indicated that the area of suitable habitat for H. r. sinensis is much larger than that of H. r. trkestanica in China. The suitable habitat of H. r. sinensis is concentrated in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River, mainly distributed in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia, and that of H. r. trkestanica is mainly distributed in Xinjiang and Tibet. The former is mainly affected by bio13 (precipitation of the wettest month), bio11 (mean temperature of the coldest quarte) and bio3 (Isothermality), and the latter is mainly affected by bio13 (precipitation of the wettest month), bio2 (mean diurnal range) and bio15 (precipitation seasonality), and the former is also more stable in the face of future climate change. They are more susceptible to climate than soil in their survival. Although, the two subspecies tend to expand and migrate toward lower latitude under future climate scenarios, there are some differences. H. r. sinensis will migrate westward, while H. r. trkestanica will migrate eastward as a whole. They have a high stability of suitable habitat and are not at risk of extinction in the future. The study's findings help to clarify the resource reserve of Hippophae rhamnoides L. in China, which will help to guide the protection of wild resources and to popularize artificial planting in suitable areas, and provides scientific basis for the protection of ecological environment.

AB  - Fear of the human 'super predator' has been demonstrated to so alter the feeding behavior of large carnivores as to cause trophic cascades. It has yet to be experimentally tested if fear of humans has comparably large effects on the feeding behavior of large herbivores. We conducted a predator playback experiment exposing white-tailed deer to the vocalizations of humans, extant or locally extirpated non-human predators (coyotes, cougars, dogs, wolves), or non-predator controls (birds), at supplemental food patches to measure the relative impacts on deer feeding behavior. Deer were more than twice as likely to flee upon hearing humans than other predators, and hearing humans was matched only by hearing wolves in reducing overall feeding time gaged by visits to the food patch in the following hour. Combined with previous, site-specific research linking deer fecundity to predator abundance, this study reveals that fear of humans has the potential to induce a larger effect on ungulate reproduction than has ever been reported. By demonstrating that deer most fear the human 'super predator', our results point to the fear humans induce in large ungulates having population- and community-level impacts comparable to those caused by the fear humans induce in large carnivores.

AB  - In social species, reproductive success and rates of dispersal vary among individuals resulting in spatially structured populations. Network analyses of familial relationships may provide insights on how these parameters influence population-level demographic patterns. These methods, however, have rarely been applied to genetically derived pedigree data from wild populations.
   Here, we use parent-offspring relationships to construct familial networks from polygamous boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Saskatchewan, Canada, to inform recovery efforts. We collected samples from 933 individuals at 15 variable microsatellite loci along with caribou-specific primers for sex identification. Using network measures, we assess the contribution of individual caribou to the population with several centrality measures and then determine which measures are best suited to inform on the population demographic structure. We investigate the centrality of individuals from eighteen different local areas, along with the entire population.
   We found substantial differences in centrality of individuals in different local areas, that in turn contributed differently to the full network, highlighting the importance of analyzing networks at different scales. The full network revealed that boreal caribou in Saskatchewan form a complex, interconnected familial network, as the removal of edges with high betweenness did not result in distinct subgroups. Alpha, betweenness, and eccentricity centrality were the most informative measures to characterize the population demographic structure and for spatially identifying areas of highest fitness levels and family cohesion across the range. We found varied levels of dispersal, fitness, and cohesion in family groups.
   Synthesis and applications: Our results demonstrate the value of different network measures in assessing genetically derived familial networks. The spatial application of the familial networks identified individuals presenting different fitness levels, short- and long-distance dispersing ability across the range in support of population monitoring and recovery efforts.

AB  - Climatic and environmental changes, as well as human action, have been cited as potential causes for the extinction of megafauna in South America at the end of the Pleistocene. Among megamammals lineages with Holarctic origin, only horses and proboscideans went extinct in South America during this period. This study aims to understand how the spatial extent of habitats suitable for Equus neogeus and Notiomastodon platensis changed between the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the middle Holocene in order to determine the impact that climatic and environmental changes had on these taxa. We used species distribution modeling to estimate their potential extent on the continent and found that both species occupied arid and semiarid open lands during the LGM, mainly in the Pampean region of Argentina, southern and northeastern Brazil, and parts of the Andes. However, when climate conditions changed from dry and cold during the LGM to humid and warm during the middle Holocene, the areas suitable for these taxa were reduced dramatically. These results support the hypothesis that climatic changes were a driving cause of extinction of these megamammals in South America, although we cannot rule out the impact of human actions or other potential causes for their extinction.

AB  - The benthic structure of seamounts is critical for understanding the ecological environment and for assessing the influence of resource exploitation. However, the characteristics of the benthic structure of the seamount, especially for guyot, are still far from being clearly understood. For the first time, we carried out detailed hydroacoustic mapping in conjunction with surficial sediment sampling and underwater video recording to investigate the geomorphical and biological characteristics of Pallada Guyot in the Western Pacific Ocean (WPO). We utilized the Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM) as an initial step to describe the detailed benthic structures and then classify the textural seabed according to backscatter images and sediment samples. We further discussed the relationship between geomorphology and the occurrence of benthic megafauna from video images. The results revealed that 13 classes of benthic structural zones were differentiated, and the dominant zones were flat abyssal plains, where the number and size of megafauna were smaller than those on the flank and flat-topped areas. The second most notable feature is the flat top, where sea cucumbers, starfish, fish, and shrimp have higher biomass and diversity. In the flank region, which is characterized by complex and extensive current-scoured ridges and depressions, sponges and corals are distributed in high-relief bedrocks. We also found that the maximum water depth where cold-water corals develop is 2,250 m. The sponge grounds appear in a marked bathymetric belt (1,800-2,150 m), which is shallower than that on a tropical seamount (2,500-3,000 m) located in the northeastern Atlantic. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the geomorphological drivers and biogeography of WPO seamounts and provide a reference for identifying priority areas for improved marine mineral planning in WPO areas.

AB  - Background Due to anthropogenic climate change and historic fire suppression, wildfire frequency and severity are increasing across the western United States. Whereas the indirect effects of fire on wildlife via habitat change are well studied, less is known about the impacts of wildfire smoke on animal health and behavior. In this study, we explore the effects of wildfire smoke on the behavior of eight medium- to large-bodied mammalian species in a heterogenous study area in Washington, USA. We linked population-level activity metrics derived from camera trap data to concentrations of fire-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We hypothesized that mammalian activity would decline during smoke events, as animals attempt to reduce potential health impacts of smoke inhalation. We used occupancy models and Poisson regression models to test the effect of fire-specific PM2.5 levels on daily detection probability and the number of detections per day, respectively, for each study species.Results While we did not observe any significant responses to daily mean concentrations of PM2.5 in the occupancy models, we found three species with significant responses in their rates of detections per day in the Poisson regression. Specifically, for each standard deviation increase in the daily mean concentration of PM2.5, there was a 12.9% decrease in the number of bobcat detections per day, an 11.2% decrease in the number of moose detections per day, and a 5.8% increase in the number of mule deer detections per day. In general, the effects of PM2.5 were small compared to other relevant covariates.Conclusions We generally found little evidence to support our hypothesis that animals would reduce their activity in response to wildfire smoke. However, our study demonstrated that mammals exhibited species-specific behavioral responses to smoke, which are possibly adaptive responses to reduce health impacts from smoke inhalation. Though we found only a few immediate behavioral responses to smoke exposure, we note that longer-term health consequences of smoke exposure for wildlife are also likely and generally unknown. Our study shows how camera traps, which are already widely used to study wildlife, can also be used to investigate the impacts of wildfire smoke on animal behavior and provides a step towards developing methods to better understand this increasing source of environmental stress on wildlife.

AB  - After several years of domestication, domestic yak is inferior to wild yak in many aspects. Gut microbes play an important role in the digestion, absorption and health of animals. Studying the intestinal flora of yak has significance to improving its productivity and immunity. In this study, we analysed the bacterial diversity in fresh faeces of wild yak and domestic yak. Results showed that the structure of the bacterial flora in wild yak and domestic yak was significantly different. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and TM7 were the dominant phyla, and Micrococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Planococcaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Christensenellaceae, Coriobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae were the dominant families. Comparing the relative abundance of different levels of bacteria, a total of 78 bacteria significantly differed between wild yak and domestic yak. Amongst these bacteria, Chloroflexi, Clostridiaceae, Microbispora, Blautia, Carnobacterium and Salinibacterium were obviously higher in wild yak than in domestic yak. Proteobacteria, Epulopiscium, Amycolatopsis, Brucellaceae, Sediminibacterium and Rhodococcus were significantly higher in domestic yak than in wild yak. The present study reported the microbial diversity of bacteria between wild yak and domestic yak. The findings can help improve the production performance and disease resistance of domestic yak.

AB  - Understanding the behavior and ecology of non-native species is important to assess their impact on food webs and ecosystem functions and to facilitate the management of non-native species. The present study reports a case of scavenging on a deer carcass by mammals, especially introduced raccoon dogs and native Japanese weasels, in the World Heritage Site of Yakushima, Japan. A sensor camera was placed near the carcass from March to May 2022 to record scavenging behavior of mammals. Out of at least six species of mammals filmed, raccoon dogs and weasels fed on the carcass. Raccoon dogs almost monopolized the carcass, i.e., raccoon dogs were filmed around carrion more frequently and spent more time scavenging than weasels. Raccoon dogs and weasels were filmed around the carcass at similar times in a day, and no overt aggression was observed between the two species, but weasels were displaced by raccoon dogs. Japanese macaques and sika deer avoided and never fed on carrion. The present study suggests that raccoon dogs contribute to carrion decomposition in the World Heritage Site of Yakushima and that comprehensive studies of carrion availability and the scavenger community could help promote the management of introduced raccoon dogs in Yakushima.

AB  - Despite being the world's largest fish, many questions remain regarding the ecology and behaviour of the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). We present the first direct evidence of whale sharks engaging in bottom-feeding behaviour and provide potential explanations for this foraging strategy. We suggest that whale sharks actively feed on benthic prey, either predominantly in deepwater environments or where the abundance of such prey exceeds that of planktonic food sources. We also highlight the potential for ecotourism and citizen science projects to contribute to our understanding of marine megafauna behavioural ecology.

AB  - In this article we announce the discovery of the first remains of Megaloceros giganteus found in Catalonia (north-eastern Iberia) from the Late Pleistocene: a fragment of maxillary. Dated between 35,000 and 37,000 cal BP, it is also among the youngest occurrence of this taxon in the Iberian Peninsula, while its last known occurrence is dated to the Neolithic period. Through a comparison with the giant deer of the northern Pyrenees, we analyzed the herbivore guilds in which this taxon was associated to understand the context in which it was able to enter the Iberian Peninsula. By comparing its diet with those of specimens from Northern Europe, we detail the ecological adaptations of this taxon in this new environment. We suggest that Megaloceros accompanied the migrations of cold-adapted species by taking advantage of the opening of corridors on both sides of the Pyrenees during the coldest periods of the Late Pleistocene. The diet of the Iberian individuals, which is oriented towards abrasive plants, suggests an adaptation to a different ecological niche than that found in Northern European individuals. The northern Iberian Peninsula may have been an extreme in the geographical expansion of M. giganteus. More specimens will be needed in the future to establish the variability of the southern Megaloceros populations.

AB  - The distribution of wild animals and their monitoring over large areas raises many logistical and technical difficulties that hinder the collection of observation data. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has increased significantly in recent years. QGIS, an open-source GIS software dedicated to the processing of geospatial data, enables the development of dedicated plugins for specific workflows. The open-source PelaSIG plugin has been developed in Python for QGIS 3 to facilitate and standardise the different steps before and after distance sampling surveys. It brings together a set of tools for survey preparation, automatic data checking, visualisation and presentation of survey effort and sightings to provide an adapted workflow. This plugin is currently designed to process dedicated aerial datasets collected with the SAMMOA software during marine megafauna surveys (i.e., marine mammals, seabirds, elasmobranchs, sea turtles, etc.). Here, we first describe the different tools already available, and then, we present an application with the dataset from the aerial survey of the ACCOBAMS Survey Initiative (ASI) conducted in 2018 over the Mediterranean Sea and using a multi-target protocol.

AB  - Rodents can cause considerable changes in plant community composition. However, relationships between shifts in species dominance and plant functional traits caused by rodents have seldom been investigated, especially for belowground functional traits. In this study, a set of enclosures was constructed to analyze the effects of 10 years of Brandt's voles' activities on the defense strategies and dominant position changes of three gramineous plants (Leymus chinensis, Stipa krylovii, and Cleistogenes squarrosa) in Inner Mongolia. Here, we measured the dominance, biomass, and fourteen functional traits of three plants. The effects of Brandt's voles on dominance, biomass, and functional traits were analyzed, and then we explored the effect of functional traits on plant dominance by using the structural equation model. Results showed that long-term feeding by Brandt's voles resulted in a significant decrease in the dominance of L. chinensis and S. krylovii, whereas C. squarrosa was positively affected. The belowground biomass of L. chinensis and S. krylovii was higher in the vole treatment, which showed that they were increasing their escape characteristics. The leaf thickness of L. chinensis and the leaf C:N ratio of S. krylovii significantly increased, while the specific leaf area of C. squarrosa significantly decreased. All three gramineous showed increased resistance traits in response to Brandt's voles, which positively affected their dominance. Tolerance-related traits of S. krylovii significantly increased, with the increasing growth rate of root length contributing to enhancing its dominance. We highlight that selective feeding by rodents led to the selection of different defense strategies by three gramineous plants, and that changes in biomass allocation and functional traits in the different species affected plant dominance, driving changes in the plant communities.

AB  - A globally rapid land use/land cover change (LULC) in human-transformed landscapes alters the interface of human-wildlife interactions due to shifting socio-ecological and environmental pressures. Understanding these shifts is crucial for mitigating repeated negative interactions that escalate conflict states between people and wildlife. This study aimed to understand LULC changes over 30 years (1989-2019), with more recent spatio-temporal patterns of high pressure at the human-elephant interface, and potentially underlying environmental and human-driven factors that affect elephant movement patterns. We analyzed a dataset of 923 human-elephant conflict occurrences, mainly crop foraging incidents, in the Enduimet Wildlife Management Area (EWMA) between the years 2016 and 2020 and combined these data with LULC for year 2019 to understand potential drivers of conflict and assess how agricultural land and settlement have increased over time. We further used GPS datasets of elephants collared between 2019 to 2020 to understand elephant movement patterns in changing land use types. Landsat image analysis revealed that 41% of the area had been converted into farmlands and settlements within the last three decades, which creates elephant-intolerant habitats and the potential to increase pressure at the human-elephant interface. Collared elephants using EWMA moved through all land use types and did not avoid settlements, although they moved through these at higher speeds, reflecting perception of risk. Elephants travelled slightly more slowly in farmland, likely reflecting the availability of foraging opportunities. Our analysis shows that human-induced LULC changes and the encroachment into elephant habitats have resulted in spatially and temporally predictable increases in HEC in EWMA, driven by the proximity of farmlands and protected areas (PAs), so that incompatible land uses are the principal drivers of damage to human livelihoods and increased risks to Tanzanian (and Kenyan) natural capital. Communities in Enduimet urgently need support to increase the effective distance between their farming activities and the PAs. Village-level crop protection and small-scale land-use planning around PAs are important first steps to halt an escalating conflict situation but need to be supported with longer-range strategies that separate incompatible land-use types and encourage the cultivation of alternative crops and livelihood diversification.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict is rapidly evolving in response to significant ecological, social, and economic changes affecting society globally. Developing objective and acceptable resolution strategies is challenging because of divergence in perceptions and understandings of humanwildlife conflict between urban and rural populations, and this disparity is increasing with rapid urbanization. In this study, we explore preferences for wild boar conflict management in China using a mixed methods approach of a survey, choice experiments, and interviews. We found that significant differences in the preferences of wild boar management exist between rural and urban residents. The majority of rural residents preferred hunting whereas most urban residents in cities remote from the conflict preferred non-hunting measures. However, we found that economic cost played an important role in influencing public preferences for management measures. The urban population had positive preferences for hunting if they were required to pay an environmental tax to compensate farmers for crop damage when asked to consider their preferred management strategy package. We consider that the current management of hunting wild boar in China requires improvement, and we argue that China should adjust the current hunting management policy to take into account the benefits of wild boar population control and the economic development of the surrounding rural areas.

AB  - Predator control remains one of the most common strategies for the conservation of threatened prey species. Despite significant and ongoing efforts to reduce predator populations, little is known about the impacts on the behaviour and interactions of target and non-target species following numerical and potentially behavioural suppression of predators. We used camera-trap data collected before and after an intensive wolf control program in northeastern Alberta's boreal forest to evaluate changes in activity patterns and overlap in wolves, competitors and prey. We hypothesized wolves would shift their activity toward increased nocturnality to avoid diurnal control efforts, and thereby cause a behavioural cascade where other species shift activity to maintain temporal segregation from wolves. Wolves shifted activity into the nighttime following predator control, reducing temporal overlap with the other, mostly diurnal, members of the community. Decreases in activity overlap between wolves and other species indicates reduced potential for wolf interactions with ungulate prey and large competitor species. Predator control may therefore not only release species from top to down regulation and competition following numerical suppression of top predators, but also through de-coupling of temporal overlap, with potential effects on species interactions. Understanding the indirect impacts of conservation strategies such as predator control on both target and non-target species provides insight into potential disruptions to top-down regulation and the associated species interactions that shape community structure.

AB  - Elusive species often use latrines which also serves as communication and information hubs. Thus, studying behavior at latrines may provide critical insights into the species' ecology and behavior. While it is established that musk deer use latrines for defecating, very little is known about the endangered Himalayan musk deer (Moschus leucogaster) and their latrines. We examined musk deer behavior from the various video clips lasting 238 min altogether, captured at latrine sites during both breeding and non-breeding seasons in the Annapurna Conservation Area of Nepal. A total of 428 visits by musk deer and 479 behavioral events by them were captured. We constructed an ethogram to describe musk deer behavior and compared behavior across individuals and sex using parametric and non-parametric tests. We found that musk deer are crepuscular and nocturnal animals. Both male and female musk deer repeatedly and independently visited shared latrine sites as well as exclusively used latrine sites. The proportion of male musk deer visited latrine sites were significantly higher than that of female musk deer. Hence, male musk deer were found more active (>2 times) than females during both seasons. The most frequently observed behavioral activities at the latrine sites were defecating, sniffing and browsing, followed by scrapping and covering, and ignoring the latrine sites. The defecating and sniffing activity were performed throughout breeding and non-breeding seasons to establish communication among peers and to claim territory. Based on the behaviors observed at the latrine sites, we can presume that Himalayan musk deer likely use latrines to convey various messages, including personality, maturity, sexual status, and territory marking among conspecifics. These findings of this study can be used for the conservation of musk deer in its natural habitat and replicated in captivity to enhance breeding performance that improves long-term conservation prospects for this species.

AB  - Simple Summary Nutrias (Myocastor coypus) escaped captivity in the 1990s in Korea; these individuals rapidly established wild populations, causing substantial environmental issues, including biodiversity loss, local habitat disturbance, and agricultural damage. The South Korean government initiated the Nutria Eradication Project in 2014 to control nutrias on a national scale. The aim of this research was to support the eradication efforts by improving our understanding of nutria movements based on biological and environmental factors. In this study, the geo-self-organizing map software was applied to radio-tracking data from individuals, and it was determined that males dominate nutria movement. Movement patterns were seasonal and varied with vegetation types between sexes and within each sex. Tall grassland was mainly associated with interactions between individuals of opposite sexes (possibly related to mating), whereas floating-leaved hydrophytes were related to same-sex interactions (possible feeding grounds). Data from this large-scale monitoring provide initial results for a more targeted and effective eradication program. Further large-scale population dynamics research is needed for a successful eradication program in the future. Nutrias (Myocastor coypus) were imported to South Korea for farming in 1985; individuals escaped captivity and established wild populations in natural ecosystems in the late 1990s. Numerous studies have focused on their monitoring and management; however, information on the continuous movement of individuals is not available. In this study, telemetry data from field conditions were used to identify the nearest-neighbor distances of individuals in association with environmental factors, including plant type, land cover, and biological parameters. The minimum nearest-neighbor distances for the different sexes were, overall, according to the minimum distances for the same sex. Local co-occurrences of individuals, either of the same or different sex, were seasonal. Tall grasslands, followed by herbaceous vegetation, were associated with the co-occurrence of different sexes. Conversely, floating-leaved hydrophytes, followed by xeric herbaceous vegetation, were correlated with the co-occurrence of the same sex. Local female-male co-occurrences were negatively associated with male-male co-occurrences but not with female-female co-occurrences, suggesting male dominance in group formations. Movement and co-occurrence information extracted using Geo-self-organizing maps furthers our understanding of population dispersal and helps formulate management strategies for nutria populations.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the impact of increased cooling sessions on milk production and physiological measures, including respiration rate and body temperature, in dairy buffaloes during a semiarid summer in Pakistan. Eighteen Nili Ravi buffaloes were assigned to three cooling strategies: CTL (handheld hosepipe cooling twice daily for 5 min), 3CS (sprinkler cooling three times daily), and 5CS (sprinkler cooling five times daily). The 5CS group produced 1.6 and 3.2 kg more milk per day than 3CS and CTL, respectively, with more milk fat. The buffaloes in the 5CS group also had lower core body temperatures and respiration rates than the CTL and 3CS groups. Furthermore, buffaloes in the 5CS group spent significantly more time eating and showed decreased blood cortisol levels. Our study demonstrated that increased cooling sessions had a beneficial effect on milk yield and composition, particularly by increasing milk fat content. Additionally, more cooling sessions positively influenced the welfare of dairy buffaloes by lowering respiration rate, body temperature, and cortisol levels. These findings underscore the critical importance of optimizing cooling practices in dairy buffalo management.
   The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of increasing cooling sessions from three to five times a day on milk yield and the welfare of dairy buffaloes during a semiarid summer in Pakistan. Eighteen Nili Ravi buffaloes were randomly assigned to three cooling strategies: (1) CTL, where buffaloes were cooled with a handheld hosepipe twice daily for 5 min each; (2) 3CS, where buffaloes were cooled using sprinklers three times daily; and (3) 5CS, where buffaloes were cooled using sprinklers five times daily. Each sprinkler cooling session lasted 1 h, with a 6 min cycle of 3 min of water on and 3 min off. Results showed that the 5CS group produced 1.6 and 3.2 kg more milk per day compared to the 3CS and CTL groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Both the 5CS and 3CS groups had consistently lower core body temperatures and respiration rates than the CTL group. Buffaloes in the 5CS group spent significantly more time eating (p < 0.001). Additionally, the 5CS group exhibited lower cortisol and blood urea nitrogen levels (p = 0.001) and higher glucose levels than the CTL group (p = 0.006). In conclusion, increasing cooling sessions to five times daily improved milk yield and welfare compared to the traditional cooling strategy (CTL) in dairy buffaloes during semiarid summers, highlighting the benefits of optimized cooling practices.

AB  - Insurance populations can provide a short-term safeguard for at-risk species. The goal for all insurance populations should be to maintain a high welfare, genetically diverse, self-sustaining population that is available for eventual reintroduction of animals back into the wild when it is safe to do so. However, many insurance populations in zoos are not meeting sustainability goals, and there is a need for larger conservation centers and sanctuaries, a greater focus on threatened species, and metapopulation management between independently managed pop-ulations. Within North America, privately-owned ranches frequently maintain large populations of threatened ungulates that are presently managed independently from AZA-accredited zoos. Using a large set of single nucleotide polymorphisms, we generated empirical kinship and genetic distance estimates for AZA and private ranch populations of southern sable antelope (Hippotragus niger niger) and critically endangered addra gazelle (Nanger dama ruficollis). We used stochastic population models to project population mean kinship (mk) and founder genome equivalents (FGE) over time with and without genetic metapopulation management, using empirical kinships and genetic distances to guide transfers. Mean kinship-guided transfers were consistently bene-ficial for all study populations, for both species. Genetic distance-guided transfers, however, resulted in modest population mk increases for AZA populations, but predicted remarkable de-creases in population mk for ranch populations. Although predicted benefits varied depending on management approach, our results show that a metapopulation management plan, whether mutually beneficial or altruistic, best supports species conservation by mitigating the loss of genetic diversity, minimizing the possibility of inbreeding, and yielding genetically diverse animals.

AB  - Co-production of conservation projects is favored by incorporating local ecological knowledge into project design and implementation. Using a mixed method approach, we asked how the territorial practices and knowledge of cowboys and livestock farmers inform their attitudes to this proposed project. We predicted that cowboy territorial practices would be reduced in diversity compared to the past, and that this may be associated with a reduction in coping or adaptation capacity in the face of environmental challenges. We further predicted that due to growing environmental and social pressures reducing traditional livelihood opportunities for this group, they are likely to see the guanaco reintroduction project in a conflictual and negative light. We additionally predicted that they would perceive local carnivorous species in a conflictual and negative way. We found that territorial practices among the sample had indeed decreased in diversity. The sample coped with changing socio-ecological conditions by taking up other jobs. However, we also found that they had majority favorable views on the guanaco reintroduction project. Yet their knowledge of current guanaco behavior led them to believe that the project would fail. However, they also observed that pumas and condors changed their behaviors. We suggest that there are opportunities to co-produce knowledge about the possibility of flexible and adaptive guanaco behavior, which may lead to restoration and create more sustainable future scenarios, by engaging with the territorial practices and local ecological knowledge of cowboys and livestock farmers.

AB  - Arthropods are essential in maintaining healthy and productive agricultural ecosystems. Agricultural crops such as apples are typically pollinated by domesticated honey bees, but wild bees and other arthropod flower visitors also contribute to pollination. Flower visitors can also be natural enemies of crop-pests or herbivores. Biodiversity is under pressure and knowledge of wildflower visitors is an important tool in designing orchards that can support high functional biodiversity. In our study, we assessed the diversity of arthropod flower visitors in four Danish apple orchards using both molecular and nonmolecular techniques to study arthropod communities in agricultural ecosystems. Arthropod DNA collected from apple flowers was analyzed using a DNA metabarcoding approach using the mitochondrial COI marker, while arthropod pollinators were recorded through visual assessment surveys. These complementary techniques resulted in a total of 19 arthropod taxa detected. Nonbee arthropods constituted a large proportion of arthropods detected by both methods (84%, 16 taxa). Metabarcoding detected 12 taxa and had 83% species resolution. Visual census recovered flower visiting groups to the order level (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera) but not species level and also provided relative abundance data, which is not possible with molecular methods. We demonstrated that by utilizing both molecular and nonmolecular techniques to assess arthropod communities, we are able to obtain a broader overview of the arthropod fauna present. The methodology used and the outcome of this study can be used to inform and tailor suitable arthropod-pest management practices in orchards to increase crop yield and maintain healthy agricultural systems.

AB  - Cover crops are widely used to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in agroecosystems. However, the effects of cover crops on the labile fractions and chemical composition of SOC, as well as the consequences for fruit yield in manure-applied orchards are still unclear. Here, we conducted two field experiments in an arid area of Northwest China to explore the responses of soil physicochemical properties, SOC characteristics, and wolfberry ( Lycium barbarum L.) yield to cover cropping and manure application rate. Decomposed sheep manure was incorporated into the soil at 0, 6660, and 13,320 kg.hm(-2) in the absence (wolfberry monocropping) and presence (cover cropping) of forage radish ( Raphanus sativus L.). Lower soil bulk density and higher total nitrogen, available nitrogen, available potassium, and dissolved organic carbon contents were observed under cover cropping compared to monocropping (p < 0.05). The contents of SOC and its labile fractions showed the greatest response to cover cropping with medium manure rate, which resulted in the highest wolfberry yield. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance analysis identified O-alkyl carbon (26.2 -52.4%) as the dominant SOC functional group across all treatments, followed by alkyl carbon (15.9 -34.5%) and aromatic carbon (9.7-35.2%). The relative abundance of alkyl carbon trended higher under cover cropping in Yinchuan (by 1.1%) and Zhongning (by 21.3%), whereas manure application rate did not affect the chemical composition of SOC. Structural equation modeling revealed that cover cropping contributed to wolfberry yield in manure-applied fields directly or indirectly by altering SOC composition and improving labile SOC accumulation as well as soil physicochemical properties. Findings of this study are helpful to enhance soil carbon management and wolfberry orchard productivity in arid areas.

AB  - Simple Summary Ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs) are routinely estimated from changes in service provider densities without measuring their actual levels. By using the sentinel approach (i.e., exposing a plant, seeds, and prey models in a standardized way), we tested how coriander (Coriandrum sativum) strips planted in mixed orchards on Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal) affected ESs/EDs via herbivory on lettuce plants, seed predation on wheat and weed seeds, and predation on artificial caterpillars. Vertebrates had more influence than invertebrates on ESs and EDs. Herbivory (ED) after 2 weeks was similar in the coriander and the control plots, while seed predation was higher in the control than in the coriander plots on both wheat grain (an ED: 30.8% vs. 15.3%) and weed seeds (an ES: 2.5% vs. 0.4%). Vertebrate predation (ES) rates after 48 h were significantly higher in the control (9%) than in the coriander plots (3%), while no difference was observed for invertebrate predation. Coriander strips did not support increased ES/reduced ED levels in this habitat. The sentinel approach is effective to quantitatively compare multiple ESs/EDs under different farming management strategies. The effect of flower strips on ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs) is routinely assessed following changes in service provider densities without measuring the associated levels of ES/EDs. By using the sentinel approach (i.e., exposing a plant, seeds, and prey models in a standardized way), we tested how coriander (Coriandrum sativum) strips planted in mixed orchards on Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal) affected herbivory on lettuce plants, seed predation on wheat and weed seeds, and predation on artificial caterpillars. Vertebrates had more influence than invertebrates on ESs/EDs. Herbivory (ED) after 2 weeks was similar in the coriander and the control plots (mean & PLUSMN; SD; 2.3% & PLUSMN; 3.3% vs. 2.2% & PLUSMN; 2.9%, n = 32 for both). Seed predation was higher in the control than in the coriander plots for both grain (ED; 30.8% & PLUSMN; 38.9% vs. 15.3% & PLUSMN; 10.8%, n = 18 for both) and weed seeds (ES; 2.5% & PLUSMN; 4.1% vs. 0.4% & PLUSMN; 0.5%, n = 18 for both). Vertebrate predation (ES) rates after 48 h were significantly higher in the control (estimate 9%, 95% CI: 4-20%) than in the coriander plots (3%, 1-8%), while no difference was observed for invertebrate predation. Coriander strips did not support increased ES/reduced ED levels in this setting. The tools used can be effective to quantitatively compare multiple ESs/EDs under different farming management strategies.

AB  - Resource pulses are ecologically important phenomenon that occur in most ecosystems globally. Following optimal foraging theory, many consumers switch to pulsatile foods when available, examples of which include fruit mast and vulnerable young prey. Yet how the availability of resource pulses shapes the ecology of predators is still an emerging area of research; and how much individual variation there is in response to pulses is not well understood. We hypothesized that resource pulses would lead to dietary convergence in our population, which we tested by tracking both population-level and individual coyote diets for 3 years in South Carolina, USA. We (1) described seasonal dietary shifts in relation to resource pulses; (2) compared male and female diets across seasons; and (3) tested this dietary convergence hypothesis by quantifying individual dietary variation both across and within periods when resource pulses were available. We found that pulses of white-tailed deer fawns and blackberries composed over half of coyote diet in summer, and persimmon fruits were an important component in fall. Male and female coyotes generally had similar diets, but males consumed more deer in fall, perhaps driven by scavenging more. We found support for our dietary convergence hypothesis, where individuals had more similar diets during resource pulses compared to a non-pulse period. We also found that this convergence happened before peak availability, suggesting a non-symmetric response to pulse availability. We show that nearly all coyotes eat fawns, suggesting that targeted efforts to remove "fawn killers" would be in vain. Instead, given how quickly coyotes collectively converge on resource pulses, our findings show that resource pulses could potentially be used by managers to alter the behavior of apex predators. More broadly, we open a new line of inquiry into how variation in individual foraging decisions scales up to shape the effects of resource pulses on ecological communities.
   Resource pulses are ecologically important; yet the amount of individual, how much individual variation in their use is not well understood. Here, we show that individuals rapidly and collectively converge on resource pulses when available, likely influencing predator-prey interactions.image

AB  - The Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus, AUFS) population, currently less than 47% of its pre-harvest size, represents the largest resident marine predator biomass in south-eastern Australia. This region, characterized by low marine productivity and rapid warming, is home to Kanowna Island, the third-largest AUFS colony. Territorial male AUFS, due to size sexual dimorphism, exert a greater influence on trophic dynamics than their conspecifics and serve as indicators of ecosystem health through their body condition index (BCI). Over a 12-year period (2009-2021), BCI data from 547 adult males revealed a significant decline, suggesting deteriorating nutritional conditions. Lower BCI was associated with warmer sea surface temperatures (current-year), higher spring Chlorophyll-a concentrations in southern Tasmanian waters (1-year lag), and stronger Bonney Upwelling westerly winds (2-year lag). Additionally, negative correlations emerged with the Indian Ocean Dipole (current- and 2-year lags), while positive correlations were linked to the Southern Annular Mode and Southern Oscillation Index (1-year and 2-year lags). These findings indicate that climate variability and warming may further impact AUFS male body condition, posing risks to broader demographic parameters and population stability. Long-term monitoring is essential to evaluate ongoing nutritional stress and potential population-level consequences under future climate scenarios.

AB  - This study aims to describe the distribution of ocean sunfishes (family Molidae) in the greater Dyer Island ecosystem off the southwest coast of South Africa. Between 2014 and 2022, local whale watching vessels operating under Dyer Island Cruises conducted 3 227 trips which resulted in 274 trips with Molidae sightings, with a total of 300 individuals sighted. Molidae sightings showed a significant correlation to sea surface temperature and a strong seasonal pattern. Sightings in the greater Dyer Island area increased significantly after 2016, suggesting a correlation with the decline of white shark Carcharodon carcharias sightings, with further increases in 2021. This suggests that the greater Dyer Island ecosystem has become a more favoured habitat for species of Molidae.

AB  - Cold-seep chemosynthetic communities are found in patchy areas where methane and other hydrocarbons leak through the seafloor. Although relatively common in continental margins, chemosynthetic communities in the Caribbean region are poorly known. Their existence in Colombian waters has been suggested by the presence of carbonates and specimens of seep- specialist families obtained through trawling surveys, and seismic and multibeam data. Habitat models incorporating bathymetry and backscatter data have also predicted the presence of hard ground areas (presumed authigenic carbonates formed due to chemosynthetic activity), which are consistent with water column plume anomalies. Here, we present the first characterization of the megafauna found in cold-seep communities in the Colombian Caribbean between 2300 and 3300 m using seafloor images taken with a towed camera system and samples collected through piston coring. Chemosynthetic communities at these sites resemble those found off Trinidad and Tobago and the Gulf of Mexico. Dominant species include tubeworms (Lamellabranchia sp. and Escarpia sp.), mussels (Bathymodiolus sp.), shrimp (Alvinocaris sp.), and squat lobsters (Munidopsis sp.). These results represent foundational knowledge of deep-sea ecosystems in the southern Caribbean.

AB  - Spatial distribution and habitat preferences of wisents (European bison) Bison bonasus (Linnaeus 1758), were studied in Bialowieska Primeval Forest (north-eastern Poland) composed of 94% broadleaved and mixed tree stands, on the basis of telemetric data obtained from 11 individuals (4 males and 7 females). Data was collected between 2012-2015 within the area of over 98 thou- sand ha. A majority of records for both sexes' presence was from the forested area, regardless of the season, compared to open areas (forest meadows, openings and agriculture neighbouring the forest). Outside of the forest in vegetative seasons, 36% of presence records of males and 26% of females were registered, and respectively about 39% and 41% in winter. This confirms the importance of an access to open areas for this species. Considering the availability of both types of habitats within home ranges occupied by wisents, the non-forest category was generally pre- ferred over the forest; however, those differences were the highest regarding the data on MCP area (the value of Ivlev's index 0.64), but were the lowest for the area representing concentrated use (kernel 50%) of a habitat. Regarding forest habitats, wisents selected against broadleaved stands but selected towards riparian vegetation. Although this species is not territorial, the degree of overlap between home ranges of particular mixed groups (consisting of cows, youngsters and calves) was very low. Data obtained in this study reveals patterns of the spatial structure of this wisent population, the oldest in the world, and therefore truly well established in its environ- ment, free ranging population of this species. Hence, the data for this population on trends in habitat selection may be a credible basis for the evaluation of habitat suitability of sites either already inhabited by this species or being considered for its future reintroductions and be useful in further management of its free ranging populations.

AB  - Spiders are dominant predators in terrestrial ecosystems and feed on prey from the herbivore and detritivore subsystem (dual subsystem omnivory) as well as on other predators (intraguild predation). Little is known about how global change potentially affects the importance of different prey groups in predator diets. In this meta-analysis we identify the impact of climatic conditions, land-use types and functional traits of spider species on the relative importance of Hemiptera, Araneae and Collembola prey in spider diets. We use a dataset including 78 publications with 149 observational records of the diet composition of 96 spider species in agricultural and non-agricultural habitats in 24 countries worldwide. The importance of Hemiptera prey was not affected by climatic conditions and was particularily high in smaller spider species in agricultural habitats. Araneae prey was most important for actively hunting, larger spider species in non-agricultural habitats. Collembola prey was most important for small, actively hunting spider species in regions with higher temperature seasonality. Spider species with a higher importance of Araneae prey for their diet also had higher importances of Collembola and lower importances of Hemiptera prey. Future increases of temperature seasonality predicted for several regions worldwide may go along with an increasing importance of Collembola prey which also related to a higher importance of intraguild prey here. Two global change drivers predicted for many regions of the world (increasing climatic seasonality and ongoing conversion of non-agricultural to agricultural land) both hold the potential to increase the importance of Collembola prey in spider diets. The importance of Hemiptera and Araneae prey may however show contrasting responses to these two drivers. These complex potential effects of global change components and their impact on functional traits in spider communities highlight the importance to simultaneously consider multiple drivers of global change to better understand future predator-prey interactions.

AB  - Maternal behavior immediately after calving has been widely studied in ruminants, including buffaloes. However, little is known about the cow-calf relationship in a cow-calf contact (CCC) system throughout the lactation period. The objective of this study was to investigate the evolution of ingestive behavior in dairy buffalo cows under a CCC grazing system during the first seven months post-calving and its relation with social behaviors. Ten crossbred dairy buffalo cows (Mediterranean x Murrah), including both multiparous and primiparous, and their calves, were evaluated from three days to seven months post-calving (M1, M2, & mldr;, M7). Evaluations were conducted weekly until M4 and biweekly from M5 to M7, totaling 22 observation days per cow-calf pair. Animals were kept together under continuous grazing, and their activities were observed from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm. These activities were grouped into the following categories: ingestive behaviors (idling, ruminating, grazing (min), and water intake; number of events); other behaviors (other activities, nursing, time out of water, and total time in water immersion; min); distance between cow and calf (<= 5 m, > 5 <= 10 m, and > 10 m; %); and social behaviors (aggressiveness, maternal care, vocalization, nursing events and denied nursing events; number of events). In M1, buffalo cows spent 75.7 % of their time at a distance of <= 5 m from their calves, while in M4, this occurred only 46.5 % of the time (P = 0.001). Idling while standing was more frequent in M1 and M2 compared to the other months (P < .0001), and ruminating while standing was higher in M1 and M2 than in the subsequent months (P = 0.011). Grazing time increased from M1 (128.3 min) to M4 (173.5 min; P = 0.002). The events of aggressiveness (4.9; P = 0.098), maternal care (7.4; P < .0001), and vocalization (1.7; P < .0001) were higher in M1 when compared to M7. During the first two months of buffalo calves' lives, cows are more vigilant and careful, increasing the time spent idling and ruminating while standing and decreasing the time spent grazing. Understanding these behaviors may help develop management practices that allow the expression of maternal care behaviors without compromising maintenance activities.

AB  - An increasing onus on elasmobranch management by regional bodies has been hindered by a lack of data on abundance, distribution and fisheries, especially in data-poor areas like the eastern Atlantic Ocean. From 2015 through 2017, 204 baited remote underwater videos (BRUV) were deployed in Cabo Verde around the eastern islands of Sal, Boavista and Maio and the remote offshore reef Jo & atilde;o Valente to establish a baseline of elasmobranch abundance. Over 200 hours of footage revealed 215 individual elasmobranchs, spanning 14 species from 6 taxonomic families. The abundance of elasmobranchs was highest in Maio, the island with the smallest human population, followed by Boavista and Sal. Smaller-bodied meso-predatory species such as the common smoothhound (Mustelus mustelus) and the Atlantic weasel shark (Paragaleus pectoralis) constituted the majority of observations in Maio and Boavista. Inversely, Carcharhinus spp. were observed in considerably greater abundance in Sal, and there was notably lower abundance of small-bodied sharks at sites with high large-bodied Carcharhinid abundance. Species richness was consistent with abundance estimates across islands, with Boavista and Sal recording the highest species diversity, followed by Maio. Results suggest that amongst Cabo Verde's eastern islands, there exists a high relative diversity and abundance of coastal elasmobranchs compared to populations in West Africa. Nonetheless, there is evidence of exploitation of higher trophic levels species. This trend is most notable in the decreasing abundance of Carcharhinids with increasing proximity to the capital city Praia, suggesting that fishing efforts from the capital are negatively affecting the abundance of large-bodied, higher-trophic predators.

AB  - Pathways to extinction start long before the death of the last individual. However, causes of early stage population declines and the susceptibility of small residual populations to extirpation are typically studied in isolation. Using validated process-explicit models, we disentangle the ecological mechanisms and threats that were integral in the initial decline and later extinction of the woolly mammoth. We show that reconciling ancient DNA data on woolly mammoth population decline with fossil evidence of location and timing of extinction requires process-explicit models with specific demographic and niche constraints, and a constrained synergy of climatic change and human impacts. Validated models needed humans to hasten climate-driven population declines by many millennia, and to allow woolly mammoths to persist in mainland Arctic refugia until the mid-Holocene. Our results show that the role of humans in the extinction dynamics of woolly mammoth began well before the Holocene, exerting lasting effects on the spatial pattern and timing of its range-wide extinction.

AB  - This study was conducted to identify the available goat feed resources for smallholder farmers in the semi-arid region of Zimbabwe. An ecological rangeland assessment was combined with participatory research methods to determine the diversity of feed resources in two wards of the Beitbridge District, namely Chamunangana and Joko. One hundred and twenty households were surveyed. All farmers depended on rangeland as the main feed resource. Some 87% of the respondents indicated that rangeland was not adequate, yet only 54% practiced supplementation. Participants predominantly used crop residues (40%), browse tree foliage (28%) and commercial feeds (22%) as supplements. Of the 46% who did not apply supplements, 53% attributed this to unavailability of feeding material and 29% were not aware of the importance, whereas the rest thought it unnecessary. Farmers in Chamunangana and those who milked their goats were more likely to supplement feed (p < 0.05). Respondents who supplemented had received training in goat husbandry (p < 0.05). The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H ') was higher in Chamunangana (1.29), compared with Joko (1.19). There was no difference in biomass production between the study sites (p > 0.05). Improved goat nutrition could be achieved through farmer trainings in goat husbandry and incorporating available feeds into balanced rations.

AB  - Substantial losses of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica have initiated investigations into localized resilience declines related to anthropogenic disturbances. In this study, we determined reconstructed shoot age and interannual growth metrics can detect anthropogenic impact effects on P. oceanica production. Interannual rhizome vertical growth, leaf production, and demographics of shoots collected from sewage and trawling impacted areas were examined using mixed effects modeling. Detected impact effects were specific to the type of impact, manifesting as an older-skewed age distribution of sewage outfall shoots and reduced vertical growth and reduced leaf production of trawling site shoots. A stress event period was also detected for all shoots >5 years old, with trawling impacted shoots indicating little recovery. Reconstructed age and growth metrics are simple to measure, incorporate multiple years of in situ shoot development, and are advantageous for identification of declining P. oceanica resilience prior to catastrophic losses.

AB  - Individuals living in heterogeneous environments often choose microenvironments that provide benefits to their fitness. Theory predicts that such niche choice can promote rapid adaptation to novel environments and help maintain genetic diversity. An open question of large applied importance is how niche choice and niche choice evolution affect the evolution of insecticide resistance in phytophagous insects. We, therefore, developed an individual-based model based on phytophagous insects to examine the evolution of insecticide resistance and niche choice via oviposition preferences. To find biologically realistic parameter ranges, we performed an empirical literature survey on insecticide resistance in major agricultural pests and also conducted a density-dependent survival experiment using potato beetles. We find that, in comparison to a scenario where individuals randomly oviposit eggs on toxic or non-toxic plants, the evolution of niche choice generally leads to slower evolution of resistance and facilitates the coexistence of different phenotypes. Our simulations also reveal that recombination rate and dominance effects can influence the evolution of both niche choice and resistance. Thus, this study provides new insights into the effects of niche choice on resistance evolution and highlights the need for more studies on the genetic basis of resistance and choice.

AB  - Asimina triloba is replacing shade-tolerant Acer saccharum as the most abundant seedling in many Ac. saccharum-dominated forests in the midwestern USA. Selective browsing of Ac. saccharum by Odocoileus virginianus and avoidance of As. triloba contributes to this increased As. triloba abundance. However, shade tolerance may also be a factor contributing to increasing As. triloba. We tested our hypothesis that As. triloba is more shade tolerant than Ac. saccharum. Fraxinus quadrangulata is less shade tolerant than As. triloba and Ac. saccharum; however, other than As. triloba, it was the only species that increased stems per hectare in the seedling stratum from 2003 to 2008. We evaluated leaf photosynthetic traits to assess shade tolerance of these three species. Light response curves (LRCs) of As. triloba, Ac. saccharum, and F. quadrangulata saplings were measured under a dense Ac. saccharum canopy in situ using a portable infrared gas analyzer and were tested for fit to rectangular hyperbola, nonrectangular hyperbola, and exponential LRC models. Multivariate analysis of covariance, with estimated ambient irradiance and leaf temperature as covariates, tested interspecific differences in gas exchange properties: (R d [dark respiration], a [LRC initial slope], and A MAX [maximum photosynthetic rate]). Multivariate contrasts indicated that F. quadrangulata had significantly higher rates of photosynthesis than the two other species, indicating lesser shade tolerance, whereas As. triloba had greater initial light response (a values) than Ac. saccharum, which confers an advantage to As. triloba under low light conditions. These results implicate greater shade tolerance by As. triloba as another contributor to its increasing dominance in the understory.

AB  - Wisconsin's plant communities are responding to shifting disturbance regimes, habitat fragmentation, aerial nitrogen deposition, exotic species invasions, ungulate herbivory, and successional processes. To better understand how plant functional traits mediate species' responses to changing environmental conditions, we collected a large set of functional trait data for vascular plant species occupying Wisconsin forests and grasslands. We used standard protocols to make 76,213 measurements of 34 quantitative traits. These data provide rich information on genome size, physical leaf traits (length, width, circularity, thickness, dry matter content, specific leaf area, etc.), chemical leaf traits (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ash), life history traits (vegetative and flower heights, seed mass), and traits affecting plant palatability (leaf fiber, fat, and lignin). These trait values derive from replicate measurements on 12+ individuals of each species from multiple sites and 45+ individuals for a selected subset of species. Measurements typically reflect values for individuals although some chemical traits involved composite samples from several individuals at the same site. We also qualitatively characterized each species by plant family, woodiness, functional group, and Raunkiaer lifeform. These data allow us to characterize trait dimensionality, differentiation, and covariation among temperate plant species (e.g., leaf and stem economic syndromes). We can also characterize species' responses to environmental gradients and drivers of ecological change. With survey and resurvey data available from >400 sites in Wisconsin, we can analyze variation in community trait distributions and diversity over time and space. These data therefore allow us to assess how trait divergence vs. convergence affects community assembly and how traits may be related to half-century shifts in the distribution and abundance of these species. The data set can be used for non-commercial purposes. The data set is licensed as follows: CC-By Attribution 4.0 International. We request users cite both the OSF data set and this Ecology data paper publication.

AB  - Evaluation of habitat suitability and landscape connectivity is critical for managing habitats of threatened species. The fragmented and declining populations of South China sika deer (Cervus pseudaxis) are now restricted to eastern China. Using infrared cameras, we monitored the species' occurrence in Jiangxi Taohongling and Zhejiang Qingliangfeng Nature Reserves and assessed environmental factors, including terrain, vegetation, water availability, and human disturbance. Habitat suitability was evaluated using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model, while least-cost path analysis was applied to identify potential corridors linking current and suitable habitats. Our findings show that habitat suitability is primarily influenced by proximity to railways, vegetation type, and distance to main roads. Highly and moderately suitable habitats, covering 6,686 km2 (9.2 %) and 2,347 km2 (3.2 %) of the study area, were concentrated near the two reserves. Additionally, we identified five potentially suitable habitats and delineated five potential corridors, with an average least-cost path length of 62.6 km (range: 4-106 km), connecting nearby reserves. This study offers critical insights for conserving South China sika deer habitats and provides a framework for protecting other threatened species with similar ecological requirements.

Among ecological interactions, those between plants and insects are among the most impacted by the elevation in CO2 concentration (eCO(2)). We selected a plant and an herbivore species of worldwide relevance and tested the hypothesis that eCO(2) affects leaf quality and defences of sunflower, Helianthus annuus L. (Asteraceae), and negatively impacts the larval preference and performance of the important pest Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Plants and insects developed inside open-top chambers under ambient CO2 (ca. 400 ppm) and eCO(2) (ca. 800 ppm). Sunflowers under eCO(2) grew more (e.g., increased height and had more leaves) but were of lower nutritional quality at an early developmental stage (e.g., lower nitrogen content, greater leaf thickness, and higher flavonoids content). Despite showing no preference for either treatment, H. armigera larvae performed better when fed with leaves from eCO(2) plants. We argue this was observed because larvae under eCO(2) sustained a greater leaf consumption, even when sunflower leaf quality became similar between treatments (by the 11th week after germination). Besides, they overcompensated a more deficient diet during early developmental stages and presented a higher growth rate; ca. 2.5x more individuals reached the pupal stage, and 4x more individuals became adults. The improvement in H. armigera larval performance under eCO(2) indicates a worrisome scenario in which a species that already exerts a significant impact on ecosystems would increase its consumption, develop faster, and support a larger population size.

AB  - We assessed the diet composition of wolves inhabiting Notecka Forest (ca 1400 km2) in western Poland based on the analysis of scats (n = 261) collected in 2008-2021. The study revealed that wolves in this large forest tract, consisting mainly of pine monocultures, consumed primarily wild ungulates (95.2% of consumed biomass). The roe deer was the essential food item (47.8%), followed by the red deer Cervus elaphus (25.1%) and the wild boar Sus scrofa) (18.4%). Wolves supplemented their diet with medium-sized wild mammals, mainly the European hare Lepus europaeus (2.8%) and the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber (1.9%). The food niche was narrow (B = 1.1), and there was no difference in food composition between the spring-summer and autumn-winter seasons. We emphasize the significance of the smallest European wild ruminant, roe deer, in the diet of wolves inhabiting Central European Plains.

AB  - Characterizing the nature of genetic differentiation among individuals and populations and its distribution across the genome is increasingly important to inform both conservation and management of exploited species. Atlantic Halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) is an ecologically and commercially important fish species, yet knowledge of population structure and genomic diversity in this species remains lacking. Here, we use restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and a chromosome-level genome assembly to identify over 86 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms mapped to 24 chromosome-sized scaffolds, genotyped in 734 individuals across the Northwest Atlantic. We describe subtle but significant genome-wide regional structuring between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and adjacent Atlantic continental shelf. However, the majority of genetic divergence is associated with a large putative chromosomal rearrangement (5.74 megabases) displaying high differentiation and linkage disequilibrium, but no evidence of geographic variation. Demographic reconstructions suggest periods of expansion coinciding with glacial retreat, and more recent declines in N-e. This work highlights the utility of genomic data to identify multiple sources of genetic structure and genomic diversity in commercially exploited marine species.

AB  - The spatial distribution pattern of plant species is frequently driven by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors that jointly influence the arrival, establishment, and reproduction of plants. Comparing the spatial distribution of a target plant species in different populations represents a robust approach to identify the underlying mechanisms. We mapped all reproductive individuals of the Iberian pear (Pyrus bourgaeana) in five plots (1.39-8.57 km2) differing in the activity of seed dispersers and vertebrate herbivores in southern Iberian Peninsula. We used Thomas point process models to quantify the consistency in the spatial pattern and the level of spatial aggregation of this mammal-dispersed tree among the five populations. We tested two hypotheses: (i) because the clumped defecation behavior of some dispersers can lead to local tree aggregation, and because denser groups of fruiting trees can limit seed dispersal by attracting frugivores to specific sites, we expected a consistent small-scale aggregation pattern across all populations; and (ii) because ungulates reduce recruitment by preying on seeds and seedlings, we hypothesize that ungulate activity will show negative relationships with tree density and level of aggregation. Our spatial analysis revealed consistent and highly aggregated small-scale patterns of all Iberian pear populations, with one critical scale aggregation, a low density of clusters and high variability in the number of trees per cluster. Ungulate activity and the number of trees per cluster showed a marginally significant negative correlation, suggesting that in areas with higher ungulate activity, trees tend to form less dense clusters. Although several of the underlying processes varied greatly among the five study sites, the Iberian pear showed a relatively consistent spatial pattern with just quantitative nuances throughout the entire region. This result has significant implications for the reproductive success of the species, management strategies, and ultimately the long-term persistence of populations.

AB  - Seed dispersal is an essential process contributing to the maintenance of plant populations. Zoochory is a widespread way of plant dispersal in every terrestrial ecosystem that can ensure the long-distance dispersal of seeds. Secondary seed dispersal (SSD) by far-ranging raptors is a special type of zoochory, which might have a role in colonizing new habitats. We used the barn owl (Tyto alba) as model species to test the effectivity and seasonality of SSD in open semi-natural landscapes. We collected 582 pellets from six sites in East-Hungary throughout one year. We identified prey items in the pellets and determined the viable seed content of the pellets by germination experiments. We found that herbivorous Microtus arvalis L. was the most abundant prey item through which most of the seeds spread. Owls dispersed the seeds of generalist and disturbancetolerant plants, indicating the habitat type where small mammals occur abundantly. In another experiment we tested the effect of the pellet material on the seedling survival and found that prey remains enhanced establishment of seedlings. Our study suggests that SSD by barn owl is occasional but important event in long-distance seed dispersal. Since the studied owl species uses several habitat types and has larger mobility than the rodents, the revealed dispersal mechanism can considerably increase seed dispersal distance and seed exchange between habitat types.

AB  - Horses are gaining importance in European nature conservation management, for which usually so-called primitive breeds are favored due to their claimed robustness. An increasingly popular breed, the Konik horse, is often said to be the direct descendent of the alleged European wild horse, the Tarpan. However, both the direct descent of the Konik from European wild horses and the existence of the Tarpan as a wild species are highly debated. In this review, we scrutinized both contemporary research and historical sources and suggest that the Tarpan and the Konik as its direct descendent are manmade myths that hinder effective conservation management. We did not find evidence that the Tarpan was a wild horse rather than a feral horse. We did not find any evidence either for a closer connection between the Konik and any extinct wild horse than between other domestic breeds and wild horses. We discuss three perspectives on why the myth has become widely accepted and survived to this day: a historical-political, a biological-ecological, and an emotional perspective. It seems that the origin story of the Konik and its connection to the Tarpan was shaped by personal and political interests, including nationalistic ideas. These as well as general human emotions towards horses have influenced researchers and laypeople to keep the myth alive, which has been possibly negatively impacting contemporary nature conservation. Indeed, today's Koniks originated from a small founder population of only six male lines that were selected according to their phenotypic traits, with the aim to rebreed the 'wild Tarpan'. Strict breeding practices have led to high inbreeding levels in recent Konik populations, which may undermine nature conservation purposes. Therefore, we suggest that mythologized origin stories should not be an argument for selecting breeds of grazers for nature conservation.

AB  - Since parrotfish in coral reefs are involved in key ecological processes, this study compiled species presence-absence data across 51 sites in the South China Sea to identify and explore the distribution and relationship between species and large-scale factors. A total of 50 species of parrotfish were recorded during the compilation, of which Scarus ghobban Forsskal, 1775 was the most common and widespread. The Nansha Islands, having a vast area of coral reefs and great proximity away from human interference, had the highest abundance with 41 species. Nestedness analysis indicated that the parrotfish community had statistically significant nested patterns in the South China Sea, and the Nansha Islands were the topmost site for the nested matrix rank. Scleractinian coral species richness and log(reef area) both had a significant effect on the site nested matrix rank (p < 0.05), which supports the habitat nestedness hypothesis in the South China Sea. Compared with browsers and excavators, scrapers were determined to be the most important functional group composition, while browsers had a greater contribution to the species nested matrix rank. A linear regression model showed that parrotfish species' richness increased with increasing longitude, scleractinian coral species richness, and reef area. Longitudinal variations in the parrotfish species richness were related to its distance from the biodiversity hotspot in the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Parrotfish were mainly distributed in the temperature range of 26-29 degrees C, similar to the optimum temperature for coral growth. The Nansha Islands should be considered biodiversity conservation priority areas for the conservation of parrotfish in degraded coral reef habitats, particularly in the context of increasing natural variability and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Fire management remains controversial worldwide, in spite of longstanding Indigenous burning practices that have shown benefits to biodiversity. In the Neotropics, limited information is available on wildlife response to fire, particularly for medium and large mammals. We conducted 1 year of transect surveys to detect signs and live sightings of mammals in the Rupununi, Guyana, within a habitat matrix of savanna, wetland, and forest, where Indigenous fire management is practiced. Species richness showed a non-linear relationship with time since fire. The number of live observations decreased with time since fire. Individual species responded differently, and this may be explained by habitat preference and post-fire resource availability. Savanna species-giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous)-favored fire, while forest-associated species-agouti (Dasyprocta leporina) and tapir (Tapirus terrestris)-avoided fire prone areas, although some species showed no such response. Our data suggest that mammals in the Rupununi show an ecological response to traditional fire management practices, but that fires affecting forested areas or forest connectivity could negatively impact wildlife. We recommend the promotion of traditional knowledge of fire and fire management among Indigenous Peoples, and the integration of this expertise to inform fire management policies. Combining traditional and scientific knowledge may help people and wildlife adapt to fire regimes that are increasingly driven by climate change and anthropogenic activities within fire prone savanna and forest landscapes.

AB  - Bycatch is a major global threat to marine megafauna and occurs in nearly all fishing fleets, including small-scale fisheries that use gillnets. Gillnets represent a threat to endangered air-breathing megafauna, who incidentally entangle in bottom-set gillnets and suffocate after being attracted by bait that is secured on fishing gear. We here provide the first evidence that hawksbill turtles feed on trapped fish in gillnets, suggesting that potential prey items trapped in gillnets may act as additional bait, attracting carnivorous sea turtles towards this threat. This overlooked depredating behaviour potentially explains and increases the likelihood of critically endangered hawksbill turtle bycatch in gillnet fisheries, calling for technological and management solutions.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter, deer) have been widely studied regarding their breeding ecology and responses to hunting pressures. However, variations in defining the breeding season-its duration and timing-across studies have created uncertainty about whether regional differences in deer breeding ecology stem from ecological factors or methodological inconsistencies. This study aims to clarify the peak breeding season timing and the movement patterns of males during this period, particularly in relation to hunting seasons. Understanding how age and the timing of hunting seasons impact movement and breeding behaviors is important for wildlife managers, as these factors can affect harvest success. This study took place in southwest Wisconsin, using GPS data collected from 188 collared male deer between 15 October and 1 December from 2017 to 2020. Based on generalized linear mixed models, 2-year-old males exhibited higher hourly movement rates than other ages, and the opening weekend of the firearm hunting season had no significant effect on movement rates. In contrast, the variance in daily movement rate differed significantly between yearlings and older ages, with males 3 years and older displaying the highest variance. This suggests that older males may alternate more frequently between high-movement mate searching and lower-movement mate tending, potentially enhancing reproductive success. Similarly, 2-year-old males had larger daily ranges than both older and younger ages. Changepoint analysis of daily movement rates determined that the peak breeding season occurred between 23 October and 12 November, with little variation among ages and alternative metrics. Our findings indicate that male movement rates and ranges can reflect deer reproductive efforts and vary by age, which has important implications for reproductive success and disease transmission risk.

AB  - Efforts to develop American chestnuts [Castanea dentata, (Marsh.) Borkh], with improved resistance to the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr, and Phytophthora root rot, caused by Phythophthora cinnamomi Rands, are ongoing. Establishing founder populations of improved chestnut will require under-standing the ecological and silvicultural requirements of the species. In areas where white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) hinder tree regeneration success, understanding how browsing will affect the estab-lishment of planted chestnut is critical. We evaluated the impact of browsing by deer on survival, growth and competitive status of hybrid chestnuts planted in 15 northern hardwood sites in Pennsylvania. We found that after six years, chestnuts planted in fences were 65 percent taller and 35 larger in basal diameter than chestnuts in unfenced areas. Browsing by deer shifted the competitive dynamics faced by the chestnuts by favoring slower growing, browse tolerant species and reducing the heights of competing woody stems. Nevertheless, the competitive status of chestnuts in unfenced plots remained stagnant over time due to repeated browsing, while it increased in fenced plots over time. Our results suggest that fencing or other means of reducing herbivory will be necessary to protect planted chestnuts in areas with moderate or high deer densities.

AB  - Returning livestock manure to the cropland as organic fertilizer is a sustainable and environmentally friendly treatment method, but its application also alters the soil microenvironment. However, the impact of soil microbial community disturbance and pollutant accumulation from different types of organic fertilizers remains largely unknown in South China. To fill this gap, we investigated the effects of organic fertilizers, including chicken manure, pig manure and vermicompost on the soil bacterial and fungal communities and environmental risks. The results show that applying organic fertilizer effectively increases the soil nutrient content. High-throughput sequencing of bacteria and fungi showed that the application of different organic fertilizers had differential effects on microbial community structure, with the highest number of microbe-specific OTUs in the vermicomposting treatment. Additionally, this study found no risk of heavy metal (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and Cd) contamination from short-term organic fertilizer application, but there was a risk of antibiotic (ENR and CHL) contamination. Functional microorganisms regulating heavy metals and antibiotics were identified by RDA analysis. This study facilitates the screening of types of organic fertilizers that can be safely returned to the field as well as developing strategies to regulate functional microbes.

AB  - A variety of metrics based on the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are commonly used as proxies for nutritional conditions of landscapes for ungulates, and these proxies are used to explain variation in animals' vital rates and movements. One common application of NDVI data is to derive the instantaneous rate of green-up (IRG) to represent the rate of plant phenological progression and evaluate hypotheses regarding animal movements related to the green wave. Although the green wave is generally assumed to occur along elevational gradients in mountain-valley systems, it is unknown how variable patterns of plant phenological progression occur across heterogeneous landscapes. Additionally, the consequences of spatial and temporal variability in these phenological patterns on animal movement behaviors in different ecological systems are unknown. Many ungulates worldwide exhibit migratory behaviors to track the leading edge of plant phenological progression; however, some species, such as pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), that occupy mountain-valley and prairie systems may experience variable patterns of plant phenological progression and employ variable movement strategies to exploit these systems. Within 8 pronghorn herd ranges that span broad and heterogeneous landscapes in Montana, USA, our objectives were to 1) calculate and interpret phenology metrics, 2) evaluate spatial and temporal variability in plant phenology patterns, 3) characterize the patterns of plant phenological progression, 4) relate the variability and patterns of plant phenological progression to pronghorn migratory movement behaviors, and 5) evaluate potential nutritional trade-offs between employing a migratory or resident migratory behavior in different landscapes. The study area included the ranges of 3 pronghorn herds in western Montana characterized by an elevational gradient from lower elevation grasslands to higher elevation forests and the ranges of 5 pronghorn herds in eastern Montana characterized by mixed-grass prairie and sagebrush steppe. Across these 8 herds, we collected global positioning system (GPS) collar location data from 586 female pronghorn during 912 animal-years from 2019 to 2021. We processed 12 years of phenology data collected during 2010-2021. Spatial and temporal patterns and predictability of plant phenological progression varied across different pronghorn ranges. In general, the 3 western Montana herd ranges had less annual variation but greater intra-annual spatial variation in values of phenology metrics, as compared to the eastern Montana herd ranges, and greater predictability across years. The estimated green-up order, which represented the strength of the green wave, suggested that a defined and strong wavelike pattern of phenological progression (i.e., a green wave) was not common across pronghorn ranges in Montana. Most ranges in most years experienced a truncated green wave or synchronous greening across the landscape rather than a green wave. Of 817 animal-years of spring migration behavior, we classified 193 as migrant and 624 as resident. The probability of being classified as a migrant increased as landscape productivity increased. We sampled migrants' and residents' potential exposure to phenology values along spring movement paths and summer ranges and found that within herds and years, the resident and migrant movement strategies conferred similar exposure to indices of nutrition.
   Collectively, these results highlight the variability in patterns of plant phenological progression across pronghorn ranges in Montana and indicate that migration behavior is not the dominant movement strategy of the pronghorn sampled or a strategy that resulted in higher exposure to indices of nutrition. Pronghorn employing either resident or migrant movement behaviors may have similar exposure to indices of nutrition, which suggests that factors other than tracking indices of nutrition may influence pronghorn movement behaviors or that remotely sensed nutrition indices may not adequately quantify nutrition-related reasons for migration. Based on these results confirming residency as a behavior employed by the majority of animals, we recommend that habitat conservation strategies should focus efforts to increase landscape permeability not only within movement corridors used by migrants but also within ranges where non-migratory animals are moving.

De nombreux ongul & eacute;s dans le monde pr & eacute;sentent des comportements migratoires pour suivre de la progression ph & eacute;nologique des plantes, cependant, certaines esp & egrave;ces, comme l'antilope d'Am & eacute;rique (Antilocapra americana), qui occupent les vall & eacute;es de montagne et les prairies, peuvent pr & eacute;senter des profils variables de progression ph & eacute;nologique des plantes et employer des strat & eacute;gies de d & eacute;placement variables pour exploiter ces syst & egrave;mes. Dans 8 aires de r & eacute;partition de troupeaux d'antilope d'Am & eacute;rique qui couvrent des paysages vastes et h & eacute;t & eacute;rog & egrave;nes du Montana, nos objectifs & eacute;taient de 1) d & eacute;river et interpr & eacute;ter les param & egrave;tres ph & eacute;nologiques, 2) & eacute;valuer la variabilit & eacute; spatiale et temporelle des mod & egrave;les de ph & eacute;nologie des plantes, 3) caract & eacute;riser les mod & egrave;les de progression ph & eacute;nologique des plantes, 4) relier la variabilit & eacute; et les mod & egrave;les de la progression ph & eacute;nologique des plantes aux comportements de d & eacute;placement migratoire des antilopes, et 5) & eacute;valuer les compromis nutritionnels potentiels entre l'utilisation d'un comportement migrateur ou r & eacute;sident dans diff & eacute;rents paysages.

AB  - Wild pig has one of the widest geographic distributions of terrestrial mammals. Dog-assisted wild pig hunting may reduce crop raiding but also elevates the potential disease transmission from dogs to wildlife and vice versa. On Sumatra, game hunting tends to focus on wild pig, where hunters either actively use dogs or firearms, or passively use snares. Our objectives are to understand: (1) the extent of active and passive wild pig hunting in Sumatra; (2) dog-assisted hunting practices; (3) potential disease transmission by hunting dogs to game. We conducted three types of data collection to cover the wide range of hunting techniques: (1) information from social media (i.e., Facebook) about dog-assisted wild pig hunting events in West Sumatra; (2) a questionnaire-guided survey among hunters around the Batanghari Protected Forest, West Sumatra; (3) expert interviews from provincial conservation offices about wild pig hunting practices in Sumatra. Active and passive wild pig hunting occurred in Sumatra. Firearm and snare hunting occurred in all eight provinces while dog-assisted hunting occurred only in six provinces. We documented at least 1331 dog-assisted wild pig hunting events which occurred in 2019 across the province of West Sumatra. The number of hunting parties and dog-assisted hunting group members on Facebook showed a dramatic increase between 2020 and 2022. Many dogs used for hunting are reportedly not vaccinated (35%), risking transmission of diseases like Rabies and Canine Distemper Virus to game and wild predators. Hunting is inadequately regulated, rendering enforcement of these regulations impossible. The extent of wild pig hunting has yet been unquantified but likely will have strong effects on the remaining wildlife populations. We call for proper quantification of hunting bags, and regulation, including the use and health status of dogs, to prevent disease transmission from dogs to wild animals and to protect remaining wildlife populations.

AB  - Slash walls are a novel strategy that could help maintain species on sites where ungulate browse limits tree regeneration. We established five slash walls in southern New England, USA to examine the influence of pre-harvest tree metrics and deer exclusion on stump sprout height and survival at 160 sample points (n =1509 trees). For all species groups, dominant sprouts were taller inside the walls at the end of the first and second growing seasons. After 2 years, mean sprout heights were similar to 2.5 times higher for Quercus rubra (1.8 vs. 0.7 m) and >6 times higher for Acer saccharum (2.0 vs. 0.3 m) inside the walls. For some species, the proportion of stumps with a live sprout after 1 year was higher inside the slash walls (56% vs. 28% for Q. rubra and 77% vs. 55% for Carya ovata). By contrast, sprouting success was uniformly high for Acer rubrum (78%) and Liriodendron tulipifera (87%). Differences in sprout survival inside versus outside the walls increased during the second year for Q. rubra, C. ovata, and A. saccharum. Where maintaining Q. rubra is a management objective, excluding deer will increase both the growth of stump sprouts and the proportion of stumps with a live sprout.

AB  - Following the near extinction of bison (Bison bison) from its historic range across North America in the late 19th century, novel bison conservation efforts in the early 20th century catalyzed a popular widespread conservation movement to protect and restore bison among other species and places. Since Allen's initial delineation (1876) of the historic distribution of North American bison, subsequent attempts have been hampered by knowledge gaps about bison distribution and abundance prior to and following colonial arrival and settlement. For the first time, we applied a multidisciplinary approach to assemble a comprehensive, integrated geographic database and meta-analysis of bison occurrence over the last 200,000 years, with particular emphasis on the 450 years before present. We combined paleontology, archaeology, and historical ecology data for our database, which totaled 6438 observations. We derived the observations from existing online databases, published literature, and first-hand exploration journal entries. To illustrate the conservative maximum historical extent of occurrence of bison, we created a concave hull using observations occurring over the last 450 years (n = 3379 observations), which is the broadly accepted historical benchmark at 1500 CE covering 59% of the North American continent. Although this distribution represents a historic extent of occurrence-merely delineating the maximum margins of the near-continental distribution-it does not replace a density-based approach reconstructing potential historical range distributions, which identifies core and marginal ranges. However, we envision the observations contained in this database will contribute to further research in the increasingly evidence-based disciplines of bison ecology, evolution, rewilding, management, and conservation. There are no copyright or proprietary restrictions on these data, and this data paper should be cited when the data are reused.

AB  - Simple Summary Yak (Bos grunniens) is the most economically and culturally important domestic bovine species adapted to the extreme ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which provides milk, meat, transportation, fuel (yak dung), and wool for local nomads as well as major sources of income. Calves are an important part of the sustainable development of the yak industry on the QTP, and the quality of calf rearing directly determines the production performance of adult animals. Under the traditional grazing management, late weaning (>180 days) of yak calves seriously affects the improvement of their production performance. A comparative study of fecal microbiota dynamics of yak and cattle (Bos taurus) calves in different months after weaning will help to understand the changes in intestinal microbiota structure, and will aid in in improving growth rate and survivability of early weaned calves. Our research will contribute to the development of appropriate strategies to regulate the gut microbiome and thus improve the growth and health of the grazing ruminants on the QTP. Background: The gut microbiota plays an important role in the health and production of animals. However, little information is available on the dynamic variations and comparison of intestinal microbiota in post-weaning yak calves living on the QTP. Methods: We explored the fecal bacterial microbiota succession of yak calves at different months after early weaning (60 d) compared with cattle calves by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and functional composition prediction. Results: We found no significant difference in blood biochemical parameters related to glucose and lipid metabolism between yaks and calves in different months after weaning. The core fecal bacterial microbiota from both species of calves was dominated by Ruminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, and Bacteroidaceae. The fecal microbial community has a great alteration within the time after weaning in both cattle and yak calves, but cattle showed a larger change. After five months, the microbiota achieves a stable and concentrated state. This is also similar to the functional profile. Conclusions: Based on the exploration of dynamic changes in the fecal microbiota at an early stage of life, our results illustrated that there were no negative effects of intestinal microbiota succession on yak calves when early weaning was employed.

AB  - Cuvier's gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) was reintroduced in Tergou reserve (TR) in 2018-2019 to help restore its population at the Moroccan Central Plateau. A study on browsing trees and shrubs was conducted in this reserve to identify (i) the seasonal pattern of this activity and (ii) the most solicited tree and shrub species. Here, we used six random 500-m transects to collect, each month and at each transect, the number of fresh browsing traces of each encountered tree and shrub species. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression model (LM) to test seasonal variation of the composition of trees and shrubs browsed. Our results showed that, in this reserve, Olea europaea, Quercus ilex, Cistus salviifolius, and Cistus creticus are mostly browsed during winter, whereas Tetraclinis articulata and Ruta angustifolia are mainly used during spring. This information is useful to the managers of the TR not only to consider the importance of the aforementioned trees and shrubs for reintroduced gazelles but also to take the necessary measures so that the forest stand of this reserve is maintained at an appropriate level. Thus, the pursuit of monitoring is necessary to understand the bio-ecology of this semi-captive population more deeply. For this reason, the TR remains a useful and appropriate reference framework offering the opportunity for consolidating and improving the knowledge on this vulnerable mammal species in the view of a future successful release in the wild.

AB  - Effects of herbivory on competition between invasive and native plants have seldom been examined from an above-belowground integrated perspective. We examined the interactions between a monophagous beetle, Agasicles hygrophila, or an oligophagous beetle, Cassida piperata, and a root-knot nematode on the intensity of intra- and interspecific interactions between the invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native congener, Alternanthera sessilis. Plant-plant competition was assessed using the relative neighbour effect (RNE) index. Competitive effects (positive RNE indexes) from conspecifics for A. philoxeroides were detected under herbivory by A. hygrophila alone. The ramet number, stolon length, and/or the biomass of A. philoxeroides were reduced compared to plants without herbivory. The interactions between the two plants without herbivory were facilitative (negative RNE indexes), and the facilitative effect became stronger such that A. philoxeroides produced more biomass under combinative herbivory by C. piperata and the nematode. However, significant competitive effects from conspecifics were detected for A. sessilis under all the AG-BG herbivory treatments, while no apparent competitive or facilitative effects from A. philoxeroides were detected for A. sessilis under all the AG-BG herbivory treatments. These results suggest that intra- or interspecific competition of invasive and native plants can be greatly affected by AG-BG herbivory, and thus interactive effects of AG-BG herbivory and plant competition may influence invasive process of alien plants in the field.

AB  - Insectivorous birds have ecologically important effects on prey abundance, behavior, and evolution, and through top-down control, birds indirectly reduce herbivory and promote plant growth. While several studies sought to characterize biogeographic patterns in top-down control by birds, variation in bird predation along elevational gradients is not well characterized in terms of both its commonness and the mechanisms underlying such variation. Here, we characterized variation in bird predation along a 700-m montane elevation gradient using artificial clay caterpillars, assessing the roles of variation in aridity, other elevational effects not associated with aridity (e.g., most notably growing season length), and bird abundance and diversity. Multivariate models revealed increasing attack rates with aridity (when controlling for the effects of elevation) and elevation (when controlling for aridity). Because aridity declines with elevation, elevational patterns were not detectable in a univariate analysis. Bird abundance (but not diversity) decreased with elevation (but not aridity) and did not provide an explanation for our results, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms were behaviorally based. We speculate that the declining abundance of insect prey with elevation and aridity leads to increased bird foraging efforts and thus the likelihood of attacking clay caterpillars. If widespread, these dynamics have important consequences for both the interpretation of predation bioassays generally and our understanding of the multivariate drivers of variation in top-down control by predators and predation risks experienced by prey.

AB  - The African savannah ecosystem is populated by nomadic pastoralists who herd livestock in the day and corral them at night in temporary enclosures, called bomas, to protect them. The number and distribution of bomas on the savannah is important from an ecological perspective and may have a significant impact on wildlife movement. However, no study has yet examined this relationship. Here, using very high-resolution satellite imagery from two time periods, we quanitified changes in boma distribution and density across an area of 3377 km(2) in the Laikipia-Samburu ecosystem of northern Kenya between 2011 and 2019. To assess wildlife movement in relation to bomas, we used a GPS data set on African bush elephant Loxodonta africana movement from 27 collared matriarchs representing herds of 9-15, covering 112 467 hourly GPS fixes over 31 months between 2018 and 2020. Our results showed a more than 46% increase in the total number of human-built structures between 2011 and 2019, the majority of which were bomas, representing a 21.9% increase in human-modified land area. Elephants readily adjusted their foraging habits and itineraries in this habitat shared with humans, who were also nomadic in space and time. Assessing the night-day activity ratio, we found elephants move more nocturnally when in closer proximity to bomas, particularly during the dry season. This temporal separation means elephants avoid the times humans are active in and around bomas while still accessing required resources-water and forage. The temporal shift was stronger during the dry season when shared resources are scarce. Using daily travel distance as a metric, we show elephants moved further in closer proximity to bomas which was likely linked to the need to travel between forage patches. Given the rise in human settlements, understanding the consequences of animals' behavioral adjustments is critical to understand the long-term population viability of elephant populations.

AB  - Deep learning has become a key tool for the automated monitoring of animal populations with video surveys. However, obtaining large numbers of images to train such models is a major challenge for rare and elusive species because field video surveys provide few sightings. We designed a method that takes advantage of videos accumulated on social media for training deep-learning models to detect rare megafauna species in the field. We trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with social media images and tested them on images collected from field surveys. We applied our method to aerial video surveys of dugongs (Dugong dugon) in New Caledonia (southwestern Pacific). CNNs trained with 1303 social media images yielded 25% false positives and 38% false negatives when tested on independent field video surveys. Incorporating a small number of images from New Caledonia (equivalent to 12% of social media images) in the training data set resulted in a nearly 50% decrease in false negatives. Our results highlight how and the extent to which images collected on social media can offer a solid basis for training deep-learning models for rare megafauna detection and that the incorporation of a few images from the study site further boosts detection accuracy. Our method provides a new generation of deep-learning models that can be used to rapidly and accurately process field video surveys for the monitoring of rare megafauna.

AB  - Understanding how marine megafauna respond to human activity changes is challenging but essential for effective conservation and management. Using China's summer fishing moratoria and the COVID-19 lockdown as quasi-natural experiments, we aimed to investigate whether temporal reductions in fishing activity affect the occurrence of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) in Chinese coastal seas. We compiled occurrence records from social media platforms (2016-2023), standardized them by fishing effort data derived from Global Fishing Watch, and validated findings through interviews with local fishers. Our analysis revealed that both the summer moratoria and the COVID-19 lockdown significantly reduced fishing intensity, with moratoria having a stronger effect. Standardized whale shark occurrences increased significantly during summer moratoria, suggesting behavioral return to coastal foraging grounds in response to predictable, high-magnitude reductions in human disturbance. However, no comparable effect was detected during the COVID-19 lockdown. These findings highlight the role of disturbance magnitude and temporal predictability in shaping marine megafauna behavior. Additionally, the occurrences from social media also renewed the IUCN range map and suggested some foraging sites of whale sharks in China's seas. We recommend targeted protection at seasonal foraging sites during summer moratoria and adaptive spatial management to mitigate bycatch risks in China's seas. Our study highlights the utility of integrating social-media sightings and local ecological knowledge to assess the behavioral response of marine megafauna to policy interventions, and to monitor spatio-temporal dynamics of rare and iconic marine megafauna at large spatial extents.

AB  - Abiotic and biotic conditions can affect camera trap performance, and failure to account for environmental factors can bias wildlife research and management inferences modeled from camera trap data. We investigated whether a camera trap enabled with edge artificial intelligence (AI) could mitigate environmental effects on camera trap performance. We compared an edge AI-enabled prototype with 2 camera trap models commonly used by wildlife managers and researchers in a field experiment in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of south-central Montana, USA. Camera trap performance was affected by air temperature, wind speed, and time of day. Increased air temperatures and wind speeds decreased the conditional probability of positive detections, and the edge AI-enabled prototype did not mitigate these effects. The conditional probability of positive detections was <0.15 when air temperatures were >= 30 degrees C or wind speeds were >= 15 km/h. However, when air temperatures were >= 30 degrees C, the conditional probability of false positives was nearly zero for the edge AI-enabled prototype vs. 0.10 to 1.00 for the camera traps without AI, thereby making image collection and analysis more efficient. Air temperature had no effect on missed detections during crepuscular periods, but during daytime, the conditional probability of missed detections was >0.15 when air temperatures were >= 30 degrees C. During nighttime, the conditional probability of missed detections decreased as air temperature increased, with the conditional probability of missed detections <0.25 when air temperatures were >= 30 degrees C. The edge AI-enabled prototype did not mitigate time-of-day effects on the conditional probability of missed detections, and the edge AI-enabled prototype was more likely to miss detections than camera traps without AI. The conditional probability of missed detections ranged from 0.20 to 0.80 for the edge AI-enabled prototype vs. 0.05 to 0.50 for the camera traps without AI. As AI technology advances, edge AI-enabled camera traps must limit missed detections while continuing to minimize false positives during warm conditions.

AB  - Mass mortality events (MMEs) of wildlife are increasingly frequent and may destabilize communities. MMEs provide a unique ecological context because they simultaneously produce a resource pulse that is sometimes coupled with the loss or severe impairment of functional roles such as predation or herbivory. Moreover, these effects are complicated by global declines in obligate vertebrate scavengers.We designed an experiment to measure the relative importance of bottom-up (nutrient addition) and top-down (impairment of obligate scavenger and herbivore functional roles) forces experienced during MMEs on the local plant community.Increasing carrion biomass shifted local plant assemblages from the original state promoting plants more resistant to soil disturbance (i.e. annual plants), but this effect was unique to carrion as the same amount of macronutrients entering the system did not affect the plant community. This may indicate that the effects of carrion are primarily driven by interactions with consumers rather than bottom-up processes. Additionally, restricting obligate vertebrate scavenger access to increasing amounts of carrion biomass shifted the net effects of the carrion on the plant community by limiting perennial vines. Impairment of the herbivore functional role released plants from top-down control, increasing plant growth and survival.Our experiment indicates that top-down forces may have strong effects on plant communities following MMEs. As such, the global increase in wildlife MMEs may have broad consequences on ecological communities, not only on the species affected.

AB  - Upland regions in the UK are increasingly under consideration as potential areas for the creation of woodlands. This is driven by a combination of factors, including the aims of UK forestry policy to increase woodland cover, changes in current upland land-use and management, agri-environment schemes in national and international policy and an increasing public awareness of the ecosystem service benefits landscapes can deliver for society. Creating new woodlands in upland areas is challenging, partly due to concerns of potential impacts from a change in land use and stakeholder interests. This study considers a 250 km2 Cumbrian (England) upland landscape dominated by sheep grazing and, using an established ecosystem service assessment tool (TESSA), estimates the provision of ecosystem services under plausible alternative woodland creation scenarios. The assessment focuses on key ecosystem goods and services, which are identified by stakeholders to be of high importance to the study area, and the potential changes to those under the scenarios. The results indicate that, under lower woodland percentage scenarios (10 %), minor benefits are expected. However, a more complex outcome would be expected from the higher percentage woodland scenarios (75 %) with the woodland cover of 50 % identified as providing the highest overall benefit to society.

AB  - Invasive species management practices often include genetic analyses to better inform decision-making and resource allocation. Yet, past management actions may artificially bias recovered patterns of genetic variation; for example a population bottleneck caused by contemporary culling may mirror some patterns associated with historical isolation. Here, we aimed to disentangle the impacts of past management activities from natural processes for Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis), an invasive species that has been repeatedly culled on two islands, SGang Gwaay and Reef, within the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada). We applied a recently developed Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing panel to contemporary (e.g., blood, serum, tissue, muscle, feces) and archived deer samples, the latter collected prior to management activity within the system (c. 1997-1998), which allowed us to contextualize conflicting patterns of isolation and connectivity previously observed on SGang Gwaay and Reef. Successful genotyping (92.6%) and population genetic analysis of 292 individuals at 236 SNPs revealed signals of historical isolation on SGang Gwaay and Reef, provided evidence of a founder effect during initial colonization, and indicated an absence of ongoing gene flow. Furthermore, our spatiotemporal analyses consistently supported a priori predictions associated with bottlenecks within post-cull populations, such as within-island loss of genetic variation, elevated within-island kinship, and increased levels of among-island genetic differentiation. These findings are promising for future management of deer on SGang Gwaay and Reef, suggesting that eradications on these islands may be durable.

AB  - The Natura 2000 network is the centerpiece of the European Union conservation strategy to safeguard priority species and habitats. The question of whether other co-occurring species of conservation concern may also benefit from this network, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we used a systematic approach (MARXAN) for i) evaluating if the current Natura 2000 network in the Alboran Sea (western Mediterranean Sea), initially proposed to protect the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and priority habitats, is also spatially protecting the endangered common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), and ii) identifying additional marine areas that should be protected to reach adequate conservation targets for the common dolphin. While the current Natura 2000 network encompass ca. 22% of predicted abundances for common dolphins, this percentage might be enhanced by protecting coastal areas nearby the Strait of Gibraltar. However, dolphins and fisheries largely overlap spatially nearby the coastline, and only segregate in offshore areas that represent the marginal distribution of the species. Thus, conservation decision-makers must achieve a trade-off between cetacean conservation and fisheries by combining an area-based approach (i.e., new protected areas close to the Strait of Gibraltar) together with a basin-wide threat-based approach (e.g., regulation of fisheries).

AB  - Salt-licks are considered to be important places for conservation of animals; however, functions of salt-licks were still not well studied especially in Peninsular Malaysia. In order to examine the possible mineral-supplementing function of salt-licks of this area, we compared mineral concentration between the water from salt-licks mainly visited by herbivorous mammals to drink water and nearby streams, possible water sources for mammals at the area. We also analyzed the relationship between mineral concentration and salt-lick visit by mammals. Among analyzed minerals, only the concentrations of sodium and calcium were significantly higher in water from all studied salt-licks than those of nearby streams in both dry and rainy seasons, indicating that mammals could supplement these minerals by drinking salt-lick water. Herbivores most frequently visited the salt-lick with the sodium concentration significantly higher than other salt-licks. In contrast, omnivores and carnivores did not show such tendency. Red muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) and sambar (Rusa unicolor), the first and second most-frequent visitors of salt-licks (41.7% and 20.8% of the visitation record by mammals, respectively), most frequently visited the salt-lick with highest sodium concentration. On the other hand, Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) and white-thighed langur (Presbytis siamensis), the third and fourth most-frequent visitors (15.1% and 5.4%, respectively), frequently visited the salt-lick with lower sodium concentration. The results are consistent with hypotheses that sodium supplementation is an important purpose of salt-lick visit by herbivores, and indicated that other factors which would vary by species, such as social interaction, also affect selection of salt-licks to visit by herbivores.

AB  - This study compares the delta N-15 values and the trophic position of two seabird species throughout the late Holocene in three regions in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to assess the hypothesis that the decimation of megafauna led to changes in the trophic position of mesopredators. Modern and ancient mollusk shells were also analyzed to account for changes in the isotopic baseline through time. Results revealed that modern Magellanic penguins have higher delta N-15 values than their ancient conspecifics in the three regions, after controlling for changes in the isotopic baseline. This was also true for modern Imperial shags compared with ancient unidentified cormorants/shags from the two areas where ancient specimens were recovered (southern Patagonia and the Beagle Channel). Such temporal variability might be caused by three non-mutually exclusive processes: decreased availability of pelagic squat lobster resulting from decreasing primary productivity through the late Holocene, increased availability of small fishes resulting from the sequential depletion of other piscivores (South American fur seal and sea lion and Argentine hake) since the late eighteenth century, and modification of the migratory patterns of Magellanic penguins. Although disentangling the relative contribution of all those processes is impossible at this time, the results reported here demonstrate that the ecology of Magellanic penguins and Imperial shags has undergone major changes since the late Holocene.

AB  - The composting performance and nitrogen transformation during membrane-covered aerobic composting of kitchen waste were investigated. The aerobic composting products of the kitchen waste had a high seed germination index of & SIM;180%. The application of the membrane increased the mean temperature in the early cooling stage of composting by 4.5celcius, resulted in a lower moisture content, and reduced the emissions of NH3 and N2O by 48.5% and 44.1%, respectively, thereby retaining 7.9% more nitrogen in the compost. The adsorption of the condensed water layer under inner-membrane was the reason for reducing NH3 emissions, and finite element modeling revealed that the condensed water layer was present throughout the composting process with a maximum thickness of similar to 2 mm in the thermophilic stage. The reduction of N2O emissions was related to the micro-positive pressure in the reactor, which promoted the distribution of oxygen, thus weakening denitrification. In addition, the membrane cover decreased the diversity of the bacterial community and increased the diversity of ammonia-oxidizing strains. This study confirmed that membrane-covered composting was suitable for kitchen waste management and could be used as a strategy to mitigate NH3 and N2O emissions.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement
   Dust seeds, which are minute and contain minimal energy reserves, are often associated with heterotrophy (plants that obtain carbon without photosynthesis). Consequently, previous studies have mainly focused on the relationships between dust seeds and heterotrophy. However, dust seeds are also found in green plants. This manuscript focuses on the seed ecology of the apparently autotrophic shrub Rhynchotechum discolor that produces dust seeds. Using time-lapse photography, feeding experiments, and germination tests, we show that camel crickets effectively disperse the seeds of this autotrophic shrub. This is the first study to document insect-mediated internal seed dispersal of an autotrophic plant in regions inhabited by terrestrial mammals, offering new insights into the evolutionary ecology of dust seeds.
   center dot Although angiosperms exhibit a wide range of seed sizes, the mechanisms driving these differences are poorly understood. The evolution of dust seeds, which contain minimal energy reserves, is traditionally linked to heterotrophy, in which external carbon sources are provided to the embryo or seedling. Dispersal by small animals may be another important but underexplored evolutionary driver of minute seed size. However, insect endozoochory has been documented only in the seeds of heterotrophic species and autotrophic species in New Zealand (i.e., in communities without native terrestrial mammals).
   center dot Here, we investigate this seed dispersal mechanism in the Japanese shrub Rhynchotechum discolor (Gesneriaceae), which produces white berries with numerous tiny ellipsoid seeds, using time-lapse photography, feeding experiments, and germination tests, particularly focusing on potential interactions with insect internal seed dispersers.
   center dot Our time-lapse photography indicated that camel crickets predominantly feed on fallen fruits of R. discolor. Field sampling revealed that camel crickets excreted numerous intact R. discolor seeds. Feeding experiments confirmed that some camel crickets excreted a high proportion of intact seeds, many of which successfully germinated into autotrophic seedlings.
   center dot The present study provides the first evidence of insects acting as endozoochorous seed dispersers in fully autotrophic plants within regions inhabited by terrestrial mammals. Our findings suggest that orthopteran-mediated seed dispersal is more widespread than previously thought, and that dust seeds can evolve from selective pressures beyond heterotrophy, specifically through insect-mediated seed dispersal.

AB  - Background Knowledge about the niche overlap among wild species and domestic cattle is helpful to conserve and manage wildlife. We assessed the habitat niche breadth and overlap of sympatrically living spotted deer (Axis axis) and domestic cattle with swamp deer (Cervus duvaucelii) in Shuklaphanta National Park, Nepal during the dry season to explore the possibility of interspecific competition by studying the habitat use by these species. The assumption was made that the presence of pellets is proof of habitat used by species. Methods Grids of 2 km x 2 km have four subgrids, each with four sample plots, making a total of 16 plots (20 m x 20 m) in each grid. The size of each sub-grid was 200 m x 200 m and they were placed randomly inside the grid but at least 1 km apart from one another. The data was collected in a 96 plots in total. Levin's niche breadth and Morisita's overlap index were calculated to determine the niche breadth and the habitat overlap, respectively. Results The Levin's measure of niche breadth suggested that spotted deer had the highest acclimatization with an index value of 0.94, followed by domestic cattle at 0.50, and swamp deer at 0.33 in our study area. Thus, our findings supported the evidence that spotted deer are habitat generalists, whereas swamp deer are habitat specialists. The swamp deer had lower niche breadth and more overlap with domestic cattle. Conclusion Our study showed the least niche breadth of swamp deer in comparison to spotted deer and domestic cattle. The domestic cattle had the highest and least niche overlap with spotted deer and swamp deer, respectively, in terms of habitat use. Our study suggests that domestic cattle grazing should be stopped, and grassland management should be carried out for the benefit of ungulates. Similar studies should be conducted, including different seasons and places, prior to appropriate habitat management. In addition, further studies are needed to quantify the extent of interspecific competition by incorporating more species.

AB  - How consumer diversity determines consumption efficiency is a central issue in ecology. In the context of predation and biological control, this relationship concerns predator diversity and predation efficiency. Reduced predation efficiency can result from different predator taxa eating each other in addition to their common prey (interference due to intraguild predation). By contrast, multiple predator taxa with overlapping but complementary feeding niches can generate increased predation efficiency on their common prey (enemy complementarity). When viewed strictly from an ecological perspective, intraguild predation and enemy complementarity are opposing forces. However, from an evolutionary ecology perspective, predators facing strong intraguild predation may evolve traits that reduce their predation risk, possibly leading to niche complementarity between enemies; thus, selection from intraguild predation may lead to enemy complementarity rather than opposing it. As specialized predators that live in or on their hosts, parasitoids are subjected to intraguild predation from generalist predators that consume the parasitoids' hosts. The degree to which parasitoid-predator interactions are ruled by interference versus enemy complementarity has been debated. Here, we address this issue with field experiments in a forest community consisting of multiple species of trees, herbivorous caterpillars, parasitoids, ants, and birds. Our experiments and analyses found no interference effects, but revealed clear evidence for complementarity between parasitoids and birds (not ants). Parasitism rates by hymenopterans and dipterans were negatively associated with bird predation risk, and the variation in the strength of this negative association suggests that this enemy complementarity was due to parasitoid avoidance of intraguild predation. We further argue that avoidance of intraguild predation by parasitoids and other arthropod predators may explain enigmatic patterns in vertebrate-arthropod-plant food webs in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Natural habitat of the endangered Florida Key deer ( Odocoileus virginianus clavium) is limited to a portion of the lower Florida Keys, large parts of which have been altered by human development. A major reason the deer have survived there is its unique geology that provides surface access to underground freshwater lenses. Such water features provide the deer access to drinking water, however, historically many of the sites have been destroyed through human activity. We examined seasonal drinking water availability to the deer on multiple islands for 3.5 years from April 2019 through September 2022. We also examined the availability of anthropogenic drinking water sources linked to human habitation. Our results show that natural drinking water sources become extremely limited or non-existent during the region's dry season in large parts of the Key deer range. Anthropogenic freshwater sources in the form of air conditioning drips, garden ponds, water buckets and bird baths are much more numerous, and the deer utilize them regularly. We posit that the existing unavailability of natural drinking water sites is a prime factor driving the domestication of Key deer. This trend of Key deer dependence on humans will only increase as projected increased hurricane activity and sea level rise will negatively affect the freshwater lenses, and hence the number of permanent freshwater sites available to Florida Keys wildlife. The dependence trend could be slowed by management's readopting natural water source enhancement efforts and installation of water guzzlers as was done in the mid-2000 s but has not been continued since.

AB  - Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) sustain one of the most lucrative fisheries in the eastern Canadian Arctic and Labrador Sea. This species also plays an important role in food web connectivity and benthic-pelagic coupling. Despite the relatively rich knowledge of this species, R. hippoglossoides ecology in these specific areas remains poorly understood. The main aim of this study was to characterize the diet of this deepwater fish in the Labrador Sea and Davis and Hudson Straits and characterize the predator-prey relationship with northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), another commercially important species in the region. Stomach contents analyses were conducted on 1199 fish captured from 2018 to 2020. Small specimens (<20 cm) fed on invertebrates, whereas larger individuals (>60 cm) fed primarily on fish, indicative of size-related changes in diet composition. The relative abundance of Pandalus shrimp species in the environment was reflected in the diet. Location appeared to be the most influential variable on feeding patterns. Distinct oceanographic conditions among areas, resulting in differences in prey availability, could explain these results. Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and redfish (Sebastes sp.) were selected in locations where fish prey were the most abundant. These results shed light on the opportunistic nature of R. hippoglossoides and its preference for fish at large size. With the rapidly changing oceanographic conditions of Arctic waters, a distributional change in the biomass of shrimp is expected. Results suggest that an increase in abundance of predatory groundfish species in the system (e.g., Sebastes sp.) could lead to acute predation on shrimp and competition with R. hippoglossoides. By revealing key trophic links within the demersal ecosystem, this work provides valuable information on the development of ecosystem approaches to fisheries management for the region.

AB  - We investigated how Mississippian residents of the Central Illinois River Valley (CIRV) altered their hunting strategies in response to climate change and warfare in the 13th and 14th centuries. The CIRV, located in westcentral Illinois just north of Greater Cahokia, was characterized by optimal climatic conditions in the 11th and 12th centuries, followed by centuries of drought and warfare. We integrated paleoclimatic reconstructions and evidence of violence with bone collagen and apatite isotopic analyses on white-tailed deer remains to investigate how CIRV residents minimized risks associated with white-tailed deer hunting. This is the first study in this region to effectively use delta 13 C apatite measurements to show the selective consumption of maize by white-tailed deer. Our results indicate that there were varied responses to climate change and conflict that were socially contingent upon community size. Notably, deer hunted by residents of Roskamp, occupied in the 13th century during the period of warfare, had highly elevated delta 13 C apatite values, demonstrating residents partook in garden hunting.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a highly adaptable species that have invaded many regions and cause significant damage throughout the world. Ungulate-proof fencing is increasingly used in conjunction with other control techniques to manage wild pig populations. However, little is known about how fencing affects wild pig space use behaviors and whether any changes may be exploited to increase efficacy of control activities. Our goal was to understand how wild pigs altered their space use behaviors in response to newly constructed fencing. Specifically, we examined for changes in space use area (home range and core area), increases in overlap with conspecifics, and shifts in space use as ungulate exclusion fencing was constructed on northern Guam from February 2021 to March 2022. Wild pigs closer to the fence had decreased space use. For every 200 m nearer newly constructed fence, home ranges and core areas decreased approximately 15% and 16%, respectively. When individual wild pigs were enclosed by the fence, those animals increased their home range overlap with conspecifics by approximately 76% compared to wild pigs outside the fence. Wild pigs shifted their home ranges 3 to 9 times more during the first part of fence construction when 68% of the fence was completed compared to all other time periods, with male wild pigs shifting greater distances than females by 1.15 times. The construction of ungulate fencing led to smaller space use areas of wild pigs on both sides of the fence and intensified use of the area inside the fence by wild pigs contained within (i.e., more overlap). Management activities nearer the fence should account for decreases in home range and core area size to maximize population control efforts (i.e., more densely spaced trap sites). Enclosed wild pigs should be eradicated quickly to minimize damages to sensitive flora and fauna and decrease disease risk from intensified movement behaviors inside the fence.

AB  - Rewilding is habitat restoration that attempts to return ecosystems to their state before human alterations were imposed. Rewilding might involve actions that are not desired by society. As a result, a compromised form of rewilding has been proposed that is generally known as rewilding lite, which involves some human intervention to achieve the goals of a more natural state of ecosystems that were historically disturbed by anthropogenic influences. Rewilding lite is gaining traction in Europe where marginal agriculture areas are being abandoned. We addressed a variant that we called livestock rewilding (LR) based on the use of herbivorous livestock species to restore ecological functions and trophic complexity (functional integrity) in abandoned agricultural landscapes. Our objective was to assess societal attitudes and awareness of LR in Spain based on the answers of 1,036 respondents of a self-selecting questionnaire of 27 closed-ended questions addressed to the general public using snowball sampling, conducted between March and July 2021. Seventy-five percent of the respondents supported LR but only on the condition of imposing minimum hazards to people, crops, and property. Ranchers were the least likely societal group to support LR (58%). Women had the greatest enthusiasm for LR (79% women vs. 71% men). Horses, donkeys, and goats were the most preferred species to be included in LR programs, with pigs as the least popular after cattle and sheep. There was support for the removal of excess individuals of rewilded livestock and for the use of their meat for human consumption, especially among male respondents. Respondents were reticent to accept mortality in LR populations caused by natural stochastic events and discriminated between livestock species for population control methods. Respondents preferred non-lethal methods of population control; involving hunters was a second choice. Some hunters were reluctant to participate in population control of rewilded livestock, especially if they had to pay, and were reticent to shoot equids but keen to shoot goats. There was general support among Spanish respondents for LR, though there were significant differences between societal groups in attitudes towards the type, species, and intensity of management required to minimize hazards to people's health, crops, and the environment. Livestock rewilding is a plausible tool for the restoration of trophic complexity in abandoned agricultural land in Spain that could be used to circumvent the introduction of allochthonous wild species.

AB  - Most animal habitats are affected by humans. While some species tolerate and even benefit from these changes, others suffer. Understanding when and how human-altered landscapes affect animal behavior, health, repro-duction, and survival is essential to species management in a human-dominated world. Here we use 27 years of data on human-baboon encounters in a protected, semi-arid ecosystem in Kenya to: (i) identify spatial, envi-ronmental, and group-level predictors of baboon encounters with pastoralists; (ii) test whether human-built water sources alter baboon ranging patterns; and (iii) test if human encounters are linked to baboon survival, reproduction, and health. We find that the primary driver of human-baboon encounters is water availability. During dry periods, pastoralists migrate into baboon rangelands, leading to frequent human-baboon encounters, especially near water wells. Further, the baboons shift their ranges to encompass newly built wells and move away from abandoned, dried-up wells. Since 2006, a third of adult baboon deaths were linked to violent en-counters with humans or their dogs. Human encounters were also linked to high infant mortality and parasite diversity in females (but this effect could not be disentangled from seasonal confounds). For wild baboons, life in protected, pastoralist conservancies presents a double-edged sword: human-built wells enable the baboons to access water during dry periods, but these wells lead to encounters with humans, which have become a common source of baboon mortality. Together, our results serve as a comprehensive case study of anthropogenic effects on wild primates, highlighting the complex interactions between humans and wildlife in protected areas.

AB  - The magnitude of change in climatic conditions and vegetation response to the last deglaciation in various parts of tropical Amazonia is poorly understood and controversial. Analysis of a sediment core e.g. fossil pollen, X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and charcoal from Lake Malachite on the Hill of Six Lakes in northwestern Brazil provided a deglacial history of climate, vegetation change and fire. Pollen revealed a forested landscape throughout, with shifts in composition that were driven by warming and changes in precipitation. The glacial cooling of c. 4-5 degrees C had brought species characteristic of cooler climates into the Amazon lowlands and was followed by an initial warming that began at least 19.5 thousand calibrated years before the present (cal kyr BP). Temperature oscillations and changes in precipitation between (18-14.6 cal kyr BP) associated with Heinrich Stadial 1 were observed as wet-dry-wet oscillations similar to some of the previous studies, and were evident in both pollen and XRF data. The pollen spectra were consistent that of a mesic forest before and after the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum. Cool-adapted taxa had previously been described from other cores from the Hill of Six Lakes, and persisted in low abundances until c. 14.1 cal kyr BP. No distinct response to the Atlantic Cold Reversal was evident in our proxy data. The early Holocene was marked by pollen, charcoal, and sedimentary changes that could reflect a peak drought stress on the forest. The large occurrence of charcoal indicating an increase in fires coincided with disturbance elements e.g. Cecropia and Alchornea, that could have been consistent with human disturbance of the forest at c. 10.2 cal kyr BP.

AB  - The majority of multi-cellular terrestrial life is found in tropical forests and is either an invertebrate or a plant: for decades ecologists have sought to understand why. As global change erodes the list of extant species on our planet quantifying what species remain, along with their origins and ecology, contributes to our ability to preserve ecosystem functioning and resilience. Here we study three feeding guilds of caterpillars (Lepidoptera) and seek to understand the drivers of their diet breadth across four diverse tropical plant genera in Papua New Guinea. Host specificity is central to biodiversity estimates and the resilience of ecological networks. Specifically, we calculate distance-based host specificity in relation to plant phylogenetic relationships alongside chemical and mechanical traits of leaves. In terms of chemical defenses, we focus on the major polyphenol groups, a compound class shared across many plant species. We refine our data exploration using food webs and ordinations to pick out specific traits of relevance to insect host specificity. Our results showed that the degree of specialization for caterpillars took the following order: phylogenetic>polyphenol>mechanical, such that insect specificity was explained best by host phylogeny and polyphenol chemistry in our study system. Leaf mining insects had higher host specificity than those feeding externally. Of the traits studied hexahydroxydiphenoyl derivatives, galloyl derivatives, trichome density, quinic acid derivatives, myricetins and successional index explained the most variation in overall insect community structure. Our findings build on earlier studies of New Guinean rainforest communities and add a mechanistic explanation to previous findings that host genera are functional islands for insect herbivores. Further, we demonstrate that different plant genera combine different defensive traits that appear to drive associated insect diversity. Our approach integrates trait data and phylogeny to explore dimensions of specialization and we welcome metabolomic studies that will provide more detailed explanations for insect-herbivore host use. Finally, chemical diversity is directly linked to organismal diversity and by studying a range of insect herbivore guilds we make a connection between feeding ecology and specialization that will help to predict species interactions and, potentially, the persistence of ecological networks.

AB  - Simple Summary Yaks are one of the sources of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, and regulating greenhouse gas emissions from yaks has important ecological significance. In this study, we evaluated potential links between basal diet, rumen microbiota composition, and CH4 and CO2 emissions of yaks under different feeding regimes. We found the CO2 and CH4 emissions of yaks were lower in traditional grazing than in warm-grazing and cold-indoor feeding regimes. The rumen microbiota of the yaks changed because of differences in basal diet. The CO2 and CH4 emissions of yaks were related to complementarity among members of the rumen functional genera. We believe that shifts in feeding regimes are effective measures reducing greenhouse gas emissions from yaks and rumen microbiome characterization could be useful screening tools for selecting yaks with low gas emissions. Shifts in feeding regimes are important factors affecting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock farming. However, the quantitative values and associated drivers of GHG emissions from yaks (Bos grunniens) following shifts in feeding regimes have yet to be fully described. In this study, we aimed to investigate CH4 and CO2 emissions differences of yaks under different feeding regimes and their potential microbial mechanisms. Using static breathing chamber and Picarro G2508 gas concentration analyzer, we measured the CO2 and CH4 emissions from yaks under traditional grazing (TG) and warm-grazing and cold-indoor feeding (WGCF) regimes. Microbial inventories from the ruminal fluid of the yaks were determined via Illumina 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing. Results showed that implementing the TG regime in yaks decreased their CO2 and CH4 emissions compared to the WGCF regime. The alpha diversity of ruminal archaeal community was higher in the TG regime than in the WGCF regime. The beta diversity showed that significant differences in the rumen microbial composition of the TG regime and the WGCF regime. Changes in the rumen microbiota of the yaks were driven by differences in dietary nutritional parameters. The relative abundances of the phyla Neocallimastigomycota and Euryarchaeota and the functional genera Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Orpinomyces, and Methanobrevibacter were significantly higher in the WGCF regime than in the TG regime. CO2 and CH4 emissions from yaks differed mainly because of the enrichment relationship of functional H-2- and CO2-producing microorganisms, hydrogen-consuming microbiota, and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic microbiota. Our results provided a view that it is ecologically important to develop GHG emissions reduction strategies for yaks on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau based on traditional grazing regime.

AB  - Canis latrans (Coyote) is known to influence herbivore communities through predation. In particular, Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) recruitment rates on the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Louisiana may be negatively influenced by Coyote predation on fawns during summer months. Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge is mostly bottomland forest surrounded by agricultural croplands and, although Coyote diets have been extensively studied, prey selection in bottomland forests is poorly understood. We collected scat samples within Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge to determine food habits of Coyotes. Coyotes used prey differently between pre-fawning and fawning seasons and exhibited inverse consumption of White-tailed Deer and small mammals by season. Consumption of White-tailed Deer increased similar to 27% from the pre-fawning to fawning seasons, whereas consumption of small mammals decreased similar to 21% . These findings are an important first step towards understanding prey selection by Coyotes in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley.

AB  - Results of a 2019 human biomonitoring study indicated that several parameters, including lead, cobalt, manganese, and hexachlorobenzene, were elevated in blood and urine samples in Old Crow, Yukon, in comparison to the general Canadian population. This study aims to identify possible local determinants of levels of these parameters, including consumption of locally harvested traditional foods, lifestyle factors, and demographics, in Old Crow and, for comparison, two other northern populations: communities in the Dehcho and Sahtu regions of the Northwest Territories. We ran generalized linear models to identify possible associations between individual determinants of exposure and key biomarkers, controlling for age and sex. In Old Crow, several variables were associated with elevated exposure levels of these biomarkers, including drinking untreated river water (29% higher blood manganese levels and 120% higher blood lead levels), eating caribou kidneys (22% higher blood manganese levels and 58% higher blood lead levels), and eating whitefish (28% higher blood cobalt levels). Additionally, in order to differentiate results in Old Crow from those in other northern regions and to identify trends across regions, we observed relationships between consumption of moose and caribou organs and lead and hexachlorobenzene levels in the reference populations and pooled population groups. Though levels of particular contaminants may be elevated in some traditional foods, these foods remain an important source of nutrients for members in these communities and provide other benefits, including increased physical activity through harvesting, mental health improvements, and spiritual wellness.

AB  - A palynological record from Girraween Lagoon sediments (Darwin region of the Northern Territory, Australia) provides detailed long-term insight into tropical savanna vegetation community patterns, climatic and fire relationships, through Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4: 71-57 thousand years ago, ka) and Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3: 57-29 ka). Owing to a lack of data in reconstructing northern Australian environments, this paper looks to define and describe to a greater degree the nature and scope of these stadial and interstadial stages for the region. Girraween Lagoon simultaneously provides proximal palaeoecological data for the time and region of Aboriginal people's first arrival into Australia, also encompassing the late Pleistocene continental decline of megafauna. This study provides a dataset enabling full exploration of long-term people-landscape and faunalfloral interactions. Sea levels and associated variations imposed on the transportation of moisture and heat, held implications for MIS 4 and MIS 3 monsoon strength, which was particularly consequential for Girraween regional ecology. Results reveal a prolonged transition from wooded- to grassy-savanna, into a cool drier semiarid savanna. Increasingly episodic delivery of moisture influenced the permanency of freshwater in the landscape.

AB  - Adolescence is a sensitive phase when cues from the social environment can shape consistent individual differences in behavioral and hormonal profiles, but the effect of the social partner on these phenotypes is not well-understood, especially for females. We therefore aimed to investigate whether the age class and sex of the housing partner affect social behavior and cortisol concentrations in female guinea pigs during adolescence and estimate the repeatability of cortisol concentrations in this life stage. Female guinea pigs were housed upon weaning for 4 weeks with either an adult female, adolescent female, or adolescent male. Social behavior was observed in the home enclosure and a preference test and social interaction test were carried out at the end of the experiment. Cortisol concentrations (baseline and response to a challenge) were measured prior to the start of the experiment and 2 and 4 weeks after pair formation. We hypothesized that the social partner would affect behavior and cortisol concentrations. We found that females housed with an adult female were less aggressive and more consistently displaced by their housing partner than females housed with an adolescent female. Sex of the housing partner did not affect focal female behavior. Regarding hormones, baseline cortisol concentration was neither significantly repeatable nor significantly affected by the housing partner. However, cortisol responsiveness was highly repeatable both 1 h and 2 h after the onset of a challenge. The age class of the housing partner affected cortisol responsiveness, with higher cortisol concentrations measured at 1 h in females housed with an adult female. These results indicate that adolescent female guinea pigs exhibit consistent individual differences in cortisol responsiveness while retaining plasticity to adjust to cues from the social environment. Taken together, we show in a female rodent that the social environment can significantly shape behavioral and endocrine parameters during adolescence.

AB  - Hunters support scavengers with seasonal pulses of carrion. If those hunters also deploy remote cameras at kill sites, they could simultaneously contribute data to wildlife research while gaining first-hand knowledge of scavenger ecology. In 2018-2020, we recruited hunters to monitor carcasses and offal with remote cameras across western Montana, USA. We increased our sampling effort by also setting up cameras following successful elk (Cervus canadensis) hunts at a private ranch. Cameras recorded 19 scavenger species. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) appeared at 55% of sites, and 3 individuals wore auxiliary markers, demonstrating how hunters can augment efforts to detect tagged wildlife. Cameras also documented elusive predators (e.g., wolves [Canis lupus]) and a seasonality of scavenging among American black bears (Ursus americanus). At 42% of the sites, >= 1 cervid investigated the carrion within 1 m, a behavior that may transmit the prions associated with chronic wasting disease. Hunters are willing and competent citizen scientists that can help generate wildlife observations at a broad spatial scale.

AB  - The nutritional quality of phytoplankton is essential for the fitness of herbivorous zooplankton and for efficient carbon fluxes in pelagic ecosystems. In freshwater lakes, cladocerans and calanoid copepods are the main pelagic herbivores in terms of both numbers and grazing impact. However, most studies focused on the easily cultivable cladocerans, while only few studies addressed the impact of the diet on freshwater calanoid copepods due to their more complex life cycle. We here supplied five different phytoplankton diets to the freshwater calanoid copepod Eudiaptomus sp. to investigate their dietary quality for the copepods' fitness traits over the copepod's entire life cycle. While all tested diets supported comparable reproductive success in adults, egg production, hatching success and survival rate differed markedly between diets. In the offspring generation, diet affected developmental and reproductive periods, size at first reproduction and clutch size. Eudiaptomus body fatty acid composition only partially reflected their diet, indicating that the copepods are able to selectively accumulate and interconvert certain essential fatty acids. This capability may allow them to cope with nutritional deficiencies and may thus be interpreted as an ecological adaptation strategy to the fluctuating environmental conditions and resource availabilities in freshwater plankton.

AB  - The marking behavior and mediated communication of male moose in central Yakutia are studied. During rut, moose damage tree and shrub vegetation with their antlers and dig "rut" pits in the ground. Eight species of tree and shrub marked with by have been found. Among them, hardwood representatives predominate. The maximum thickness of a marked tree does not exceed 24 cm, the thickness of trunks averaging 12.5 +/- 2.7 cm. The moose marking activity concerns four types of damage to the marked tree or shrub trunks. Moose signal marks on the ground represent strongly smelling animal secretions left in depressions in the ground. Their dimensions average 50.3 +/- 8.0 cm long and 32.7 +/- 8.7 cm wide.

AB  - In terrestrial and marine ecosystems, migrants from protected areas may buffer the risk of harvest-induced evolutionary changes in exploited populations that face strong selective harvest pressures. Understanding the mechanisms favoring genetic rescue through migration could help ensure evolutionarily sustainable harvest outside protected areas and conserve genetic diversity inside those areas. We developed a stochastic individual-based metapopulation model to evaluate the potential for migration from protected areas to mitigate the evolutionary consequences of selective harvest. We parameterized the model with detailed data from individual monitoring of two populations of bighorn sheep subjected to trophy hunting. We tracked horn length through time in a large protected and a trophy-hunted populations connected through male breeding migrations. We quantified and compared declines in horn length and rescue potential under various combinations of migration rate, hunting rate in hunted areas and temporal overlap in timing of harvest and migrations, which affects the migrants' survival and chances to breed within exploited areas. Our simulations suggest that the effects of size-selective harvest on male horn length in hunted populations can be dampened or avoided if harvest pressure is low, migration rate is substantial, and migrants leaving protected areas have a low risk of being shot. Intense size-selective harvest impacts the phenotypic and genetic diversity in horn length, and population structure through changes in proportions of large-horned males, sex ratio and age structure. When hunting pressure is high and overlaps with male migrations, effects of selective removal also emerge in the protected population, so that instead of a genetic rescue of hunted populations, our model predicts undesirable effects inside protected areas. Our results stress the importance of a landscape approach to management, to promote genetic rescue from protected areas and limit ecological and evolutionary impacts of harvest on both harvested and protected populations.

AB  - Plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects of invasive plants are often regulated by abiotic factors, but whether soil water availability alters the impact of PSF on invasive plant growth and foliar herbivory remains unclear. We hypothesized that soil water content modifies PSF effects and then affects foliar herbivory. To test this, we established four soil water level treatments (soil surface elevated 0, 5, 10 or 15 cm above water) to examine their effects on PSF, growth traits, and herbivore resistance in the invasive weed Alternanthera philoxeroides. Results showed PSF was negative when the soil surface was elevated 5 cm above water, but it was positive in other treatments. Soil condition, water treatment and their interactions significantly affected total biomass, leaf and branch numbers. As soil water content decreased, leaf nitrogen content increased, while the leaf C/N ratio decreased. Root nitrogen and C/N ratios were also affected by water treatment. Leaf mass per area and leaf area consumption rate were significantly affected by water content, with foliar herbivory being lowest when water content was at its minimum. Importantly, the effects of water availability on invasive plant performance and foliar herbivore resistance appeared to be stronger than those mediated by soil feedback. These findings suggest that soil water content, as a critical role, modifies the PSF effects on invasive plant performance, thereby indirectly affecting foliar herbivory.

AB  - The mycelial networks of fungi promote the interaction between the originally isolated bacteria, thereby potentially enhancing the exchange of nutrients and the horizontal transfer of genetic materials. However, the driving effect of fungi on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during mesophilic facultative composting is still unclear. This study aims to elucidate the changes in ARGs and underlying mechanisms during the mesophilic composting of manure. Results indicated that reduction rates of ARGs in sheep and pig manure over a 90-day composting period were 34.68% and 60.10%, respectively. The sul1, sul2 and tetX were identified as recalcitrant ARGs in both composting treatments, with the additional unique recalcitrant gene addA observed in sheep manure. Fungal communities appeared to have a more significant influence on the cooperation between bacteria and fungi. Massive fungi interacted intensively with bacterial hosts carrying both ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). In sheep and pig manure, there were 53 and 38 potential bacterial hosts (genus level) carrying both ARGs and MGEs, associated close interactions with fungi. Structural equation modeling revealed that compost properties influence ARGs by affecting the abundance of core fungi and the hosts carrying MGEs, and that core fungi could also impact ARGs by influencing the bacterial hosts carrying MGEs. Core fungi have the potential to facilitate the horizontal transfer of ARGs by enhancing bacterial network interactions.

AB  - The outstanding diversity of Amazonian forests is predicted to be the result of several processes. While tree lineages have dispersed repeatedly across the Amazon, interactions between plants and insects may be the principal mechanism structuring the communities at local scales.
   Using metabolomic and phylogenetic approaches, we investigated the patterns of historical assembly of plant communities across the Amazon based on the Neotropical genus of trees Inga (Leguminosae) at four, widely separated sites.
   Our results show a low degree of phylogenetic structure and a mixing of chemotypes across the whole Amazon basin, suggesting that although biogeography may play a role, the metacommunity for any local community in the Amazon is the entire basin. Yet, local communities are assembled by ecological processes, with the suite of Inga at a given site more divergent in chemical defences than expected by chance
   Synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to present metabolomic data for nearly 100 species in a diverse Neotropical plant clade across the whole Amazonia. Our results demonstrate a role for plant-herbivore interactions in shaping the clade's community assembly at a local scale, and suggest that the high alpha diversity in Amazonian tree communities must be due in part to the interactions of diverse tree lineages with their natural enemies providing a high number of niche dimensions.

AB  - Seemingly small ecological changes can have large, ramifying effects that defy expectations. Such are keystone effects in ecosystems. Phloem-feeding insect herbivores can act as keystone species by altering community structure and species interactions via plant-mediated or ant-mediated mechanisms. Plant responses triggered by phloem feeders can disrupt tri-trophic interactions induced by leaf-chewing herbivores, while ants that tend phloem feeders can deter or prey on other arthropods. Here, we investigate how phloem-feeding herbivores change caterpillar-parasitoid interactions on Quercus alba (white oak) trees in natural forests. We factorially manipulated the presence of phloem-feeding insects as well as ant access on Q. alba branches over multiple years and sites and measured parasitism rates of co-occurring caterpillars. While 19.3% of caterpillars were parasitized when phloem feeders were removed, the presence of phloem feeders completely suppressed parasitism of caterpillars (0%). This stark pattern was consistent across the diverse community of phloem feeders and caterpillars. Our manipulation of ant access had no effect on parasitism of caterpillars, implicating a plant-mediated mechanism. We further assessed the mechanistic hypothesis that phloem feeders suppress plant emission of caterpillar-induced volatile compounds, which could disrupt host-location behavior by parasitoids of caterpillars. Phloem feeders indeed reduced concentrations of four volatile compounds, consistent with the putative plant volatile-mediated mechanism. Given the important role of parasitoids in controlling herbivore populations, this keystone effect of phloem feeders offers novel insight into community dynamics in forests and potentially other terrestrial ecosystems.

To understand the characteristics of heavy metals in the topsoil of the Zoige alpine basin, a total of 252 grass and topsoil samples were collected in May and September 2014. The results showed that only Cd and Pb highly exceeded their background values (BV); in May and September, Cd was 2.02- and 1.55-fold higher than its BV, respectively, and Pb was 2.35- and 2.17-fold above its BV, respectively. The sources of Cd and Pb were homologous. In addition, the comprehensive potential ecological risk index was less than 150, indicating that heavy metal pollution in the study area is currently low. The spatial interpolation indicated that Cd and Pb pollution might be related to tourism and transportation, but the low biological absorption coefficient for all heavy metals showed that heavy metal absorption ability of forage was low and would not impact yak breeding. Finally, the soil was lightly contaminated by Cd and Pb due to the rapid development of the animal husbandry and tourism. The spatial variation of heavy metal in the basin is dominated by structural factors, and the random factors also have an effect on spatial distribution of As, Cd, Cu and Ni. The random factors such as overgrazing can exert an influence on physical structure and the circulation of nutrient substances of meadow soil through livestock grazing and trampling, ultimately affecting the content and distribution of soil heavy metals.

AB  - As transportation infrastructure expands to accommodate increasing human population growth, wildlife-vehicle conflicts (WVCs) are a growing concern for motorist safety and wildlife populations. In the case of large ungulates, minimal information exists on successful mitigation of WVCs involving bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and habitat fragmentation. Too address this void, we evaluated the effectiveness of 3 new wildlife overpasses, 3 culverts, 2 bridges, and ungulate exclusionary fencing as potential desert bighorn sheep (O. c. nelsoni; sheep) crossing opportunities along US Highway 93 in Arizona, USA. We evaluated sheep movements using global positioning system (GPS) radio-transmitter collars and remote cameras for 4 years from March 2011 to March 2015 and sheep-vehicle collision data collected from 2011 to 2020. Although GPS determined pre- and post-mitigation passage rates of sheep that crossed US Highway 93 were initially similar, they increased every year and were on average 217% higher following inclusion of wildlife crossings and by year 4 had ultimately increased 633% from pre-construction rates. Cameras recorded 6,936 crossings by a dozen wildlife species with sheep accounting for 95% of all crossings. Sheep used the 3 overpasses (90% of all sheep crossings) disproportionately more than the 3 culverts and 2 underpasses (10% of all sheep crossings) in the same area, and use of the 3 overpasses increased 905% in the first year. Sheep initially used the 30-m-wide overpasses at 83% and 175% higher passage rates than 2 15-m-wide structures; however, by year 4 passage rates were similar across overpasses. From February 2011 through February 2020, we documented 0.8 sheep-vehicle collisions/year for an overall 93.3% reduction from the 12 collisions per year previously documented. Most of the collisions occurred immediately following completion of the project and gradually reduced as sheep access points were identified and addressed through an adaptive mitigation process to iteratively improve success. Overpasses appear to be the preferred wildlife crossing type for sheep and when properly located and linked with ungulate exclusion fencing successfully reduced collisions and habitat fragmentation. These findings add to our knowledge base of effective roadway mitigation for different species. Longterm monitoring informs species learning curves, preference of wildlife crossing structure type, and adaptive mitigation opportunities to increase effectiveness of mitigation measures on current and future projects.

AB  - The wisent (Bison bonasus) is Europe's largest land mammal. We produced a HiFi read-based wisent assembly with a contig N50 value of 91 Mb containing 99.7% of the highly conserved single copy mammalian genes which improves contiguity a thousand-fold over an existing assembly. Extended runs of homozygosity in the wisent genome compromised the separation of the HiFi reads into parental-specific read sets, which resulted in inferior haplotype assemblies. A bovine super-pangenome built with assemblies from wisent, bison, gaur, yak, taurine and indicine cattle identified a 1580 bp deletion removing the protein-coding sequence of THRSP encoding thyroid hormone-responsive protein from the wisent and bison genomes. Analysis of 725 sequenced samples across the Bovinae subfamily showed that the deletion is fixed in both Bison species but absent in Bos and Bubalus. The THRSP transcript is abundant in adipose, fat, liver, muscle, and mammary gland tissue of Bos and Bubalus, but absent in bison. This indicates that the deletion likely inactivates THRSP in bison. We show that super-pangenomes can reveal potentially trait-associated variation across phylogenies, but also demonstrate that haplotype assemblies from species that went through population bottlenecks warrant scrutiny, as they may have accumulated long runs of homozygosity that complicate phasing.
   Assembly of an European wisent genome and its integration into a bovine super-pangenome provide insights into large structural variants and how they impact phenotypes across phylogenies.

AB  - Optimizing energy acquisition and expenditure is a fundamental trade-off for consumers, strikingly reflected in how mobile organisms use space. Several studies have established that home range size decreases as resource density increases, but the balance of costs and benefits associated with exploiting a given resource density is unclear. We evaluate how the ability of consumers to exploit their resources through movement (termed "resource exploitation") interacts with resource density to influence home range size. We then contrast two hypotheses to evaluate how resource exploitation influences home range size across a vast gradient of productivity and density of human-created linear features (roads and seismic lines) that are known to facilitate animal movements. Under the Diffusion Facilitation Hypothesis, linear features are predicted to lead to more diffuse space use and larger home ranges. Under the Exploitation Efficiency Hypothesis, linear features are predicted to increase foraging efficiency, resulting in less space being required to meet energetic demands and therefore smaller home ranges. Using GPS telemetry data from 142 wolves (Canis lupus) distributed over more than 500,000 km(2), we found that wolf home range size was influenced by the interaction between resource density and exploitation efficiency. Home range size decreased as linear feature density increased, supporting the Exploitation Efficiency Hypothesis. However, the effect of linear features on home range size diminished in more productive areas, suggesting that exploitation efficiency is of greater importance when resource density is low. These results suggest that smaller home ranges will occur where both linear feature density and primary productivity are higher, thereby increasing regional wolf density.

AB  - The cheilostome Bryozoa encrusting settlement panels deployed in the Azores between 0 and 500 m, which were retrieved after a time span of 1 and 2 years, are here described and figured. Of the 49 cheilostome species reported, 15 are new to science: Beania pauciserialis sp. nov., Caberea rylandi sp. nov., Micropora acorecia sp. nov., Cellaria acorensidolisi sp. nov., Hippothoa jakobseni sp. nov., Chorizopora lula sp. nov., Haplopoma freiwaldi sp. nov., Schizomavella (Schizomavella) reverteri sp. nov., Schizomavella (Schizomavella) kekrymmena sp. nov., Microporella avilai sp. nov., Microporella quadrispinosa sp. nov., Microporella lobopodia sp. nov., Microporella nodulifera sp. nov., Buffonellaria faialensis sp. nov., and Omalosecosa secunda sp. nov. The subspecies Glabrilaria orientalis azorensis (Harmelin, 1988) is here raised to species rank, resulting in Glabrilaria azorensis (Harmelin, 1988) comb. nov. Moreover, we designate a lectotype for Nimba praetexta Jullien in by Jullien & Calvet, 1903, type species of the genus Nimba Jullien in by Jullien & Calvet, 1903, redescribe the species based on scanning electron microscope inspection, and transfer the genus from the Lacernidae Jullien, 1888 to the Escharinidae Tilbrook, 2006. A lectotype is also designated for Schizobrachiella sanguinea (Norman, 1868). Based on the taxonomic account, we discuss changes concerning the recorded diversity of bryozoans in the Azores and their taxonomic assignment, now including 91 endemic species that account for 41% of a total of 221 bryozoan species reported from the archipelago. Finally, we discuss biogeographic relationships and the status of origin, including potential non-indigenous species, and demonstrate a strong relatedness with eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean faunas.

AB  - Trophic mismatches are commonly reported across a wide array of taxa and can have important implications for species participating in the interaction. However, to date, examples of trophic mismatch have centrally focused on those induced by shifts in climate. Here we report on the potential for humans to induce trophic mismatch by shifting the phenology of fire. Globally, anthropogenic fire ignitions are phenologically mismatched to that of historic lightning ignitions but the effects of this phenological mismatch on trophic interactions are poorly understood. Using fire records from 1980 to 2016 from the southeastern USA, a hotspot of anthropogenic fire, we demonstrate that there is a temporal mismatch between anthropogenic and lightning lit fires in this region. The peak of anthropogenic ignitions (i.e. 45% during March and April) occurred 3 months earlier than the peak in lightning-ignited fires (i.e. 44% occurred during June and July), a pattern consistent with reports from several other regions and continents. We demonstrate with a field experiment conducted at a nutrient-poor site in the southeastern U.S., that anthropogenic fire phenology shifts nutrient pulses in resprouting plants so that they mismatch herbivore reproductive demands. Consequently, plant nutrient quality in four commonly consumed forages was below the threshold to meet lactation requirements. Neonates subsequently were more likely to starve when born far from areas burned during the peak month of lightning fire phenology. Our data indicate that human activities may be an additional causative agent of trophic mismatch.

AB  - To promote the sustainability of forest ecosystems and maintain ecosystem services to human populations in the context of climate change, forest managers are considering several adaptation tools. One of those, assisted migration, consists of displacing tree species and/or populations to locations with suitable future climate conditions. Assisted migration plantations, however, could fail to produce viable forests under high herbivory pressure from mammalian herbivores. Thus, selecting species and genotypes with low susceptibility to herbivores could be a key condition for the recruitment of translocated seedlings. We developed an approach to predict susceptibility to mammalian herbivores, based on the seedlings' chemical content (a proxy of phytochemical defence and susceptibility to herbivores). We used the approach on eight North American tree species of three climate analogues regions each (i.e. locations where the current climate is similar to the future climate at plantation site). We built chemical profiles and ranked species and climate analogue based on their potential susceptibility. To assess the reliability of our approach, we compared the chemical profiles to a systematic review of these species' chemistry and of mammalian browsing throughout their native geographic range. For most species, our chemical profiles and browse susceptibility rankings were congruent with information available in the literature, both for phytochemical defence and for browsing. Two of the eight species (Pinus strobus and Thuja occidentalis) were more susceptible than predicted based on their chemical profile. These discrepancies could be linked to specific mammalian herbivores, that were unaffected by the phytochemical defence of these species. We observed a generally higher susceptibility of broadleaf species, which could be taken into account when devising adaptive silvicultural strategies. Furthermore, we propose the chemical profiling approach as a preliminary screening tool to identify species more resistant to mammalian herbivores, but also potentially to other herbivores and pathogens. Our chemical profile approach, based on the objective assessment of multivariate analyses results, could be replicated to compare the potential susceptibility of other species. This approach could be especially useful when contending with novel plant-herbivore relationships, such as forestry and conservation assisted migration or species invasion.

AB  - BackgroundSetting large- and medium-sized wild mammal (>= 2 kg) restoration goals is important due to their role as ecosystem engineers and generalized numeric reductions. However, determining wild mammal restoration goals is very challenging due to difficulties in obtaining data on current mammal density and due to unclear information on what mammal density values should be used as a reference. Here we chose a 154 ha conservation area within one of the last remnants of the mountainous Chaco from central Argentina. We suspected that extensive and unreported defaunation had occurred due to past human pressure and the introduction of non-native mammals. To conduct the analyses, we used a simplified technique that integrates methods used in rangeland and ecological sciences.ResultsEight native mammal species including only one herbivore species, and four non-native mammal species including three herbivore species were detected during 6113 camera trap days. We used known cattle densities as estimated by droppings and direct counts, together with the relative abundance indexes obtained from camera trap photos to calculate the densities of the other species, correcting for mammal size. Densities for the least and most abundant native species were 0.2 and 1.33 individuals km(-2), respectively; and for non-native species, 0.03 and 5.00 individuals km(-2), respectively. Native and non-native species represented 0.8% and 99.2%, respectively, of the biomass estimates. Reference values for native herbivore biomass, as estimated from net primary productivity, were 68 times higher than values estimated for the study area (3179 vs. 46.5 kg km(-2)).ConclusionsThere is an urgent need to increase native mammals, with special emphasis on herbivore biomass and richness, while non-native mammal numbers must be reduced. As cattle are widespread in large portions of the globe and there is a lot of experience estimating their abundances, the ratio method we used extrapolating from cattle to other large- and medium-sized mammals could facilitate estimating mammal restoration goals in other small and defaunated areas, where traditional methods are not feasible when target mammal densities get very low.

AB  - Top carnivores are essential for maintaining ecosystem stability and biodiversity. Yet, carnivores are declining globally and current in situ threat mitigations cannot halt population declines. As such, translocations of carnivores to historic sites or those outside the species' native range are becoming increasingly common. As carnivores are likely to impact herbivore and small predator populations, understanding how carnivores interact within an ecosystem following translocation is necessary to inform potential remedial management and future translocations. Dietary analyses provide a preliminary assessment of the direct influence of translocated carnivores on a recipient ecosystem. We used a metabarcoding approach to quantify the diet of Tasmanian devils introduced to Maria Island, Tasmania, a site outside the species' native range. We extracted DNA from 96 scats and used a universal primer set targeting the vertebrate 12S rRNA gene to identify diet items. Tasmanian devils on Maria Island had an eclectic diet, with 63 consumed taxa identified. Cat DNA was detected in 14% of scats, providing the first instance of cats appearing as part of Tasmanian devil diets either via predation or scavenging. Short-tail shearwaters and little penguins were commonly consumed, corresponding with previous surveys showing sharp population declines in these species since the introduction of Tasmanian devils. Our results indicate that the introduction of carnivores to novel ecosystems can be very successful for the focal species, but that commonly consumed species should be closely monitored to identify any vulnerable species in need of remedial management.

AB  - P4 is a functional small peptide screened after enzymatic hydrolysis of cotton meal. Bacillus subtilis CM66 (OB) underwent recombination to yield Bacillus subtilis CM66-P4' (RB), capable of secreting P4. This study aimed to assess the effects of RB on the growth, antioxidant capacity and intestine in blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Seven groups were formed: a control group (CG) with no additional bacteria, three groups with different concentrations of Bacillus subtilis CM66 (2 x 10(7), 2 x 10(8), 2 x 10(9) CFU/kg - referred to as LOG, MOG, HOG), and three groups with corresponding concentrations of Bacillus subtilis CM66-P4' (2x 10(7), 2 x 10(8), 2 x 10(9) CFU/kg - referred to as LRG, MRG, HRG). After 8 weeks of feeding, the results showed that OB and RB had no significant impact on growth performance. Compared with CG and MOG, the MRG group exhibited a significant increase in protease and total anti-oxidative capacity (T-AOC) in the intestine (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of mucin-2 in MOG and MRG were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Compared with CG, muscle layer thickness (MLT) of MOG and MRG were significantly increased (P < 0.05), villus height (VH) and goblet cells numbers of MRG were increased (P < 0.05). Species richness and diversity of intestinal microbes were significantly increased in MOG and MRG (P < 0.05). P4 demonstrated a significant alleviation of the increase in sod expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) treated with H2O2 and mitigated the decrease in cells activity (P < 0.05). In conclusion, P4 effectively mitigated the impact of H2O2 on IECs in blunt snout bream. Dietary supplementation of 2 x 10(8) CFU/kg RB (secreting P4) improved the intestinal microbes and intestinal barrier, resulting in enhanced antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Aims A cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Trichinella spp. exposure in wild boar and Iberian domestic pigs from Mediterranean ecosystems of southwestern Spain.Methods and Results Serum samples from 1360 wild boar and 439 Iberian domestic pigs were obtained during 2015-2020, from regions where Iberian pigs are raised under extensive conditions, hence sharing habitat with wild boar. Seropositivity was found in 7.4% (100/1360; 95% CI: 6.1-8.9) of the wild boar analysed. In this species, the individual seroprevalence ranged from 3.6% (8/223) (hunting season 2016-2017) to 11.4% (37/326) (2018-2019). A significant higher seropositivity was observed during the hunting season 2018-2019 (p < 0.009: OR = 3.07; 95% CI = 1.32-7.18) and one statistically significant cluster was detected within the studied area, in south central Andalusia [Relative Risk (RR) = 2.9; p = 0.037]. Females showed a significantly higher seroprevalence than males (8.7% vs. 5.8%) (p < 0.001: OR = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.08-2.32). No seropositivity to Trichinella spp. was detected in Iberian domestic pigs (0.0%; 95% CI: 0.0-0.9).Conclusions Although wild boar play an important role as a reservoir of Trichinella sp. in the Mediterranean ecosystems of southwestern Spain, our results suggest that the wild boar production system does not seem to pose a risk of Trichinella exposure to domestic pigs, despite sharing habitats in these ecosystems.

AB  - Purpose Intensive livestock grazing has been associated with an increased risk of soil erosion and concomitant negative impacts on the ecological status of watercourses. Whilst various mitigation options are promoted for reducing livestock impacts, there is a paucity of data on the relationship between stocking rates and quantified sediment losses. This evidence gap means there is uncertainty regarding the cost-benefit of policy preferred best management. Methods Sediment yields from 15 hydrologically isolated field scale catchments on a heavily instrumented ruminant livestock farm in the south west UK were investigated over similar to 26 months spread across 6 years. Sediment yields were compared to cattle and sheep stocking rates on long-term, winter (November-April), and monthly timescales. The impacts of livestock on soil vegetation cover and bulk density were also examined. Cattle were tracked using GPS collars to determine how grazing related to soil damage. Results No observable impact of livestock stocking rates of 0.15-1.00 UK livestock units (LU) ha(-1) for sheep, and 0-0.77 LU ha(-1) for cattle on sediment yields was observed at any of the three timescales. Cattle preferentially spent time close to specific fences where soils were visually damaged. However, there was no indication that livestock have a significant effect on soil bulk density on a field scale. Livestock were housed indoors during winters when most rainfall occurs, and best management practices were used which when combined with low erodibility clayey soils likely limited sediment losses. Conclusion A combination of clayey soils and soil trampling in only a small proportion of the field areas lead to little impact from grazing livestock. Within similar landscapes with best practice livestock grazing management, additional targeted measures to reduce erosion are unlikely to yield a significant cost-benefit.

AB  - The ecology and evolution of reproductive timing and synchrony have been a topic of great interest in evolutionary ecology for decades. Originally motivated by questions related to behavioral and reproductive adaptation to environmental conditions, the topic has acquired new relevance in the face of climate change. However, there has been relatively little research on reproductive phenology in mammalian carnivores. The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) occurs across the Eurasian continent, covering three of the four main climate regions of the world. Thus, their distribution includes a large variation in climatic conditions, making it an ideal species to explore reproductive phenology. Here, we used data on multiple reproductive events from 169 lynx females across Europe. Mean birth date was May 28 (April 23 to July 1), but was similar to 10 days later in northern Europe than in central and southern Europe. Birth dates were relatively synchronized across Europe, but more so in the north than in the south. Timing of birth was delayed by colder May temperatures. Severe and cold weather may affect neonatal survival via hypothermia and avoiding inclement weather early in the season may select against early births, especially at northern latitudes. Overall, only about half of the kittens born survived until onset of winter but whether kittens were born relatively late or early did not affect kitten survival. Lynx are strict seasonal breeders but still show a degree of flexibility to adapt the timing of birth to surrounding environmental conditions. We argue that lynx give birth later when exposed to colder spring temperatures and have more synchronized births when the window of favorable conditions for raising kittens is shorter. This suggests that lynx are well adapted to different environmental conditions, from dry and warm climates to alpine, boreal, and arctic climates. This variation in reproductive timing will be favorable in times of climate change, as organisms with high plasticity are more likely to adjust to new environmental conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary We used camera traps to survey wild mammals in a portion of western Thailand and recorded 32 species, 17 of which were IUCN-listed from Near Threatened to Critically Endangered. Of all photo-captures, 4 species comprised 62%, and several species were captured only rarely. This area holds a rich community of mammals, but some differences in photo-rates from an adjacent sanctuary and comparisons with other research on local mammals suggest that some species were missed because of their rarity and the limitations of the technique used. The Thung Yai Naresuan (East) Wildlife Sanctuary (TYNE), in the core area of the Western Forest Complex of Thailand, harbors a diverse assemblage of wildlife, and the region has become globally significant for mammal conservation. From April 2010 to January 2012, 106 camera traps were set, and, in 1817 trap-nights, registered 1821 independent records of 32 mammal species. Of the 17 IUCN-listed (from Near Threatened to Critically Endangered) mammal species recorded, 5 species listed as endangered or critically endangered included the Asiatic elephant (Elephas maximus), tiger (Panthera tigris), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), and Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica). The northern red muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis), large Indian civet (Viverra zibetha), Malayan porcupine (Hystrix brachyuran), and sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) were the most frequently recorded species (10-22 photos/100 trap-nights), representing 62% of all independent records, while the golden jackal (Canis aureus), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata), and Sunda pangolin were the least photographed (<0.1/100 trap-nights). Species accumulation curves indicated that the number of camera trap locations needed to record 90% of taxa recorded varied from 26 sites for herbivores to 67 sites for all mammals. TYNE holds a rich community of mammals, but some differences in photo-rates from an adjacent sanctuary and comparisons with other research on local mammals suggest that some species are rare and some are missed because of the limitations of our technique. We also conclude that the management and conservation plan, which involves the exclusion of human activities from some protected areas and strict protection efforts in the sanctuaries, is still suitable for providing key habitats for endangered wildlife populations, and that augmented and regular survey efforts will help in this endeavor.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a non-native, invasive species that cause considerable damage and transmit a variety of diseases to livestock, people, and wildlife. We explored Twitter, the most popular social media micro-blogging platform, to demonstrate how social media data can be leveraged to investigate social identity and sentiment toward wild pigs. In doing so, we employed a sophisticated machine learning approach to investigate: (1) the overall sentiment associated with the dataset, (2) online identities via user profile descriptions, and (3) the extent to which sentiment varied by online identity. Results indicated that the largest groups of online identity represented in our dataset were females and people whose occupation was in journalism and media communication. While the majority of our data indicated a negative sentiment toward wild pigs and other related search terms, users who identified with agriculture-related occupations had more favorable sentiment. Overall, this article is an important starting point for further investigation of the use of social media data and social identity in the context of wild pigs and other invasive species.

AB  - Kelps are ecosystem engineers, which collectively form forests that provide a variety of important ecosystem services for humans and other organisms. Kelp forests are threatened by multiple local and global stressors, one of the most notable is herbivory. Overabundant sea; urchins can consume kelp, leading to a phase shift from productive forests to unproductive; rocky barrens. Reducing sea urchin densities by directly removing them can reverse this; phase shift. However, maintaining low densities of sea urchins, is logistically and financially; challenging. Following a review of herbivore exclusion methods to date, we tested the efficacy of three different methods for excluding sea urchins from kelp in the laboratory: flexible fences; electricity; and copper anti-fouling paint. The results from the laboratory; experiment showed that flexible fencing was the most successful method for excluding sea urchins. To test the efficacy of this method in the field, sea urchins were removed from 1m(2) patches in barrens and intact kelp beds, and the effectiveness of flexible fences of two different heights (30 cm and 60 cm) at excluding sea urchins were tested. The results from the field study demonstrated that flexible fences of both heights were effective at maintaining low sea urchin densities in barrens but not in intact kelp beds, relative to unmanipulated; rocky barrens. These findings suggest that flexible fencing could be an important tool in restoring kelp in barrens, however the costs of fencing are likely to place limits on the scale at which this management strategy can be implemented.

AB  - PremisePlant traits and insect herbivory have been highly studied within the modern record but only to a limited extent within the paleontological. Preservation influences what can be measured within the fossil record, but modern methods are also not compatible with paleobotanical methods. To remedy this knowledge gap, a comparable framework was created here using modern and paleobotanical methods, allowing for future comparisons within the fossil record.MethodsInsect feeding damage on selected tree species at Harvard Forest, the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, and La Selva were characterized using the damage type system prevalent within paleobotanical studies and compared with leaf traits. Linear models and random forest analyses tested the influence of leaf traits on total, specialized, gall, and mine frequency and diversity.ResultsStructural traits like leaf dry mass per area and palatability traits, including lignin and phosphorus concentrations, are important variables affecting gall and mine damage. The significance and strength of trait-herbivory relationships varied across forest types, which is likely driven by differences in local insect populations.ConclusionsThis work addresses the persistent gap between modern and paleoecological studies focusing on the influence of leaf traits on insect herbivory. This is important as modern climate change alters our understanding of plant-insect interactions, providing a need for contextualizing these relationships within evolutionary time. The fossil record provides information on terrestrial response to past climatic events and, thus, should be implemented when considering how to preserve biodiversity under current and future global change.

AB  - Purpose The tick-borne protozoa piroplasms, including Theileria and Babesia, are the cause of substantial economic losses to the livestock industry. However, in southern Qinghai province, China, there are limited information on the molecular characteristics of piroplasms. This study therefore aimed at determining the prevalence and genetic diversity of piroplasms. Methods In order to detect piroplasms, we examined 330 yaks and 236 Tibetan sheep blood samples by nested PCR. The differences in piroplasms prevalence in relation to different risk factors was analyzed using SPSS 26. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA sequences was inferred using MEGA 7. Results During this study, Theileria spp. were detected in 33.6% (111/330) of yaks and 94.1% (222/236) of Tibetan sheep, but no Babesia was identified. Importantly, a comparison study revealed that T. ovis infection was highly prevalent in sheep (94.1%) but infrequent in yaks (6.1%), while T. sinensis was host-specific to yaks with an infection rate of 27.6%. In addition, male animals were more likely to be infected by T. sinensis and female animals were more likely to be infected by T. ovis. And animals below 4000 m areas reported a higher infection rate with T. sinensis (26.1% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.001). Alongside these differences in prevalence, we found a significantly higher T. sinensis infection rate in separated-grazing livestock (22.2% vs. 3.7%, p < 0.001), while mixed-grazing ruminants had a higher T. ovis infection rate (50.0% vs. 39.0%, p = 0.014). Furthermore, sequence analysis revealed that the 18S rRNA sequences obtained in this study shared 86.9-100.0% identities with each other and they were clustered into T. sinensis or T. ovis. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first report of T. sinensis in Qinghai region. In addition, high prevalence of the generally sub-clinical T. ovis in sheep indicates extensive exposure to ticks and transmission of tick-borne pathogens with a significant economic impact. This study provides insights into the distribution and genetic diversity of Theileria in China.

AB  - Scavengers benefit from carrion and simultaneously provide essential ecosystem services. To assess benefits and risks that carrion might bring, it is crucial to understand ecosystem -specific scavenger communities. Carrion research has mostly focussed on ungulate carcasses and has rarely explored the effects of carnivore carcasses, which can be critical to understanding disease transmission pathways. Therefore, using red fox, roe deer and red deer carcasses, we investigated factors that affect facultative vertebrate scavenger assemblages visiting carnivore and herbivore carcasses in a temperate forest ecosystem. Due to potentially increased disease transmission risk associated with carnivore carrion, we predicted that carnivore carcasses would be visited less and have a reduced visiting species composition compared to herbivore carcasses. Further, we expected red foxes to exhibit less consumption behavior of conspecific carcasses. We placed 22 red fox and 22 herbivore carcasses in a temperate montane protected area in Central Europe, the Bavarian Forest National Park, and analyzed the visits of all species and the consumption behavior of red fox at carcasses to understand whether these depended on carcass type. We found no significant effects of carcass type on visitation rates, visiting species composition, or red fox behavior. Cannibalism of foxes was common and, when controlling for confounding factors, e.g., elevation, temperature, and scavenging seasonality, the predicted consumption rate of red fox at conspecifics was higher than at herbivore carrion. Foxes appeared to consume conspecifics earlier than herbivore carrion, but the difference was not significant. At the very least, our results show that carnivore carcasses and fox behavior, including cannibalism, could provide a pathway for disease transmission. We thereby provide a first impression of the patterns of vertebrate scavenger assemblages at different carcass types in a temperate ecosystem and show that red fox behavior might precipitate a disease transmission pathway.

AB  - This study focuses on the Siberian roe deer population in the Greater Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. The cold temperate forest ecosystem in this area is distinctive. The Siberian roe deer is a crucial ecological indicator species, and its living conditions hold significant importance for ecological balance. From the winter of 2019 to 2022, 269 fecal samples of Siberian roe deer were collected from four protected areas in the northern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains, Heilongjiang Province. These samples were comprehensively analyzed using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers, combined with conservation genetics evaluation methods. The results revealed that 244 individuals were identified in the fecal samples. The results of a Cyt b genetic analysis of the samples indicated that the haplotype and nucleotide diversity were 88.1% and 20.3%, respectively. The evaluation of 14 pairs of microsatellite loci showed that the average number of alleles was 11.2, and the average expected and observed heterozygosity were 0.672 and 0.506, respectively. Therefore, the overall genetic diversity level is high, but some populations of Siberian roe deer are at risk. AMOVA analysis and STRUCTURE Bayesian clustering confirmed the existence of obvious genetic differentiation among the populations. Historical studies have shown that the HZ and SH populations underwent the earliest diffusion events, and the BJC and SL populations also exhibited related signs (HZ: Huzhong Nature Reserve in the Greater Khingan Mountains; SH: Shuanghe National Nature Reserve in Heilongjiang Province; BJC: Heilongjiang Beijicun National Nature Reserve; SL: Songling District in Heilongjiang Province). Mismatch distribution and neutral tests indicated no expansion events or bottleneck effects in the population, and the inbreeding coefficient was positive, suggesting the possibility of inbreeding. The development potential of the population in the future varies among the various local populations. This study supports the biodiversity of Siberian roe deer at the genetic level to save the population and provides important scientific basis and reference for the protection and management of Siberian roe deer.

AB  - Globally, many wild deer populations are actively studied or managed for conservation, hunting, or damage mitigation purposes. These studies require reliable estimates of population state parameters, such as density or abundance, with a level of precision that is fit for purpose. Such estimates can be difficult to attain for many populations that occur in situations that are poorly suited to common survey methods. We evaluated the utility of combining camera trap survey data, in which a small proportion of the sample is individually recognizable using natural markings, with spatial mark-resight (SMR) models to estimate deer density in a variety of situations. We surveyed 13 deer populations comprising four deer species (Cervus unicolor, C. timorensis, C. elaphus, Dama dama) at nine widely separated sites, and used Bayesian SMR models to estimate population densities and abundances. Twelve surveys provided sufficient data for analysis and seven produced density estimates with coefficients of variation (CVs) <= 0.25. Estimated densities ranged from 0.3 to 24.6 deer km(-2). Camera trap surveys and SMR models provided a powerful and flexible approach for estimating deer densities in populations in which many detections were not individually identifiable, and they should provide useful density estimates under a wide range of conditions that are not amenable to more widely used methods. In the absence of specific local information on deer detectability and movement patterns, we recommend that at least 30 cameras be spaced at 500-1,000 m and set for 90 days. This approach could also be applied to large mammals other than deer.

AB  - Despite numerous studies on the rise and fall of terrestrial megafauna in the late Quaternary, knowledge about marine megafauna from this period remains limited. In this study, we performed radiocarbon dating and partial mitochondrial DNA sequencing from the skeletal remains of three species of small odontocetes (Pacific white-sided dolphins, Dall's porpoises and harbour porpoises) excavated from prehistoric archaeological sites around the Japanese shore dating back to 8500-1000 years ago (ya). Pacific white-sided dolphins that habituated the eastern coast of Hokkaido around 2000 ya belonged to different maternal groups than those from over 5000 ya and today. Furthermore, the species composition excavated from eastern Hokkaido sites varies between 5000 and 2000 ya. These findings suggest two significant population turnovers of small odontocetes on the east coast of Hokkaido, a transitional zone between the coastal area of East Asia and the offshore North Pacific. Notably, the first turnover, occurring between 5000 and 2000 ya, represents the oldest evidence of local population turnovers of marine megafauna during the late Quaternary.

AB  - Long's (Braya longii Fernald) and Fernald's (B. fernaldii Abbe) Braya are endemic to the Great Northern Peninsula of Newfound-land, Canada. These herbaceous perennials are endangered due to habitat loss and degradation, as well as ongoing threats from fungal infections and insect herbivory. While recovery plans are being implemented, the identity of pathogenic fungi and their origins remain largely unknown. This study was initiated to describe the associated fungal community and infection symptoms. Plant tissues from three populations were sampled over 5 years yielding 326 fungal isolates identified primarily by nucleotide sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer rDNA region. Isolates included 36 taxa, 16 of which were detected once and 5 detected three times or less. In contrast, 12 taxa were detected across multiple sites, sampling intervals and years. These included two species of Alternaria, Boeremia exigua, closely related species of the Didymellaceae, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium sp., Colletotrichum sp., Stagonosporopsis sp., Pleospora sp., and Truncatella angustata. Some common taxa showed seasonal trends. The isolated fungi included known pathogens of Brassicaceae. The plants in this study frequently showed symptoms indicative of fungal infection and insect herbivory. These findings improve our knowledge of Braya endophyte communities and will inform recovery efforts for these endangered species.

AB  - Caribbean coral reefs face unprecedented decline due to anthropogenic and environmental stressors, necessitating active restoration efforts. Among the strategies to conserve and restore reef ecosystems, land-based sexual propagation of corals is crucial for preserving genetic diversity and population resilience. This study explores the efficacy of utilizing native sea urchin herbivory to control benthic macroalgal proliferation and enhance coral growth in land-based propagation systems. Three captive-reared urchin species-Lytechinus variegatus, Tripneustes ventricosus, and Diadema antillarum-were evaluated for their influence on algal cover and growth of sexually propagated brain coral Pseudodiploria strigosa. Juveniles of each urchin species were co-cultured with 6-month-old coral colonies over a 105-day experiment. Results indicated that all urchin treatments effectively reduced algal cover compared to controls; however, only T. ventricosus significantly increased coral growth rate, while the other urchin species did not have a notable effect. Despite differences in growth, coral survival was consistently high across all treatments. Benthic community analysis revealed shifts in algal composition, with D. antillarum grazing associated with increased crustose coralline algae. However, overgrazing by D. antillarum may have resulted in mild peripheral tissue damage to some corals. Urchin survival remained high, suggesting potential for downstream utilization in restoration (e.g. urchin population enhancement). This study highlights the potential of native urchins as biocontrol agents in coral propagation, emphasizing the importance of species-specific interactions in shaping benthic communities and promoting coral resilience.

AB  - Water quality models are an emerging tool in water management to understand and inform decisions related to eutrophication. This study tested flow scenario effects on the water quality of Buffalo Pound Lake-a eutrophic reservoir supplying water for approximately 25% of Saskatchewan's population. The model CE-QUAL-W2 was applied to assess the impact of inter-basin water diversion after the impounded lake received high inflows from local runoff. Three water diversion scenarios were tested: continuous flow, immediate release after nutrient loading increased, and a timed release initiated when water levels returned to normal operating range. Each scenario was tested at three different transfer flow rates. The transfers had a dilution effect but did not affect the timing of the nutrient peaks in the upstream portion of the lake. In the lake's downstream section, nutrients peaked at similar concentrations as the base model, but peaks arrived earlier in the season and attenuated rapidly. Results showed greater variation among scenarios in wet years compared to dry years. Dependent on the timing and quantity of water transferred, some but not all water quality parameters are predicted to improve along with the water diversion flows over the period tested. The results suggest that it is optimal to transfer water while local watershed runoff is minimal.

AB  - Reductions in gene flow due to anthropogenic habitat fragmentation are often associated with reduced genetic diversity and increased population structuring in wildlife populations. We assessed fine-scale population structure and landscape factors influencing gene flow in threatened boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) based on genotypes for 337 individuals sampled at the southern extent of their distribution in Ontario. The impact of isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by resistance (IBR) on gene flow was examined using resistance surface optimization and linear mixed-effects modelling. Genetic clustering algorithms failed to identify a biologically meaningful pattern of population substructure, consistent with the observed weak genetic differentiation of individuals across the study area. Although the inferred optimum resistance scenario differed based on the choice of genetic distance metric, roads were consistently included in the top resistance models. While our results support a growing body of evidence indicating a negative influence of roads on gene flow in woodland caribou, future studies are recommended to validate these finding given the conservation implications for this iconic boreal species.

AB  - Both ageing and insect damage by Holcocerus hippophaecolusled to the reduction of hydraulic efficiency, hydraulic safety and xylem embolism repair capacity of aged sea-buckthorn, which constrained the photosynthesis and root carbon storage. Insect damage further deteriorated water status and carbon shortage, and similarly limited root growth and weakened the trees. Also, the capacity of xylem embolism repair was closely related to the cell viability of branches. Results indicated that poor water status and reduced carbon supply in roots would affect the survival of aged and moth-damaged sea-buckthorn under adverse conditions.
   Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is widely distributed across the Eurasian continent. Recently sea-buckthorn has shown premature ageing and decline when confronted with water deficiency and Holcocerus hippophaecolus damage in northwest China and the Loess Plateau region. However, the physiological process of sea-buckthorn senescence in response to drought and pest damage is still unknown. In this study, 4-year-old (4y), 15-year-old normal growth (15yN) and 15-year-old seriously moth-damaged sea-buckthorn plants (15yH) were used as the research objects. The growth of branches and roots, branch water potential and percentage loss of conductivity (PLC), branch vulnerability to embolism (quantified by P-50, xylem water potential at 50 % of PLC), branch xylem parenchyma cell viability, photosynthesis and the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) content in branches and roots in dry and wet seasons were measured. The results showed that the length, basal diameter of 1-year-old branches and the leaf area of 4y trees were significantly larger than that of 15yN and 15yH trees, and the fine root density of 15yH trees was significantly lower than that of 15yN trees in all measured areas. The branch-specific hydraulic conductivity of 15yN and 15yH trees was only 50.2 % and 12.3 % of that of 4y trees, and the P-50 of 4y, 15yH and 15yN trees was -3.69 MPa, -2.71 MPa and -1.15 MPa, respectively. The midday water potential and photosynthetic rate were highest in 4y trees, followed by 15yN and then 15yH trees in both the dry season and wet seasons, while branch PLC declined in the opposite direction (15yH trees highest, 4y trees lowest). The degree of PLC repair within a day was highest in 4y trees, followed by 15yN and then 15yH trees, and the viability of xylem cells was consistent with this pattern. The branch xylem starch and NSC content of 4y and 15yN trees were significantly higher than that of 15yH trees in the dry season, and the root starch and NSC content of 4y trees were significantly higher than that of 15yH trees in the two seasons. The above results suggest that the hydraulic properties of the normal elderly and seriously pest-damaged sea-buckthorn were significantly worse than in juvenile plants. Narrower early wood width and vessel density, high embolism vulnerability and weak embolism repair capacity led to the decline in water-conducting ability, and similarly further affected photosynthesis and the root NSC content. The decline in xylem parenchyma cell viability was the main reason for the limited embolism repair in the branches.

AB  - Context. Human activities in general, and hunting in particular, often have significant impacts on the behaviour of wildlife through the anti-predator behaviours they evoke. Wild boar populations are rapidly expanding worldwide and their population densities are increasing.
   Aims. To examine hunting effects in combination with different land-use factors on the behaviour and social structure of wild boars (Sus scrofa) in Israel. Specifically, to examine differences in vigilant behaviour and social structure in agricultural areas (hunting permitted) and nature reserves (hunting prohibited).
   Methods. Motion-triggered cameras were installed to record wild boars' social structure and vigilance behaviour along movement trails. Age and sex of individual wild boars were identified, as were the size and structure of their social groups, and hunting in each of the studied areas was quantified.
   Key results. Results indicated significant differences in the vigilance behaviour of wild boars between agricultural areas and nature reserves. In agricultural areas, adult females were significantly more vigilant (P < 0.001) compared with adult males (P = 0.150). Additionally, in these areas there were significantly more adult males and fewer females leading family groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, male yearlings were significantly more vigilant in agricultural areas (P < 0.001) compared with female yearlings (P = 0.164). Male yearlings tended to roam significantly more with family groups in agricultural areas compared with nature reserves, where they tended to roam alone or in groups (P = 0.029, P = 0.035).
   Conclusions. These results indicate social and behavioural differences in wild boars between agricultural areas and nature reserves, suggesting that hunting may have a substantial impact on their social structure and behaviour.
   Implications. Overall, the findings support the behavioural and social consequences of human hunting. Long-term implications of altered behavioural and social responses should be considered in management and conservations strategies. For instance, the high proportion of male yearlings in family groups in agricultural areas in autumn (October-December, mating season) may offer young males early access to reproductive females, even within the same social group. This may eventually lead to an increase in the reproductive potential of female wild boars.

AB  - Plant resistance and predators can influence density-dependent survivorship and growth of herbivores, and their damage to plants. Although the independent effects of plant resistance and predators on herbivores and herbivory are well known, little is known about their interactive and density-dependent effects on herbivores and the amount and distribution of damage on plants. These relationships are important for understanding how herbivore and plant populations influence each other. We used a laboratory density-manipulation experiment to determine how plant resistance (three treatments: jasmonate-insensitive, unmanipulated wild type, and jasmonate-sprayed wild-type plants) and predation (two treatments: predator or no predator) affect the survivorship and growth of an herbivore, as well as per capita damage and the distribution of damage on plants. We found evidence that the density dependence of herbivore survivorship was influenced by predators and an interactive effect of plant resistance and predation. Herbivore growth was reduced by higher plant resistance but was not density-dependent nor affected by predation. Per capita plant damage was reduced by plant resistance, predation, and herbivore density. The within-plant distribution of damage became more even with increasing herbivore density but was not affected by predation or the independent effect of plant resistance. The distribution of damage was also affected by an interaction between plant resistance and herbivore density; damage became less aggregated with density across all plant resistance treatments, but the decrease was strongest for the jasmonate-insensitive plants. These results show that predators influence herbivore density dependence, and that plant resistance can affect the impact of predators on herbivores. Though plant resistance, predation, and herbivore density all reduced per capita herbivore damage to plants, only herbivore density and plant resistance affected the distribution of damage. Distributions of herbivory can influence plant success; documenting patterns of herbivory is an under-appreciated avenue for integrating effects of plant resistance, predators, and herbivore density on plant-herbivore interactions.
   Plant resistance and predators can influence survivorship and growth of herbivores, and their damage to plants. We found evidence that the density dependence of herbivore survivorship was influenced by predators and an interactive effect between plant resistance and predation, while herbivore growth was only reduced by plant resistance. Per capita plant damage was reduced by plant resistance, predation, and herbivore density, and plant damage became more even with increasing herbivore density but was not independently influenced by plant resistance or predation.image

AB  - Habitat loss is the greatest contributor to the decline of species globally. To prioritize protection of imperiled species, it is important to examine habitat use at multiple spatial scales because the availability of different resources and habitat features is scale dependent. We conducted a radio-telemetry study in the Long Point region of Ontario, Canada, in 2009 and 2010 to examine habitat selection at multiple spatial scales by eastern hog-nosed snakes (Heterodon platirhinos), a species at risk in Canada. We documented the habitat composition of home ranges compared to the surrounding landscape, the selection of locations within home ranges based on classified satellite imagery, and the use of microhabitat features based on site characterization in the field. At the scale of the home ranges, hog-nosed snakes avoided areas of agriculture and selected sand barrens. Within home ranges, hog-nosed snakes selectively used areas altered by humans (e.g., residential sites, openings in tree plantations). Microhabitats used by hog-nosed snakes had more woody debris, logs, and lower vegetative coverage than adjoining random sites. Because hog-nosed snakes prefer open areas and require sandy soils for nesting, management efforts should focus on the conservation and maintenance of sand barrens and patches of early successional forest.

AB  - Globalization has led to the frequent movement of species out of their native habitat. Some of these species become highly invasive and capable of profoundly altering invaded ecosystems. Feral swine (Sus scrofa x domesticus) are recognized as being among the most destructive invasive species, with populations established on all continents except Antarctica. Within the United States (US), feral swine are responsible for extensive crop damage, the destruction of native ecosystems, and the spread of disease. Purposeful human-mediated movement of feral swine has contributed to their rapid range expansion over the past 30 years. Patterns of deliberate introduction of feral swine have not been well described as populations may be established or augmented through small, undocumented releases. By leveraging an extensive genomic database of 18,789 samples genotyped at 35,141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we used deep neural networks to identify translocated feral swine across the contiguous US. We classified 20% (3364/16,774) of sampled animals as having been translocated and described general patterns of translocation using measures of centrality in a network analysis. These findings unveil extensive movement of feral swine well beyond their dispersal capabilities, including individuals with predicted origins >1000 km away from their sampling locations. Our study provides insight into the patterns of human-mediated movement of feral swine across the US and from Canada to the northern areas of the US. Further, our study validates the use of neural networks for studying the spread of invasive species.

AB  - Anthropogenic nutrient input to coastal waters is one of the most common disturbances within inshore marine benthic communities. Organic enrichment in sediments leads to the reduction or disappearance of sensitive organisms, and influences the quality and quantity of primary producers which serve as food sources for the benthic fauna. Such changes, in turn, affect the energy flow and food-web interactions in benthic communities. To examine how organic enrichment may alter marine benthic trophic relationship, a stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) analysis of the potential food sources and a range of meiofauna and polychaetes from an organically polluted and a relatively unpolluted site was compared in subtropical waters of Hong Kong. Results indicated that some omnivorous infauna shifted from a mainly carnivorous diet at the unpolluted site to a largely herbivorous diet at the organically polluted site. This dietary shift is likely to be related to the oxygen stress, prey limitation and increased abundance and nutritional quality of primary producers in the eutrophic area, resulting in an increase in utilization of plant materials as the major food source. The present findings suggest that such changes in trophic position induced by organic enrichment can provide further insights into the structure and function of coastal benthic communities under pollution stress.

AB  - Aim: Study was carried out to record the abundance and diversity of insects in jasmine (Jasminum sambac L.) ecosystem.
   Methodology: To determine insect pests, natural enemies and non-insect diversity, fortnight observations were taken from second fortnight of September'19 to March'20 on insect population at three adjacent locations. Abundance and diversity indices were computed using mean data. The management practices, presence of weeds and adjacent cropping systems were also recorded at three locations to determine the reasons for variation in the diversity of organisms.
   Results: A total of 3335 individuals arthropods belonging to 55 species, which included 32 species of herbivores and 23 species of natural enemies were recorded throughout the study period. Location 3 had perennial crops in the vicinity, un-weeded ecosystem with no chemical inputs. Among various diversity indices calculated, Margalef Richness Index of herbivores was higher at location 3 (1.67) than location 1 (1.17) and 2 (0.76). Interpretation: The abundance and diversity of insects in different jasmine ecosystem depends on the chemical inputs and adjacent cropping system.

AB  - Predator-prey interactions are important for regulating populations and structuring communities but are affected by many dynamic, complex factors across large scales, making them difficult to study. Integrated population models (IPMs) offer a potential solution to understanding predator-prey relationships by providing a framework for leveraging many different datasets and testing hypotheses about interactive factors. Here, we evaluate the coyote-deer (Canis latrans-Odocoileus virginianus) predator-prey relationship across the state of North Carolina (NC). Because both species have similar habitat requirements and may respond to human disturbance, we considered net primary productivity (NPP) and urbanization as key mediating factors. We estimated deer survival and fecundity by integrating camera trap, harvest, and biological and hunter observation datasets into a two-stage, two-sex Lefkovich population projection matrix. We allowed survival and fecundity to vary as functions of urbanization, NPP, and coyote density, and projected abundance forward to test eight hypothetical scenarios. We estimated initial average deer and coyote densities to be 11.83 (95% CI: 5.64, 20.80) and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.02, 1.45) individuals/km2, respectively. We found a negative, though highly uncertain, relationship between the current levels of coyote density and deer fecundity in most areas that became more negative under hypothetical conditions of lower NPP or higher urbanization, leading to lower projected deer abundances. Though not conclusive, our results indicate the possibility that coyotes could have stronger effects on deer populations in NC if their densities rise, but primarily in less productive and/or more suburban habitats. Our case study provides an example of how IPMs can be used to better understand the complex relationships between predator and prey under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - By studying the host-selection patterns of oxpecker species, researchers can gain valuable insights into their ecological roles and interactions with different host species. This information is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies that prioritise the protection of oxpeckers and their host populations. The study conducted field observations and recorded data on the number of oxpeckers and their respective host species. Additionally, this study investigated the relationship between host species and host parameters (body mass and hair length) in the Salambala conservancy in northeastern Namibia. Selection and density indices were used to calculate the number of host animals supporting one oxpecker as well as the oxpecker density on a host's body surface. Pentad-based counts of oxpeckers and ungulates were conducted. Of the observed oxpeckers, 75% were Red-billed and 25% Yellow-billed Oxpeckers. These findings suggest that Red-billed Oxpeckers ( Buphagus erythrorhynchus) are more commonly found on host species than Yellow-billed Oxpeckers ( Buphagus africanus). The selection index indicates that Red-billed Oxpeckers have a higher preference for impala ( Aepyceros melampus) compared to cattle ( Bos taurus), while Yellow-billed Oxpeckers show a lower preference for goats ( Capra aegagrus hircus) compared to cattle. The selection indices for impala and cattle for both oxpecker species were highest during the wet season. In terms of correlation analysis, there were no significant correlations between selection and density indices and host hair length or speciestypical body mass.

AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council developed the concept of High Conservation Values (HCVs) as a criteria in the forest certification process in order to promote sustainable forest management. It has six major components or values and component one and two of HCVs deal with the habitat for viable populations of "rare, endemic and threatened (RET) species" using the IUCN Red List category and other national / regional / local lists. But a consistent robust methodology for identification of these areas, does not exist. The present study tried to develop for the first time, a straight forward inclusive methodology for identification of HCVAs for the RET species on a spatio-temporal scale. A total of 50 RET and other significant species (32 flora, 10 fauna and 8 avifauna) were identified after a thorough literature review, field surveys and consultations with experts. Occurrence data of the selected species was collected from different secondary sources, field surveys, institutes and scientists who have worked on them. A 10 km grid-based approach and stratified random sampling was used for the primary GPS field surveys conducted during 2018-2019. MaxEnt species distribution model (SDM) software was used based on the occurrence data and environmental variables for identification of potential suitable habitats for the selected species. Linear support vector machine (LSVM) model was used for assessing the performance of the SDMs. The performance of each SDM has been validated through Cohen's Kappa (KAPPA), true skill statistic (TSS) and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) models. The proposed methodology addresses the urgent need for a holistic and robust set of techniques to apply the HCV toolkit. This is key to identify and map HCVAs for RET species at the landscape level and can be easily adapted to and adopted at the national, regional, state or local level in India. The methods offer an efficient, reliable approach for the application of the HCV concept, elsewhere in the world.

AB  - The ecosystems of the Arctic Ocean and their expected changes in a context of Global climate processes are crucially dependent on the freshwater input. The freshwater signal is assumed to be the main structuring factor for the marine fauna on the shallow shelf of the Siberian Arctic seas. The Laptev Sea, as a part of the world's widest continental shelves surrounding the Arctic Ocean, is a key area for understanding the land-ocean interaction in high latitude regions. The largest freshwater input is provided by the deltaic Lena river followed by the estuarine Khatanga river. The plumes of these rivers differ considerably in their hydrophysical characteristics, suggesting differential impacts on ecosystems of the adjacent shelf. The key component of pelagic ecosystems is zooplankton, which transfers energy from primary producers to higher trophic levels and modifies sedimentations processes. This study is focused on the influence of river discharge on zooplankton in the Laptev Sea at the end of productive season. We studied zooplankton biomass, species composition, distribution patterns of the dominant species and assessed herbivorous feeding rates and grazing pressure of these species along a transect from the inner Khatanga Gulf northward to the continental slope, and a transect in the Lena plume influenced area in August-September 2017. Despite large spatial extension of the Khatanga plume, the impact of river discharge on zooplankton species composition was restricted mainly to the inner Gulf where the brackish species shaped the community. Contrary to the Khatanga input, the Lena freshwater inflow was highly variable and under certain conditions (discharge rate, wind forcing) governed the structure of zooplankton community over a vast shelf area. Distribution patterns of zooplankton biomass, ingestion rates and grazing impact of the dominant species on phytoplankton over the shelf influenced by the Khatanga and Lena plumes were similar. Analysis of our results on demographic structure of Calanus glacialis suggests that seasonal development of the population was largely controlled by the time of ice retreat. Observed climatic changes in the Arctic were not reflected in the total zooplankton biomass and composition of the dominant species.

AB  - The long-term coexistence of sympatric species is dependent on segregation in at least one of three niche dimensions: space, time or feeding habits. Hunting by people can influence species' temporal and spatial patterns and consequently affect their coexistence. We tested the hypothesis that hunting influences spatial and temporal patterns of coexistence of two sympatric deer species (Mazama americana and Mazama nemorivaga) in central Amazonia. We described deer hunting patterns using data from an 18-year community-based hunting monitoring program and predicted the spatial distribution of deer hunting trips. We used camera traps to (1) estimate the habitat use patterns of each species through conditional occupancy, (2) evaluate whether these species interact and (3) assess how modelled hunting intensity affects deer habitat occupancy. We also tested the temporal overlap of activity time between both species and hunters. We did not find evidence of hunting effects on occupancy and interaction, nor of spatial segregation among the deer species. M. americana was primarily nocturnal and M. nemorivaga primarily diurnal. The overlap between species' temporal activities was relatively low, suggesting temporal niche segregation between species. Hunting activity was mainly diurnal and overlapped with M. nemorivaga active hours. However, we found that M. americana was more frequently hunted than M. nemorivaga. The probability of daytime activity was not influenced by hunting intensity. Temporal segregation, with asynchrony of activity periods, seems to be the mechanism behind the coexistence of M. americana and M. nemorivaga in Central Amazonia. The absence of hunting effects on brocket deer species in our study area suggests a low impact of harvest on both species' behaviour. This indicates that contexts of low human density and large extensions of pristine forests can enable hunted brocket deer populations to be sustained through source-sink dynamics.

AB  - Until recently, the Kara Sea was a relatively stable ecosystem unaffected by alien species, but in the early 21st century, the Arctic shelf was invaded by the snow crab Chionoecetes opilio. This predator has a wide dietary range and can feed on echinoderms, especially ophiuras, mollusks, polychaetes, and crustaceans. This article reports data on the study of benthic communities of the southwestern Kara Sea, based on the materials collected in 2014 and 2019 (before and after the mass appearance of the snow crab). The period of 2014-2019 was marked by significant changes in the structure of benthic communities, while abiotic parameters (near-bottom temperature, salinity, and sediment characteristics) remained almost constant at the investigated stations. The most significant changes affected the megafauna. The total megabenthos abundance and biomass decreased, the abundance of dominant species also reduced, and the species structure became more even. Most likely, the observed transformation of the benthic communities is related to the establishment of the snow crab, the most affected were dominant benthic species which are the main prey items of this crab.

AB  - Herbivorous and detritivorous fish display complex feeding behaviour, and research into how feeding behaviour changes with environmental and social variables is lacking. Such knowledge is imperative to infer how herbivory/detritivory will differ, in light of shifting resources and communities and specifically whether reefs can recover from disturbance. Fish abundance, feeding rate, body size, diet and schooling feeding of three major functional groups (scrapers, grazers and browsers) were examined across reef types under different fishing regulations. Scrapers and grazers (parrotfishes and surgeonfishes) were more abundant and displayed the highest feeding rates on reef flats. Scrapers mainly resided inside the restricted zone, while more grazers were found in the general use zone, where macroalgal abundance was highest. Browsers (rabbitfishes) were seldom observed and patchily gathered on the reef flat and reef slope in both zones. Thus, fishing protection did not appear to benefit grazers and browsers, whereas more scrapers gathered on shallow reef flats in the protection zone. Scraper and grazer feeding rates increased from an individual to a pair and increased with body size, these factors led to variations in feeding behaviours across reef types and protection regulations. Protection appears to benefit scrapers and variations in feeding rates were largely related to school size. Lastly, grazer density was associated more with macroalgal coverage than protection status. The opposite feeding behaviours of scrapers and grazers indicates not only protection status, but fishing restrictions and size limit regulations are needed to maintain coral reef fisheries and functional diversity on coral reefs in Taiwan.

AB  - In Scotland, large deer populations are associated with negative ecological and socioeconomic impacts, such as damage to peatlands and forests, agricultural and commercial forestry losses, Lyme disease transmission, and road accidents. Increasing the annual deer cull might help address these negative impacts, but could be ethically controversial. A stratified sample of adults living in Scotland (n = 1,002) responded to our online questionnaire measuring perceptions of deer management, including the acceptability of increasing the deer cull if doing so would help achieve a variety of ecological and social objectives. Overall, respondents indicated that it would be acceptable to increase the deer cull if doing so would serve public interests by reducing negative impacts of deer, with deer welfare, environmental conservation, and public health and safety being the most relevant ethical considerations. Although rural and urban respondents reported significantly different experiences and perceptions of deer, their values (i.e., attitudes, beliefs, and policy preferences) regarding deer management were very similar. Understanding values of the general public, beyond vocal interest groups, can help inform decisions on contentious wildlife management issues.

AB  - The elevated levels of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in livestock manure represent a significant threat to both the environment and human health. Composting has been recognized as an effective strategy to mitigate the abundance of ARGs in manure. However, notable rebounds in ARGs abundance have been observed during this process. This study explored the changes in ARGs abundance and the underlying influencing factors during the composting of carnivore (chicken and pig) and herbivore (sheep and cow) manures, along with mushroom residues. The findings revealed that the total relative abundance of ARGs increased by 6.96 and 10.94 folds in chicken and pig manure composts, respectively, whereas it decreased by a remarkable 91.72% and 98.37% in sheep and cow manure composts. Nitrogen content emerged as the primary physicochemical factors governing the abundance of ARGs in chicken and pig manure composts. Conversely, carbon content played a pivotal role in determining ARGs abundance in chicken and pig manure composts. Furthermore, the presence of dominant hosts, such as Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and Clostridium, along with emerging bacteria like Thermobifida, Saccharomonospora, and Actinomadura, contributed significantly to the enrichment of total ARGs, including tetG, tetO, tetX, and sul2, in chicken and pig manure composts. The coexistence of these genes with mobile genetic elements and a plethora of host bacteria, coupled with their high abundance, renders them particularly high-risk ARGs. On the other hand, the observed decrease in the abundance of total ARGs in sheep and cow manure composts can be attributed to the decline in the population of host bacteria, specifically Atopostipes, Psychrobacter, and Corynebacterium. Collectively, these results provide crucial insights into the management of ARGs risks and offer essential theoretical support for enhancing the safe utilization of organic fertilizer in agriculture.

AB  - In North America, lodgepole pine is frequently subjected to attacks by various biotic agents that compromise its ability to defend against subsequent attacks by insect herbivores. We investigated whether infections of lodgepole pine by different pathogenic fungal species have varying effects on its defense chemistry. We selected two common pathogens, Atropellis canker, Atropellis piniphila, and western gall rust, Endocronartium harknessii, affecting mature lodgepole pine trees in western Canada. We also included three ophiostomatoid fungi Grosmannia clavigera, Ophiostoma montium, and Leptographium longiclavatum associated with the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), because they are commonly used to investigate induced defenses of host trees of bark beetles. We collected phloem samples from lodgepole pines infected with the rust or the canker and healthy lodgepole pines in the same stand. We also inoculated mature lodgepole pines with the three fungal symbionts and collected phloem samples 2 weeks later when the defense chemistry was at its highest level. Different fungal species differentially altered the terpene chemistry of lodgepole pine trees. E. harknessii and the fungal symbionts altered the terpene chemistry in a similar pattern while trees responded to the infection by the A. piniphila differently. Our study highlights the importance of considering specific biotic stress agents in tree susceptibility or resistance to the subsequent attacks by insect herbivores, such as mountain pine beetle.

AB  - Human responses to alterations caused by wildlife in human livelihoods depend on psychological and cultural factors, in addition to tangible factors. The ideas of transforming the discourse of conflict into a vision of coexistence, as well as of promoting a dialogue between science and ancestral knowledge, have been increasingly valued in biodiversity conservation. In ten communities of the Arhuaco people (Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia), we qualitatively explored the role of the jaguar (Panthera onca) and its main prey (deer, peccary and paca) in the Arhuaco cosmovision (vision and interpretation of the world and cosmos) as well as how these people interpret and manage the alterations caused by these species on their livelihood from a cultural perspective. We also evaluated quantitatively their cognitive, affective, and behavioral attitudes towards coexistence with these species. Our findings show that attitudes towards coexistence with the jaguar and its main prey were significantly more positive among those who have been affected by wildlife (i.e., livestock depredation and crop consumption) or who, according to their occupation (ranchers-farmers), have a higher risk of being affected. These attitudes could be better understood in light of the principles of the Arhuaco cosmovision, that have a profoundly ecological ethic, in which the jaguar plays a primordial role in the spiritual, cosmogonic, and natural order. Guaranteeing the protection of Arhuaco culture and territory could be very valuable for the conservation of the jaguar and biodiversity in the ecoregion of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.

AB  - While studies often focus on density-dependent responses of ungulate populations to resource limitations at large spatial scales, the dynamics at smaller scales remain relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we investigated the temporal dynamics of ungulate abundance in a small dystrophic grassland ecosystem over 20 years, with minimal management interventions. We used annual counts and herd composition data to explore density-dependent responses at the population level and attempt to link such responses to demographic mechanisms. Counts were corrected using a state-space modeling approach. Populations of most species increased from low densities to approximate equilibrium densities. Our findings reveal evidence of density-dependent responses in population growth that shaped the population abundance dynamics. Additionally, juvenile-to-adult ratios exhibited patterns of density-dependent reductions in recruitment. This study suggests grassland ecosystems with moderate annual rainfall are regulated primarily by bottom-up processes.

AB  - The short-term effects of soil amendments on the structure, diversity and function of a nematode community of Miscanthus x giganteus was investigated. Crop was cultivated on marginal, nutrient-poor land amended with biochar in single and double doses (BD1 and BD2), biogas digestate (D), sewage sludge (SS), and hemicellulose waste (HW). Sampling was done after planting, in the middle and end of vegetation; morphology-based approach was used. 28 nematode taxa were identified, including 5 bacterivores genera, 4 fungivores genera, 5 herbivores genera (11 species), 2 omnivores genera, 5 predators genera. The general linear models, correspondence analysis and clustering were applied for evaluation. The total abundance of nematode taxa Filenchus, Dorylaimus, Cephalobus, Panagrolaimus, Aphelenchus, and Ditylenchus was depended on the sampling time and amendments. The incorporation of amendments affected nematode food web and resulted in suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs). It was revealed that community structure was more mature for SS, less stable for D and had inconclusive effects for BD1, BD2, and HW. Using amendments ensured pest control benefits which is important given concern that PPNs can inflict crop damage during increased cultivation of M x g. Further research is needed to examine amendments which can minimise PPNs without reducing populations of nitrogen-fixing bacterivores and fungivores.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have major negative effects on marine life across phylogenetic groups. Cephalopods, however, have life history characteristics that suggest they may benefit from certain climate change scenarios. Of all cephalopods, squids reach the greatest biomasses; as a result, they are of substantial importance for human and predator consumption. To test the hypothesis that the effects of climate change are beneficial for commercial squid, we used species distribution models on climate scenarios for the period between 2000 and 2014, as well as the years 2050 and 2100 (RCP [representative concentration pathway] 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5; CMIP5). Our results suggest that consequences of climate change scenarios are species specific. In the North Pacific and Northwest Atlantic, squid's habitat suitability may increase (from + 0.83% [Doryteuthis pealeii] to + 8.77% increase [Illex illecebrosus]), while it is predicted to decrease in other regions (from - 1.03% [Doryteuthis opalescens] to - 15.04% decrease [Loligo reynaudii]). Increases in habitat suitability occurred mostly at higher latitudes (north of 50 & DEG; N), while suitable habitat decrease was predicted for the tropical regions. These shifts in future habitat suitability were stronger under harsher emission scenarios. Starting in 2050 (with RCP scenarios 4.6, 6.0 and 8.5), as a result of warming of the Arctic, squid habitat may increase along both coasts of North America. In the Southern Hemisphere, squids may lose habitat with no poleward habitat alternatives to move into. Contrary to our hypothesis, these commercial squid do not stand to benefit from climate change. Since these squid are an important food source for marine megafauna and humans, it is imperative that climate change biogeographic impacts are considered for a sustainable management of this important group of molluscs.

AB  - Purpose Bovine babesiosis causes morbidity in tropical and subtropical countries worldwide. The present study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of Babesia bigemina and B. bovis in cattle and water buffaloes in Menoufia province, where the second-highest population of bovines in Lower Egypt are raised. Materials and Methods A total of 506 blood samples were collected from cattle (N = 262) and water buffaloes (N = 244) in Menoufia province, Egypt. Seroprevalences of B. bigemina and B. bovis in the samples were determined using recombinant Babesia antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Results In cattle, the seroprevalences of B. bigemina and B. bovis were 41.60 and 38.17% (37.40 and 35.88% for IgM and 9.54 and 6.11% for IgG), respectively, whereas those of water buffaloes were 35.66 and 31.97% (27.87 and 21.72% for IgM and 15.16 and 15.16% for IgG), respectively. Statistically significant changes in the seroprevalences of the two infective agents were recorded on the basis of region and season of sample collection. Conclusion In conclusion, babesiosis is frequent and presents a threat of an epidemic among bovines in Menoufia province. In turn, control of bovine babesiosis is required because of its potential to detrimentally affect milk and meat production in Menoufia province.

AB  - Aboveground pipelines (AGP) associated with in-situ oil sands may restrict mammal movement, potentially increasing extinction probability and decreasing reproductive success. Our 12-year study used winter track count techniques to assess the response of winter-active mammals to AGP in northern Alberta, Canada. The primary questions were: which species were most prone to movement obstruction by AGP, facilities or natural factor(s)?; and which factor exerted the strongest influence on crossing likelihood?<br /> A total of 2,068 trails of 12 different species were observed. All species crossed more than half of the time. Focal species crossed on average 80% of the time. Crossing likelihood of white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus), ermine ( Mustela erminea), coyote ( Canis latrans), lynx ( Lynx canadensis), and fisher ( Martes pennanti) were significantly influenced by predictors including pipeline height, pipeline corridor width, infrastructure age, vegetation type, and proximity to infrastructure. Deer and lynx crossing likelihood was positively affected by pipe height. Deer, coyote, and ermine crossing likelihood was positively affected by age of pipe. Fisher and deer crossing likelihood was negatively affected by pipeline corridor widths. Our investigations show that most species cross AGP with high crossing frequencies of pipe heights, ranging from 130 cm to 160 cm.<br /> These findings are important for impact mitigation because of the scarcity of published studies of wildlife movement responses to AGP, our inclusion of small and mid-sized carnivores, and our investigation of multiple factors. We highlight mitigation and design improvements, effects of pipeline corridor widths, and challenges posed by coupling infrastructure with pipelines, serving to reduce movement barriers and fragmentation.

AB  - Assessing population responses to anthropogenic impacts is crucial for effective conservation management. However, estimating the abundance and demographic parameters of vulnerable marine megafauna presents significant logistical and financial challenges, particularly in developing nations with limited resources and infrastructure. This study provides the first comprehensive population abundance analysis for reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) in Nusa Penida, Bali, Indonesia, a region adjacent to former targeted manta ray fishing grounds. Additionally, it is only the second such analysis for this species in Indonesia. We used POPAN Jolly-Seber and Robust Design capture-mark-recapture models from an 11-year photo-identification dataset (2012-2023) collected by researchers and citizen scientists. Annual abundance estimates ranged from 170 (95% CI = 154-198.6) in 2012 to 447 (95% CI = 393.6-517.6) in 2022, indicating an overall increase in abundance during the study period, with high rates of apparent survival (mean = 0.92, SE = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.88-0.94). The proportion of individual manta rays sighted more than once (79.5%) was higher than in any other documented manta ray aggregation elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region. Our results also suggest that citizen science contributions improved the accuracy of abundance estimates. Continued long-term monitoring of individual manta rays at this aggregation, both through dedicated research and the involvement of citizen scientists, is required to monitor population status and detect changes in relation to anthropogenic impacts, particularly fisheries bycatch, climate change, and tourism.

AB  - Salinity gradient directly influences the composition and distribution of biological communities from upstream to downstream of the estuary. In this middle-scale study, a large dataset (10 rocky sections of 3 islands) of the Hangzhou Bay and Zhoushan Sea allowed thoroughly analyzing salinity and seasonal gradients and relating macrobenthos distributions and community structure to environment factors. In general, distinct regional differences were found in the distribution, diversity and community structures of macrobenthos. Abundance and biomass in all regions were dominated by suspension feeders and increased along the estuarine gradient. Significant seasonal differences were found in the abundance and biomass of herbivores, and significant regional differences were found in the abundance and biomass of suspension feeders. Redundancy analysis showed that water temperature was the dominant factor for the low-salt region, suspended particulate matter was the dominant factor for the mid-salt region, and water temperature as well as chlorophyll-a were the dominant factors for the high-salt region. These results showed that at a middle-scale estuary a considerable fraction of the variation in distribution and community structure of the intertidal macrobenthos correlated very well with environmental factors (salinity, water temperature, chlorophyll-a and suspended particulate matter).

AB  - The visual capabilities of prey species such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) must be specialized to enhance predator detection and traverse a complex physical environment. Although aspects of the visual system of deer have been investigated, there has been no evaluation of the species' spatial resolution abilities. We used a behavioral assay to estimate visual acuity of three adult female deer using operant conditioning techniques. We estimated the spatial resolution is between four and six cycles/degree. Our results suggest the white-tailed deer eye allows relatively low spatial resolution, consistent with prior studies that reported high temporal resolution. The combination of low spatial resolution and high temporal resolution allows for efficient detection of movement and enhanced capability to transverse a complex environment.

AB  - Plant neighbors in arid environments can ameliorate abiotic stress by reducing insolation, but they also attract herbivores and pathogens, especially when neighbors are close relatives that share similar antagonists. Plants' metabolic profiles provide a chemical fingerprint of the physiological processes behind plant responses to different environmental stresses. For example, abscisic acid and proline, mainly involved in stomatal closure and osmotic adjustment, can induce plant responses to abiotic stress, while jasmonic acid and salicylic acid primarily regulate plant defense to herbivory or pathogens. Neighbor plants can generate contrasting ecological contexts, modulating plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. We hypothesize that plant metabolic profile is modulated by its neighbors in a vegetation patch, expecting a higher investment in metabolites related to biotic-stress tolerance (i.e., herbivory or pathogens) when growing associated with other plants, especially to phylogenetically close relatives, compared to plants growing alone. We show that plants from five species growing with neighbors invest more in biotic-stress tolerance while their conspecifics, growing alone, invest more in abiotic-stress tolerance. This tendency in plants' metabolic profiles was not affected by the phylogenetic diversity of their neighborhood. Linking physiological snapshots with community processes can contribute to elucidating metabolic profiles derived from plant-plant interactions.

AB  - In Mexico, few studies have explored how environmental conditions in tropical dry forests (TDF) influence bat fly load even though, according to climate change scenarios, this ecosystem will experience a drier and warmer climate. Such an extension of the dry season in these ecosystems could have dramatic consequences for biodiversity, particularly in regions with plains where animals do not have elevational climate shifts. The present study therefore evaluates the effect of prevailing environmental conditions during 2015-2019, as well as host body conditions, on the infestation and abundance of bat-specific ectoparasites and the composition and bat fly load in the dry season of a TDF in Yucatan. Since Yucatan has an essentially flat and low-lying topography, organisms cannot escape from the predicted extreme conditions with elevational shifts. This region is therefore an excellent location for assessment of the potential effects of warming. We collected 270 bat flies from 12 species. Three streblid species (Nycterophilia parnelli Wenzel, Trichobius johnsonae Wenzel, and Trichobius sparsus Kessel) are new records for Yucatan. Our overview of the dry season bat ectoparasite loads reveals low values of richness and prevalence, but high aggregation. Our models detected significant differences in ectoparasite infestation and abundance over the years, but the environmental and body host condition variables were unrelated to these. We report that pregnant females are parasitized to a greater extent by bat flies during the dry season, which generally represents the season of most significant nutritional stress.

AB  - Understanding how plant nutrient acquisition strategies respond to grazing at the community level is critical understanding ecosystem structure and functioning in grasslands. However, few studies have simultaneously compared the difference in above-ground (leaf) and below-ground (root) nutrient-acquisition strategies in response to long-term grazing, especially at the regional scale. Here, we measured a set of leaf and fine-root traits that correspond to the fast-slow economic spectrum at the community level in 10 experimental sites from paired grazed and ungrazed grasslands across a soil nutrient gradient covering three major types of grasslands in northern China. We found that patterns of variations of leaf and fine-root traits were consistent with both a leaf and root economic spectrum at the community level for both grazed and non-grazed plots. Grazing had minor effect on community-level leaf nutrient-acquisition strategies but strongly influenced community-level root nutrient-acquisition strategies. Specifically, root nutrient-acquisition strategies were shifted to more exploitative resource use in grazed communities. Moreover, soil nutrient contributed to the changes in both leaf and root nutrient-acquisition strategies, which tended towards a more resource acquisition strategy with increasing soil nutrient levels. Grazing significantly interacted with soil nutrient to affect root nutrient-acquisition strategies, and grazing contributed more to root nutrient-acquisition strategies than soil nutrient. Synthesis. Our results demonstrated completely inconsistent responses of community-level above- and below-ground resource acquisition strategies to long-term grazing, and below-ground acquisition strategies were more sensitive to long-term grazing. Our findings also suggest that high intensity anthropogenic activities such as grazing may strongly modify below-ground resource acquisition strategies.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog. image

AB  - This study investigated the intra- and inter-herd diversity of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) isolates from four goat herds in Thuringia (Germany) that were affected by paratuberculosis for several years. The main focus was on the characterization and distribution of genotypes among animals and the environment of goat herd 1. This study included 196 isolates from the feces of 121 infected goats, various tissues from 13 clinically diseased goats, 29 environmental samples from herd 1, and additionally, 22 isolates of different origin from herds 2 to 4. The isolates, sampled between 2018 and 2022, were genotyped using short-sequence-repeat (SSR) analysis, mycobacterial-interspersed repetitive units-variable-number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) analysis, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based assay for phylogenetic grouping. All the isolates belonged to the MAP-C group. In herd 1, one predominant genotype was determined, while two other genotypes were identified very rarely and only in fecal and environmental samples. One of three further genotypes was found in each of herds 2 to 4. The assignment of genotypes to different phylogenetic clades suggested six different infection strains. The results indicated no epidemiological links between the examined herds. Based on the current MAP genotyping data from Germany, possible sources of infection are MAP-contaminated barns previously used by infected cattle and the purchase of sub-clinically infected goats.

AB  - High-density genetic linkage maps provide a foundational genomic resource for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, candidate gene localisation, and comparative genomic analysis. Data from such studies, in turn, can be incorporated into marker or genomics assisted selective breeding strategies for increased efficiency of aquaculture production. This study aimed to construct the first high-density genetic linkage map for dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus) a commercially important marine finfish in Asia, Australia, and South Africa. Using 2brestriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) sequencing for genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, in three full-sib F1 families (Family 1, n = 69 offspring; Family 2, n = 73 offspring; and Family 3, n = 70 offspring), led to the discovery and genotyping of 22,789 SNPs. Among these, 3992 quality filtered and informative SNPs were mapped to 24 linkage groups (LGs), aligning with the species' proposed haploid chromosome number. The total integrated genetic map spanned a length of 2550 cM with an average marker spacing of 0.68 cM, achieving a genome coverage of 98.61%. Male and female specific maps highlighted differential map lengths and recombination rates between the sexes, with the female map slightly longer and a lower recombination frequency than for the male. QTL analysis for growth-related traits, weight (W), standard length (sL), and Fulton's condition factor (K), identified a total of 25 QTLs of which five QTLs were found to be consistently shared across the traits. Collectively, these shared QTLs explained a substantial proportion of the phenotypic variance, accounting for between 9.30 and 19.30% of the observed variation, suggesting potential major genes for growth. These QTL regions led to the discovery of 65 potential candidate genes, including 11 genes that were specifically located within the shared QTLs. These genes were linked to essential biological processes, including metabolism, immunity, stress response, development, and vascular function. The establishment of this highdensity genetic linkage map represents an important genomic resource for comprehending the genetic determinants of economically important traits in A. japonicus, with implications for advancing and optimising ongoing marker-assisted selection (MAS) initiatives in the species.

AB  - Large-scale deforestation and forest fragmentation in the tropical area of the Atherton Tablelands in Far North Queensland, Australia, have placed extensive strains on populations of many endemic species of this area, such as the Lumholtz's Tree-Kangaroo (LTK). Despite LTKs predominantly arboreal life and their ability to quickly colonize and adapt to restored forested habitats, little is known about their terrestrial activity patterns within these habitats which put them at risk to predation by canines and to roadkill when crossing nearby roads. Using motion-sensing cameras, forest floor-related activities of LTKs were recorded in a restored riparian rainforest habitat in relation to seasons and moon phases. The results show that LTKs exhibit a cathemeral activity pattern of forest floor-related movements with a tendency towards crepuscular activity at dawn. While there was a significant association between the daytime recordings and the seasons with more activity during the days of the wet season, there was no association between the nighttime recordings and the seasons, as well as the moon phases. These results suggest that seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation, but potentially also in food quality, are likely to affect the frequency at which LTKs access the forest floor. Mitigating threats to LTKs in restored habitats should focus on facilitating terrestrial movements of LTKs, the control of feral dogs, enlarging and connecting available habitat, and educating drivers about peak times of LTK movements on the ground.

AB  - The invasive shrub glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus) has been progressively colonizing the Northeastern United States and Southeastern Canada for more than a century. To determine the dominant arthropod orders and species associated with F. alnus, field surveys were conducted for two years across 16 plots within the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania, USA. Statistical analyses were employed to assess the impact of seasonal variation on insect order richness and diversity. The comprehensive arthropod collection yielded 2845 insects and arachnids, with hemipterans comprising the majority (39.8%), followed by dipterans (22.3%) and arachnids (15.5%). Notably, 16.2% of the hemipterans collected were in the immature stages, indicating F. alnus as a host for development. The two dominant insect species of F. alnus were Psylla carpinicola (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) and Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae); D. suzukii utilized F. alnus fruits for reproduction. Species richness and diversity exhibited significant variations depending on the phenology of F. alnus. The profiles of volatile compounds emitted from the leaves and flowers of F. alnus were analyzed to identify factors that potentially contribute to the attraction of herbivores and pollinators. The results of our study will advance the development of novel F. alnus management strategies leveraging the insects associated with this invasive species.

AB  - Characterizing the dietary niche partitioning of sympatric mesocarnivores is fundamental for understanding their mechanisms of coexistence and ecosystem function. By utilizing scat DNA and DNA metabarcoding, our study revealed a detailed picture of the trophic interaction between two mesocarnivores in a cool temperate forest ecosystem in Northeast China. Both red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) consumed a diverse range of prey (52 prey taxa from 11 orders) dominated by Rodentia (56.5-64.9%). Bipartite trophic network analysis suggested that both predators are generalists and have a high degree of niche overlap (Pianka's index = 0.77). However, diet patterns differed between the predators. Both predators consumed more diverse prey during the snow-free period than during the snow-covered period, which resulted in lower niche overlap between the predators (Pianka's index = 0.43). Another important source of diet niche partitioning was the proportion of large prey consumed, with red foxes consuming more ungulates than leopard cats do throughout the year in regions with two apex carnivores, tigers (Panthera tigris) and leopards (P. pardus). The presence of apex carnivores provides more stable carrion resources, which facilitates dietary niche partitioning and the coexistence of mesocarnivores. Our study provides important clues about the strategies of dietary niche partitioning between sympatric mesocarnivores, which is critical for understanding coexistence within carnivore communities.

AB  - Interspecific interactions between two spatiotemporally co-occurred species sharing a single resource are considered to be either competitive or facilitative. This study examined the possible interspecific interactions between a dung-tunneling beetle species (Onthophagus yubarinus) and an earthworm species (Aporrectodea nocturna), two major detritivores responsible for dung removal in a Tibetan alpine meadow. We conducted a two-way, factorial field experiment using replicated chambers, and measured the performances of beetles and earthworms, as well as yak dung removal, soil properties and aboveground plant biomass over two months. Earthworm presence significantly decreased the body size of beetle larvae and the weight of tunnel dung that beetle larvae live on. In contrast, beetle presence did not affect the performance of earthworms. Beetles, earthworms and their interaction significantly increased dung removal and soil organic carbon concentration at the end of the experiment. Beetles alone significantly increased soil total N and P, soluble N and P concentrations, but earthworms alone had nonsignificant effects on these nutrient variables. Beetles and earthworms additively enhanced soluble N and P concentrations, and aboveground plant biomass at the end of the experiment. These results indicate 1) there was a onesided negative relationship between dung-tunneling beetles and earthworms, resulting from the consumption of earthworms on food resource of beetle larvae; and 2) the coexistence of beetles and earthworms facilitated dung removal interactively and plant growth additively by increasing nutrient availability.

AB  - Cephalopod beaks are essential for prey acquisition and fragmentation during feeding. Thus, it is expected that ecological pressures affect cephalopod beak shape. From a practical perspective, these structures are also used to identify gut contents of marine megafauna, such as toothed whales, sharks, seabirds, and large pelagic fishes. Here, we investigated the relative importance of ecological pressures and phylogenetic relatedness in the evolution of beak shape using a wide range of Mediterranean cephalopod species. Phylogenetic analyses based on complete mitogenomes and nuclear ribosomal genes provided a well-supported phylogeny among the 18 included cephalopods. Geometric morphometric and stable isotope methods were implemented to describe interspecific beak shape and trophic niche variability, respectively. Phylogenetic signal was detected in the shape of both parts of the beak (upper and lower). However, lower beak shape was more distinct among closely related species, in line with the empirical notion that lower beak morphology is more useful as an identification tool in cephalopods. Interestingly, no association between beak shape and trophic niche (stable isotope values) was found. These results suggest that the evolution of cephalopod beak shape as quantified here is mainly driven by phylogenetic relationships, while feeding habits play a minor role.

AB  - The winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus (Ixodidae), commonly infests a wide variety of wild and domestic ungulates throughout North America. This one -host -tick infests animals from October to April, with moose (Alces alces) particularly affected. Animals highly infested may present with anemia, tick -induced alopecia, and alterations in thermoregulation, often resulting in death. Mortality from winter tick infestation has been reported in free -ranging woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and captive reindeer in Alberta, Canada. This historic report raises concern about mortality due to D. albipictus in a wider host range, specifically on translocated caribou. The aim of this report was to describe three cases of winter tick infestation in captive reindeer resulting in severe anemia and mortality likely due to the infestation in New Hampshire, northeastern United States (US). Additionally, ticks were screened molecularly for the detection of tick -borne pathogens. At time of necropsy, all three reindeer showed decreased nutritional status, marked submandibular edema, and had heavy D. albipictus infestation. None of the reindeer exhibited alopecia, which is a common clinical manifestation in moose that die from winter tick infestation. No pathogens were detected via qPCR screening. This report highlights the risk that captive cervids face in areas where winter tick is endemic; therefore, the adoption of preventive control measures should be encouraged to reduce the risk of tick infestation and potential death of these animals.

AB  - The compatibility of forest livestock grazing with timber production is disputed, as livestock can damage young trees through browsing and trampling. At the same time, livestock grazing might reduce the growth of competing vegetation and thereby enhance conifer forest regeneration. We investigated the effects of cattle (Bos taurus) on young spruce (Picea abies) trees in boreal production forest. We compared data from young spruce plantations within and outside of the grazing area, and during and off the cattle grazing season. Overall, stocking rates were 0.01 cows per hectare across the grazing areas. Cattle did not distribute equally, but concentrated their area use to young spruce plantations, leading to locally high densities during periods of the grazing season. Cattle removed vegetation competing with young spruce trees: Within the grazing area, the sward height of the field layer vegetation was lower, and young willow (Salix spec.) and downy birch (Betula pubescens) trees were browsed more than outside the grazing area. The annual height growth of spruce increased once the spruce grew above sward height. Spruce trees surrounded by many competing trees grew slower than those surrounded by few trees. Bent spruce trees grew slower than undamaged spruce trees. Yet, no difference in annual spruce growth was found between inside and outside the cattle grazing area. In contrast, we found a higher spruce mortality risk inside than outside the cattle grazing area. This mortality risk was very low and positively correlated with a given spruce tree's bark being damaged. Cattle did not increase the risk of damaged stem bark. This study did not succeed in pointing out the mechanism by which cattle might increase spruce mortality risk. Interestingly, the probability of being browsed and the probability of being bent were higher after winter than after summer, indicating that wild ungulates and snow might have a stronger effect on young spruce trees than summer grazing cattle at these stocking rates. In conclusion, cattle had minor effects on young spruce trees. This study suggests that at low stocking rates, forestry and livestock production in boreal production systems are compatible.

AB  - A cost of reproduction may not be observable in the presence of environmental or individual heterogeneity because they affect the resources available to individuals. Individual space use is critical in determining both the resources available to individuals and the exposure to factors that mediate the value of these resources (e.g. competition and parasitism). Despite this, there has, to our knowledge, been little research to understand how between-individual differences in resource acquisition, caused by variation in space use, interact with environmental variation occurring at the population scale to influence estimates of the cost of reproduction in natural populations. We used long-term data from the St. Kilda Soay sheep population to understand how differences in age, relative home range quality, and average adult body mass, interacted with annual variation in population density and winter North Atlantic Oscillation index to influence over-winter survival and reproduction in the subsequent year, for females that had invested into reproduction to varying degrees. Our results suggest that Soay sheep females experience costs both in terms of future survival and future reproduction. However, we found little evidence that estimated costs of reproduction vary depending on relative home range quality. There are several possible causes for the lack of a relationship between relative home range quality and our estimate of the costs experienced by females. These include the potential for a correlation between relative home range quality and reproductive allocation to mask a relationship between home range quality and reproductive costs, as well as the potential for the benefit of higher quality home ranges being offset by higher densities. Nevertheless, our results raise questions regarding the presence or context-dependence of relationships between resource access and the estimated cost of reproduction.

AB  - Simple Summary Precisely estimating the extent of the conflict between livestock and wild animals is crucial for making a proper management policy. Sika deer in the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park restrictedly distributes along the Sino-Russia border and fail to dispersal further into inland China, which hampers the ecosystem restoration flagged with tiger and leopard. Domestic cattle raised in the park are hypothesized as the main factors restricting the dispersal of sika deer, while the extent of the cattle-deer conflict is largely unknown. By utilizing high-throughput sequencing technology, this study quantified the extent of foraging conflict between cattle and deer in the park. We found the cattle shifted from a grazer-typical diet to a browser-typical diet, which resulted in a big diet overlap with sika deer. Indeed, the diet of cattle was more diverse than that of sika deer. Therefore, we argue that the big diet overlaps and superior competitive abilities of cattle may be the main driver restricting the dispersal of sika deer into the inland. Managers need to know the extent of the conflict between livestock and wild animals. Although many studies have reported the conflict between livestock and wild animals, few have checked the extent of the conflict. Cattle raising in the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park is considered one of the main driving forces behind the restricted distribution of sika deer. To understand whether foraging competition is contributing to avoidance patterns between sika deer and cattle, we investigated their feeding habits using DNA barcoding and high-throughput sequencing. Our study shows that although cattle are grazers in the traditional division of herbivores, their diet shifted to a predominance of dicotyledonous woody plants, and this diet shift resulted in a high degree of dietary overlap between sika deer and cattle. Moreover, compared to sika deer, cattle diets are more diverse at the species level with a wider ecological niche. Our results confirm that overlapping dietary niches and the superior competitive abilities of cattle contribute to the restricted distribution of the sika deer, which has critical implications for the conservation of their predators. Our study suggests that cattle grazing should be prohibited in the Park and effective measures should be taken for the benefit of sika deer.

AB  - Plastic waste is currently a major threat to marine ecosystems, and the ever-growing production of plastic materials suggests that this scenario will not change soon. Understanding cryptic effects of plastic debris on keystone marine species is warranted to address ecosystem-level impacts caused by plastic pollution. This study reports on plastic entanglement in top predator tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, from the western South Atlantic Ocean. Circular plastic straps produced severe trauma in 3 % of all tiger sharks sampled and led to abnormal anatomical development, indicating worrisome incidence and consequences of plastic entanglement in this species. Removing the plastic strap from one shark which had been entangled for at least 9 months was probably the cause for the shark having experienced post-release mortality. This suggests that, in some circumstances, strap removal is not effective to promote the survival of entangled sharks. Eliminating the circular integrity of plastic materials at first use should contribute to mitigate some of the impacts of plastic pollution on marine megafauna since this shape might be determinant in the process of shark entanglement.

AB  - The hypothesis that transformation of rangelands by domestic herbivores follows state-and-transition models predicts that vegetation communities will cross ecological thresholds when shifting from one state to another. We test this hypothesis by identifying threshold responses of soil function in Gamka Thicket, a variation of Arid Thicket in South Africa. We relate indices of soil water infiltration, nutrient cycling, and soil retention (reflecting ecosystem function) to distance from artificial watering points in four piosphere treatments differing in rangeland management history. Furthermore, we compare the pattern, extent, and variation in transformation at the end regions of our piosphere treatments to each other and to a transformed and untransformed reference site. The changes to all the indices of ecosystem function support the hypothesis that functional thresholds have been crossed. We propose a conceptual model that suggests that Arid Thicket transformation due to herbivory transcends three vegetation states. We contend that during the process of transformation the crossing of structural thresholds lead to the crossing of functional thresholds that ultimately drive the formation of new vegetation states.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Underground storage utilizing natural cold energy, a long tradition of communities in Beringia closely integrated within their lifeways, is challenged by malfunctions or difficulties in appropriate use, affecting food security and food sovereignty, and community wellbeing. Previous studies tend to center on physical aspects in individual ice cellar cases in permafrost zones. In this study, we investigated impacts of climate and socio-ecological changes on underground food storage through analysis of local community interviews and proactive dialogues between local community experts and scientists to illustrate (1) the roles of cold storage in supporting their sustainable foods and lifestyles, (2) the causes and factors related to the issue of dysfunction of and/or decrease in underground cold storage use and eventual decline in use, and (3) consequent losses and damages these changes brought. Thereby, we enhanced and applied a 'Food Life History' framework, a working hypothesis constructed to address human-environment issues in a holistic, multiperspectival, and integrated way. The results show that changes in underground cold storage practices are not caused by a single factor (e.g. climate change or permafrost degradation alone), but through a variety of agents that have influence on different time scales (e.g. colonization, globalization, food changes, technologies for subsistence). Included is a relational diagram depicting the interrelations of relevant factors impacting the role and functionality of underground cold storage practices of a tradition more than a century old. It will serve to provide suggestions for sharing ideas and intuitive understandings of current situations, and a template to address and examine key points and potential policy options for future planning with respect to the resilience and wellbeing of communities, fostering open and transparent discussion.

AB  - Simple Summary Low ambient temperature resulted in the body's cold stress response, while local wild boars in the middle-temperate zone performed better than commercial pigs. Therefore, three breeds-Large White (LW) pigs, a local Mashen (MS) pig breed and Jinfen White (JFW) pigs, a hybrid breed from wild boar-were investigated in an artificial climate chamber. The results implicated that low-ambient-temperature stimulation increased trypsin activity in duodenal chyme and promoted inflammatory response in Mashen pigs. The cold-resistance mechanism of MS pigs should be explored to reduce hogs' stress caused by low-ambient-temperature stimulation. Ambient temperature (Ta) fluctuation is a key factor affecting the growth performance and economic returns of pigs. However, whether the response of intestinal structure and function are related to pig breeds in low Ta has not been investigated yet. In this study, Large White (LW) pigs, Jinfen White (JFW) pigs and Mashen (MS) pigs were raised in artificial climate chambers under normal Ta (25 degrees C) and low Ta (4 degrees C) for 96 h. Afterwards, the decrease in body temperature and complete blood counts (CBC) of all pigs were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin, immunohistochemical staining, qPCR and ELISA were used to investigate their intestinal mucosa integrity and inflammatory response. The results showed that MS pigs could maintain a normal body temperature and villus structure after 4 degrees C stimulation compared with those of LW and JFW pigs. Villus height and villus height/crypt depth of MS pigs were significantly higher than those of LW and JFW pigs at 4 degrees C. Low-Ta stimulation increased the digestion of carbohydrates of all pigs. Meanwhile, low Ta enhanced the activity of lipase in LW pigs and increased trypsin activity in MS and JFW pigs. Furthermore, low-Ta stimulation significantly downregulated the protein of tight junction and upregulated the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines in MS pigs. MS pigs also showed stronger spleen immune function at 4 degrees C. These results indicated that the local MS pig breed had stronger intestinal function in low Ta by producing a stronger inflammatory response, which lays the foundation for further study on the mechanism of cold tolerance in pigs.

AB  - A new species of hylid frog is described from Tapir Valley Nature Reserve, located on the Caribbean slope of Tenorio Volcano in Bijagua, Alajuela Province, Costa Rica. A molecular phylogenetic analysis supports its inclusion in the genus Tlalocohyla. Morphological, morphometric, larval, and acoustic characteristics further distinguish it from other species in the genus and support its uniqueness. The new species is closely related to T. picta and T. smithii, and is separated by at least 500 kilometers from the nearest known occurrence of a population of T. picta in southern Honduras. The new species is readily distinguished from all other Tlalocohyla by its brilliant green coloration marked with a pronounced, incomplete light dorsolateral stripe that is bordered above by a diffuse reddish-brown stripe. Its dorsum is marked with bold reddish brown spots and its ventral skin is fully transparent. This new Tlalocohyla is currently only known from the type locality, where it inhabits a lentic wetland system with an emergent herbaceous vegetation-dominated benthic zone, surrounded by tropical rainforest. A description of its bioacoustic repertoire and information on natural history, reproduction and habitat preference of this new species are provided.

AB  - Wildlife monitoring is key for the effective management of natural resources. Hunting-based data (e.g., hunting bag statistics) is an important source of information to overcome the financial constraints imposed to long-term monitoring. Here, taking advantage of three decades (1989-2022) of hunting bag statistics of wild mammals in Portugal, we present the trends and discuss the issues regarding nine game species (five wild ungulates, two carnivores and two lagomorphs). Our results show that hunting bag statistics mirror the general population trends of wild mammal populations at a national scale. The data reflects the increase in number and distribution of roe deer, red deer and wild boar, and the recent expansion experienced by the Egyptian mongoose. The decline in the numbers of European wild rabbit and Iberian hare harvested are also noticeable. Hunting-based data have been used in several research contexts; however, this information is usually affected by geographical, temporal and recording bias. Portugal is no exception. Engaging the interested stakeholders is pivotal to ensure data quality. By reporting reliable and systematically collected hunting data, game managers and wildlife researchers will be able to better understand the main drivers of population dynamics, adjust hunting bags towards sustainable yield and assess the ecological and socio-economic relevance of the hunting sector.

AB  - Emperor moth (Saturnia japonica) outbreaks in Hokkaido's deciduous forests have been happening since 2006. The susceptibility of monarch birch (Betula maximowicziana) leaves differs, with the specific mechanisms affecting their defensibility at the ontogenetic level remaining unknown. In this study, the first instar emperor moth larvae were fed monarch birch leaves from 32 individual trees (saplings to mature trees), and their body weights were compared. Various leaf characteristics (water content, toughness, leaf mass per area, total phenolics, condensed tannin, nitrogen content, carbon content, and carbon to nitrogen [C/N] ratio) were measured concurrently to identify the factors affecting larval growth. Structural equation model analysis indicated that the C/N ratio was the most important factor affecting larval weight and that light conditions have a greater effect on the C/N ratio. In conclusion, light conditions had a strong effect on the foliar C/N ratio which in turn had a significant impact on the weight of emperor moth larvae. This study provides insights into monarch birch management and proposes that maintaining a lighter canopy is important to reduce herbivore damage.

AB  - The response of plankton communities to short-term climatic events was studied in a narrow coral reef lagoon representative of the channel-type lagoons of the high islands of the tropical Pacific. Phyto- and zooplankton data (abundance and taxonomic composition) were sampled at high frequencies for 2 weeks in April-May 2017 under various tidal conditions and combined with environmental and physical measurements and modeling hydrodynamic products. The short-term external events (wind, waves and rain) that occurred caused changes in the circulation patterns and increased nutrient concentrations in the lagoon. The plankton reacted quickly to this enrichment, with an increase in chlorophyll a and the rapid development of a microphytoplankton community dominated by diatoms, and of opportunistic herbivorous zooplankton (tintinnids, appendicularians). Zooplankton composition and distribution were strongly modulated by the circulation patterns through advection and mixing. Our results show that the tidal and diel components of the temporal variability of planktonic groups were blurred by sporadic event components (i.e. wind, wave and rainfall events). Environmental and biological responses to these external physical forcings occurred at lagoon scale in this channel-like lagoon, unlike what is observed in larger lagoons (such as the southern lagoons of New Caledonia) where spatial variability is much higher.

AB  - There have been few field studies to date on female reproductive success in the Japanese serow, Capricornis crispus. Data were collected on female reproduction and kid mortality in a high-density population in Akita City, Japan, for seven years from 1979 to 1985. The parturition rate from 1979 to 1984 was at least 81.1%, and the annual variation (73.3-85.7%) was not significant. Each adult female usually gave birth to a single kid in successive years and may have intermittently had 1- or 2-year interruptions of parturition. In the seven females observed from zero or one year of age, four (57.1%) and three females (42.9%) first gave birth at three and four years of age, respectively. The kid mortality rate from 1979 to 1984 was 54.7%, and the annual variation (27.3-88.9%) was significant. Compared with the pregnancy rates of culled serows in low-density local populations, parturition rates were remarkably high in the study area, perhaps because of good nutritional conditions. In low-density populations such as red-listed areas, it is necessary to monitor fertility rates as well as population densities to avoid local extinction.

AB  - Cultural eutrophication-the pollution of water bodies with nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from human activities-and associated harmful algal blooms are key issues facing decision-makers, yet costs are often identified as a barrier to restoration. When designed in collaboration with impacted communities, economic valuation of lake ecosystem services can contribute to informed environmental decision-making by quantifying economic benefits of lake restoration and understanding the trade-offs people are willing to make. Here, we collaborate with the local community, stakeholders, and decision-makers to develop and implement a discrete choice experiment survey to estimate people's preferences and willingness to pay for restoring Elk/Beaver Lake, Canada, which has been experiencing worsening harmful algal blooms and other water quality issues. Over half of survey respondents (66%) indicated that water quality issues impact their use of the lake, and many (52%) indicated they did not feel safe swimming in or allowing their pets to drink from the lake (64%). Responses to the choice experiment are analyzed using choice models which reveal that the annual economic benefits of lake restoration across different model specifications ranged from $141 to $292 CAD per household with substantial heterogeneity across people. The aggregate annual benefits of lake restoration are $27 to $55 million which is notably greater than the estimated costs of restoration plans. This study contributes to the growing literature suggesting that there are substantial benefits to society from restoring lakes, thus the perception of cost as an insurmountable barrier to restoration of bloom-affected lakes requires reconsideration.

AB  - ContextWildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) are a significant threat for many species, cause financial loss and pose a serious risk to motorist safety.ObjectivesWe used spatial data science on regional collision data from Switzerland with the objectives of identifying the key environmental collision risk factors and modelling WVC risk on a nationwide scale.MethodsWe used 43,000 collision records with roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and chamois from 2010 to 2015 for both midlands and mountainous landscape types. We compared a fixed-length road segmentation approach with segments based on Kernel Density Estimation, a data-driven segmentation method. The segments' environmental properties were derived from land-cover geodata using novel neighbourhood operations. Multivariate logistic regression and random forest classifiers were used to identify and rank the relevant environmental factors and to predict collision risk in areas without collision data.ResultsThe key factors for WVC hotspots are road sinuosity, and two composite factors for browsing/forage availability and traffic noise-a proxy for traffic flow. Our best models achieved sensitivities of 82.5% to 88.6%, with misclassifications of 20.14% and 27.03%, respectively. Our predictions were better in forested areas and revealed limitations in open landscape due to lack of up-to-date data on annual crop changes.ConclusionsWe illustrate the added value of using fine-grained land-cover data for WVC modelling, and show how such detailed information can be annotated to road segments using spatial neighbourhood functions. Finally, we recommend the inclusion of annual crop data for improving WVC modelling.

AB  - Zooplankton are a vital component of the food web as the major conduit of energy from primary producers to planktivorous fishes. Therefore, changes in the structure of the zooplankton community affect how energy moves through aquatic ecosystems. Changes in the zooplankton community structure are typically documented through detailed community analysis, which can be difficult to interpret and communicate to non-experts. Alternatively, a few key summary indicators of community structure may better disseminate this information to a broader audience. In this study we analyzed zooplankton data from 1997 to 2019 from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes National Program Office to select indicators that summarized changes in the zooplankton community. Two indicators (percent of calanoids by biomass and areal density of herbivorous cladocerans) detected known changes in lakes Huron, Michigan, and Ontario, correlated with the crustacean zooplankton areal biomass above (herbivorous cladocerans) or in the hypolimnion (percent calanoids), and were related to the lake or basin-wide Carlson's Trophic State Index based on chlorophyll (TSIchl) (percent calanoids by biomass). Our findings suggest that employing one or both selected indicators in addition to TSIchl and total crustacean zooplankton areal biomass, an already reported indicator in the Great Lakes that captures overall food availability for fish, would provide additional key information about zooplankton community structure in simple metrics that could be effectively communicated to stakeholders.

AB  - To explain the differences in microbial diversity between soil from termite mounds and their nearby soils, we evaluated the impact of termite biopedturbation on the respiration profiles of microorganisms from termite mound soils. The MicroRespTM technique was employed to assess the whole-soils' community-level-physiological-profiles (CLPP) assays using 21 carbon substrates chosen on the ground of significance to biotas dwellings in the soil. Principal component analyses showed that carbon substrate groups in the soils from termite mound were separated from those of the nearby soils. The results supported our first premise that the CLPP of soils from termite mounds could be distinguishable from the CLPP of the nearby soil and the degree of the differences was based on which substrates were added in the analysis. The assumption that any variance established in the CLPP could be attributed to a higher use of structurally complex carbon substrates in soils from termite mounds compared to the nearby soil samples was also supported. The higher soil respiration and the capacity to degrade carbon sources in soils from termite mounds than the nearby soil samples connote a rise in microbial functional diversity due to the differences in the diversity of microorganisms between both habitats.

AB  - The use of umbrella species to promote biodiversity conservation is practiced worldwide. The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) an iconic species for world wildlife conservation, that inhabits regions with significant biodiversity. Given that the functions at wildlife of different trophic levels and in different body size groups are different within the ecosystem, it is unknown whether those groups of wildlife co-occurring with giant pandas are each likewise protected. To examine the umbrella effect of giant pandas on sympatric species, we used an extensive dataset of wildlife from more than 78% of giant panda habitats. We analysed the changes in distribution for four wildlife categories (large carnivores, large herbivores, medium carnivores and medium herbivores) using a generalized linear mixed model, and the underlying driving factors using binomial logistic regression models. Changes in forests in giant panda habitats were evaluated using Fragstats. The results have shown that the counts of herbivores and medium carnivores increased significantly during the decade. However, those of large carnivores significantly declined. Forest cover and nature reserves showed significant and positive effects on wildlife in 2001 and 2011, while the human population had significant and negative impacts on the herbivores and carnivores. Our results have also suggested that there has been a slight alleviation in forest fragmentation in areas unaffected by earthquakes. We concluded that the umbrella strategy of using the giant panda as an umbrella species achieved partial success by promoting the recovery of herbivores and medium carnivores. Meanwhile, this has indicated that the strategy was not sufficient for large carnivores, and therefore not enough for local ecosystems, given the critical role of large carnivores. We have suggested integrating habitat patches, controlling human disturbance, and preparing for potential human-wildlife conflict management in the Giant Panda National Park to restore large carnivore populations and maintain ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Sheep are a primary species in animal husbandry. Accurate sheep population counts are vital for managing husbandry practices and preventing grassland overgrazing. Current methods using UAV images are time-consuming and costly. The small size of sheep and complex backgrounds in large-scale areas make accurate extraction challenging. We propose the Small Object Extraction Net (SOENet), a semantic segmentation model with an encoder-decoder structure. The SOENet encoder resizes the original images to three resolutions to extract multi-scale sheep features. A Multi-resolution Context Enhancement (MCE) module is proposed to extract complicated contextual features of sheep by concatenating different scales of feature maps to reduce the possibility of commission errors. To minimize omission errors, a Multi-resolution Feature Fusion (MFF) module is proposed by introducing more scales of features to the encoder, facilitating the sharing and exchange of multi-scale sheep features. Our model outperforms nine deep learning models, with a 7.9% improvement in precision and a 1.2% increase in mIoU. SOENet provides an effective solution for large-scale sheep extraction from various ground objects.

AB  - Warming temperatures and advancing spring are affecting annual snow and ice cycles, as well as plant phenology, across the Arctic and boreal regions. These changes may be linked to observed population declines in wildlife, including barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a key species of Arctic environments. We quantified how barren-ground caribou, characteristically both gregarious and migratory, synchronize births in time and aggregate births in space and investigated how these tactics are influenced by variable weather conditions. We analyzed movement patterns to infer calving dates for 747 collared female caribou from seven herds across northern North America, totaling 1255 calving events over a 15-year period. By relating these events to local weather conditions during the 1-year period preceding calving, we examined how weather influenced calving timing and the ability of caribou to reach their central calving area. We documented continental-scale synchrony in calving, but synchrony was greatest within an individual herd for a given year. Weather conditions before and during gestation had contrasting effects on the timing and location of calving. Notably, a combination of unfavorable weather conditions during winter and spring, including the pre-calving migration, resulted in a late arrival on the calving area or a failure to reach the greater calving area in time for calving. Though local weather conditions influenced calving timing differently among herds, warm temperatures and low wind speed, which are associated with soft, deep snow, during the spring and pre-calving migration, generally affected the ability of female caribou to reach central calving areas in time to give birth. Delayed calving may have potential indirect consequences, including reduced calf survival. Overall, we detected considerable variability across years and across herds, but no significant trend for earlier calving by caribou, even as broad indicators of spring and snow phenology trend earlier. Our results emphasize the importance of monitoring the timing and location of calving, and to examine how weather during summer and winter are affecting calving and subsequent reproductive success.

AB  - Little is known about the land use and vertical patterns of the soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) pools in the subalpine grassland of the Guizhou Plateau with experienced extensive landuse changes. We investigated Unused natural grassland (UG), Buffalo grazing grassland (BG), Mosaic grassland (MG), Shrubland (SL), Afforest land (AL), Secondary forest land (SF) and Cropland (CL) to depict the land use- and depth-related patterns of SOC and SIC in the upper half-meter soils. The results displayed that MG had the highest SOC stocks (16.21 kg m(-2)), but BG had the lowest SOC stocks (3.62 kg m(-2)). BG had the highest SIC stock (2.01 kg m(-2)), but SL had the lowest SIC stock (0.93 kg m(-2)). SOC stock was more affected by land use and SIC stock was more affected by soil depth. In addition, land use impacted the SOC stock within specific soil chemical ranges, land use indirectly changed the SIC stock via its influence on soil chemical properties. This study provided interesting snapshots on the effects of land use and soil depth on soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities and SOC and SIC stocks with the regulations of soil factors.

AB  - As natural habitats decline and wildlife adapts to increasing anthropogenic disturbance, it is crucial to understand humanwildlife relationships in residential areas. However, relevant studies are limited and mostly focused on single cities. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated people's preferences for seeing wild mammals in residential areas by conducting and analyzing an online survey distributed across Germany (n = 2997 participants). Our results revealed that preferred species (squirrels, hedgehogs, hares, roe deer) were frequently encountered, whereas unpreferred species were those encountered frequently (rats, martens), as well as those encountered rarely (wild boar, coypus, raccoons). We also found a moderately positive correlation between the number of encounters with mammals and them being preferred by humans. Finally, some socio-demographic variables, particularly gender, garden access, and urbanity, are significantly related to human preferences. Based on our results, we propose tailoring wildlife management in residential areas to promote the positive attributes of preferred wildlife as biodiversity ambassadors, while also addressing ways to mitigate encounters and negative perceptions associated with unpreferred species.

AB  - Widespread distribution of livestock in the natural habitats of large carnivores may negatively impact carnivore populations by reducing wild prey availability and increasing human-carnivore conflicts. In this study, we used camera-trapping data collected in the temperate forests of the Taihang Mountains in North China during 2016-2019 to examine whether and how free-ranging cattle affected habitat use and Diel activity patterns of the endangered North Chinese leopard (Panthera pardus japonensis) and its 2 wild prey species, Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Residents were also interviewed to record livestock depredation events by leopards during 2015-2019. We found that roe deer spatially avoided sites frequented by cattle, but wild boar did not. In the growing seasons, leopards shared habitats with cattle and tended to increase their diurnal activities where cattle were present. All 3 study species exhibited fine-scale spatial-temporal segregation to cattle. Leopards selectively preyed on calves over adult cattle and livestock depredation frequency was positively correlated with the detection rates of cattle and wild prey, but not that of leopard. These findings not only show that through behavioral adaption large carnivores and their ungulate prey may persist under livestock disturbance, but also highlight how important proper livestock management is for conserving North Chinese leopards in this region. To enhance livestock management and mitigate human-leopard conflicts, we recommend specific actions, such as better guarding of free-ranging cattle or adoption of a captive farming system.

AB  - Background The wild pig (Sus scrofa) is an exotic species that has been present in the southeastern United States for centuries yet continues to expand into new areas dominated by bottomland and upland forests, the latter of which are less commonly associated with wild pigs. Here, we aimed to investigate wild pig movement and space use attributes typically used to guide wild pig management among multiple spatiotemporal scales. Our investigation focused on a newly invaded landscape dominated by bottomland and upland forests. Methods We examined (1) core and total space use using an autocorrelated kernel density estimator; (2) resource selection patterns and hot spots of space use in relation to various landscape features using step-selection analysis; and (3) daily and hourly differences in movement patterns between non-hunting and hunting seasons using generalized additive mixed models. Results Estimates of total space use among wild pigs (n = 9) were smaller at calculated core (1.2 +/- 0.3 km(2)) and 90% (5.2 +/- 1.5 km(2)) isopleths than estimates reported in other landscapes in the southeastern United States, suggesting that wild pigs were able to meet foraging, cover, and thermoregulatory needs within smaller areas. Generally, wild pigs selected areas closer to herbaceous, woody wetlands, fields, and perennial streams, creating corridors of use along these features. However, selection strength varied among individuals, reinforcing the generalist, adaptive nature of wild pigs. Wild pigs also showed a tendency to increase movement from fall to winter, possibly paralleling increases in hard mast availability. During this time, there were also increases in anthropogenic pressures (e.g. hunting), causing movements to become less diurnal as pressure increased. Conclusions Our work demonstrates that movement patterns by exotic generalists must be understood across individuals, the breadth of landscapes they can invade, and multiple spatiotemporal scales. This improved understanding will better inform management strategies focused on curbing emerging invasions in novel landscapes, while also protecting native natural resources.

AB  - This study investigated the vegetation growth and forage-livestock balance of desert grasslands at the village scale. This study was chosen to be conducted in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, where desert grasslands are widely distributed and fragility of the environment. This paper establishes a model for estimating time series changes of above-ground biomass (AGB) in the study area based on remote sensing images from the Gaofen-6 satellite, combined with canopy spectra and AGB data of vegetated desert steppe areas. Next, the ecological carrying capacity and load of the desert steppe area were analyzed based on the number of sheep raised in different enclosures and the grazing methods employed. The status of the forage-livestock balance in the study area was assessed after measuring the crop yield of farmland. Finally, data and case support for grazing management in desert steppe were provided in combination with the research results. The study concluded that Gaofen-6 satellite images could quickly and accurately obtain information on vegetation growth and changes in desert grassland areas at a village scale. The available grazing time in a single year in the study area is inadequate to support current stocking levels. When ecological stability is the primary consideration, natural forage obtained through natural conditions cannot meet the needs of farmers for normal grazing and production activities. The suitable grazing time in the study area is limited in any year. The suitable maximum grazing intensity among all plots ranged from 0.334 to 2.541 sheep/ha. In the case of the balance between grass and livestock, the forage obtained from natural pastures could only satisfy 41.71% of the current stocking levels for sheep. Rotational grazing and subsidies for farmers help desert steppe to recover and achieve a forage-livestock balance.

AB  - In salt marshes of the Southeastern USA, purple marsh crabs (Sesarma reticulatum), hereafter Sesarma, aggregate in grazing and burrowing fronts at the heads of tidal creeks, accelerating creek incision into marsh platforms. We explored the effects of this keystone grazer and sediment engineer on salt marsh sediment accumulation, hydrology, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) turnover using radionuclides (Pb-210 and Be-7), total hydrolyzable amino acids (THAA), and C and N stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in sediment from paired Sesarma-grazed and un-grazed creeks. Sesarma-grazed-creek sediments exhibited greater bioturbation and tidal inundation compared to sediments in un-grazed creeks, as indicated by larger Pb-210 and Be-7 inventories. Total organic carbon (TOC) to total nitrogen (TN) weight ratios (C:N) were higher and delta N-15 values were lower in grazed-creek sediments than in un-grazed-creek sediments, suggesting Sesarma remove and assimilate N in their tissues, and excrete N with lower delta N-15 values into sediments. In support of this inference, the percent total carbon (TC) and percent TOC declined by nearly half, percent TN decreased by similar to 80%, and the C:N ratio exhibited a similar to threefold increase between Sesarma fore-gut and hind-gut contents. An estimated 91% of Sesarma's diet was derived from Spartina alterniflora, the region's dominant salt marsh plant. We found that, as Sesarma grazing fronts progress across marsh landscapes, they enhance the decay of Spartina-derived organic matter and prolong marsh tidal inundation. These findings highlight the need to better account for the effects of keystone grazers and sediment engineers, like Sesarma, in estimates of the stability and size of blue C stores in coastal wetlands.

AB  - The Hawaiian Islands have long been seen as relatively devoid of native toxic plant species, a result of the paucity of herbivorous predators in this biogeographically isolated archipelago. This assertion has been subjective, without quantitative comparison to floras that evolved in the presence of such predators. We test this assertion by comparing the richness of toxic species in the native flora of the main Hawaiian Islands to that in the naturalized flora of these islands. That test shows the assertion to be correct: the relative abundance of toxic plant species in the naturalized Hawaiian flora is nearly ten times greater than the relative abundance of those species in the Hawaiian native flora. Of the approximately 150 toxic plant species now found in these islands, 92% are naturalized. The species richness of both native and naturalized Hawaiian plant species correlates positively with island size, as does the richness of toxic native and toxic naturalized plant species. These results, and the lack of significant residuals in species-area relationships across the main Hawaiian Islands, suggest that the relative youth of Hawaii Island is not needed to account for native plant species richness on this island.

AB  - The long-term anthropogenic release of mercury (Hg) into the environment has led to contamination of the biosphere, with all forms of Hg showing toxic effects and the ability to accumulate in organisms. Since the 1970s, efforts have been made in Western Europe to reduce Hg emissions and for the economic use of Hg, leading to a reduction in Hg exposure to humans and entire ecosystems. The purpose of this research was to present the total mercury (THg) burden in three mustelids (the piscivorous Eurasian otter and American mink, and the invertebrativorous European badger) inhabiting north-western Poland (mostly floodplains) and other European countries (literature data). Moreover, we wanted to investigate whether reductions in the environmental Hg burden in Europe have resulted in reductions in liver and kidney levels in wild terrestrial mammals (Eurasian otter, wild boar, red deer, roe deer, cervids, leporids, rodents, and ecotrophic groups: piscivorous mustelids, non-mustelids whose diets include aquatic prey, canids and other carnivores, omnivores, herbivores), between samples collected before and after 2000. We revealed significantly higher nephric THg levels in roadkilled than in trapped American minks. As roadkilled piscivorous mustelids from the same floodplain had similar hepatic and nephric THg concentrations, we suggest that the European research on Hg ecotoxicology should more often use alien American mink instead of the protected Eurasian otter. Badgers inhabiting Polish and other European floodplains bioaccumulated higher amounts of THg than those from other areas, and as such, may be recommended as bioindicator of mercury soil contamination. Our analysis of abundant data on mammalian hepatic and nephric THg concentrations (excluding non-piscivores mustelids) showed that in 12 of 21 cases, Hg concentrations had dropped significantly since 2000. This data signals a reduction in Hg contamination in terrestrial mammals, such as the Eurasian otter, and may be reason for cautious optimism. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In eastern Oregon, western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) encroachment has degraded vast amounts of wildlife habitat; thus, the removal of juniper has become a common restoration practice. Vegetative responses following juniper treatment have been well documented; however, wildlife, especially mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) responses have not. We deployed camera traps at 40 sites within the Phillip W. Schneider Wildlife Area in northeastern Oregon to assess habitat use of wintering mule deer during two winters with different conditions, a mild winter in 2017-2018 and a harsher winter in 2018-2019. We assessed mule deer spatial habitat use using N-mixture models accounting for imperfect detection. We assessed temporal use by fitting kernel density functions to the timestamps of mule deer photographs. Spatial analysis indicated that during a mild winter, mule deer used unburned juniper treatment habitats more than untreated and unburned habitats. Once burned, however, juniper treatment habitats were used the least. During a harsher winter, mule deer spatially responded negatively to total precipitation rather than habitat conditions. Temporal analysis indicated that mule deer did not change their activity pattern between the two winters and used a mosaic of habitats to meet their daily requirements. Our results highlight the importance of juniper removal from encroached sage-steppe habitat but also emphasize the importance of habitat heterogeneity. Our results also demonstrate that wildland fires can negate the benefit of juniper treatment to wintering mule deer. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Understanding the range-wide distribution and abundance of species is critical for their conservation and management. Hog-nosed skunks, genus Conepatus, are an understudied small carnivores' taxa with a broad geographic range across America. However, the factors that shape their distribution are poorly understood and large-scale analyses of Conepatus species' range and ecological niche are absent. On the basis of species occurrence records, large-scale environmental variables (bioclimatic and topographic) and using niche-based species distribution modeling, we estimate the suitable areas and the most important variables that underlie their distribution. Although general pattern of Conepatus distribution is mostly congruent with those described from the literature, C. semistriatus seems to be expanding they distribution range, likely at the expense of changes in anthropogenic land use. Our results show that isothermally (for C. chinga and C. leuconotus) and the mean of the monthly temperature ranges (for C. semistriatus) are the main variables influencing hog-nosed skunks' distribution. Also, the three species responded negatively to the presence of trees. Finally, and according to our models, sites of high habitat suitability, at least for C. chinga, are underrepresented in protected areas. We believe that the geographic and potential distribution maps presented here constitutes a valuable tool to better understand Conepatus ecology as well as for their conservation planning.

AB  - Landscape features influence wildlife movements across spatial scales and have the potential to influence the spread of disease. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease affecting members of the family Cervidae, particularly white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the first positive CWD case in a wild deer in Ohio, USA, was recorded in 2020. Landscape genetics approaches are increasingly used to better understand potential pathways for CWD spread in white-tailed deer, but little is known about genetic structure of white-tailed deer in Ohio. The objectives of our study were to evaluate spatial genetic structure in white-tailed deer across Ohio and compare the support for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by landscape resistance (IBR) models in explaining this structure. We collected genetic data from 619 individual deer from 24 counties across Ohio during 2007-2009. We used microsatellite genotypes from 619 individuals genotyped at 11 loci and haplotypes from a 547-base pair fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. We used spatial and non-spatial genetic clustering tests to evaluate genetic structure in both types of genetic data and empirically optimized landscape resistance surfaces to compare IBD and IBR using microsatellite data. Non-spatial genetic clustering tests failed to detect spatial genetic structure, whereas spatial genetic clustering tests indicated subtle spatial genetic structure. The IBD model consistently outperformed IBR models that included land cover, traffic volume, and streams. Our results indicated widespread genetic connectivity of white-tailed deer across Ohio and negligible effects of landscape features. These patterns likely reflect some combination of minimal resistive effects of landscape features on white-tail deer movement in Ohio and the effects of regional recolonization or translocation. We encourage continued CWD surveillance in Ohio, particularly in the proximity of confirmed cases. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Breeding programs have an essential role in the recovery of threatened populations through optimal genetic management and mating strategies. The dama gazelle (Nanger dama) is a North African ungulate listed as critically endangered. The mhorr subspecies is extinct in the wild and currently survives thanks to the creation in 1971 of an ex situ breeding program. The aim of the present study was to assess the evolution of genetic variability in this mhorr gazelle captive population, as well as the mating strategy used in two reference populations studied (Almeria and Europe). The entire pedigree, with 2739 animals, was analyzed to measure demographic characters, pedigree completeness level, probability of gene origin, level of relatedness and genetic structure of the population. The population size has been progressively increasing, with up to 264 individuals alive in Europe at the time of the study. The average number of equivalent complete generations was 5.55. The effective number of founders and ancestors was both 3, and the founder genome equivalent was 1.99. The genetic contributions of the four main ancestors were unbalanced. The average values of inbreeding and average relatedness for the whole pedigree were, respectively, 28.34% and 50.14%. The effective population size was 8.7 by individual increase in inbreeding and 9.8 by individual increase in coancestry. F-statistics evidenced a very small level of population subdivision (F-ST = 0.033370). The mating strategy used, based on the minimum coancestry of the individuals, has minimized the losses of genetic variability and helped to balance the genetic contributions between ancestors. The strategy also avoided large subdivisions within the population and the appearance of new bottlenecks. This study shows how pedigree analysis can both be used to determine the genetic variability of the population and to assess the influence of the mating strategy used in the breeding program on such variability.

AB  - There is a growing recognition of the significance of unique morphological and physiological adaptation of native warm-season grasses (NWSG) of North America as summer forage resources and major grassland ecosystem components. Defoliation management plays a major role in ensuring eco-friendly utilization of grassland natural resources. To assess sward structural responses of big bluestem (BB, Andropogon gerardii Vitman), eastern gamagrass (GG, Tripsacum dactyloides L.), indiangrass (IG, Sorghastrum nutans L. Nash), and switchgrass (SG, Panicum virgatum L.) stands to seasonal changes in harvest regimes, a five-year forage harvesting trial was conducted, in a randomized complete block design, at Virginia State University's research farm. Vegetation structural response attributes (sward-height, canopy closure, stand density and basal cover) of newly established the NWSG stands to second year changes in harvest regimes were monitored. In 2013, 64 plots of year-old stands of transplanted BB, GG, IG, and SG separated by =120-cm alleys were cut once in early-August and mid-November to suppress weeds and promote tillering. Starting June 2014, each plot had three 1.5-m wide side-by-side harvest-strips cut once-, twice-, or thrice year(-1) (frequencies) ending mid-Oct for four consecutive years followed by a single mid-summer harvest in 26 June 2018, using a forage plot-harvester. In 2015, harvest frequencies for the three- and single-cut strips, in plots 32-64, were switched/flipped once and never reverted. Data was recorded on four early-summer and late-fall sward heights, from each strip at 60-cm intervals before the first and the last harvest, each year. early-spring basal- and canopy-diameter, for mid-April 2015 and 2016, concurrent early-spring canopy light interception, using the LI-191 Line Quantum Sensor, and season-end visual obstruction heights, for stand density in 2016 and 2017. All regrowth sward-heights showed effects of harvest frequency and exhibited compensatory structural responses to the change in harvest regimes. Basal and canopy diameters tended to be greater for the single-cut strips that were previously cut thrice.

AB  - The impact of ungulate browsing on tree saplings has been found to have a negative effect on the regeneration of temperate forests. However, it remains ambiguous whether a relationship exists between browsing intensity and soil quality in natural forests. Therefore, we conducted a study in Roztocza & nacute;skie National Park to investigate the relationship between soil quality and browsing intensity for tree saplings. The aim was to gain a better understanding of how soil quality affects the browsing of ungulates on tree species. Baseline data (sapling height, basal diameter, crown length and width, browsed-shoot diameter, and soil samples) were collected from the 22 belt transects established in the permanent research plots. The soil quality index was calculated using physical and chemical soil properties. Twig dry mass was determined using allometric equations. Species relative density and browsing intensity were assessed through field measurements. Relationships between the variables were established using a linear regression model. The results suggest that browsing intensity is influenced by the gradient of the soil quality index and that it varies between tree species. Along the increasing soil quality gradient, tree species' relative density (p = 0.012) and twig dry mass m-2 (p = 0.005) significantly decreased for A. pseudoplatanus. In contrast, browsing intensity increased significantly with an increasing species relative density for A. pseudoplatanus (p = 0.00) and C. betulus (p = 0.001) and with an increasing twig dry mass for F. sylvatica (p = 0.034) and C. betulus (p = 0.004). Browsing intensity increased significantly with an increasing soil quality index for F. sylvatica (p = 0.027) and decreased significantly for A. pseudoplatanus (p = 0.036). Notably, there was a significant positive relationship between browsing intensity and species relative density and twig dry mass, indicating that ungulate browsing is concentrated where browsing is abundant. These results provide insights that can be used to improve management and conservation strategies to protect tree species vulnerable to ungulate herbivory.

AB  - Forests typically have limited high quality nutrition available to meet the seasonal needs of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) during summer. Prescribed fire is used to enhance deer habitat in pyric-disclimax communities but is normally applied during the dormant season. Historically, lightning-ignited fires in pine systems occurred during summer in the southeastern US, but fire ignited by humans occurred at all times of the year and was most common in fall/winter. The different timing of prescribed fire may be important when trying to couple forage resources with nutritionally demanding periods for herbivores. We evaluated fire-timing effects (dormant season, March; growing season, June; and unburned control) on nutrient availability (crude protein, % phosphorus, and biomass) and nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) for moderate-high use forages of white-tailed deer during summer of 2018 and 2019 in nine mid-rotation loblolly pine stands. Fire increased nutrient content the year of the burn and the increase persisted into the second growing season following growing season fire. Dormant season fire increased protein-and phosphorus-based NCC for two growing seasons but growing season fire reduced biomass during the first year and delayed NCC improvement until the second year. Prescribed fire can be timed to manipulate forage quality, quantity, and improve NCC to recouple forage nutrient supply with herbivore seasonal nutrient demands. We recommend land managers consider diversifying fire timing across the landscape in pyric disclimax systems to support the changing nutrient requirements of large herbivores.

AB  - The effect of forest machinery on the rut formation on extraction trails is an important aspect of forest operations. The aim of this study was to compare how track design and vehicle configuration affects rut formation on straight and curved test trails with no slash mats on peatland. Rut depth was observed from five machine-track combinations on several test plots after several passes and two different trail configurations, straight and curve. The observations (N = 760) were modeled using a mixed model approach to include the variation between the combinations. The results show that rut depth decreases exponentially with soil shear modulus, increases linearly with the number of passes and is not affected with the trail section configuration. The overall coefficient of determination is R-2 = 0.55. A first generation Ponsse Elk with Fomatec tracks (EFwo) showed the lowest rut formation, followed by a first generation Ponsse Elk with Fomatec tracks equipped with add-on track shoes (EFw), a Ponsse Buffalo with KOPA high flotation tracks (Kopa) and a Ponsse Elk 10 W with Olofsfors mixed tracks (E10W), while a Ponsse Elk with long wheelbase bogie and Olofsfors high-flotation tracks (LWB) showed the deepest rut formation. Vehicle dynamics on peatlands are still far from being fully understood and the paper highlights the complexity of the interactions of the variables studied while providing a valid modeling tool with applications in planning of forest operations and simulation.

AB  - Despite the key roles that dispersal plays in individual animal fitness and meta-population gene flow, it remains one of the least understood behaviors in many species. In large mammalian herbivores, dispersals might span long distances and thereby influence landscape-level ecological processes, such as infectious disease spread. Here, we describe and analyze an exceptional long-distance dispersal by an adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the central United States. We also conducted a literature survey to compare the dispersal to previous studies. This dispersal was remarkable for its length, duration, and the life history stage of the dispersing individual. Dispersal is typical of juvenile deer seeking to establish postnatal home ranges, but this dispersal was undertaken by an adult male (age = 3.5). This individual dispersed similar to 300 km over a 22-day period by moving, on average, 13.6 km/day and achieving a straight-line distance of similar to 215 km, which was similar to 174 km longer than any other distance recorded for an adult male deer in our literature survey. During the dispersal, which occurred during the hunting season, the individual crossed a major river seven times, an interstate highway, a railroad, and eight state highways. Movements during the dispersal were faster (mean = 568.1 m/h) and more directional than those during stationary home range periods before and after the dispersal (mean = 56.9 m/h). Likewise, movements during the dispersal were faster (mean = 847.8 m/h) and more directional at night than during the day (mean = 166.4 m/h), when the individual frequently sheltered in forest cover. This natural history event highlights the unpredictable nature of dispersal and has important implications for landscape-level processes such as chronic wasting disease transmission in cervids. More broadly, our study underscores how integrating natural history observations with modern technology holds promise for understanding potentially high impact but rarely recorded ecological events.

AB  - The gut microbiota is integral to the health and adaptability of wild herbivores. Interactions with soil microbiota can shape the composition and function of the gut microbiota, thereby influencing the hosts' adaptive strategies. As a result, soil microbiota plays a pivotal role in enabling wild herbivores to thrive in extreme environments. However, the influence of soil microbiota from distinct regions on host's gut microbiota has often been overlooked. We conducted the first comprehensive analysis of the composition and diversity of gut and soil microbiota in goitered gazelles across six regions in the Qaidam Basin, utilizing source tracking and ecological assembly process analyses. Significant differences were observed in the composition and diversity of soil and gut microbiota among the six groups. Source tracking analysis revealed that soil microbiota in the GangciGC (GC) group contributed the highest proportion to fecal microbiota (8.94%), while the Huaitoutala (HTTL) group contributed the lowest proportion (1.80%). The GC group also exhibited the lowest alpha-diversity in gut microbiota. The observed differences in gut microbial composition and diversity among goitered gazelles from six regions in the Qaidam Basin were closely tied to their adaptive strategies. Ecological assembly process analysis indicated that the gut microbiota were primarily influenced by stochastic processes, whereas deterministic processes dominated most soil microbial groups. Both the differences and commonalities in gut and soil microbiota play essential roles in enabling these gazelles to adapt to diverse environments. Notably, the utilization pattern of soil microbiota by gut microbiota did not align with regional trends in gut microbial alpha-diversity. This discrepancy may be attributed to variations in environmental pressures and the gut's filtering capacity, allowing gazelles to selectively acquire microbiota from soil to maintain homeostasis. This study highlights the significant regional variation in gut and soil microbiota diversity among goitered gazelle populations in the Qaidam Basin and underscores the critical role of soil-derived microbiota in their environmental adaptation.

AB  - Rare species are a crucial component of global biodiversity, contribute disproportionately to ecosystem functions and services, and represent a key target for conservation policies. Examining species rarity across multiple dimensions (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) can offer deeper insights into biodiversity patterns. Using seven years of bottom trawl survey data, along with fish trait and mitochondrial gene information, this study quantified rarity indices for 242 fish species in the central East China Sea, including taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic rarity, as well as species restrictedness. Differences in rarity among fish with different traits were assessed, and the relationships between the various rarity indices were explored using generalized additive models. Finally, taxonomically, functionally and phylogenetically rare species were identified. The results showed that the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic rarity of benthic species was significantly higher compared to benthopelagic and pelagic species. Sedentary species exhibited the highest levels of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic rarity, while mobile species showed the lowest levels of multidimensional rarity. Invertivorous species displayed higher taxonomic and functional rarity, as well as species restrictedness, compared to herbivorous-invertivorous and invertivorous-piscivorous species. Correlations between different rarity indices were very weak. A total of 34 taxonomically rare species, 18 functionally rare species, and 14 phylogenetically rare species were identified, with five species being rare across all three dimensions. Our findings emphasise that, in addition to prioritising taxonomically, functionally, and phylogenetically rare species in conservation, future coastal fish conservation and management efforts should also enhance protection for benthic, sedentary, and invertivorous species.

AB  - Deer impacts on forest vegetation have complicated attempts at forest regeneration in many parts of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic States, and other regions. Deer overabundance limits the success of forest regeneration. One strategy is to reduce deer browsing by temporarily excluding them from regeneration harvests. Because of the costs of fence installation, maintenance, and removal, we developed and tested the feasibility and effectiveness of slash walls. In 2017, 4 regeneration harvests ranging from 4.5 to 30 ha were cut. Slash and trees of marginal value proximate to the perimeter were piled into a slash wall that averaged 3.7 m to the tallest branch and 7.2 m wide. Slash walls occupied from 0.5 to 1.5 ha of the harvest area and used approximately 28,000 kg of slash and low-grade logs per 30 m section. The rate of construction depended on topography along with access to slash and low-grade trees. Construction rates for slash walls varied from 32 m/hr to 77 m/hr. The average cost of construction was $4.82/m ($1.47/ft) based on machine and operator costs of $200 (US)/hr for a weighted average cost of $541/ha ($219/ac). Fence installation can cost 3-4 times as much as slash wall construction, plus additional costs for maintenance and removal. The cost to monitor and maintain slash walls was negligible. Slash wall heights slumped approximately 8-14% per year, which reduced slash wall height by 37 cm per year. Four years after creating the slash walls, the heights of tagged seedlings of palatable species remained significantly greater inside the slash wall where deer were excluded than in adjacent control areas that were accessible to deer. We recommend slash walls minimally be constructed 3.1 m tall to the highest 5-cm-diameter branch, 7 m wide at the base, and sufficiently dense to prevent deer from being able to crawl through. This study is the first documentation of slash walls as a feasible and effective technique during regeneration harvesting to exclude deer from impacting forest vegetation. Subsequent to this study, multiple logging crews have created additional slash walls in CT, MA, NH, NY, and RI as part of commercial harvests.

AB  - 1. Ancient trees have important ecological, historical and social connections, and are a key source of dead and decaying wood, a globally declining resource. Wood-pastures, which combine livestock grazing, open spaces and scattered trees, are significant reservoirs of ancient trees, yet information about their true abundance within wood-pastures is limited. England has extensive databases of both ancient trees and wood-pasture habitat, providing a unique opportunity for the first large-scale, national case study to address this knowledge gap.
   2. We investigated the relationship between the abundance of ancient trees in a large sample of English wood-pastures (5,571) and various unique environmental, historical and anthropogenic predictors, to identify wood-pastures with high numbers of undiscovered ancient trees. A major challenge in many modelling studies is obtaining independent data for model verification: here we introduce a novel model verification step using series of historic maps with detailed records of trees to validate our model predictions. This desk-based method enables rapid verification of model predictions using completely independent data across a large geographical area, without the need for, or limitations associated with, extensive field surveys.
   3. Historic map verification estimates correlated well with model predictions of tree abundance. Model predictions suggest there are similar to 101,400 undiscovered ancient trees in all wood-pastures in England, around 10 times the total current number of ancient tree records. Important predictors of ancient tree abundance included wood-pasture area, distance to several features including cities, commons, historic Royal forests and Tudor deer parks, and different types of soil and land classes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Historical maps and statistical models can be used in combination to produce accurate predictions of ancient tree abundance in wood-pastures, and inform future targeted surveys of wood-pasture habitat, with a focus on those deemed to have undiscovered ancient trees. This study provides support for improvements to conservation policy and protection measures for ancient trees and wood-pastures.

AB  - Forests are important for climate regulation and provide wood and fiber to an increasing human population. Forest systems encompass a large part of the world's land surface area and they are increasingly threatened by several abiotic and biotic factors, including invasive alien species. Generally, the management of damaging nonnative forest insects relies strongly on classical biological control. This is because other Integrated Pest Management tactics may not be readily applicable in forests as these are typically long-lived and structurally complex systems. Given the marked increase in the arrival and establishment of alien forest insects, and the worldwide development of commercial forestry, there is a growing need for classical biological control to achieve persistent pest suppression and to bar the geographical spread of alien pests. Despite much progress in the identification, rearing capacity and release protocols of natural enemies, a limited understanding of pest population ecology and the underlying driving factors, can hinder the effectiveness of classical biological control programs. In this review, we explore the importance of population ecology of forest insects and highlight ecological hypotheses that can serve to lay the groundwork for improved pest management programs in the context of climatic change. While we emphasize the value of classical biological control to manage insect pests in forest systems, especially alien species in novel environments such as in commercial plantations, we draw attention to the need for a better understanding of the processes determining forest insect population dynamics, to secure successful and sustainable pest management programs.

AB  - Macroalgal forests play a key role in shallow temperate rocky reefs worldwide, supporting communities with high productivity and providing several ecosystem services. Sea urchin grazing has been increasingly influencing spatial and temporal variation in algae distributions and it has become the main cause for the loss of these habitats in many coastal areas, causing a phase shift from macroalgae habitats to barren grounds. The low productive barrens often establish as alternative stable states and only a major reduction in sea urchin density can trigger the recovery of macroalgal forests. The present study aims to assess if the 2018 disease outbreak, responsible for a strong reduction in the sea urchin Diadema africanum densities in Madeira Island, was able to trigger a reverse shift from barren grounds into macroalgae-dominated state. By assessing the diversity and abundance of benthic sessile organisms, macroinvertebrates and fishes before, during and after that particular mass mortality event, we evaluate changes in benthic assemblages and relate them to variations in grazer and herbivore densities. Our results revealed a clear shift from barren state to a macroalgae habitat, with barrens characterized by bare substrate, sessile invertebrate and Crustose Coralline Algae (CCA) disappearing after the mortality event. Overall variations in benthic assemblages was best explained by four taxa (among grazers and herbivores species). However, it was the 2018 demise of D. africanum and its density reduction that most contributed to the reverse shift from a long stable barren state to a richer benthic assemblage with higher abundance of macroalgae. Despite this recent increase in macroalgae dominated habitats, their stability and persistence in Madeira Island is fragile, since it was triggered by an unpredictable disease outbreak and depends on how D. africanum populations will recover. With no control mechanisms, local urchin populations can easily reach the tipping point needed to promote a new shift into barren states. New conservation measures and active restoration are likely required to maintain and promote the local stability of macroalgal forests.

AB  - (1) Background: Plant litter decomposition and its effect on soil nutrients are important parts of the ecosystem material cycle, and understanding these processes is key for species selection and allocation, to promote the effective use of litter in ecological tea gardens. (2) Methods: In situ decomposition was used in this study Changes in decomposition rate, element release, and soil properties during the decomposition of the mixed plant residues were measured. (3) Results: The decomposition rate (k) of the CCG (Camellia sinensis + Cinnamomum glanduliferum) mixed plant residue was significantly higher than that of the CS (Camellia sinensis) residue. The decomposition of the CCG, CPM (C. sinensis + Pinus massoniana), and CBL (C. sinensis + Betula luminifera) mixed plant residues showed an additive effect, whereas that of the CCL residue showed an antagonistic effect. The CBL mixed plant residue promoted the release of N; the decomposition of the CCG, CPM, CCL (C. sinensis + Cunninghamia lanceolata), and CBL residues promoted the release of TC (total carbon); and the decomposition of the CCG residue promoted the release of cellulose. After 428 d of decomposition, the four mixed plant residues had improved the soil nutrient contents to some extent.

AB  - Efforts to minimize the environmental impact of livestock production are essential for sustainable agriculture. Immunocastration, using products like Improvac (R), offers an alternative to surgical castration, enabling the physiological advantages of rearing entire male pigs while addressing issues such as boar taint and animal welfare. This review analyzes the effects of immunocastration on the performance and carbon footprint of fattening pigs compared to entire males, gilts, and surgically castrated males. Data from 39 trials reported in research articles were used to extract information on average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and mortality. The means of these parameters were used to calculate the carbon footprint. Results showed that immunocastrated males had a higher mean ADG and a lower mean FCR compared to gilts and surgically castrated males, resulting in 7.1% and 6.8% lower carbon footprints, respectively. However, entire males had a slightly lower carbon footprint than immunocastrated males due to a more favorable FCR, although differences were not statistically significant. The findings underscore the ecological advantage of immunocastration over surgical castration, driven by improved feed efficiency and growth rates. From a sustainability perspective, boar fattening offers the lowest environmental impact, but practical challenges like boar taint and behavioral issues remain. If boar fattening is not feasible, immunocastration emerges as the preferable alternative to surgical castration, aligning with ecological and animal welfare goals. This review highlights the potential of immunocastration to balance productivity and sustainability in fattening pigs while addressing consumer and regulatory concerns.

AB  - Background: Biologging technologies have yielded new insights into the ecology and behaviour of elasmobranchs, but to date, most studies involve animal capture and restraint to attach tags. Capturing animals usually results in a period of atypical behaviour after release and is undesirable or simply not possible for large and vulnerable elasmobranchs such as mobulas and whale sharks. To avoid animal capture and restraint, we developed and tested two noninvasive multisensor towed tags. The use of towed packages creates additional data analytical challenges relative to fixed packages because towed devices wobble independently of animal movements. We present five examples, two mobulas (reef manta and sicklefin devil ray) and three sharks (blue, tiger and whale shark), to illustrate the advantages and challenges of this approach. We used animal-borne video to validate behavioural data derived from accelerometers and conducted an experiment to compare accelerometer data from attached and towed tags simultaneously deployed on a shark.Results: We used fluid dynamic models to calculate the added drag of towed devices on target species. We found that drag impact is acceptable for short-term tagging of large mobulas, but the drag penalty associated with the current camera tag design is greater than 5% for most mature blue sharks. Despite wobble effects, swimming behaviour (tail-beat and wing-stroke frequency) captured by towed accelerometers was consistent with those attached directly to the animal and with data from animal-borne video. Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors recorded up to 28 and 9 geolocations per hour of surface swimming by sicklefin devil ray and blue sharks, respectively.Conclusions: Towed tags with non-invasive attachments provide an effective alternative for acquiring high -resolution behaviour and environmental data without capturing and handling animals. This tool yields great potential to advance current knowledge of mobula ecology and behaviour without capture or invasive tagging.

AB  - The dynamics of ungulate populations across variable ecosystems and management strategies demonstrate disparate trajectories such that some populations are overabundant, while other populations are subject to recovery efforts. Understanding how variation in vital rates such as pregnancy and survival integrate to shape the trajectories of populations is, therefore, helpful for informed management, particularly given that our understanding of the dynamics of harvested ungulate populations is often limited. Age-related variation in vital rates among elk (Cervus canadensis) suggest that suitable population matrix models require age-specific vital rates that can be logistically and analytically challenging to obtain. Our goals were to use a large, long-term data set on elk and hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate age-specific pregnancy and annual survival rates and their process variances, use stochastic population projection matrices to understand the effects of additional mortality from harvest on population dynamics, and identify the influence of different combinations of vital rates on population trajectories. We found that median age-specific pregnancy rates increased with age from yearlings (0.52, 90% credible interval [CrI] = 0.37, 0.65) to a plateau among prime ages (e.g., 9-year-old: 0.91, 90% CrI = 0.87, 0.94), followed by a decline for the oldest ages (e.g., 19-year-old: 0.10, 90% CrI = 0.03, 0.28). Annual survival rates plateaued among prime-aged animals (e.g., 9-year-old: 0.94, 90% CrI = 0.92, 0.96), and declined for the oldest-ages (e.g., 19-year-old: 0.21, 90% CrI = 0.04, 0.56). We found higher process variation in pregnancy rates than survival rates; annual pregnancy rates for a 7-year-old varied from 0.82 (90% CrI = 0.67, 0.92) to 0.98 (90% CrI = 0.95, 0.99), and annual survival rates varied from 0.94 (90% CrI = 0.85, 0.96) to 0.96 (90% CrI = 0.93, 0.99). Simulated population trajectories indicated that additional mortality due to harvest resulted in a shift in the age structure towards younger animals with lower probabilities of pregnancy. When we held calf survival between 0.48 and 0.50 and specified constant pregnancy rates, changes in age structure alone resulted in variation of the recruitment of female calves from 0.20 to 0.16. We found that populations with a low mean value of calf survival (0.25) and no additional mortality due to harvest had marginal demographic performance ( lambda geo over bar = 1.02) and could sustain no additional mortality from harvest and still increase. In contrast, productive populations with a high mean value of calf survival (0.75) required high harvests to abate population growth (e.g., harvest rate = 0.20, lambda geo over bar = 0.94). Finally, we found a temporally lagged effect of harvest on age structure such that a shift towards younger animals could persist for multiple years following a reduction in harvest, suggesting that harvest may have multi-year lagged depressive effects on population growth rates above and beyond the direct effects on survival rates. Our work highlights the importance of considering the effect of varying age-structure on population dynamics, suggests minimum combinations of vital rates required for increasing or decreasing elk population growth rates to general management objectives, and provides the framework required for future management-specific recommendations using stochastic population projection matrices.

AB  - Increases in drought frequency in combination with overgrazing may result in degradation of (semi-) arid ecosystems. Facilitative interactions between plants are a key mechanism in preventing degradation, but it is poorly understood how they respond to increased stress by combined drought and herbivory. In this study, we used an ecohydrological model, to simulate the plant growth of two plant species interacting with each other under different rainfall and herbivory pressure scenarios. The functional traits of the two modeled plants were based on a prior field experiment in southeastern Spain, in which an unpalatable "nurse" species protected a palatable protege' species from herbivory. Moreover, the nurse species was more drought-resistant; that is, it had a lower wilting point, whereas the protege species had a higher optimal growth rate. Firstly, we investigated the coexistence of the two plant species growing under a single limiting resource, focusing on the effect of intra-seasonal rainfall variability. We found that longer periods without rainfall within the wet season resulted in stable coexistence, whereas nearly constant rainfall led to competitive exclusion of the protege by the nurse species. Secondly, we investigated how plant interactions varied along our studied gradients. Using the neighbor effect intensity and importance indices, we found that competitive effects increased with more constant rainfall. Moreover, higher herbivory rates resulted in increased facilitative effects of the nurse on the protege species, but facilitative effects could only prevail over competitive effects under currently observed or higher intra-seasonal rainfall variability. This study highlights the relevance of intra-seasonal rainfall variability in explaining coexistence of species in dryland ecosystems and shows that increasing intra-seasonal rainfall variability or herbivory pressure can result in more facilitative effects from a nurse species. This information is crucial to obtain a better insight into the long-term coexistence of species, and the resulting stability of dryland ecosystems in response to future climate change.

AB  - Investigating the spatial distribution of wildlife contributes to understanding the adaptation of wildlife and conservation management. We assessed the summer spatial distribution of sika deer Cervus nippon in relation to human harvesting and other factors, such as human residences, forage abundance, and cover. Spatial distribution of deer was significantly biased to non-harvesting areas and far from residential areas, suggesting that the deer avoid riskier spaces by establishing a landscape of fear. High-quality food resources (deciduous broad-leaved trees and forbs) were more abundant in harvesting areas than in non-harvesting areas, suggesting that foraging pressure by deer reduce them. However, deer frequently used higher dwarf bamboo abundance areas, suggesting that the dwarf bamboo is an alternative food resource in non-harvesting areas. Our results suggest that human activities shifted the spatial distribution of deer to areas far from human activities, such as subalpine/alpine zones, which may increase damage to vulnerable ecosystems due to severe foraging pressure. It has been known that harvesting by humans strongly influences individual within-home range habitat selection of many deer species; however, little is known about the effect of harvesting on coarse-scale habitat selection (i.e., spatial distribution). We examined the summer spatial distribution of sika deer Cervus nippon in relation to human harvesting and other factors, such as human residences, forage abundance, and cover, using pellet group counts at Mount Fuji, central Japan, in 2018. In the study area, harvesting is conducted at medium elevation areas throughout the year, but not at high or low elevation areas where access is difficult or harvesting is prohibited. Spatial distribution of deer was significantly biased to non-harvesting areas and far from residential areas, suggesting that they avoid riskier spaces by establishing a landscape of fear. High-quality food resources (deciduous broad-leaved trees and forbs) were more abundant in harvesting areas than in non-harvesting areas, suggesting that foraging pressure by deer reduce them. However, there were no differences in abundances of more fibrous dwarf bamboo between harvesting and non-harvesting areas, and spatial distribution of deer was significantly biased to higher dwarf bamboo abundance areas, suggesting that the dwarf bamboo is an alternative food resource in non-harvesting areas where supplies of high-quality food were limited. Our results suggest that human harvesting pressure and residences shifted the spatial distribution of deer from the montane forests to subalpine/alpine zones, which may increase damage to vulnerable ecosystems due to severe foraging pressure.

AB  - Simple Summary The skin is one of the largest surface organs for animals. The microbiome of the skin plays an important role in protecting the host. The study showed that the environment in which the animals lived and their size could affect the bacterial composition of their skin. Additionally, individual differences between the bacterial composition of the skin were observed, which may indicate the existence of a factor called "individual influence". For decades, skin has been assigned the main role of an insulator of the inside of the body from the external environment, but it also plays a role in maintaining homeostasis. In this study, the level of selected bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria) was assessed in three sheep breeds (Swiniarka sheep, Uhruska sheep and BCP line (synthetic sheep breed; n = 6) and in two breeds of goats (Boer, Saenian; n = 6) living in the same environment and fed on the same feed, where the aim was to identify differences in terms of race, species and individual differences. Significant differences were found in Firmicute, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla (p <= 0.05). Statistically significant and positive correlations were demonstrated between Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The obtained results suggest that the species and racial differences in the level of the studied bacterial phyla may also result from the physicochemical differences of the skin surface, as they could exacerbate the variations in humidity, temperature, composition of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and lipid content. In addition, individual differences were observed, which indicate a similar effect of an individual on the microbiological composition of its organism.

AB  - Many insular plant taxa naturally consist of small populations, which are increasingly impacted today by herbivory, climate change, and competition with invasive plants. Are some insular species fated to extinction or do they still have potential to recover? To help explore this question, we studied Schiedea adamantis, a federally endangered shrub from the Hawaiian island of O'ahu where it was originally known as a single population. This population underwent a population crash in the late 1990s, declining from >250 plants to a handful of plants before several more individuals were discovered nearby. Fortunately, plants grown from seed obtained before the bottleneck had been maintained ex situ in California. Using microsatellite markers, we confirmed that levels of genetic variation were lower in the bottlenecked population compared to the pre- bottleneck and offspring collections, but overall levels remained moderate in the wild population despite the severe reduction in size. The four remaining field individuals consisted of one plant that likely persisted through the bottleneck and its progeny. The ex situ offspring collection contained four unique alleles, indicating the value of these collections maintained offsite. Subsequently, new plants located downslope from the original population and a second genetically different population on the same island were also discovered, although numbers continue to decline. In addition to ongoing reintroduction efforts, levels of genetic variation and discovery of new individuals holds promise for in situ survival of this species, but only if its habitat can be protected from fire, increased drought, and competition from invasive species.

AB  - Models of herbivorous insect phenology can be used to make agriculture more sustainable and to better manage the effects of climate change on natural communities. The phenology of herbivorous insects depends on heat time, but exactly how it varies across populations and the causes of this variation are unclear. Here, with multilevel Bayesian models, we performed a comparative analysis of 601 published herbivorous insect phenology models. We found that variation in herbivorous insect phenology can be explained by variation in phylogenetic relatedness, adult body size, feeding site, host plant taxonomy, geographic location, and the approaches that researchers used for model parameterization. Contrary to previous analysis, we also found that the minimum temperature required for development varies across life stages in a way that could be adaptive. Our analysis demonstrates that by accounting for more information on the variation across insect populations and their environments, we can make better and more generalizable predictions of herbivorous insect phenology.

AB  - Aerial surveys can efficiently monitor populations of large animals in geographically extensive management units but are time- and cost-intensive. Biologists often design population surveys to balance cost, spatial coverage, and precision in estimates of population size. Demographic ratio data from aerial surveys are an important component of population monitoring and management, yet the error of ratio data remains under-appreciated, especially for low-density populations. We quantified error in juvenile:female, male:female, and young:mature male ratios from 177 helicopter surveys of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in 37 wildlife management units encompassing 3,269 km(2) of semi-arid grasslands and brush in South Texas, USA, during 2011-2015. We classified error (the % difference between the mean and the limits of the confidence interval) of surveys as appropriate for research-based (=25% error) or monitoring surveys (=50% error). Overall, error usually met criteria for monitoring surveys but not for research-based surveys; male:female (x = 32% error) and juvenile:female (x = 37%) ratios had smaller errors than young:mature male ratios (x = 51%). As number of detections increased, errors declined; minimum number of detections for both components of a given ratio needed for monitoring and research-based surveys was about 30-40 and 150-185 at the 90% confidence interval and 45-60 and 210-230 at the 95% confidence interval, respectively. Acceptable error to reliably detect changes in demographic ratios may require greater survey effort or a different survey design for low-density populations. Furthermore, obtaining sufficient detections for acceptable error of male age structure estimates may not be feasible. Error of demographic ratios is an important consideration given their role in the design of harvest plans, evaluation of the effects of management, and tracking the effect of diseases, such as chronic wasting disease. The high effort required to obtain acceptable error with ratio data in areas with low deer densities indicates that helicopter surveys may not be an ideal platform to investigate fine-scale variation in demographic data. Managers will have to consider trade-offs between expenses and variance of ratio data collected from aerial surveys and whether obtaining acceptable error with ratio data is feasible given deer densities and detection probabilities are site-specific.

AB  - Priority habitat types (HTs) within the Natura 2000 network are of the highest importance for conservation in Europe. However, they often occur in smaller areas and their conservation status is not well understood. One such HT is that of the Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines (9180*). The Natura 2000 study site, Boc-Haloze-Donacka gora, in the Sub-Pannonian region of eastern Slovenia is characterized by a matrix of European beech forests and includes rather small, fragmented areas covered by Tilio-Acerion forests. The goal of this research was to examine the heterogeneity and conservation status of the selected HT through field mapping, which was performed in the summer of 2020. As the conservation of HT calls for a more detailed approach, we distinguished between the following four pre-defined habitat subtypes: (i) Acer pseudoplatanus-Ulmus glabra stands growing mostly in concave terrain, (ii) Fraxinus excelsior stands growing on slopes, (iii) Tilia sp. stands with thermophilous broadleaves occurring on ridges and slopes, (iv) Acer pseudoplatanus stands occurring on more acidic soils with an admixture of Castanea sativa. Field mapping information was complemented with the assessment of habitat subtype characteristics using remote sensing data. The results showed that habitat subtypes differed significantly in terms of area, tree species composition, forest stand characteristics, relief features and the various threats they experienced (e.g., fragmentation, tree mortality, ungulate browsing pressure). The differences between subtypes were also evident for LiDAR-derived environmental factors related to topography (i.e., terrain steepness and Topographic Position Index). This study provides a baseline for setting more realistic objectives for the conservation management of priority forest HTs. Due to the specificities of each individual habitat subtype, conservation activities should be targeted to the Natura 2000 habitat subtype level.

AB  - The Balkan Peninsula is considered to have acted as a glacial refugium as well as a biogeographic crossroads during the Pleistocene, playing an important role in the survival of biota and population dynamics through time. Furthermore, rather than being a homogeneous habitat, it is thought to have hosted a number of diverse, isolated "refugia within refugia," providing suitable conditions for the persistence of different plant and animal species, as well as, potentially, Pleistocene hominins. We present the first palynological and charcoal record, although discontinuous, from the middle Pleistocene archaeological site Marathousa 1 (MAR-1; Megalopolis Basin) to reconstruct the local environment along with the first multispecies record of coprophilous fungal spores from Greece to track herbivore activity during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 12. Our data show that during the early and late MIS 12, when the forest cover substantially decreased, mesophilous trees and aquatic vegetation persisted, reflecting wetter and milder conditions at MAR-1. Herbivore presence is documented by similar to 473 ka, while its intensification coincides with increased vegetation biomass and local fire activity during the late MIS 12. Our findings suggest that MAR-1 likely served as a glacial refugium for middle Pleistocene hominins, providing essential resources for their survival during MIS 12.

AB  - Over 150 species of earthworms are known from the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest, but many more are expected to live in this megadiverse biome. In the present study, we evaluated earthworm species occurrence and diversity in native and reforested areas in four National Forests in three Brazilian states: Tres Barras National Forest (Santa Catarina), Irati and Pirai do Sul National Forests (Parana) and Capao Bonito National Forest (Sao Paulo) using formalin and hand sorting methods. A total of 13 species were found, five exotic and eight natives (of which four were new, undescribed species), belonging to six genera and five families (Rhinodrilidae, Glossoscolecidae, Ocnerodrilidae, Benhamiidae, Megascolecidae). In general, higher number of earthworms were collected in Araucaria plantations, except in Capao Bonito where Pinus sp. plantations had higher abundance. Hand sorting also collected more species in all forests, so this should be the preferred sampling method to evaluate earthworm communities. Formalin extraction was efficient only for epi-endogeic earthworms, most of them exotic species. Exotic pine species plantations tend to reduce species richness and abundance, compared with native forests and Araucaria plantations, and substitution of native vegetation for pine plantations should consider potential negative effects on soil animal populations.

AB  - The increases in ungulate populations and hunting bags throughout Europe and North America have resulted in higher carcass numbers available for mesocarnivore species in temperate and boreal forests. The increase in food resources can sustain denser predator populations, potentially affecting prey species such as the threatened western capercaillie Tetrao urogallus. We investigated the ungulate population trends in recent decades and the carrion use by facultative scavengers in areas of the Pyrenees occupied by capercaillie to assess the potential effects on predation of nests and adult birds, and on its population trend. We found a significant increase in the number of ungulates harvested during the period of sharp capercaillie population decline. Carrion was provided experimentally in forested areas occupied by capercaillie showing that remains were mainly consumed by red fox Vulpes vulpes, followed by wild boar Sus scrofa and marten species (Martes sp.). Season (cold or warm) was the most important factor determining scavenging activity in most species. Main predators of capercaillie nests and adults were martens and red fox, with no predation by wild boar. Our data show that main predators of capercaillie are the same species that mainly consume carrion, especially in winter, and that plentiful carrion resources could maintain higher populations of these species, potentially increasing predation pressure on the capercaillie population. This study shows that managing carrion arising from hunting activity in areas of capercaillie distribution is a necessary management action to reduce the available carrion biomass and so reduce the impact of mesocarnivores on capercaillie conservation.

AB  - Accurate description of animal diets is central to ecology. Analyses based on DNA metabarcoding of faecal samples is used increasingly as a non-invasive and accurate method to determine animal diets. In this chapter, I introduce the brief history of molecular-based diet analyses and present the basic workflow of the metabarcoding diet analyses: sampling, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing, data processing and taxon identification of food DNA sequences, with several important notes to obtaining reliable data from degraded faecal DNA. The method's limitations and technical challenges, such as possible contamination and uncertainty of quantification etc., which require special consideration in research planning and data interpretation, are also discussed. This chapter will help users, especially new scientists, who are considering using the metabarcoding approach in their studies, understand the principles and processes of metabarcoding. I also hope this chapter will facilitate developments in this method and answer broader ecological questions related to trophic interactions.

AB  - Objective The admixture of domestic pig into wild boar populations is controlled until now, by cytogenetic analysis. Even if a first-generation hybrid animal is discernable because of its 37-chromosome karyotype, the cytogenetic method is not applicable in the case of advanced intercrosses. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the use of SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) markers as an alternative technology to characterize recent or past hybridization between the two sub-species. The final goal would be to develop a molecular diagnostic tool. Data description The Geneseek Genomic Profiler High-Density porcine beadchip (GGP70KHD, Illumina, USA), comprising 68,516 porcine SNPs, was used on a set of 362 wild boars with diverse chromosomal statuses collected from different areas and breeding environments in France. We generated approximately 62,192-64,046 genotypes per wild boar.

AB  - Asian elephants are endangered while they have faced similar to 70% population decline in India in the last 60 years. Climate change projections indicate exacerbation of ongoing habitat loss (>40%) by 2070, potentially impacting genetic structure of wild elephants across India. Therefore, we provide consolidated baseline data on genetic diversity and structure of elephants across four eco-regions of India, i.e., north-western (NW), north-eastern (NE), east-central (ECI), and southern India (SI), to identify populations at greater risk of further divergence. We genotyped 169 faecal samples across 14 microsatellites with 90.0% overall success rate. The genetic diversity levels were moderate and varied between the eco-regions (H-E=0.57-0.74). Allelic richness was higher in NE (3.73-3.78) and SI (3.62-3.71). We observed a high inbreeding coefficient in NE (F-IS=0.55-0.58) compared to the other elephant populations, probably due to the presence of related individuals in our samples. Genetic differentiation between populations using F-ST statistics (F-ST=0.06-0.18) was significant. Bayesian and multivariate analyses identified three major genetic clusters in India - NW, NE, and combined ECI-SI, mostly consistent with their geographic distribution. We also observed an unexpected pattern of high genetic distance between adjacent populations. This fine-scale genetic structure suggests the presence of barriers (natural and anthropogenic) and complex social organisation. Additionally, incipient sub-structuring within NE and SI indicates potential genetic discontinuity. These results highlight the importance of maintaining genetic diversity, particularly of NE and ECI populations, by retaining habitat connectivity and ensuring gene flow for effective elephant conservation in India.

AB  - While dispersal is the basis of inter-population connectivity, it is difficult to directly observe. New molecular techniques provide ways of studying the intensity and direction of dispersal among populations through quantifying gene flow. When herbivores disperse their gut microbes travel with the host, and gut microbiota is known to play an important role in host health. However, the current understanding of the driving mechanism between moose dispersal patterns and gut microbial structure is vague. Therefore, when we observe the effects of climate warming on gene flow, it is important to understand the ecological mechanisms that affect the gut microbiota. We applied integrative methods from molecular biology, nutritional ecology and microbiomics to quantify dispersal patterns of moose populations in northeast China and explore the ecological mechanisms driving gut microbe-host associations. We found that moose populations in northeast China are undergoing two dispersal patterns while retreating in a northwesterly direction. Dispersing and isolated moose populations differed in their gut microbial composition and frequency of functional types that relate to digestion and diet composition. We also found that the environmental variables related to the moose gut microbial communities also changed with different dispersal patterns. The gut microbiota of isolated moose populations was only related to ambient temperature, whereas the microbiota in dispersing moose populations was related to longitude and diet protein content. We expect that the differences in the taxonomic and functional structure of gut microbiota relating to digestion are adaptive. Consequently, this study highlights that special attention should be placed on the management of isolated moose populations, and ecological corridors or translocation of moose individuals may be needed to allow persistence in the face of global warming; doing this will likely improve the adaptability of gut microbiota.

AB  - Since volatile organic compounds (VOCs) shape plant defenses against pests, ecologists strive to understand their sources of variation. The worldwide distribution of tomato offers an ideal system to explore the ecological diversity of VOCs produced by plants supporting a large range of local adaptations. In this study, we analyzed the diversity of VOC profiles released by 29 accessions of tomato belonging to five species with different natural histories and including domesticated plants and wild relatives. In addition, olfactometer assays were performed on 10 accessions characterized by strong differences in VOC emissions to test the consequences on host-plant location by a major pest specialized on solanaceous plants, Tuta absoluta. Based on 77 VOCs detected, our results suggest that the large diversity of volatile profiles reflect different biogeographic areas. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to test phylogenetic drivers in VOC emissions. The richness of volatile profiles and sesquiterpenoid emissions were relatively high in ancestral branches and decreased exponentially with evolution according to early-burst patterns. In olfactometer assays, we identified four repellent accessions belonging to S. pennellii, S. habrochaites and S. cheesmaniae. This study points out the importance of inter- and intra-specific diversity of VOCs in antixenosis. Further, our results suggest that methyl salicylate, beta-myrcene and sesquiterpenoids such as (3E,7E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene or alpha-curcumene could serve as repellents against T. absoluta. In a greenhouse, we confirmed the biological relevance of agroecological research interested in screening repellent plants. Bridging chemical ecology with phylogenetic approaches helps to better understand the evolution of mechanisms supporting anti-herbivore plant defenses.

AB  - Wildlife populations cannot grow indefinitely; however, natural mechanisms of population regulation may be unknown for species undergoing prolonged harvest or persecution. Poached across the continent for centuries, African elephants have seldom been subject to natural mechanisms of population regulation. However, increased protections have removed the top-down control of poaching, leading some elephant populations to rebound. Maintaining healthy populations and ecosystems throughout the elephant's range requires a better understanding of the natural ways in which elephant populations are regulated. We analyzed 24 years of data on an African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) population in Tanzania, finding rapid and sustained population growth immediately following cessation of poaching. Annual survival was high and contributed 15.2 times more to population growth than recruitment. An upward shifting age structure, high elephant densities and anthrax outbreaks were negatively associated with survival, representing 62.4 % of variable importance. This suggests that disease is a key density-dependent mechanism for regulating elephant populations, capable of rapid population stabilization. However, patterns of anthrax outbreaks are variable across elephant populations, necessitating a better understanding of the diversity and drivers of anthrax outbreaks, and effects on elephant vital rates. Although rainfall has been suggested as an important factor for anthrax outbreak frequency and severity, we found no evidence for mediation of anthrax effects by rainfall in our survival models. Nevertheless, managers should be aware of the natural mechanisms of elephant population regulation, including disease-related feedbacks, and the potential role of changing precipitation patterns, when making decisions for elephant conservation and management throughout Africa.

AB  - In many regions of the world, large populations of native wildlife have declined or been replaced by livestock grazing areas and farmlands, with consequences for terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem connectivity and trophic resources supporting food webs in aquatic ecosystems. The river continuum concept (RCC) and the riverine productivity model (RPM) predict a shift of energy supplying aquatic food wets along rivers: from terrestrial inputs in low-order streams to autochthonous production in mid-sized rivers. In Afromontane savanna landscapes, the shifting numbers of large mammalian wildlife present a physical continuum whose ecological implications for rivers is not clearly understood. Here, we studied the influence of replacing large wildlife (mainly hippos) with livestock on the fractional contribution of C3 vegetation, C4 grasses and periphyton on macroinvertebrates in the Mara River, which is an African montane-savanna river known to receive large subsidy fluxes of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients mediated by large mammalian herbivores (LMH), both wildlife and livestock, in its middle and lower reaches. Using stable carbon (VC) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes, we identified spatial patterns in the fractional contribution of allochthonous organic matter from C3 and C4 plants (woody vegetation and grasses, respectively) and autochthonous energy from periphyton for macroinvertebrates at various sites of the Mara River and its tributaries. Potential energy sources and invertebrates were sampled at 80 sites spanning stream orders 1 to 7, various catchment land uses (forest, agriculture and grasslands) and different loading rates of organic matter and nutrients by LMH (livestock and wildlife, i.e., hippopotamus). The fractional contribution of different sources of energy for macroinvertebrates along the river did not follow predictions of the RCC and RPM. First, the fractional contribution of C3 and C4 carbon was not related to river order or location along the fluvial continuum but to the loading of organic matter (dung) by both wildlife and livestock. Notably, C4 carbon was important for macroinvertebrates even in large river sections inhabited by hippos. Second, even in small 1st -3rd order forested streams, periphyton was a major source of energy for macroinvertebrates, and this was fostered by livestock inputs fuelling aquatic primary production throughout the river network. Importantly, our results show that replacing wildlife (hippos) with livestock shifts river systems towards greater reliance on autochthonous sources of energy through an algae-grazer pathway as opposed to reliance on allochthonous inputs of C4 carbon through a detrital pathway.

AB  - Dhole (Cuon alpinus) is threatened with extinction across its range due to habitat loss and prey depletion. Despite this, no previous study has investigated the distribution and threat of the species at a regional scale. This lack of knowledge continues to impede conservation planning for the species. Here we modeled suitable habitat using presence-only camera trap data for dhole and dhole prey species in mainland Southeast Asia and assessed the threat level to dhole in this region using an expert-informed Bayesian Belief Network. We integrated prior information to identify dhole habitat strongholds that could support populations over the next 50 years. Our habitat suitability model identified forest cover and prey availability as the most influential factors affecting dhole occurrence. Similarly, our threat model predicted that forest loss and prey depletion were the greatest threats, followed by local hunting, non-timber forest product collection, and domestic dog incursion into the forest. These threats require proactive resource management, strong legal protection, and cross-sector collaboration. We predicted <20% of all remaining forest cover in our study area to be suitable for dhole. We then identified 17 patches of suitable forest area as potential strongholds. Among these patches, Western Forest Complex (Thailand) was identified as the region's only primary stronghold, while Taman Negara (Malaysia), and northeastern landscape (Cambodia) were identified as secondary strongholds. Although all 17 patches met our minimum size criteria (1667 km(2)), patches smaller than 3333 km(2) may require site management either by increasing the ecological carrying capacity (i.e., prey abundance) or maintaining forest extent. Our proposed interventions for dhole would also strengthen the conservation of other co-occurring species facing similar threats. Our threat assessment technique of species with scarce information is likely replicable with other endangered species.

AB  - The spatial structure and composition of urban parks play a crucial role in shaping bird communities by determining the availability and quality of suitable sites for nesting, feeding, and shelter. In this study, we investigated bird communities inhabiting urban parks and squares in Dnipro, Ukraine, during the breeding seasons of 2022-2024. Using transect counts, information-logical data analysis, and ecological data classification methods, we analyzed bird species composition and their substrate preferences to identify ecological clusters. Based on substrate preferences and ecological adaptations, we identified 12 distinct clusters, some of which reflect different levels of hemeroby - the degree of anthropogenic impact on ecosystems. Species such as the lesser whitethroat (Sylvia curruca), tree pipit (Anthus trivialis), icterine warbler (Hippolais icterina), and common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) were rarely found in urban parks due to specific habitat requirements, indicating areas of low hemeroby. Conversely, species like the woodpigeon (Columba palumbus), common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), and fieldfare (Turdus pilaris) were more prevalent, suggesting areas with moderate to high levels of hemeroby. Moreover, we identified bird species that exhibit remarkable adaptability, thriving both in urban park areas and natural habitats. These include the great tit (Parus major), hooded crow (Corvus cornix), and chaffinch (Fringil- la coelebs). Their widespread presence across diverse environments underscores their ecological versatility and importance in both urban and natural ecosystems. The widespread presence of species such as the tree sparrow (Passer montanus) indicates significant ecological transformation within these urban parks. These findings emphasize the importance of specific habitat features in supporting diverse bird communities and reveal varying degrees of species sensitivity to urbanization. The presence of these species in park bird communities allows one to assess the level of anthropogenic landscape transformation and can be used for monitoring the ecological state of urban areas. The results underscore the critical importance of conserving and restoring diverse habitats in urban parks and squares, which will support a wide range of bird species, including those adapted to urban environments and those more sensitive to changes.

AB  - BACKGROUND The in vitro gas production technique has been used to evaluate forage fermentation kinetics. However, individual and animal species variation can change fermentation patterns due to differences in ruminal environment and microbiota. The aim was to verify whether rumen inoculum (RI) of llama had superior intrinsic digestion capacity and reduced methane (CH4) production compared to sheep RI using fescue and paspalum hay as substrates. RESULTS Dry and organic matter (OM) digestibility produced with llama RI tended to exceed that of sheep (P = 0.099 and 0.074, respectively) at 24 h of incubation. However, at 48 h, the sheep RI presented higher substrate digestibility and asymptotic value of gas production than that of llama (P < 0.010). CH4 production showed no differences between RI or substrates (P > 0.050). The NH3-N and total volatile fatty acid concentrations were greater in the RI of llamas compared to those of sheep (P < 0.050). Acetate and butyrate proportions and acetate-to-propionate ratio were greater in the RI of llamas compared to those of sheep (P < 0.001) at 24 and 48 h. However, propionate proportion was greater in sheep compared with llama (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Llama RI tended to surpass that of sheep in dry and OM digestibility at 24 h of incubation, but sheep RI at 48 h presented a higher digestibility and gas production value than llama RI. No differences between the two species were detected for CH4 production. This study showed that llama RI did not perform better than sheep RI in digesting low-quality forages.

AB  - Damage on forests by large wild herbivores, especially by red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) has been increasing in Central Europe including Slovakia. Therefore, we attempted to estimate the forage potential, i.e. potentially available bark for consumption by large wild herbivores and actually consumed bark of common rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) and goat willow (Salix caprea L.). For these purposes, we measured basic tree characteristics and dimensions (length and width) of wounds due to bark browsing at 15 plots located in a young mixed forest stand (Javorniky Mts; Slovakia). Browsing was recorded separately for four stem sections: 0-50, 51-100, 101-150, and 151-200 cm measured from the ground level. Three stem bark browsing metrics were implemented: browsed bark area (cm(2)), browsed bark mass (g) and portion of browsed bark mass to total stem bark mass representing potential forage for game expressed in percent. We proved that while common rowan and goat willow were browsed in a great extent, nearly no damage occurred on stems of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.). Our estimates showed that the total forage potential of stem bark at common rowan and goat willow was about 13.4 kg per 100 m(2) of a forest stand. We learnt from our estimates for instance that the total available stem bark at 100 m(2) of our young mixed forest might suffice (if theoretically entire potential was exploited) for red deer, fallow deer (Dama dama L.) and mouflon (Ovis aries musimon L.) for one, two and nearly four weeks, respectively. At the same, that during four years, large wild herbivores browsed nearly 2.6 kg of bark per 100 m(2) area, i.e. about 1/5 of the available potential on rowans and willows. It seems like common rowan and goat willow might generate important resources of forage for large wild herbivores and would be treated as a part of biological protection of target tree species against bark browsing.

AB  - Hawaiian dryland ecosystems are important for global biodiversity conservation and contain numerous species threatened with extinction. Over the past century, wildfire frequency and size have increased dramatically because of invasion by fire-promoting non-native invasive species, greatly threatening these ecosystems. Native species restoration is a tool that can disrupt the cycle of increased fire and invasion in lowland dry forest communities, but restoration prescriptions have not been studied systematically in other dryland plant communities. We examined the restoration of three Hawaiian dryland plant communities (a high-productivity Diospyros sandwicensis and Metrosideros polymorpha lowland dry forest (HP), a moderate-productivity Myoporum sandwicense and Sophora chrysophylla dry forest/woodland (MP), and a low-productivity Dodonaea viscosa shrubland (LP)), using a community-assembly framework to understand the abiotic and biotic constraints to species establishment and growth in each community. Because active restoration methods are often needed, at both high and low levels of productivity, we also examined restoration treatments and outcomes across the three sites, which spanned a gradient of rainfall and substrate age. At each site, we used the same factorial field experiment with three factors: habitat quality (high or low), weed control (yes or no), and species addition (none, seeding, or outplanting). Outplants (cohort 1) and seeds were added in the winter of 2009-2010, and outplants were added again in March 2011 (cohort 2). Dispersal limitation was apparent at the LP and HP sites, but was not observed in the MP site, which had, overall, greater native diversity and abundance. Outplant survival was greater in high-quality habitats at the HP site, likely due to reduced abiotic stress. Invasive species were found in greater abundance in certain types of microsites at the LP and MP sites, suggesting that shade or topography can be used to plan restoration and weed-control activities. Overall, active restoration methods improved restoration outcomes at the high- and low-productivity sites, and less so at the moderately productive site. Weed removal and outplanting were effective restoration prescriptions at the LP and HP sites, and habitat quality could also be used to increase survival at the HP site. Active restoration could be a lower priority for moderately invaded, moderate-productivity communities, which have the capability to maintain a native ecosystem state.

AB  - Mud crabs (Scylla serrata) play crucial roles in coastal ecosystems, and their intestinal microbiota might be greatly affected by the habitats. Illumina NovaSeq sequencing was used to identify the intestinal microbiota of wild S. serrata and the microbiomes in ambient water and sediment in the Koggala lagoon of Sri Lanka. The study found significant differences in the microbiota of mud crab intestines, lagoon water, and sediment. The microbial communities in lagoon sediment and water were richer and more diverse than those in the crab intestine, exclusively detecting 90.66% of microbes in the intestinal microbiota. The lagoon water and sediment showed distinct planktonic and sediment microbiota, with 96.08% and 90.13% differences, respectively, while only 2.8% of classified intestinal microbes, including Photobacterium, Carboxylicivirga, Acinetobacter, Clostridiumsensu stricto 1, Desulfovibrio, Bacillus, and Bacteroides could be detected in the water and sediment. Even if its proportion is small, Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae is a known pathogen, particularly in marine environments and aquaculture. However, the genomic analysis in this study revealed factors that do not contribute to pathogenicity, suggesting that P. damselae subsp. damselae is not pathogenic to S. serrata in Koggala Lagoon. Notably, Vibrio, Shewanella, Stenotrophomonas and Desulfovibrio exhibit a greater propensity to colonize the intestine of S. serrata. The planktonic and sediment microbiota might play an essential role in biogeochemical cycling, especially in nitrification, carbon, and sulfur cycling. Furthermore, harmful Cyanobium, has been detected in the intestine of S. serrata and lagoon water and sediment habitats, might have adverse effects on the ecosystem and human health. Based on the chloroplast 16S rRNA gene sequences, the terrestrial plant materials found in the intestine of S. serrata suggest less herbivorous feeding habits. Our results could provide implications for the effective management of the mud crab, S. serrata in its natural habitat.

AB  - The recent decline in the health status of deep-sea habitats around the world has pushed the need to document and map their distribution to preserve them in their marine ecosystems. This work describes deep-water coral habitats (133-729 m) and their associated communities, based on nine ROV video transects. These transects cover a 171 km sub-seafloor profile within a predefined 5560 km2 area along the North Atlantic coast of Morocco, surveyed in 2020 as part of a coral habitat mapping study under the FAO-NANSEN programme. The nine sites were initially explored using multibeam echosounder, to generate a detailed bathymetry map allowing for the positioning of video transects. Megafauna and sediment composition was recorded along transects, and in total 1854 individuals were annotated, and 59 taxa were identified. To identify coral communities and related species assemblages, we used a cluster analysis for classification and the ordination analysis Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) to identify the environmental drivers behind the community patterns. Eight environmental variables were compared with the DCA ordination results, and the important variables were bedrock, mud and depth. The results revealed six megabenthic communities. Three groups were associated with soft sediments, mainly mud. Group I, at depths of 605-726 m, was characterized by Ceriantharia and Synaphobranchus kaupii. Group V, at 133 m depth, was dominated by Ceriantharia. Group VI, consisting of Centrostephanus sp. and a fish community (Scorpaenidae, Capros aper, and Macroramphosus sp.), was found at 201 m depth. In mixed bottoms, where mud is the dominant substrate, Group II was characterized by Crinoidea and sea pens (Funiculina quadrangularis and Virgularia mirabilis) at a depth range of 207-369 m, while Group III, found at depths of 465-602 m, was characterized by sea pens (Pennatula phosphorea and Funiculina quadrangularis), Crinoidea, and the key species Isidella elongata. Group IV, at 207 m depth, was represented by Sertularella sp. and Ellisella paraplexauroides as the dominant species. This first study about mapping deep sea coral habitats in the North Atlantic coast of Morocco reveals the identification of different habitats and new species. It contributes to Strengthen Science for Conservation and Sustainable Management of Deep-Water Corals in Morocco.

AB  - Feeding and spatial distribution of Caucasian chamois and domestic sheep were studied in the eastern Caucasus. Trophic analysis showed that the chamois diet consisted of 12 herbaceous species and 21 for sheep. Chamois selected forbs and fabaceous species, whereas sheep foraged less selectively. The trophic niche breadth (averaged) of sheep was significantly greater (9.75) than that of chamois (4.33). Trophic niche overlap reached 86% in spring and 56.6% in autumn, and the summer spatial niche breadth of chamois was lower (0.83) than that of sheep (1.46). The spatial niche overlapping of both species was low (17%). Five environmental parameters made the highest contributions to interspecific differences. Chamois habitats in spring were characterised by a lower total phytomass level and higher-calorie herbaceous group biomass (forbs, fabaceous) than in sheep-grazing areas, whereas in autumn, the high-calorie herbaceous-group biomass was higher in chamois habitats than in sheep pastures. We deduce that the chamois spatial pattern is a potential response to sheep presence; chamois moves to difficult-to-reach habitats. Therefore, ecological segregation could be potentially expected due to divergence along the spatial axis of the ecological niche.

AB  - The Cuvier's gazelle ( Gazella cuvieri) is an endemic species to the Maghreb region, with a range extending from Morocco to Tunisia. Understanding the ecological requirements and distribution patterns of this species is crucial for its conservation. In this study, we employed MaxEnt species distribution modelling (SDM) and explored spatiotemporal niches to investigate the distribution of G. cuvieri in Northwestern Algeria. We selected 10 out of 23 environmental variables for the final dataset to understand their effect on the distribution of the Cuvier's gazelle. Model accuracy was high for Cuvier's gazelle distribution (AUC = 0.89). Our results showed that G. cuvieri showed the most significant relative contribution at a mean temperature of warmest quarter (24.88%) followed by annual precipitation (15.72%). Based on permutation importance, temperature annual range was the most significant with 49.82%. Comparison of major land cover classes showed that cropland was the main habitat type for G. cuvieri, while grasslands and shrublands were significant areas for this species. G. cuvieri demonstrated high selectivity in terms of habitat suitability. Therefore, we recommend that conservation efforts be directed, and that priority be given to the areas identified in this study as potential conservation habitats.

AB  - Living on islands entails numerous challenges for animals, among which population density approaching the carrying capacity of trophic resources stands out. To overcome this limitation, many insular lizards can supplement their insectivorous diet with increasing portions of plant material. The Madeira wall lizard, Teira dugesii, is a medium-sized lacertid, endemic to the Madeira and Selvagens archipelagos. As common in this family, adults are sexually dimorphic with males being bigger than females. Previous dietary studies on morphological scatology identified a higher proportion of plant over animal prey items, changing according to the location and sex. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding to examine the diet of this lizard species quantifying it at a higher taxonomical resolution and enhancing the detection of soft-body prey that often go undetected in morphology-based studies. In a sample of 151 faecal samples from eight populations including different habitats and altitudes in Madeira, we identified 289 prey items belonging to eight animal and three plant Classes, encompassing 58 distinct orders and 140 families. Of these, 63 were identified up to the species level. The results support a strong trend towards herbivory in this species with plants representing almost 74% of the diet occurrences in contrast to the 26% of animal prey. Remarkably, the plant fraction of the diet remained stable across localities but varied with size and mass in males. As males grew bigger and heavier, they significantly increased their plant matter intake. Likely, larger bodies and abdomens allowed allocating longer and more complex digestive tracts harbouring intestinal flora to better decompose plant organic compounds. This allowed heavier animals to have a richer diet regime. However, diet richness and composition were not affected by either sex or size, while the locality had a significant effect on both diet components likely in response to local variation in prey availability. By including an increasing plant fraction into a primarily insectivorous diet, this insular lizard has not only enlarged its trophic niche but is also able to exploit more efficiently the highly variable resources provided by insular environments.

AB  - Ammospiza caudacuta (Saltmarsh Sparrow) is a salt marsh-nesting obligate species of greatest conservation concern due to decreasing populations and probable future threats, such as climate change-induced sea-level rise. Low reproductive success is a limiting factor to population growth for the species due to flooding, habitat loss, and predation. To further understand the effects of predation on nesting Saltmarsh Sparrows, we deployed camera traps at monitored nests in Jacob's Point salt marsh, Warren, RI, during the 2022 breeding period. In 2 instances of observed nest failure, camera traps captured the apparent depredation of eggs by Odocoileus virginianus ( White- tailed Deer). We believe these to be the first documented cases of Saltmarsh Sparrow nest predation by White-tailed Deer. This finding has implications for the conservation of Saltmarsh Sparrows and for future management strategies aimed at increasing breeding success.

AB  - Cetacean falls provide a large amount of organic matter to the deep ocean, an otherwise oligotrophic environment. These events are now believed to maintain endemic species and offer intermediate habitats for species in other deep-sea ecosystems. Only about 70 modern whale falls have been reported in the world's oceans to date. We discovered the first known dolphin fall in the South China Sea in March 2020, on the middle slope of the Zhongnan seamount. We set up a camera at the site to observe animals visiting the dolphin carcass for 30 consecutive days from March 29 to April 28, 2020 and made four additional HOV dives to the dolphin carcass. In total, we observed 14 visible megafauna species visiting this dolphin fall, including six fish species, five crustacean species, two echinoderm species, and one mollusk species, of which most were scavengers or predators. This was the first record of many of these taxa in the deep South China Sea. Furthermore, two bone-eating worms were found in a piece of the dolphin bone. The worms are identified as new species in the genus Osedax based on DNA analysis. The findings of this work suggest that cetacean falls occur frequently in the South China Sea and help to fill a knowledge gap regarding the biodiversity of cetacean falls in the West Pacific.

AB  - Context. Rusa deer (Cervus timorensis), originally introduced in the 1860s, are still spreading in eastern Australia. The expanding peri-urban rusa deer population in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia is having undesirable impacts on human and ecological communities, but the spatial structure of this population has not been investigated. Genetic information on invasive species is potentially useful in identifying management units to mitigate undesirable impacts. Aims. The aim of this study was to investigate population structure, characterise dispersal, and determine if natural and human-made landscape features affected gene flow in rusa deer invading the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Methods. We used reduced representation sequencing (DArT-Seq) to analyse single nucleotide polymorphisms distributed throughout the genomic DNA of rusa deer culled during a management program. We used admixture and Principal Component Analyses to investigate population structure with respect to natural and human-made landscape features, and we investigated whether our genetic data supported the presence of sex-biased dispersal. Key results. Genetic diversity was highest in the north, near the original introduction site. A railway line demarcated restricted gene flow. Surprisingly, the Illawarra escarpment, a prominent landscape feature, did not restrict gene flow. There was no evidence of sex-biased dispersal and seven individuals were identified as genetic outliers. Conclusions. The genetic structure of the Illawarra rusa deer population is consistent with individuals spreading south from their introduction site in Royal National Park. The population is not panmictic, and a landscape feature associated with urbanisation was associated with increased spatial genetic structure. Outliers could indicate hybridisation or secondary incursion events. Implications. Rusa deer can be expected to continue invading southwards in the Illawarra region, but landscape features associated with urbanisation might reduce dispersal across the landscape. The genetic structuring of the population identified three potential management units on which to prioritise ground shooting operations.

AB  - Vertebrate scavengers provide essential ecosystem services such as accelerating carrion decomposition by consuming carcasses, exposing tissues to microbial and invertebrate decomposers, and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. Some scavengers do not consume carcasses on site but rather scatter their remains in the surroundings, which might have important implications for nutrient transport, forensic investigations and the spread of diseases such as African Swine Fever. However, only a few studies have investigated and measured the scatter distances. Using wild boar (Sus scrofa) carcasses and limbs, we monitored scavenging behavior and measured scatter distances of mammals. We placed 20 carcasses (up to 25 kg) and 21 separate limbs equipped with very high frequency (VHF) transmitters and monitored scavenger activity using camera traps in a mountainous region in southeast Germany. Except for one carcass, all other carcasses and limbs were scattered. We measured 72 scatter distances (of 89 scattering events; mean = 232 m, maximum = 1250 m), of which 75% were dispersed up to 407 m. Scavengers moved scattered pieces into denser vegetation compared to the half-open vegetation at provisioning sites. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were the most common scavenger species, contributing to 72 scattering events (58 measured scatter distances). Our results provide evidence of scatter distances farther than previously assumed and have far-reaching implications for disease management or forensic investigations, as the broader surroundings of carcasses must be included in search efforts to remove infectious material or relevant body parts for forensic analysis.

AB  - Population density estimations are essential for wildlife management and conservation. Camera traps have become a promising cost-effective tool, for which several methods have been described to estimate population density when individuals are unrecognizable (i.e. unmarked populations). However, comparative tests of their applicability and performance are scarce.
   Here, we have compared three methods based on camera traps to estimate population density without individual recognition: Random Encounter Model (REM), Random Encounter and Staying Time (REST) and Distance Sampling with camera traps (CT-DS). Comparisons were carried out in terms of consistency with one another, precision and cost-effectiveness. We considered six natural populations with a wide range of densities, and three species with different behavioural traits (red deer Cervus elaphus, wild boar Sus scrofa and red fox Vulpes vulpes). In three of these populations, we obtained independent density estimates as a reference.
   The densities estimated ranged from 0.23 individuals/km(2) (fox) to 34.87 individuals/km(2) (red deer). We did not find significant differences in terms of density values estimated by the three methods in five out of six populations, but REM has a tendency to generate higher average density values than REST and CT-DS. Regarding the independents' densities, REM results were not significantly different in any population, and REST and CT-DS were significantly different in one population. The precision obtained was not significantly different between methods, with average coefficients of variation of 0.28 (REST), 0.36 (REM) and 0.42 (CT-DS). The REST method required the lowest human effort.
   Synthesis and applications. Our results show that all of the methods examined can work well, with each having particular strengths and weaknesses. Broadly, Random Encounter and Staying Time (REST) could be recommended in scenarios of high abundance, Distance Sampling with camera traps (CT-DS) in those of low abundance while Random Encounter Model (REM) can be recommended when camera trap performance is not optimal, as it can be applied with less risk of bias. This broadens the applicability of camera trapping for estimating densities of unmarked populations using information exclusively obtained from camera traps. This strengthens the case for scientifically based camera trapping as a cost-effective method to provide reference estimates for wildlife managers, including within multi-species monitoring programmes.

AB  - Host-specific pathogens have long been suggested to act as a major driver of species diversity in tropical forests. However, determining the degree of host specificity of potential pathogens coupled to key cellular characteristics of infection is difficult and time-consuming. These challenges have delayed progress in relating the functional specificity of pathogenic fungi to ecological consequences. We tested the pathogenicity of 27 (of 215) fungi that were isolated from surface sterilized roots of seedlings from four common tree species in a diverse subtropical forest. Inoculation experiments showed that six fungi exhibited strong pathogenicity on the host seedlings. Five of these only infected their specific hosts (i.e. host-specific pathogen species). Green fluorescent protein labelling revealed that in three host-specific pathogens fungal hyphae were able to grow into the vascular tissues only in their specific host plant, in contrast to other fungal-host combinations that exhibit non-pathogenic interactions. This fluorescent labelling technique allows direct tracking of the progress of fungal infection in different host tissues. Synthesis. By coupling the green fluorescent protein technique with standard host inoculation experiments, we determined the developmental differences between infections by pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi in a relatively simple and straightforward way. Our work provides a useful tool for rapidly screening and categorizing host-fungal interactions, reflecting the functional basis of host specificity of pathogenic fungi. More broadly, this technique can contribute to understanding the roles of pathogens in species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance in forest communities.

AB  - Habitat conversion to farmland has increased human-wildlife interactions, which often lead to conflict, injury or death for people and animals. Understanding the behavioural and landscape drivers of human-wildlife conflict is critical for managing wildlife populations. Staging behaviour prior to crop incursions has been described across multiple taxa and offers potential utility in managing conflict, but few quantitative assessments of staging have been undertaken. Animal movement data can provide valuable, fine-scale information on such behaviour with opportunities for application to real-time management for conflict prediction.We developed an approach to assess the efficacy of six widely used metrics of animal movement to identify staging behaviour prior to agricultural incursions. We applied this approach to GPS data from 55 African elephants in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem and found tortuosity and HMM-derived behavioural states to be the most effective for identifying staging events. We then assessed temporal patterns of defined staging at daily and seasonal scales and explored environmental and anthropogenic drivers of staging from spatial generalized logistic mixed models. Finally, we tested the viability of combining movement and simple spatial metrics to predict crop incursions based on GPS data.Our approach identified staging behaviour that appeared to be driven largely by human activity and diurnal availability of protective cover from forest, riverine vegetation, and topography. Staging also varied substantially by season. Tortuosity and behavioural state metrics identified different staging strategies with distinct spatial distributions and anthropogenic drivers, and appeared to be linked to the juxtaposition between protected and cultivated lands. Tortuosity-based staging combined with distance-to-agriculture produced promising results for pre-event prediction of crop incursion.Synthesis and applications. Our study found staging by elephants prior to crop use could be identified from GPS tracking data, indicating that a better understanding of movement behaviour can inform targeted and proactive human-wildlife conflict management and inform spatial planning efforts. Our approach is extendable to other conflict-prone species to assess pre-conflict behaviours and space use and demonstrates some of the challenges and advantages of using animal behaviour to assess temporal and spatial heterogeneity in human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - The initial development stage of forests forms the basis for the future tree generation. Various driving and interacting factors determine the regeneration process at small and large scale. Based on the latest Austrian National Forest Inventory 2016-2021 the regeneration assessments and estimation methods were collated. Analyses were conducted to estimate the forest area regarding regeneration necessity and occurrence, the causes of regeneration deficits, the origin from natural and artificial regeneration, tree species occurrence as well as browsing impact.The results show a sea level gradient of increasing shares of necessary but missing regeneration, ranging between 15% at the lowest and 60% at the highest altitudes. Accordingly, high shares can be found in protective forest without yield (50%) and in the growth regions of the mountainous areas of the Alps (up to 40%). Due to the multitude of driving and interacting factors, the assessed causes of regeneration deficits show divers patterns. Light as a limiting factor appears to be more relevant at low altitudes, and competition through ground vegetation is highest at low and high altitudes. The influence of the humus layer on the seed bed was assessed to increase with altitude, as well as the impact of forest pasture, while game browsing as cause of regeneration deficits show no clear tendency over the analysed strata. About 91% of the necessary and occurring regeneration originates from natural regeneration and the remaining from artificial or a mixture of both regeneration types. The number of tree species in the ground vegetation layer decreases with altitude. Considering browsing impact the results show percentages of affected areas between 40% and 80%. The highest browsing impacts were found at intermediate altitudes between 600 and 1,500 m above sea level.From a large-scale perspective as provided by NFIs, the results show divers patterns of regeneration necessity and occurrence and impacts on the regeneration. Representative large-scale monitoring by NFIs provides the opportunity to identify and quantify the adverse impacts and forest strata that are affected by regeneration deficits, and therefore support the development of forest management strategies that aim at the establishment of the future tree generation under changing climate conditions.

AB  - Apex predators structure ecosystems by hunting mesopredators and herbivores. These trophic cascades are driven not only by the number of animals they kill, but also by how prey alter their behaviors to reduce risk. The different levels of risk navigated by prey has been likened to a "landscape of fear." In Australia, dingoes are known to suppress red fox populations, driving a trophic cascade. However, most of what we know of this relationship comes from circumstances where predators are persecuted, which can affect their social and trophic interactions. Utilizing camera traps, we monitored fox behavior when accessing key resource points used by territorial dingoes, in a region where both predators are protected. We predicted that foxes would avoid and be more cautious in areas of high dingo activity. Indeed, foxes avoided directly encountering dingoes. However, contrary to our expectations, foxes were not more cautious or vigilant where dingo activity was high. In fact, fox activity and scent-marking rates increased where dingo scent-marking was concentrated. Further, foxes were increasingly confident with increasing levels of conspecific activity. Our results suggest that responses to the threat of predation are more complex than fear alone. In socially stable conditions, it is possible that prey may develop knowledge of their predators, facilitating avoidance, and reducing fear.

AB  - The Bulianta Coal Mine is among the problematic coal mining areas in China that is still creating environmental damage, especially associated with soil destruction. Therefore, a scientific investigation was conducted to establish a scientific basis for evaluating the impact of planted forest on soil physical and chemical properties, as well as the ecological benefits following 15 years of vegetation restoration in the area. The soil physicochemical characteristics and distribution of organic carbon storage in the 0-80 cm layer soils of Pinus sylvestris forests, Prunus sibirica forests, and Hippophae rhamnoides forests restored after 5, 10, and 15 years were investigated. The immersion method was used to determine soil porosity and density followed by the determination of soil indicators, and a statistical ANOVA test was applied to examine the differential effects of different vegetation types and restoration years on soil properties. The results clearly demonstrated the following: (1) The recovery of vegetation was achieved after a period of 15 years, with the average bulk density of the 0-80 cm soil layer as follows: P. sylvestris forest (1.513 g<middle dot>cm-3) > P. sibirica forest (1.272 g<middle dot>cm-3) > H. rhamnoides forest (1.224 g<middle dot>cm-3), and the differences among different forest types were statistically significant (p < 0.05). (2) In planted forests, soil nutrients were predominantly concentrated in the 0-20 cm layer, while soil carbon storage exhibited a decline with an increasing soil depth. (3) The soil carbon storage across the three forest types was as follows: P. sylvestris forest (45.42 t<middle dot>hm-2) > P. sibirica forest (44.56 t<middle dot>hm-2) > H. rhamnoides forest (41.87 t<middle dot>hm-2). In summary, during the ecological vegetation restoration process in the Bulianta Core Mine, both P. sylvestris forest and P. sibirica forest exhibit superior carbon storage capacities compared to H. rhamnoides forest, as well as more effective soil improvement outcomes.

AB  - Megafauna are important seed dispersers because they can disperse large quantities of seeds over long distances. In Hokkaido, Japan, the largest terrestrial animal is the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and other megafauna seed dispersers are lacking. Thus, brown bears are expected to have an important function as seed dispersers in Hokkaido. In this study, we, for the first time, evaluated the seed dispersal function of brown bears in Hokkaido using three fleshy-fruited trees and studied: (1) gut passage time (GPT) in feeding experiments, (2) seed dispersal distance using tracking data of wild bears, and (3) the effect of gut passage and pulp removal on germination rate. Most seeds were defecated intact, and less than 6% were broken. The average GPT without pulp was 3 h and 56 min to 6 h and 13 min, depending on the plant and trial. Each plant's average simulated seed dispersal distance was 202-512 m. The dispersal distance of Actinidia arguta seeds with pulp was significantly longer than those without pulp because of their longer GPT. The germination rate of defecated seeds without pulp was 19-51%, depending on the plant, and was significantly higher or not different comparing with that of seeds with pulp. We concluded that brown bears in Hokkaido are effective seed dispersers. In managing brown bears in Hokkaido, such ecological functions should be considered along with conserving the bear population and reducing human-bear conflicts.

AB  - Uncertainties about the magnitude of bycatch in poorly assessed fisheries impede effective conservation management. In northern Peru, small-scale fisheries (SSF) bycatch negatively impacts marine megafauna populations and the livelihoods of fishers which is further elevated by the under-reporting of incidents. Within the last decade, accounts of entangled humpback whales (HBW) (Megaptera novaeangliae) off the northern coast of Peru have increased, while Eastern Pacific leatherback turtles (LBT) (Dermochelys coriacea) have seen over a 90% decline in nesting populations related in large part to bycatch mortality. By leveraging the experience and knowledge of local fishers, our research objectives were to use a low-cost public participation mapping approach to provide a spatio-temporal assessment of bycatch risk for HBW and LBT off two Peruvian fishing ports. We used an open-source, geographic information systems (GIS) model, the Bycatch Risk Assessment (ByRA), as our platform. Broadly, ByRA identifies high bycatch risk areas by estimating the intersection of fishing areas (i.e., stressors) with species habitat and evaluating the exposure and consequence of possible interaction between the two. ByRA outputs provided risk maps and gear risk percentages categorized as high, medium, and low for the study area and seven subzones for HBW in the austral winter and LBT in the austral summer. Overall, the highest bycatch risk for both species was identified within gillnet fisheries near the coast. Bycatch risk for most gear types decreased with distance from the coast. When we separated the ByRA model by port, our map outputs indicate that bycatch management should be port specific, following seasonal and spatial variations for HBW, and specific fishing gear impacts for HBW and LBT. Combined with direct bycatch mitigation techniques, ByRA can be a supportive and informative tool for addressing specific bycatch threats and marine megafauna conservation goals. ByRA supports a participatory framework offering rapid visual information via risk maps and replicable methods for areas with limited resources and data on fisheries and species habitat.

AB  - Grazing can affect soil nutrient pools in a top-down process primarily through foraging, trampling and excreting of livestock. However, how grazing affects the relative contribution of plant biomass allocation to soil stoichiometry and nutrient storage in alpine grassland remains unclear. In this study, a 3-year serial grazing trail was conducted under 2 grazing regimes (continuous grazing and rotational grazing) and 3 grazing intensities (light grazing, medium grazing and heavy grazing) in an alpine steppe on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) to examine the effects of plant biomass allocation on soil stoichiometry and soil nutrient stock. The results showed that grazing decreased the aboveground biomass, whereas increased the belowground biomass and R:S. Grazing increased SOC stock and soil TP stock but did not affect the TN stock. Meanwhile, grazing caused an increasing in C: N and N: P. The shifts in belowground biomass and R: S regulates the changes of C: N: P stoichiometry. The plant functional composition regulated the changes of SOC stock, TN stock and TP stock. The relative contribution of R: S ratio to SOC stock and TN stock were increased with grazing intensities. We concluded that moderately rotational grazing is beneficial to better plant resource allocation and to regulate the soil nutrient stock in the alpine grassland ecosystem. These findings are crucial to identify the feasible grazing practices for the QTP's alpine grasslands.

AB  - Chemodiversity, the diversity of specialised (secondary) metabolites, plays a crucial role in mediating interactions between plants and animals, including insect herbivores and mutualists. Chemodiversity can be observed at both the individual and the population level. However, the impacts of chemodiversity at these two levels on interactions between plants and floral visitors, mainly pollinators and floral herbivores (florivores), are only poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of chemodiversity at both individual (chemotype) and plot level on pollinators and florivores, examining their mutual interactions. To investigate these questions, we used individuals of the perennial Tanacetum vulgare differing in their terpenoid composition, representing different chemotypes. We planted individuals of five distinct chemotypes in a common garden design with homogeneous (five plants of the same chemotype) and heterogeneous (five different chemotypes) plots and observed flower visits in dependence of individual chemotype and plot type. Seeds were collected from a subset of plants and germination rates determined. Our findings revealed that chemodiversity at the plot level significantly influenced pollinator visitation, with more visits on plants of heterogeneous plots. We also observed marginally more pollinators on one of the chemotypes grown in homogeneous plots. In contrast, chemotype but not plot type had a significant effect on florivore visits. Pollinator and florivore species richness did not vary with plot type. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between pollinator and florivore visits in 1 year. Germination rates were positively correlated with pollinator visits and affected by chemotype but not by florivore visits or plot type. Synthesis. Our study emphasises the significance of the spatial level at which plant chemistry is perceived by flower visitors, potentially influencing the germination success of plants. Exploring the ecology of these visitors and the varying selection pressures they exert on floral chemistry can help to elucidate the evolutionary processes that maintain chemodiversity in natural environments.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) are efficient at controlling predation upon livestock. LGDs create a safer landscape for livestock through accompaniment and the reduction of the abundance and distribution of wild carnivores. However, the effects of LGDs on livestock behavior, group dynamics, and use of space remain understudied. To understand LGDs' impact on sheep behavior and group dynamics, and using a natural experiment approach, we worked on two sheep farms that differed in the use of LGDs to control predation. We used the focal sampling technique to observe sheep behavior; in addition, we obtained information about group size and nearest neighbor distance. Nutritional quality and habitat selection were also assessed. For each individual, we calculated the proportion of time invested in behavioral categories (scanning, feeding, resting, and traveling), and categories between properties were contrasted with the nonparametric U-test, as well as features related to group dynamics, vegetation structure, and food quality. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of LGDs and other management and biological variables on sheep behavior and group properties. In close proximity to LGDs, sheep spent more time in scanning while time allocated to feeding decreased; however, feeding time did not change based on its presence. Moreover, LGDs' company led to the formation of larger sheep groups and individuals closer to each other. Sheep together with LGDs selected habitats with limited plant cover, which allows animals greater visibility. Lastly, we suggest that the ability of LGDs to maintain larger and more cohesive groups in open areas, as well as with more vigilant animals, could increase livestock responsiveness to predator presence, thus helping to reduce probability of predation on sheep and, in consequence, reducing the necessity of killing wild species in retaliation.

AB  - Borneo is the centre of diversity of the palm genus Pinanga. At least 13 understory species have been recorded in the Ulu Temburong National Park in Brunei, but little is known of their persistence. Changes in populations of Pinanga understory palms may be indicative of more widespread changes due to climate change, such as changes in rainfall, which may be important for the palm diversity in the protected area. However, we know little about the population dynamics of these palms, how persistent their populations are or if they behave similarly over long time frames. In 1998, populations of five co-occurring species of Pinanga at several locations in the Ulu Temburong National Park were documented. This project aimed to undertake a comprehensive resurvey of the original five Pinanga palm species populations in order to assess if they showed similar population changes across sites and species after two decades. Overall, most species maintained their population size in the surveyed region but not consistently among sites, and one species significantly declined in abundance. There was considerable variation in population growth rate (R) within and among species and sites that was significantly correlated with density and the percentage of multi-stemmed plants. There was evidence of pulsed recruitment in some species and or sites rather than steady or exponential patterns of population growth.

AB  - Contamination of soils by microplastics can have profound ecological impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and has received increasing attention. However, few studies have considered the impacts of soil microplastics on plant communities and none has tested the impacts of spatial heterogeneity in the horizontal distribution of microplastics in the soil on plant communities. We grew experimental plant communities in soils with either a homogeneous or a heterogeneous distribution of each of six common microplastics, i.e., polystyrene foam (EPS), polyethylene fiber (PET), polyethylene bead (HDPE), polypropylene fiber (PP), polylactic bead (PLA) and polyamide bead (PA6). The heterogeneous treatment consisted of two soil patches without microplastics and two with a higher (0.2%) concentration of microplastics, and the homogeneous treatment consisted of four patches all with a lower (0.1%) concentration of microplastics. Thus, the total amounts of microplastics in the soils were exactly the same in the two treatments. Total and root biomass of the plant communities were significantly higher in the homogeneous than in the heterogeneous treatment when the microplastic was PET and PP, smaller when it was PLA, but not different when it was EPS, HDPE or PA6. In the heterogeneous treatment, total and root biomass were significantly smaller in the patches with than without microplastics when the microplastic was EPS, but greater when the microplastic was PET or PP. Additionally, in the heterogeneous treatment, root biomass was significantly smaller in the patches with than without microplastics when the microplastic was HDPE, and shoot biomass was also significantly smaller when the microplastic was EPS or PET. The heterogeneous distribution of EPS in the soil significantly decreased community evenness, but the heterogeneous distribution of PET increased it. We conclude that soil heterogeneity in the horizontal distribution of microplastics can influence productivity and species composition of plant communities, but such an effect varies depending on microplastic chemical composition (types) and morphology (shapes).

AB  - Enhancing the herbivore fish stock is envisaged as a mitigation tool to reverse the macroalgal dominance in a coral reef environment. However, identifying the key species of herbivore fish that significantly controls the macroalgal abundance in a reef is critically important. The present study is aimed at determining the prospects of two common herbivore fish, Siganus javus and S. canaliculatus, in regulating the macroalgae prevalent in the Gulf of Mannar (GoM), a Marine National Park, using in situ cage experiments. Ten different macroalgal species that commonly grow over corals were collected from the GoM reefs, and a known biomass of macroalgae was fed individually to both S. javus and S. canaliculatus maintained in separate in situ cages. Grazing experiments revealed a significant difference in the macroalgae consumption rate between S. javus and S. canaliculatus. The S. javus consumed 0.9 +/- 0.7 to 10.1 +/- 1.8 g h(-1) comparatively higher than S. canaliculatus (0.5 +/- 0.14 and 4.7 +/- 0.9 g h(-1)), indicating the differential feeding ability of the closely related herbivore fish. Green filamentous macroalgae including Enteromorpha compressa and Chaetomorpha crassa were intensely grazed within 5 h of feeding trials. Though the grazing rate of Siganus spp. recorded in this study was comparable with other geographical reefs, the feeding preferences differed as the macroalgae Turbinaria ornata, Sargassum wightii, and Halimeda tuna were least consumed by both the Siganus spp., probably contributing to their long-term persistence in the coral reef ecosystem. The results presented here emphasize that the feeding pattern of Siganus spp. varied with different species of macroalgae that might play a critical role in shaping the reef community. The herbivory rate and choice of macroalgae by other herbivores should be considered to decide on the management options such as marine replenishment zones.

AB  - Species detections often vary depending on the survey methods employed. Some species may go undetected when using only one approach in community-level inventory and monitoring programs, which has management and conservation implications. We conducted a comparative study of terrestrial mammal and bird detections in the spring and summer of 2021 by placing camera traps at 30 locations across a large military installation in northern Michigan, USA and testing replicate soil samples from these sites for environmental DNA (eDNA) using an established vertebrate metabarcoding assay. We detected a total of 48 taxa from both survey methods: 26 mammalian taxa (excluding humans, 24 to species and two to genus) and 22 avian taxa (21 to species and one to genus). We detected a relatively even distribution of mammalian taxa on cameras (17) and via eDNA analysis (15), with seven taxa detected from both methods. Most medium-to-large carnivores were detected only on cameras, whereas semi-fossorial small mammals were detected only via eDNA analysis. We detected higher bird diversity with camera traps (18 taxa) compared to eDNA analysis (eight taxa; four taxa were detected with both methods), but cameras alone were most effective at detecting smaller birds that frequently occupy arboreal environments. We also used Bayesian spatial occupancy models for two widely distributed game species (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, and ruffed grouse, Bonasa umbellus) that were moderately detected with both survey methods and found species-specific site use (occupancy) estimates were similar between cameras and eDNA analysis. Concordant with similar studies, our findings suggest that a combination of camera trap and eDNA surveys could be most useful for assessing the composition of terrestrial mammal communities. Camera traps may be most efficient for assessing bird diversity but can be complemented with eDNA analysis, particularly for species that spend considerable time on the ground.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is a critical threat to sea turtle populations worldwide, particularly because turtles are vulnerable to multiple gear types. The Canary Current is an intensely fished region, yet there has been no demographic assessment integrating bycatch and population management information of the globally significant Cabo Verde loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) population. Using Boa Vista island (Eastern Cabo Verde) subpopulation data from capture-recapture and nest monitoring (2013-2019), we evaluated population viability and estimated regional bycatch rates (2016-2020) in longline, trawl, purse-seine, and artisanal fisheries. We further evaluated current nesting trends in the context of bycatch estimates, existing hatchery conservation measures, and environmental (net primary productivity) variability in turtle foraging grounds. We projected that current bycatch mortality rates would lead to the near extinction of the Boa Vista subpopulation. Bycatch reduction in longline fisheries and all fisheries combined would increase finite population growth rate by 1.76% and 1.95%, respectively. Hatchery conservation increased hatchling production and reduced extinction risk, but alone it could not achieve population growth. Short-term increases in nest counts (2013-2021), putatively driven by temporary increases in net primary productivity, may be masking ongoing long-term population declines. When fecundity was linked to net primary productivity, our hindcast models simultaneously predicted these opposing long-term and short-term trends. Consequently, our results showed conservation management must diversify from land-based management. The masking effect we found has broad-reaching implications for monitoring sea turtle populations worldwide, demonstrating the importance of directly estimating adult survival and that nest counts might inadequately reflect underlying population trends.

AB  - We document the presence of a huemul population on Cabo Leon, Riesco Island, Chilean Patagonia 15 years after its first assessment, providing ecological insights for this southernmost coastal population. During Austral spring 2018 we recorded indirect signs of huemul presence and five individuals including one yearling across 35 km of trails, estimating a density of 2.3 ind/km(2). Records were distributed in dense secondary forest, at low elevations and slopes. These observations suggest the presence of a breeding population, favored by the establishment of a private reserve and the reduction of livestock, along with the recently established Kawesqar National Park.

AB  - Over the past 70 years, the introduced, invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) has become established and caused considerable decline and mortality of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) across much of the tree's natural range. Hemlock is a foundation tree species with little inherent resistance to this exotic species and infestation by this sap-feeding insect results in progressive crown decline and tree mortality within 4 to 15 years. Continued climate warming favours the spread of this insect to Ontario and other areas at the northern edge of hemlock's range. More than 30 years of basic and applied research directed towards control and mitigation of damage by this insect indicates that the rate of development of hemlock decline and mortality depends on climate, site, and stand factors that affect both insect performance and hemlock vigour. Here we synthesize these research findings to provide science-based management recommendations to (1) increase the resilience of Ontario's hemlock forest resource to this insect before it spreads, (2) mitigate hemlock woolly adelgid damage once it gets established, and (3) facilitate degraded hemlock forest restoration.

AB  - Overabundant populations of wild boar (Sus scrofa) are frequent where anthropogenic food is easily available and where hunting is limited. Improving recreational hunting efficacy may contribute to manage these populations. However, we do not know the factors modulating hunting efficacy in a hunting day (i.e., proportion of individuals culled from a population). Additionally, we need to explore which factors drive hunting efficacy in shooting opportunities (i.e., proportion of hunted individuals from a wild boar group in individual shooting opportunities). Here, we analyze the factors explaining wild boar hunting efficacy at the scale of driven hunt and shooting opportunity. Hunting efficacy was surveyed in 92 driven hunts (2017-2018 to 2020-2021 hunting seasons) and in 145 shooting opportunities in Sierra de Gredos (central Spain). We found that hunting efficacy at the scale of the driven hunt was mainly modulated by the number of hunting posts. Indeed, maximum levels of 82 posts showed a fourfold hunting efficacy (59%) compared to minimum levels reaching six hunting posts (16%). At the scale of the shooting opportunity, hunting efficacy was mainly driven by wild boar group size, being negatively related to hunting efficacy: the higher the number of individuals in the group, the lower the shooting efficacy (13-fold; 41% for an individual, 3% for individuals belonging to groups > 7 individuals). Given the need of maintaining native wild boar populations at densities compatible with biodiversity conservation, rural economy, and animal and public health, efforts towards facilitating more hunters per event would improve wild boar hunting efficacy.

AB  - Understanding the role of recruitment in population dynamics of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is important for management. In the central Appalachian Mountains, deer are part of a largely forested ecosystem that supports 3 carnivore species thought to be capable of influencing white-tailed deer recruitment: black bears (Urus americanus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and bobcats (Lynx rufus). Yet little is known about predation, how other environmental factors influence recruitment, or the importance of neonate survival to white-tailed deer population performance in the region. Our objectives were to identify causes of mortality for neonates, analyze effects of landscape attributes on survival of neonates, estimate survival rates for neonates and adult female white-tailed deer, and to model population growth trends based on current vital rates and hypothetical harvest and neonate survival scenarios. During 2019-2020, we captured 57 neonate deer in Bath County, Virginia, USA, by monitoring 38 pregnant females equipped with global positioning system collars and vaginal implant transmitters and by conducting transect searches for recently born neonates. We observed 37 neonate mortalities and identified cause of death using field and genetic evidence. Mortalities included 28 predation events and 9 deaths from other causes (e.g., abandonment, malnutrition, disease). Black bears accounted for 48.6% of neonate mortalities, and 64.2% of predation events (n = 18), followed by bobcats (n = 5) and coyotes (n = 3). Annual survival for adult female deer was 0.871 and neonate survival to 12 weeks old was 0.310. Elevation was a significant predictor of neonate survival; mortality risk increased 20% for every 100-m increase in elevation. Models of annual population growth using observed vital rates predicted an increasing population (lambda = 1.10). A 10% increase in female harvest would still result in a potential population increase of 2% (lambda = 1.02), but a 20% increase in harvest rate would result in a potential 7% decline (lambda = 0.93). Neonate survival was higher near fertile valley bottoms and lower along forested ridges characterized by shallow, infertile soils and limited edge or early successional forests. While predation, largely influenced by black bears, was the leading cause of neonate mortality and contributed to low neonate survival, we observed little evidence of population decline, and suggest there is opportunity for a modest increase in harvest of female deer.

AB  - Spread of non-native species can be important drivers of biodiversity declines, leading to precautionary management based on assumptions that (1) non-native biota have negative impacts and are "guilty" of causing harm and (2) reducing a non-native species' abundance will reduce these negative impacts, in turn, benefiting native species. However, we frequently lack data to gauge both negative impacts of non-native species and success or failure of chosen management interventions to benefit native species. Addressing these knowledge gaps is critical to improving management outcomes for native species while maintaining public trust to sustain funding of management activities. Here, we investigated the response of Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) and associated plant communities to implementation of biological control in more than 10 wetland sites in New York State for up to 28 years. Introduced to North America from Europe in the 1800s, L. salicaria is a prime example of a non-native species with a continent-wide distribution that could not be suppressed by mechanical and chemical treatments. In the 1980s, waterfowl biologists, wetland managers, and conservationists alike worried about the loss of diverse wetland plant communities associated with the rapid expansion of L. salicaria. In response, after careful assessments of safety, and potential costs and benefits, four highly host-specific insect herbivores were released in North America in the early 1990s to reduce L. salicaria abundance and its negative ecological impacts. In a companion paper, Blossey et al. documented reduced L. salicaria occupancy and stem densities following insect releases over time (i.e., biological success), irrespective of site-specific differences in starting plant communities or L. salicaria abundance. Here, we show that reduced abundance of L. salicaria leads to the ultimate goal of non-native plant management: increased cover, abundance, and diversity of species, often of native species (i.e., ecological success). We also conduct analyses to provide inference about which plant species are most sensitive to L. salicaria, including changes in L. salicaria stem density. Overall, we provide an important conservation success story: our findings emphasize that biocontrol of non-native plants can be effective and safe, allowing native species to recover as a dominant non-native species gradually declines.

AB  - The modification of precipitation regimes and the increase in summer aridity under the predicted climate change scenarios are hypothesized to have repercussions on the semi-extensive pastoral systems of Mediterranean grasslands, leading to change in forage quantity/quality, increased interannual variability in phytomass production, reduction of the carrying capacity of rangelands, and worsening of animal welfare. The research aims were to find what climatic features affect changes in the annual peak of Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP), and how topographic variables and management conditions influence these variations in a pastoral system of central Apennines (Italy). We monitored Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variations at the peak of phytomass production using Landsat satellite images, used as a proxy for ANPP changes in the most productive phase of the growing season, when herds are carried to pastures and hay-meadows are mown, on a dataset of 10,000 randomly sampled pixels (30 ? 30 m), in the years 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2013-2015. We investigated the relation between NDVI and climatic variables, topographic parameters, vegetation physiognomy, and management type, using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling, variation partitioning, and correlation analysis. We observed an increase in average yearly temperatures and high variability in the rainfall seasonal distribution pattern, particularly of spring precipitation. Climatic fluctuations influenced the overall amount of forage production more than management and topographic conditions. The spring variation of climatic variables (precipitation in March, drought stress in April and May), the drought and cold stress intensities in the previous year and the cold stress in the preceding winter were the main drivers of NDVI change. The landform factors interacted with climate variability in determining the amplitude of NDVI changes, which were the widest in semi-flat mountain tops and flat valley bottoms and the smallest in south-facing slopes. The effect of the climatic variables on NDVI was different depending on the management condition, suggesting that grassland management partially filters the climatic drivers of changes in forage production. Based on our results, the most productive grassland communities and the areas used for grazing by domestic herbivores could be the most impacted by the predicted climate changes for the Mediterranean basin, potentially reducing the economic sustainability of semi-extensive farming in the Apennine mountains.

AB  - A central challenge in ecology and evolutionary biology is to understand how variation in abiotic and biotic factors combine to shape the distribution, abundance, and diversity of focal species. Environmental gradients, whether natural (e.g., latitude, elevation, ocean proximity) or anthropogenic (e.g., land-use intensity, urbanization), provide compelling settings for addressing this challenge. However, not all organisms are amenable to the observational and experimental approaches required for untangling the factors that structure species along gradients. Here we highlight herbaceous plants in the genus Plantago as models for studying the ecology and evolution of species interactions along abiotic gradients. Plantago lanceolata and P. major are native to Europe and Asia but distributed globally, and they are established models for studying population ecology and interactions with herbivores, pathogens, and soil microbes. Studying restricted range congeners in comparison with those cosmopolitan species can provide insight into abiotic and biotic determinants of range size and population structure. We highlight one such species, P. rugelii, which is endemic to eastern North America. We give an overview of the literature on these focal Plantago species and explain why they are logical candidates for studies of species interactions across environmental gradients. Finally, we emphasize collaborative and community science approaches that can facilitate such research and note the amenability of Plantago for authentic research projects in science education.

AB  - Adding fruit tree branches to the compost pile in appropriate proportions is one of the methods used to address the challenge of tobacco waste recycling. However, the effects of different proportions of fruit tree branches on nicotine concentration and microbial diversity during tobacco waste composting have not been reported. In this study, a composting system with tobacco waste, cow dung, and fruit tree branches was established in a laboratory fermenter to assess the impact of adding 10%, 20%, and 30% fruit tree branches on quantity changes. In addition, the relationships between nicotine degradation, compost properties, enzyme activities, and microbial diversities were determined using biochemical assay methods and high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that adding appropriate proportions of fruit branch segments affected changes in physical and chemical properties during composting and promoted tobacco waste compost maturity. Aerobic composting effectively degraded nicotine in tobacco waste. Increased proportions of fruit branch segments led to elevations in nicotine degradation rates and enzyme activities related to lignocellulose degradation. The addition of fruit branches influenced the relative abundance and species of dominant bacteria and fungi at the phylum and genus levels. However, it did not significantly affect the relative abundance of the main bacterial genera involved in nicotine degradation. Nevertheless, it reduced the sensitivity of enzyme activity to nicotine content within heaps, increasing reliance on total nitrogen changes. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the utilization of tobacco waste in composting systems and indicate that fruit tree branches can enhance nicotine degradation efficiency during tobacco waste composting.

AB  - Quantifying the emotional impact of street greening during the full-leaf seasons in spring, summer, and fall is important for well-being-focused urban construction. Current emotional perception models usually focus on the influence of objects identified through semantic segmentation of street view images and lack explanation. Therefore, interpretability models that quantify street greening's emotional effects are needed. This study aims to measure and explain the influence of street greening on emotions to help urban planners make decisions. This would improve the living environment, foster positive emotions, and help residents recover from negative emotions. In Hangzhou, China, we used the Baidu Map API to obtain street view images when plants were in the full-leaf state. Semantic segmentation was used to separate plant parts from street view images, enabling the calculation of the Green View Index, Plant Level Diversity, Plant Color Richness, and Tree-Sky View Factor. We created a dataset specifically designed for the purpose of emotional perception, including four distinct categories: pleasure, relaxation, boredom, and anxiety. This dataset was generated through a combination of machine learning algorithms and human evaluation. Scores range from 1 to 5, with higher values indicating stronger emotions and lower values indicating less intense ones. The random forest model and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) algorithm were employed to identify the key indicators that affect emotions. Emotions were most affected by the Plant Level Diversity and Green View Index. These indicators and emotions have an intricate non-linear relationship. Specifically, a higher Green View Index (often indicating the presence of 20-35 fully grown trees within a 200 m range in street view images) and a greater Plant Level Diversity significantly promoted positive emotional responses. Our study provided local planning departments with support for well-being-focused urban planning and renewal decisions. Based on our research, we recommend the following actions: (1) increase the amount of visible green in areas with a low Green View Index; (2) plant seasonal and flowering plants like camellia, ginkgo, and goldenrain trees to enhance the diversity and colors; (3) trim plants in areas with low safety perception to improve visibility; (4) introduce evergreen plants like cinnamomum camphor, osmanthus, and pine.

AB  - The persistence of Pacific coral reefs is threatened by large-scale mortality resulting from heat stress, storms, overfishing, disease, and land-based pollution. While reefs have demonstrated the ability to recover from these disturbances, recovery potential is highly variable; in part driven by the high spatial variability in the abundance of coral juveniles. However, our understanding of the patterns and predictors of juvenile coral density is hampered by the limited geographic scope of previous studies. Our objectives in this study were to: (1) explore the spatial and temporal patterns of juvenile (1- < 5cm in diameter) colony density across the U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands and atolls; and (2) identify the potential role of ecological and environmental factors which may influence coral juvenile abundance. Juvenile density was quantified as part of NOAA's National Coral Reef Monitoring Program between 2013 and 2019 using a stratified sampling design across 1,405 forereef sites on 34 islands and atolls. Regional mean juvenile density varied from 1.4 to 10.5 colonies m(-2) with the highest densities observed in the northern Mariana Islands, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, and southern Mariana Islands. Juvenile density significantly increased between sampling periods in the Main Hawaiian Islands, Line Islands and northern Mariana Islands. Survey-weighted generalized linear modeling demonstrated that juvenile density was best predicted by the interaction between time since a heat stress event and heat stress severity, depth, site and sector-level percent coral cover, human density, percent unconsolidated substrate, macroalgal cover, herbivore biomass, and the interaction of sector coral cover area and heat stress, and the interaction of wave power (combination of wave height and period) and heat stress. With the unique scale and gradients across the U.S. Pacific, our study found that the high latitude regions have enhanced juvenile density compared to their lower latitude counterparts. Our results also suggest density is most dependent on the timing and severity of heat stress, depth, stock-recruitment with an open adult population, availability of suitable habitat at the site-scale, and the number of humans in the system.

AB  - Globally, animal populations are facing increasing levels of environmental disturbance. Human activity, land-use change, and global warming are altering migration routes, space use, activity budgets, and the behaviour of many wildlife species. Understanding impacts on wildlife at a fine scale is essential to identify locations of increased disturbance, mitigate its effects, and predict potential population level outcomes. In this work, we introduce a low-cost animal tracking system that integrates open-source electronics, edge machine learning, and an Internet of Things network, to provide real-time information on the location and behaviour of animals. The system employs an on-board machine learning algorithm to identify distinct behaviours and then transmits classification outputs along with location data over a long-range network. We deployed the system on wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell, 1823)), in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, a highly social migratory ungulate population that is ecologically and economically vital to the region. Analysis of the transmitted data showed activity readings were consistent with location data and revealed biologically meaningful fluctuations in daily activity patterns. Our system introduces a new dimension to studying animal behaviour and movement ecology by offering immediate insights into the behaviour and location of collared animals.

AB  - Survival of early life history stages is critical to the successful establishment of benthic populations. Although light availability and herbivory are likely to influence the passage of marine macroalgae through a "recruitment bottleneck" at the sporeling stage, the interactive effect of these factors on subsequent community patterns of macroalgae is not well studied. We experimentally tested the effect of light and grazing on sporelings of the common intertidal kelp Hedophyllum sessile. Studies were conducted at two sites along the Oregon coast: Strawberry Hill (an intermittent upwelling region) and Cape Blanco North (a persistent upwelling region). Herbivory and light availability were manipulated and kelp performance metrics (density and length) were measured monthly from May to November 2019. We found that the effects of herbivory and light availability were pronounced at Cape Blanco North but negligible at Strawberry Hill. At Cape Blanco North, herbivory had strong but opposing effects on the density and length of H. sessile. Kelp density was higher in treatments without herbivores while kelp length was greater in treatments with herbivores. Responses also differed with the life history stage. Herbivory had negative effects on juvenile kelp but positive effects on adult kelp while light availability had opposing effects on the length of juvenile and adult kelps. The length of juvenile kelps was higher in shaded treatments while the length of adult kelps was higher in unshaded treatments. Our study highlights the potential importance of coastal geophysical processes (and subsequently, nutrients) in modifying herbivore and light effects on population dynamics of H. sessile, and how these dynamics may be further influenced by different characteristics of the kelp (i.e., demographic traits and life history stages).

AB  - The sexual reproduction of Sasa borealis, a species of dwarf bamboo, occurred in central Japan from 2016 to 2017. S. borealis grows on the forest floor and serves as an important source of habitat and food for various animals. Sexual reproduction occurs in synchrony among individuals in a given area, leading to a decline in population and causing substantial disturbances to the forest ecosystem; however, the subsequent regeneration process remains unclear. In this study, we investigated S. borealis seedling regeneration over six years. Fixed plots were established in the forest in the year following the sexual reproductive event, and the growth of seedlings was monitored from seed emergence to seedling growth at the individual level. We considered biotic and abiotic factors to evaluate their influence on regeneration. We examined mammalian and arthropod foraging as biotic factors. Conversely, abiotic factors included temperature and humidity near the ground surface, solar radiation, soil conditions, and snow cover. Seedling growth was characterized by a slow rate and affected by morphological changes resulting from foraging and abiotic factors. The return of S. borealis to its presexual reproductive stage requires an extended duration. Our study provides precious information for future S. borealis conservation and management strategies.

AB  - DNA from the environment (eDNA) has been increasingly used as a new tool to conduct biodiversity assessment. Because of its noninvasive and less time-consuming nature, many studies of recent years solely rely on this information to establish a species inventory. eDNA metabarcoding has been shown to be an efficient method in aquatic ecosystems, especially for fish. However, detection efficiency is not clear for mammals. Using the existing literature, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate if eDNA metabarcoding allows greater detection success compared to conventional surveys (such as field surveys, camera traps, etc.). Although only 28 articles were retrieved, showing the lack of comparative studies, still representing more than 900 taxa detected, we found that detection success was method dependent, but most importantly varies on the taxonomy of the targeted taxa. eDNA metabarcoding performed poorly for bats compared to the traditional mist nests. However, strong detection overlaps were found between conventional surveys and eDNA for large-bodied mammals such as ungulates, primates, and carnivores. Overall, we argue that using both molecular and field approaches can complement each other and can maximize the most accurate biodiversity assessment and there is much room for metabarcoding optimization to reach their full potential compared to traditional surveys.
   We compared conventionnal surveys methods with eDNA for mammal biodiversity inventories. Although more taxa were detected using eDNA, we found low overlap detection between methods, arguing for the use of both methods at this time to maximize the accuracy of biodiversity assessment.image

AB  - Birds increase crop yields via consumption of pests in some contexts but disrupt pest control via intraguild predation in others. Landscape complexity acts as an inconsistent mediator, sometimes increasing, decreasing, or not impacting pest control. Here, we examined how landscape context and seasonal variation mediate the impact of birds on arthropod pests and natural enemies, leaf damage, and yields of broccoli (Brassica oleracea) on highly diversified farms that spanned the USA west coast. Our study had two complementary components: a bird exclusion experiment and molecular diet analysis of 357 fecal samples collected from the most commonly captured bird species that also foraged in Brassica fields-American Goldfinch (Spinus tristis), American Robin (Turdus migratorius), Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodia), and White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys). Bird access yielded higher, rather than lower, numbers of pest aphids and increased their parasitism, while no other arthropods examined were consistently impacted. Independent of bird presence, percent natural cover in the landscape sometimes increased and sometimes decreased densities of arthropods in the mid-growth period, with diminishing impacts in the late-growth period. Herbivore feeding damage to broccoli leaves decreased with increasing amounts of natural land cover and in the late-growth period. Molecular diet analysis revealed that Brassica pests and predatory arthropods were relatively uncommon prey for birds. Landscape context did not alter the prey items found in bird diets. Altogether, our bird-exclusion experiment and molecular diet analysis suggested that birds have relatively modest impacts on the arthropods associated with broccoli plantings. More broadly, the limited support in our study for net natural pest control services suggests that financial incentives may be required to encourage the adoption of bird-friendly farming practices in certain cropping systems.

AB  - Developing protocols that maximize the total sperm output during a semen collection from an endangered species is essential for strategic genome resource banking practices. Exogenous oxytocin has been administered to domestic bovid species prior to semen collection to increase the total sperm count from a single collection. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the administration of exogenous oxytocin prior to semen collection by electroejaculation (EEJ) would significantly increase the total sperm count of the ejaculate obtained from banteng. Banteng were administered exogenous oxytocin (50 i.u.) intravenously similar to 10 min prior to EEJ. Ejaculates from 13 banteng (n = 6 oxytocin treated, n = 8 untreated) were assessed for volume, pH, osmolarity, sperm concentration, total sperm count, percentage of motile sperm, status (scale of 0-5; 0 = no forward progression, 5 = rapid straight forward progression). In banteng ejaculates, significant (p < 0.05) differences were observed in volume, sperm concentration, and total sperm count between oxytocin treated (Mean +/- SEM; 17.5 +/- 3.7 ml, 2,138 +/- 883.9 x 10(6) sperm/ml, 32,070 +/- 8,812 x 10(6) sperm), and untreated (9.1 +/- 1.8 ml, 308.8 +/- 69.3 x 10(6) sperm/ml, 2,702 +/- 763.7 x 10(6) sperm) bulls. These findings indicate that administering oxytocin to banteng prior to semen collection significantly increases total sperm count, and if routinely used, would maximize the number of banteng spermatozoa available in a genome resource bank. Semen was observed on the prepuce prior to the start of the EEJ procedure in three of the oxytocin-treated banteng, indicating oxytocin may be a useful agent to administer prior to other semen collection techniques such as urethral catheterization.

AB  - Passive approaches to nature recovery have been hailed as a low-cost approach to boosting biodiversity in ecologically degraded sites. But there remains little evidence of whether this generalises to all climatic and ecological contexts. To address this knowledge gap, we used satellite remote sensing to examine vegetation change in Alladale Wilderness Reserve, a remote rewilding site in Scotland where active and passive approaches have simultaneously taken place for the past decades. In contrast to enclosures and tree planting, more passive approaches did not help regenerate the native Caledonian forest, failing to lead to structural or functional change within Alladale, relative to the wider landscape. Observed changes under both approaches were moreover much less dramatic than those reported for the Knepp Estate, another established rewilding site in Southern England. Our results suggest that passive rewilding is unlikely to promote significant biodiversity change in areas where recent human forcing of ecological processes has been limited, even if past human pressures have intensively reshaped the ecosystem-as seen in Alladale. In such situations, active interventions are likely to be required to shift the system onto a new ecological trajectory. Altogether, our study illustrates how freely available satellite data can (1) help contrast the impacts of environmental management approaches on ecosystem structure and functioning, in ways that complement existing ground-based studies; and (2) help distinguish areas likely to benefit from passive nature recovery approaches from those where specific active interventions are needed.
   We use long-term satellite data to test the efficacy of passive and active approaches to nature recovery in Alladale Wilderness Reserve, in the Scottish Highlands. In contrast to enclosures and tree planting more passive approaches did not help regenerate the native Caledonian forest, failing to lead to structural or functional change within Alladale relative to the wider landscape. Our results suggest that passive rewilding is unlikely to promote significant biodiversity change in areas where recent human forcing of ecological processes has been limited, even if past human pressures have intensively reshaped the ecosystem-as seen in Alladale.image

AB  - We analysed the history behind the current contrasting lichen covers of two adjacent reindeer herding districts at the Finnish-Norwegian border. We conducted vegetation field inventories across the border fence and reconstructed a lichen cover history from 1959 to 2020 using aerial and satellite images. The oldest images showed only a slight difference in lichen cover between the different sides of the border fence. Since the late 1950s, lichen cover has decreased in both districts. At present, lichen biomass is approximately three times greater in in the Norwegian winter pasture than in the Finnish herding district, which has less strictly defined seasonal pastures. A lichen biomass model indicated that lichen intake by reindeer cannot explain the decline in lichen biomass in either of the districts. We suggest that the lichen decline is mainly due to trampling and foraging-induced loss, while other unknown ecological and climatological factors may also be involved.

AB  - Resource quality is a key driver of species abundance and community structure. Carrion is unique among resources due to its high nutritional quality, rapidly changing nature, and the diverse community of organisms it supports. Yet the role resource quality plays in driving variation in abundance patterns of carrion-associated species remains poorly studied. Here we investigate how species abundances change with a measure of resource change, and interpret these findings to determine how species differ in their association with carrion that changes in quality over time. We conducted field succession experiments using pigs and humans over two winters and one summer. We quantified the effect of total body score, an objective measure of resource change, on adult insect abundance using generalised additive models. For each species, phases of increasing abundance likely indicated attraction to a high-quality resource, and length of abundance maxima indicated optimal oviposition and feeding time. Some species such as the beetle Necrobia rufipes had a rapid spike in abundance, suggesting a narrow window of opportunity for carrion resource exploitation, while species like the wasp Nasonia vitripennis had a gradual change in abundance, indicating a wide window of resource exploitation. Different abundance patterns were also observed between species occurring on pigs and humans, suggesting cadaver type is an important aspect of resource quality. Our findings show that species abundances, unlike species occurrences, can reveal additional detail about species exploitation of carrion and provide information about how resource quality may drive competition and variation in insect community succession.

AB  - Algal turfs are the most abundant benthic covering on reefs in many shallow-water marine ecosystems. The particulates and sediments bound within algal turfs can influence a multitude of functions within these ecosystems. Despite the global abundance and importance of algal turfs, comparison of algal turf-bound sediments is problematic due to a lack of standardisation across collection methods. Here we provide an overview of three methods (vacuum sampling, airlift sampling, and TurfPods), and the necessary equipment (including construction suggestions), commonly employed to quantify sediments from algal turfs. We review the purposes of these methods (e.g. quantification of standing stock versus net accumulation) and how methods can vary depending on the research question or monitoring protocol. By providing these details in a readily accessible format we hope to encourage a standardised set of approaches for marine benthic ecologists, geologists and managers, that facilitates further quantification and global comparisons of algal turf sediments.

AB  - IntroductionAgriculture and biodiversity conservation are both vitally important human activities that overlap geographically and are often in conflict. Animal agriculture has been implicated in species loss and the degradation of ecosystems due to land clearing, overgrazing, and conflicts with large carnivores such as dingoes (Canis dingo). This paper explores the potential for transformation in Australian commercial livestock production from human-dingo conflict towards social-ecological coexistence. MethodA qualitative model that depicts transformative change was developed from field observations and twenty-one in-depth interviews with livestock producers, conservation researchers, grazing industry representatives and policy makers across Australia. The model articulates the current state of dingo management and the drivers of system change. ResultsSeven pathways are described to catalyse transformation from routine lethal management of dingoes towards a future vision that embeds mutually beneficial coexistence. Central to transformation is the adoption by livestock producers of preventive non-lethal innovations supported by a new farming movement, Predator Smart Farming, that balances livestock grazing and wildlife conservation values to unlock the resilience of landscapes, animals (domesticated and wild) and livelihoods. Other key pathways include targeted research, capacity building, outreach and knowledge sharing networks; institutional (policy, legislation, and economic incentives) and cultural change; public awareness raising and advocacy to reduce lethal control; and greater involvement of Indigenous Australians in decisions relating to wildlife management. DiscussionThe seven transition pathways are discussed in relation to how they can collectively foster coexistence with dingoes in extensive rangelands grazing systems. International examples of interventions are used to illustrate the types of successful actions associated with each pathway that could inform action in Australia. The findings have implications for coexistence with large carnivores in rangeland ecosystems globally.

AB  - Specialised natural enemies can locally suppress seeds and seedlings near conspecific adults more than far from them. Whilst this is thought to facilitate species coexistence, the relative contribution of multiple enemies to whether heterospecific seeds and seedlings rather than conspecifics perform better beneath a particular adult species remains less clear, especially in regions with spatially extensive monodominant stands. We designed a field exclusion experiment to separate the effects of fungi, insects and vertebrates on the seedling establishment and early survival of two temperate tree species, Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies, in the adult tree monocultures of these species. Our experiment demonstrates the key role of vertebrates in mediating the effects of adult trees on seeds and seedlings. Due to vertebrates and partly insects, Fagus sylvatica seedlings survived worse beneath conspecific than heterospecific adults and were also outperformed by Picea abies seedlings beneath their own adults. Picea abies seedling establishment was higher beneath conspecific than heterospecific adults, but Fagus sylvatica seedlings outperformed them beneath their own adults. The impact of enemies on Picea abies establishment beneath conspecific adults was less clear. Fungi did not influence seedling establishment and survival. Our findings highlight the need to compare enemy impacts on each seedling species beneath conspecific and heterospecific adults with their impacts on conspecific and heterospecific seedlings beneath a particular adult species. Such evaluations can shed more light on the role of enemies in tree communities by identifying the plant-enemy interactions that facilitate species coexistence and those that promote species monodominance.

AB  - Over the last 20 years, ecological restoration of degraded habitats has become common in conservation practice. Mountain hares (Lepus timidus scoticus) were surveyed during 2017-2021 using 830 km of line transects in the Peak District National Park, England. Historically degraded bog areas were previously reported having low hare numbers. Following bog restoration, we found hare densities of 32.6 individuals km(-2), notably higher than neighboring degraded (unrestored) bog with 24.4 hares km(-2). Hare density on restored peatland was 2.7 times higher than on bogs managed for grouse shooting at 12.2 hares km(-2) and 3.3 times higher than on heather moorland managed for grouse shooting at 10.0 hares km(-2). Yearly estimates varied most on habitats managed for grouse, perhaps indicative of the impact of habitat management, for example, heather burning and/or possible hare culling to control potential tick-borne louping ill virus in gamebirds. Acid grassland used for sheep farming had a similar density to grouse moorland at 11.8 hares km(-2). Unmanaged dwarf shrub heath had the lowest density at 4.8 hares km(-2). Hare populations are characterized by significant yearly fluctuations, those in the study area increasing by 60% between 2017 and 2018 before declining by ca. 15% by 2020 and remaining stable to 2021. During an earlier survey in 2002, total abundance throughout the Peak District National Park was estimated at 3361 (95% CI: 2431-4612) hares. The present study estimated 3562 (2291-5624) hares suggesting a stable population over the last two decades despite fluctuations likely influenced by weather and anthropogenic factors. Mountain hares in the Peak District favored bog habitats and were associated with restored peatland habitat. Wildlife management should be cognizant of hare density variation between habitats, which may have implications for local extinction risk.

AB  - Understanding how parasitism may affect social behavior and social networks is key to understanding the impact of infection on a population. Infection can disrupt social networks by altering the behavior of both infected individuals (e.g. by reducing activity) and the behavior of uninfected individuals (e.g. avoiding sick individuals), both of which can have an impact on social group dynamics and parasite transmission. Here we test experimentally how parasitism affects social contact behavior and social network structure using a common parasite infection of sheep. Three treatment groups, each with 4 replicate social groups were established (i) Parasitised; all lambs were infected with a parasitic nematode, (ii) Non-parasitised; all lambs remained uninfected (iii) Mixed; part of each group were infected, and part of the group remained uninfected. Contact behaviours of each individual were recorded using proximity loggers during four phases of infection (pre-parasite, pre-patent, patent-parasite, post-parasite). We found infected individuals in the parasitised and mixed groups reduced contact frequency following infection. Despite the reduction in contacts between infected animals in the mixed group, non-infected individual's maintained pre-parasite levels of social interactions with their infected conspecifics. These results demonstrate how infection can impact the social behavior of all animals within a group, and how the expression of behavioral change may depend on the parasitic status of all group members and the response of uninfected conspecifics.

AB  - In November 2006, the City of Hammond, Louisiana, began discharging secondarily treated, disinfected municipal effluent through a distribution pipeline to a 14,000 ha emergent wetland complex referred to as the East Joyce Wetlands. The primary goals were to improve local water quality by taking effluent that would normally be discharged to local waterways and directing it to wetlands that were hydrologically isolated and degraded by saltwater intrusion. During the 2007 growing season there was robust growth of marsh vegetation with a near doubling of productivity compared to controls, however, during winter 2007 there was a massive decline in vegetation and transition to open water in the 121 ha of wetlands in the direct path of effluent discharge. Herbivory by nutria was found to be the cause of the decline, but not before several other causes were hypothesized and largely accepted by the public, specifically that the cause of the vegetation decline was due to excess nutrients that increased rates of soil decomposition and limited root growth of plants. Studies show these hypotheses were flawed due to scale and methodology issues. Intensive nutria removal began in the spring of 2008 and continued through the winter of 2008-2009, with approximately 2000 nutria killed, and vegetation recovery began during the spring of 2009, which was most pronounced and consistent nearest the discharge pipe. Vegetative cover increased dramatically from the near complete loss after nutria grazing to near 80% by 2015, and wetland recovery has continued to the present.

AB  - Mongolia's vast grasslands, crucial for both environmental and economic stability, are currently facing challenges due to overgrazing, climate change, and land -use changes. Understanding and effectively managing their Carrying Capacity (CC) and Relative Stocking Density (RSD) is essential for maintaining ecological balance. This study rigorously evaluates the CC and RSD of Mongolia's grasslands through an innovative approach that integrates ecological models with socio-economic data, aimed at improving grazing management practices. Data from the National Agency for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring validates the model, providing precise CC and RSD estimates at the Soum level from 2000 to 2019. The study reveals significant regional variations in CC: northern grasslands exhibit a high CC of 2.8 Sheep Units (SU) per hectare, contrasting with the fragile CC in some southern regions, like the Gobi Desert, where it is as low as 0.3 SU per hectare. Approximately 38.8 % of Mongolia's territory maintains a CC exceeding 1.0 SU per hectare, indicative of sustainable grasslands. In contrast, 41.7 % of the land, primarily in southern regions, shows CCs below 0.5 SU per hectare, highlighting ecosystem vulnerability. The RSD, reflecting livestock numbers relative to CC, averages 1.07, suggesting a high livestock concentration near Ulaanbaatar but a more sustainable density across 43.2 % of the country. The research also explores adaptation scenarios against desertification and degradation, as well as improving pasture accessibility, providing insights for future grassland management strategies. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the need for sustainable land management practices to balance carrying capacity and stocking rates, offering a vital tool for policymakers and stakeholders in grassland conservation.

AB  - Evaluating the diversity of multiple taxa is fundamental to understand community assembly and to assess the integrity and functionality of tropical secondary forests. In this study, we analyzed the natural regeneration of tropical dry forests (TDFs) in three regions of Brazil using Hill-Simpson diversity, abundance and beta-diversity of trees and five groups of insects (herbivores, fruit-feeding butterflies, ants, culicid mosquitoes and dung beetles). Sampling was conducted in 39 0.1 ha plots using a chronosequence approach (13 plots in early, intermediate and old-growth forests). We evaluated the contribution of three different levels to gamma-diversity: alpha (within plots), beta 1 (among plots) and beta 2 (among successional stages), and further determined the relative importance of turnover (species replacement) and nestedness (differences in species number among sites) to beta 2. Our results showed that, unexpectedly, the Hill-Simpson diversity was consistently higher in early than old-growth stages for all regions, but varied more widely in the intermediate stages. For each group separately, the same trend was observed for butterflies, ants, dung beetles and herbivores and did not differ among stages for mosquitoes. Successional differences in abundance were only detected for trees (increasing along the gradient) and for mosquitoes (decreasing). According to our expectations, the additive partitioning analysis showed that beta 2-diversity contributed more to gamma-diversity than beta 1-diversity, when all taxa were considered together and for most of them separately (except for butterflies and dung beetles). Most of the beta 2-diversity was due to species turnover, but this contribution varied among groups and regions, with the highest turnover for herbivores and the lowest for dung beetles. Our results suggest that the Hill-Simpson diversity and changes in species composition (as given by beta 2-diversity) are better indicators of forest natural regeneration than raw species richness, corroborating previous studies with plants and animals.

AB  - Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries-Reserve (TURF-Reserve) is a form of rights-based fisheries management that could improve the effectiveness and coral reef conservation efforts in Marine Protected Area (MPA). Maya Tribe Customary Council with Mayalibit Bay customary communities declared Customary Fisheries Management (CFM), a fishery resources management approach that combines customary marine tenure, traditional ecological wisdom, and TURF-Reserve principles. This study aims to measure coral reef health conditions to illustrate CFM's effectiveness in maintaining coral reef conditions in Mayalibit Bay. This study uses Point Intercept Transect (PIT) and fish belt transect as data collection methods to gather coral reef health data. Coral reef condition is measured using five indicators with ecological thresholds. Study results show that there is an increase of reef fish biomass and herbivore fish biomass proportion compared to previous condition which indicate a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Decreasing macroalgae: hard coral ratio along with fished: unfished ratio compared to previous condition indicate coral reef ecosystem with moderate condition. This study concluded that the coral reef ecosystem in Mayalibit Bay is in healthy condition and its reef fisheries activities are still considered sustainable. Based on the healthy coral reef condition, CFM is shown as an effective approach in maintaining coral reef ecosystem condition, complementing conservation efforts, and reef fishery resources management in Mayalibit Bay.

AB  - The return of agricultural waste to the field is one of the most effective strategies of increasing crop yield, improving the soil's physicochemical properties, and improving the soil rhizosphere environment. In the present study, sheep manure (SM), cow manure (CM), tail vegetable (TV), mushroom residue (MR), and corn straw (CS) were used as raw materials, and no fertilization (CK1) and local commercial organic fertilizer (CK2) treatments were used as controls. Eight composts were set up using specific mass ratios of different compost materials. After fermentation, field experiments were conducted to determine the cabbage yield, soil's physicochemical properties, and soil rhizosphere conditions. The eight composts increased the soil organic matter and nutrient contents significantly. Among the eight fermentation formulas, T6 (CM:CS:TV:SM = 1:1:2:6), T7 (MR:CS:TV:SM = 1:1:2:6), and T8 (CM:MR:CS:TV:SM = 1:1:1:2:5) were relatively effective. Therefore, high-throughput sequencing was performed on T6, T7, T8, CK1, and CK2. T6, T7, and T8 exhibited increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinomycetes, and Firmicutes, while the Acidobacteria abundance was decreased. In addition, Ascomycota's and Basidiomycetes' relative abundance decreased, and the oil chytrid and mortierella increased. The microbial community structure was affected significantly by pH, electrical conductivity, available potassium, available nitrogen, and organic matter. In general, the three composts increased yield by improving the soil's physicochemical properties, fertility, and microbial community structure. Among them, T6 had the most significant effect and is the optimal formula for use as a local organic cabbage fertilizer, and it could facilitate sustainable agricultural development.

AB  - Despite the vast diversity of phytophagous insects that feed on vascular plants (tracheophytes), insects that feed on bryophytes remain understudied. Agromyzidae, one of the most species-rich phytophagous clades in Diptera, consists mainly of leaf-mining species that feed on tracheophytes. However, a recent discovery of thallus-mining species on liverworts and hornworts within the Liriomyza group of Phytomyzinae provides an opportunity to study host shifts between tracheophytes and bryophytes. This study aimed to explore the origin and diversification of thallus-miners and estimate the pattern and timing of host shifts. Phylogenetic analysis of Phytomyzinae has revealed that the thallus-mining agromyzids formed a separate clade, which was sister to a fern pinnule-miner. The diversification of bryophyte-associated agromyzids since the Oligocene involved multiple host shifts across various bryophyte taxa. The diversification of the thallus-mining Phytoliriomyza may have occurred at the same time as the leaf-mining agromyzid flies on herbaceous plants, indicating a dynamic history of interactions between bryophytes and herbivores in angiosperms-dominated ecosystems.

AB  - Seagrass meadows provide important habitats and rich organic carbon sources for consumers at different trophic levels but are threatened by accelerating eutrophication in coastal waters. Nevertheless, at present, carbon transfer processes throughout the food web and trophic pathways in eutrophic seagrass meadows are still poorly known. To resolve this issue, carbon sources of different trophic communities in a eutrophic tropical seagrass meadow [Xincun (XC) bay, South China Sea] under eutrophication were examined in summer and winter using dual stable isotopes. The delta C-13 value of omnivores and carnivores overlapped more with that of herbivores and planktivores/filter feeders, which mainly overlapped with that of epiphytes in summer and macroalgae in winter. Meanwhile, epiphytes and macroalgae exhibited high biomass and corresponding highest contribution to herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores in summer and winter, respectively. These results suggest that the grazing food chain was the main trophic pathway in this eutrophic seagrass meadow, and that the transfer of carbon flow in the grazing food chain was mainly dominated by the proliferating epiphytes or macroalgae carbon. In contrast, the contribution of seagrass to detritivores in both seasons was higher than that of other food sources. Our findings suggest that in eutrophic tropical seagrass meadows, the proliferation of epiphytes or macroalgae induced by high nutrient loading, as well as their seasonal changes, has a greater impact on the transfer of carbon in the grazing food chain than that in the detritus food chain, and the seagrass fueled the food web mainly through the detritus food chain.

AB  - Fencing is one of the most widely utilized tools for reducing human-wildlife conflict in agricultural landscapes. However, the increasing global footprint of fencing exceeds millions of kilometers and has unintended consequences for wildlife, including habitat fragmentation, movement restriction, entanglement, and mortality. Here, we present a novel and quantitative approach to prioritize fence removal within historic migratory pathways of white-bearded wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) across Kenya's Greater Masai Mara Ecosystem. Our approach first assesses historic and contemporary landscape connectivity of wildebeest between seasonal ranges by incorporating two sets of GPS tracking data and fine-scale fencing data. We then predict connectivity gains from simulated fence removal and evaluate the impact of different corridor widths and locations on connectivity and removal costs derived from locally implemented interventions. Within the study system, we found that modest levels of fence removal resulted in substantial connectivity gains (39%-54% improvement in connectivity for 15-140 km of fence line removed). By identifying the most suitable corridor site, we show that strategically placed narrow corridors outperform larger, more expensive interventions. Our results demonstrate how and where targeted fence removal can enhance connectivity for wildlife. Our framework can aid in identifying suitable and cost-effective corridor restoration sites to guide decision-makers on the removal of fences and other linear barriers. Our approach is transferable to other landscapes where the removal or modification of fences or similar barriers is a feasible mitigation strategy to restore habitat and migratory connectivity.

AB  - Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation, and over the last 10 years the ready availability of whole-genome sequencing has permitted direct estimation of mutation rate for many non-model species across the tree of life. In this meta-analysis, we make a comprehensive search of the literature for mutation rate estimates in eukaryotes, identifying 140 mutation accumulation (MA) and parent-offspring (PO) sequencing studies covering 134 species. Based on these data, we revisit differences in the single-nucleotide mutation (SNM) rate between different phylogenetic lineages and update the known relationships between mutation rate and generation time, genome size, and nucleotide diversity-while accounting for phylogenetic nonindependence. We do not find a significant difference between MA and PO in estimated mutation rates, but we confirm that mammal and plant lineages have higher mutation rates than arthropods and that unicellular eukaryotes have the lowest mutation rates. We find that mutation rates are higher in species with longer generation times and larger genome sizes, even when accounting for phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, although nucleotide diversity is positively correlated with mutation rate, the gradient of the relationship is significantly less than one (on a logarithmic scale), consistent with higher mutation rates in populations with smaller effective size. For the 29 species for which data are available, we find that indel mutation rates are positively correlated with nucleotide mutation rates and that short deletions are generally more common than short insertions. Nevertheless, despite recent progress, no estimates of either SNM or indel mutation rates are available for the majority of deeply branching eukaryotic lineages-or even for most animal phyla. Even among charismatic megafauna, experimental mutation rate estimates remain unknown for amphibia and scarce for reptiles and fish.

AB  - Wildlife plays an important role in the emergence of livestock diseases, and their movements can complicate disease management efforts. One of the most significant vector-borne diseases of livestock worldwide is bovine babesiosis, spread by cattle fever ticks (CFTs; Rhipicephalus [=Boophilus] microplus and Rhipicephalus [=Boophilus] annulatus). Although CFTs were eradicated from the United States by 1943, bovine babesiosis and CFTs are prevalent in Mexico. Recently, management of CFTs in the Texas-Mexico region has been complicated by the presence of free-ranging, exotic nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus). Nilgai are abundant in this region and are competent hosts for CFTs. The goal of this study was to better understand nilgai movements and space use to inform CFT treatment strategies. We analyzed hourly locations from 40 GPS-collared nilgai in Cameron County, TX, USA, from April 2019 to September 2020. We assigned each nilgai a movement behavior using the net squared displacement metric. We estimated nilgai home range sizes at different temporal scales (monthly, seasonally, and overall) using Brownian bridge movement models. We observed movement patterns consistent with residency (52.5%), seasonal movers (17.5%), dispersal (5%), and unclassified (25%). Resident nilgai had an average maximum axial distance of 7.8 km, while two young females made separate dispersal movements of about 40 km within a year. Overall, nilgai had large and highly variable home ranges: annual median home range estimate for females was 563 ha (range = 105-1545 ha), and for males, it was 937 ha (range = 221-1602 ha). Peak nilgai movements occurred during crepuscular hours, and median hourly movement for females was 57 m/h, and for males, it was 66 m/h. Nilgai home ranges and long-distance movements have the potential to overlap multiple ranches, as the typical ranch size in South Texas ranges from 250 to 6000 ha. Resident nilgai were more likely to maintain local infestations of CFT. Dispersal events took place during peak tick season, demonstrating the potential for nilgai to aid in the spread of CFT. Understanding these behaviors will help the CFT Eradication Program develop more efficacious treatment strategies to treat infestations in nilgai.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Corylus avellana L. (Hazel) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Wild C. avellana in Britain and Ireland grows in a wide climatic and ecological range, in a broad suite of vegetation communities, particularly woodlands, at all latitudes and from 0 to 650 m asl. It supports a large number of faunal and fungal associates. The developing plant sends up basal shoots every spring from the peripheral parts of its underground stool, which gives it a structural regenerative advantage over cohabitant woody species. The flowers and pollen of C. avellana are adapted for wind pollination, yet honeybees have been observed to gather its pollen. The pollen and fruit of C. avellana are a cause of allergic reactions in sensitive people, with previous exposure to Birch pollen a strong predictor of the food allergy. Corylus avellana is native to Europe and western Asia, and was one of the first plant species to recolonize Europe after the last gIacial period. By the time of its cultivation in the Roman empire, regional human-selected lineages of C. avellana were already developing, with independent domestication in the western and eastern Mediterranean. Corylus avellana is a genetically diverse taxon with effective gene flow across populations, presenting a continuum of wild to domesticated plants. Its nuts and involucres show a wide morphological variability, with hundreds of cultivars and forms proposed. The taxon Corylus maxima Mill. is sympatric and fully fertile with C. avellana, yet rarely self-sown and their hybrid is little recorded in Britain and Ireland. Independent molecular studies have concluded that specimens of C. maxima cluster with C. avellana. Hazelnuts are globally one of the most important nut crops, currently with 70% of traded nuts being grown in Turkiye, followed by Italy and Azerbaijan.

AB  - The Allee effect is a density-dependent phenomenon in which individual fitness increases as population density increases at low population densities. Over the past few decades, a growing number of studies have identified Allee effects in populations using experimental approaches and statistical modeling techniques. These studies have investigated multiple Allee mechanisms (e.g. mate-finding, predation, resource limitation), across a range of systems and taxa (e.g. plants, vertebrates, invertebrates). This meta-analysis aims to synthesize studies that experimentally manipulated population density and measured either per capita population growth or fitness components, with the goal of determining whether the 'magnitude' of the Allee effect (defined here as the positive correlation between population density and population growth or fitness) varies with Allee mechanism across taxonomic groups. A total of 2305 studies were screened, and 62 of these studies met our meta-analysis inclusion criteria. Within these 62 studies, 155 effect sizes encompassing nine different Allee mechanisms were identified across five broad taxa. When grouped by Allee mechanism and taxa, the magnitude of the Allee effect differed across mechanisms, whereas taxonomic group was less useful at explaining variation in the magnitude of Allee effects. Of the nine Allee mechanisms identified, interspecific competition was associated with the largest Allee effects, followed by fear, pollen limitation and mate limitation. These findings suggest that Allee effects may be more dependent on mechanism than taxa and may function similarly within different taxonomic groups. However, as the majority of experimental Allee effect studies included in this meta-analysis focused on plants and invertebrates, more research is needed on Allee effects in other taxonomic groups to confirm this conclusion. This first quantitative synthesis of Allee effect research in ecology offers novel insight into how Allee mechanisms affect the manifestation of Allee effects in populations, providing important information for ecologists and conservationists.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is distinguished by its diverse ecosystems and biodiversity, which are highly dependent on their soil. In this study, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to assess the ecological risks in Maqin County, located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, along with the local background values of soil elements, level of element enrichment, and source appointment of soil elements. The findings show that the background soil element levels in Maqin County were greater than the average soil content values in China. The soils in the study area exhibited pollution levels ranging from weak to moderate. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was employed to successfully categorized soil elements into four sources: F1 (natural sources), F2 (grazing sources), F3 (volcanic and rock fracture sources), and F4 (intrusive and deep rock source). Based on the characteristics of the ecological communities and the network environmental analysis model, ecological risks were directly introduced through vegetation and soil microorganisms, with subsequent transmission to other components of the ecosystem through the food chain. The integrated risks associated with vegetation, herbivores, soil microorganisms, and carnivores were 0.0106, 0.00193, 0.0282, and 0.00132, respectively. Notably, soil microorganisms were found to be the primary contributors to the total ecological risk in the study area. Furthermore, network environmental analysis and human health risk models revealed that F1, F2, F3, and F4 accounted for 16.85 %, 8.90 %, 21.76 %, and 52.49 % of the input risk of vegetation and soil microorganisms, respectively. Particularly, F4 emerged as the largest contributor to human health risks. This study provides valuable information for the preservation of the ecological environment in pastoral areas, contributing to the global promotion of sustainable ecological practices.

AB  - North-African slender-horned gazelles are facing extensive poaching pressure. The main remaining population patch occurs in Saharan habitat between Tunisia and Algeria. Access to the species' distribution range in both countries is limited by difficult terrain and strict permitting requirements. We explored a mix of aerial (1365 km) and ground transects (351 km) to monitor the Grand Erg Oriental which covers the species' range in Tunisia. Only ungulate spoors but no gazelles were observed during the aerial survey over the southern part of the study area. Ground survey in the northern part revealed more conclusive results with evidence and observation of one couple, one group of three and another of four individuals. Our results confirm the presence of a slender-horned gazelle population in Tunisia yet support the need for immediate intervention to halt its decline. Ex-situ con-servation is essential to the species' future survival and continuous monitoring of the wild range is recommended.

AB  - Giving-up densities (GUDs) are a frequently used technique that ascertains the value of a forager's patch use by measuring foraging harvest rate. However, it is not always feasible to measure GUDs due to issues such as non-target species accessing the food items and experimental designs not meeting all of the assumptions of GUDs. Under such circumstances, measuring activity densities can be a valuable alternative approach that can still address many of the same ecological questions as GUDs. Our objective was to design a feeder that enables the accurate measurement of ungulate habitat preference and space use by measuring activity densities and excluding non-target species from data collection. We conducted two experiments to measure the efficacy of our feeder design. The first measured the activity densities of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in three habitat types (forest, old-field, and ecotone). We then used trail cameras to monitor the frequency at which non-target species accessed our modified feeder design compared to a traditional feeding bin used in GUD experiments. We found that our feeders were able to discern habitat preference, and that white-tailed deer preferred to use the old-field habitat over the forest. From the camera-trap experiment, we found that non-target species foraged 173 times from feeding trays and zero times from our feeder design during asynchronous 5-day sampling periods. Additionally, our feeder design can be tailored to other ungulate species and provides a method that can quantify resource use and preference via measuring activity densities, while removing non-target species from data collection. Significance statement Giving-up densities (GUDs) are a powerful behavioral indicator of foraging preference. Studies that measure GUDs frequently address the foraging behavior of individuals relative to habitat preference, predation risk, and other costs that can influence the fitness of a forager. However, many studies that measure GUDs deal with the issue of non-target species gaining access to the food source which can alter the results of a study and, in some cases, make results impossible to attain. The feeder design that we use for this experiment is suitable for measuring activity densities in place of GUDs for ungulate species and restricts access to non-target species that could alter the results of an experiment. Our approach provides a method for research that is related to foraging behavior and landscape use, and enables activity densities to be collected in circumstances where GUDs cannot.

AB  - Spatial variation in plant community composition is an important driver of variation in susceptibility to herbivores. In close proximity, certain neighbors can attract or repel herbivores to a focal plant ("associational effects"). Neighboring plants may also compete for resources, modifying their phenotype in ways that affect susceptibility to herbivores. To test whether and how competition contributes to associational effects, we manipulated the sharing of belowground resources among plant neighbors (spotted Joe Pye weed and common boneset) that serve as alternate hosts for an herbivorous beetle. In the field, the beetle Ophraella notata laid more eggs and inflicted more damage on plants of both species that were released from belowground competition with neighbors. Competition also weakened the effects of neighbor identity during field trials, reducing associational susceptibility. When beetles were forced to choose between the two host species in cage trials, competition again reduced beetle use of Joe Pye weed as a secondary host. To test the role of plant traits related to herbivore defense and nutrition, we quantified leaf protein, specific leaf area, and trichomes, and conducted behavioral assays on leaf disks. Beetles did not distinguish between Joe Pye weed treatments at the leaf disk level, and competition did not impact specific leaf area and protein. Trichome density was higher in both species in the preferred treatment. Overall, our results suggest that belowground interactions between plants may mediate the strength of associational effects, as secondary hosts become more attractive when released from competition with primary host plants.

AB  - Avoiding the undesirable impacts of invasive species requires robustly evaluating the effects of alternative management scenarios. Such evaluations depend on reliable spatio-temporal projections of changes in the distribution and abundance of the invasive species under different scenarios. However, commonly used modelling approaches are constrained for this purpose because they do not incorporate demographic processes and are seldom validated.We develop a spatially and temporally explicit grid-based population model for invasive fallow deer Dama dama in Tasmania, Australia, validated against observed distribution and abundance 'targets' using a pattern-oriented approach. We use this validated model to project the future invasion patterns of deer, including encroachment into areas of high conservation value, under eight harvest and habitat suitability scenarios.Projected population sizes of deer differ greatly depending on harvest and habitat suitability scenarios. Without harvest, the population grows sixfold, from about 80,000 deer in 2019 to over 500,000 by 2100. In contrast, the population stabilises at 32,000-41,000 deer with 25% annual harvest. Abundance in the environmentally sensitive Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA), a region of high conservation value, increases in all scenarios. We identify likely areas in the expanding range of deer where targeted removal should be most effective at minimising deer numbers in the TWWHA.Synthesis and applications: Using a pattern-oriented model validated with spatio-temporal data, we show how the future distribution and abundance of invasive fallow deer in Tasmania can be substantially reduced by targeted increases in harvest and prioritising areas for removal around high conservation value regions. Our approach can be used to project likely effects of management interventions on future distributions and abundances for a range of invasive taxa.

AB  - Black Amur bream (Megalobrama terminalis), a dominant species, resides in the Pearl River basin, known for its high plasticity in digestive ability. During spawning season, M. terminalis individuals with large body size and high fertility undergo a spawn migratory phase, while other smaller individuals prefer to settlement over migration. It is well known that gut microbial community often underpins the metabolic capability and regulates a wide variety of important functions in fish. However, little was known about how the gut microbiomes affect fish breeding migration. To investigate the variations in the gut microbiome of M. terminalis during the migration, we used high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to reveal the distinct composition and diversity of the whole gut microbiome of migrated and nonmigrated population during period of peak reproduction, respectively. Our results indicated that nonmigrated population in estuary had a higher alpha diversity than that of migrated population in main stem. Additionally, an obvious abundant taxa shift between the gut microbiota community of nonmigrated and migrated M. terminalis was also observed. Change of dominant gut taxa from nonmigrated to migrated population was thought to be closely related to their degradation enzymes. Our results suggested that amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in migrated population were higher than that in nonmigrated population, providing a line of evidence for that M. terminalis change from partial herbivorous to partial carnivorous diet during breeding migration. We further concluded that, in order to digest foods of higher nutrition to supply energy to spawning migration, M. terminalis regulate activities of the gut microbiome and degradation enzymes, considered to be a key physiological strategy for reproduction.

AB  - Over the past few decades, wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations have surged globally, including in Tunisia, creating challenges that necessitate understanding the factors influencing their abundance and trends. Herein, we analyzed hunting statistics (number of seen and hunted animals during the hunting events) from 2008 to 2022 to examine the spatial pattern of wild boar abundance in the oases of Kebili and Gab & eacute;s in south Tunisia. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models, we examined the relationships between wild boar abundance (the number of animals seen during hunting activities) and hunting effectiveness (the ratio of hunted to seen animals during hunting activities), considering landscape structure, human infrastructure, and hunting pressure. Wild boar abundance was higher in Kebili than in Gab & eacute;s, but in Gab & eacute;s wild boar population trend was positive. Our results suggest that wild boar abundance was positively correlated with oasis size, mostly in oasis with presence of herb, shrub, and tree layers. Regarding hunting effectiveness, our results showed that it was significantly higher in Gab & eacute;s and was positively correlated with the distance to the nearest road. This study underscores the distinct dynamics of wild boar populations in the two regions and highlights the potential risk of population increase based on environmental conditions. The results emphasize the importance of region-specific management strategies that influence both abundance and distribution, and the capability to regulate wild boar populations by hunting. It also underscores the significance of collecting reliable hunting statistics to monitor population dynamics and formulate effective wildlife policies.

AB  - Gap-based silviculture and legacy-tree retention are strategies that can increase structural and resource heterogeneity while maintaining forest productivity at the stand scale. Nevertheless, areas of delayed regeneration have been noted in openings with some persisting for a decade or more. To better understand the causes of localized recruitment delay and/or near-term failure, we examined spatial patterning of persistent (>15 years) patches of regeneration failure (<= 1 sapling >1.37 m tall per 10 m2) at two long-term experimental gap experiments in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. During the summers of 2018 and 2019, we surveyed 84 harvest-created canopy gaps for areas of failure and mapped 79 individual patches where regeneration had failed to establish and recruit in a total of 52 openings. Spatial attributes of these individual patches were summarized and compared to their location relative to expected within (e.g., north versus south, distance from edge) and between gap (e.g., gap size) gradients in light resource availability. Spatial analyses revealed no significant trends between north and south regions of gaps, which suggests that regeneration failure at the gap scale is likely determined by factors disentangled from expected within-gap light resource gradients. At the site without legacy-tree retention, patches that had failed to regenerate trees occupied 17.3% of the total area in gaps (>10 m radius) and were located near gap center. In contrast, at the site with legacy trees, only 4.8% of the total area in gaps (>11 m radius) was occupied by patches of regeneration failure and patches were located near gap edge. Furthermore, increasing gap size was associated with a higher risk of regeneration failure only at the study site without legacy-tree retention. Our results suggest that legacy-tree retention may moderate the spatial extent of regeneration failure, however, further work is needed to clarify their long-term influence on regeneration dynamics within harvest openings.

AB  - Habitat loss is affecting many species, including the southern mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) population in western North America. Over the last half century, this threatened caribou population's range and abundance have dramatically contracted. An integrated population model was used to analyze 51 years (1973-2023) of demographic data from 40 southern mountain caribou subpopulations to assess the effectiveness of population-based recovery actions at increasing population growth. Reducing potential limiting factors on threatened caribou populations offered a rare opportunity to identify the causes of decline and assess methods of recovery. Southern mountain caribou abundance declined by 51% between 1991 and 2023, and 37% of subpopulations were functionally extirpated. Wolf reduction was the only recovery action that consistently increased population growth when applied in isolation, and combinations of wolf reductions with maternal penning or supplemental feeding provided rapid growth but were applied to only four subpopulations. As of 2023, recovery actions have increased the abundance of southern mountain caribou by 52%, compared to a simulation with no interventions. When predation pressure was reduced, rapid population growth was observed, even under contemporary climate change and high levels of habitat loss. Unless predation is reduced, caribou subpopulations will continue to be extirpated well before habitat conservation and restoration can become effective.

AB  - Climate change has altered the frequency and severity of extreme weather, which can affect vegetation condition and habitat quality for wildlife. Declines in vegetation productivity during droughts and heatwaves can negatively impact animals that depend on vegetation for water and nutrition. We used the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) to look at relationships between vegetation productivity and the presence of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in potential habitat throughout much of their range. Using a large, long-term koala presence dataset, we tested the hypothesis that locations where koalas had been observed would exhibit higher NDVI values than a random, representative sample from the same vegetation group. We also identified the minimum NDVI threshold at which koalas occurred across time for each vegetation group and compared these to the minimum NDVI values across potential koala habitat before and during the Millennium Drought, one of the worst recorded in Australia. Additionally, we investigated whether vegetation above the minimum NDVI thresholds was significantly closer to perennial water than unsuitable vegetation. We found that koalas tend to occur at locations with higher NDVI than average for all vegetation groups. Prior to the drought, 49% of potential koala habitat maintained a minimum NDVI above the koalas' threshold, equating to 190,227 km2, which declined to 166,746 km2 during drought (i.e., a 12% reduction). We also found that unsuitable vegetation tended to occur farther from perennial water than suitable vegetation for some vegetation groups. Areas that remained above the NDVI thresholds during the drought should be considered potential refugia for populations during an event of similar magnitude and could indicate future habitat extent.

AB  - In south-central Chile, the dynamics of southern beech (Nothofagaceae) stands vary predictably along climatic gradients. Beeches form persistent stands at high elevations, but their establishment on lowland sites depends mainly on catastrophic disturbances. In New Zealand, nearly all studies of beech forest dynamics to date have reported all-sized, persistent populations. However, previous work has focused largely on the South Island or on North Island mountains, where beeches are widespread and often dominant. Little is known about beech dynamics in the warm North Island lowlands, where beeches are less common. We aimed to clarify the circumstances that enable beeches to establish on lowland sites in the North Island. We measured population structures of beeches and associated species on 11 plots distributed across a range of climate, lithology and topography. On sites where the most shade-tolerant broadleaved trees were absent or uncommon, all-sized populations showed that beech regeneration did not depend on major disturbances. These stands were located mostly on steep faces or ridges with soil carbon:nitrogen ratios > 18, usually with ericaceous understoreys. On sites with higher N availability, where shade-tolerant broadleaved trees were abundant, beech populations were generally sparser, with restricted age ranges. One of these +/- even-aged beech stands appeared to have established after windthrow, the other four after fires. Recent dieback of Weinmannia racemosa associated with insect attack had resulted in another wave of beech regeneration in one of the post-fire stands. Establishment on landslides appears to only rarely enable beeches to capture new sites in the lowland North Island. We conclude that beeches form stable self-replacing stands on lowland North Island sites with low nitrogen availability, but that exogenous disturbances occasionally enable beeches to establish as pioneers on sites with higher nitrogen availability. The early successionalrole commonly seen in lowland south-central Chile thus appears less widespread in New Zealand.

AB  - Kelps and coralline algae are important primary producers and habitat-builders in rocky intertidal ecosystems. On wave-exposed shores along the west coast of North America, Hedophyllum sessile and Alaria marginata are two dominant kelp species with juveniles that often occur at a higher density on articulated corallines than other available substrates. Little is known of the mechanisms underlying this interaction. One hypothesized mechanism is that articulated coralline algae enhance kelp spore settlement and germination. This study tested this hypothesis by releasing spores from H. sessile and A. marginata onto multiple genetically identified articulated and crustose coralline species, as well as bare rock, then observing subsequent sporophyte densities. Kelp recruitment was generally higher on articulated corallines than on crustose corallines, although there was variation across coralline species. There was no significant difference between recruitment on bare rock and on articulated corallines, and recruitment was higher on bleached Corallina vancouveriensis than on live C. vancouveriensis, suggesting that this articulated coralline actively inhibits rather than promotes intertidal kelp settlement. Thus, other mechanisms, such as protection from herbivory or wave action, likely explain observed distributions of kelp recruits. This research contributes to understanding how the fine-scale distribution of kelps is linked to that of corallines.

AB  - Urbanization impacts plant-herbivore interactions, which are crucial for ecosystem functions such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. While some studies have reported reductions in insect herbivory in urban areas (relative to rural or natural forests), this trend is not consistent and the underlying causes for such variation remain unclear. We conducted a continental-scale study on insect herbivory along urbanization gradients for three European tree species: Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, and Fraxinus excelsior, and further investigated their biotic and abiotic correlates to get at mechanisms. To this end, we quantified insect leaf herbivory and foliar secondary metabolites (phenolics, terpenoids, alkaloids) for 176 trees across eight European cities. Additionally, we collected data on microclimate (air temperature) and soil characteristics (pH, carbon, nutrients) to test for abiotic correlates of urbanization effects directly or indirectly (through changes in plant secondary chemistry) linked to herbivory. Our results showed that urbanization was negatively associated with herbivory for Q. robur and F. excelsior, , but not for T. cordata. . In addition, urbanization was positively associated with secondary metabolite concentrations, but only for Q. robur. . Urbanization was positively associated with air temperature for Q. robur and F. excelsior, , and negatively with soil nutrients (magnesium) in the case of F. excelsior, , but these abiotic variables were not associated with herbivory. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence for indirect effects of abiotic factors via plant defences on herbivory for either Q. robur or F. excelsior. . Additional biotic or abiotic drivers must therefore be accounted for to explain observed urbanization gradients in herbivory and their interspecific variation.

AB  - Climate change affects soil microbial communities and their genetic exchange, and subsequently modifies the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacteria. However, how elevated CO2 impacts soil antibiotic resistome remains poorly characterized. Here, a free-air CO2 enrichment system was used in the field to investigate the responses of ARGs profiles and bacterial communities to elevated CO2 (+200 ppm) in soils amended with sulfadiazine (SDZ) at 0, 0.5 and 5 mg kg(-1). Results showed that SDZ exposure induced the co-occurrence of beta-lactamase and tetracycline resistance genes, and SDZ at 5 mg kg(-1) enhanced the abundance of aminoglycoside, sulfonamide and multidrug resistance genes. However, elevated CO2 weakened the effects of SDZ at 0.5 mg kg(-1) following an observed reduction in the total abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements. Additionally, elevated CO2 significantly decreased the abundance of vancomycin resistance genes and alleviated the stimulation of SDZ on the dissemination of aminoglycoside resistance genes. Correlation analysis and structural equation models revealed that elevated CO2 could directly influence the spread of ARGs or impose indirect effects on ARGs by affecting soil properties and bacterial communities. Overall, our results furthered the knowledge of the dissemination risks of ARGs under future climate scenarios.

AB  - Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) occur when a plant species modifies soil physicochemical and biological properties in ways that affect growth of a plant subsequently grown in the same soil. PSFs are influenced by both herbivory, and climatic conditions, but it is unclear how foliar herbivory and climate change interact to modify PSFs. A PSF experiment was conducted to assess the effect of foliar herbivory on Medicago sativa and Trifolium repens, when grown in monoculture and mixture. PSFs were assessed in soils from a field experiment simulating ambient rainfall and prolonged drought (50% reduction) for six years. All soils were sterilized and then re-inoculated to create the respective biological rainfall legacy treatments including a sterile control. The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, was used to induce herbivore treatments. Neither legume showed significant PSFs in the absence of herbivory. However, foliar herbivory induced positive PSFs for legumes in soil with drought legacies, and negative to neutral PSFs in soil with ambient rainfall legacies, when grown in monocultures. By contrast, herbivory induced strong positive PSFs in soils with ambient rainfall legacies, and negative PSFs in soils with drought legacies, in mixtures, possibly due to competition for space and resources. Herbivory-induced PSFs in soils with prolonged drought legacies appeared to be related to differences in leaf N concentration and rhizobia colonization likely due to effects on herbivore-induced systemic resistance. Our results indicate that foliar herbivores alter plant species co-existence and community dynamics under future climate change scenarios through changes in PSFs.

AB  - Urbanization and agricultural intensification are considered the main causes of recent insect decline in temperate Europe, while direct climate warming effects are still ambiguous. Nonetheless, higher temperatures advance spring leaf emergence, which in turn may directly or indirectly affect insects. We therefore investigated how Sentinel-2-derived start of season (SOS) and its spatial variability (SV-SOS) are affected by spring temperature and whether these green-up variables can explain insect biomass and richness across a climate and land-use gradient in southern Germany. We found that the effects of both spring green-up variables on insect biomass and richness differed between land-use types, but were strongest in forests. Here, insect richness and biomass were higher with later green-up (SOS) and higher SV-SOS. In turn, higher spring temperatures advanced SOS, while SV-SOS was lower at warmer sites. We conclude that with a warming climate, insect biomass and richness in forests may be affected negatively due to earlier and more uniform green-up. Promising adaptation strategies should therefore focus on spatial variability in green-up in forests, thus plant species and structural diversity.
   Earlier spring green-up and its reduced spatial variability is negatively correlated to insect richness and biomass in temperate forests. Through this pathway, climate warming may indirectly contribute to a decline in insect richness and biomass.

AB  - Comparison of woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) (Rh) individuals of different ages found at different times in Yakutia, i.e. a one-year old suckling (juvenis=infantulus), two 4-5-year old juveniles (subadultus), a 20-year old (adultus) and a 30-year old female (adultus=senex), and an adult of unknown sex, allows for age-related changes in their hair coat to be reconstructed. As the individual grew older, the colour of its coat seems to have changed from light to dark brown, with the possible presence of local colour spots (from light beige to reddish). The fur became more diverse (polymorphic), darker, longer, denser and thicker due to the growth of the upper tier hair (pile - overhair and guards) and thick underfur (downy hairs). The most powerful multi- layered fur covered the croup area. Of the main fine structures of hairs studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a dense cortex and a multilayered cuticle with similar patterns developed in the extinct Rh and the recent Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis). The main trend of adapting the hair coat of Rh was aimed at improving the mechanical strength of the fur, achieved due to an uneven development of the different hair structures - thick, rough cuticle and bark, and a poorly developed or completely absent less durable cellular medulla, as well as the formation of the upper protective tier of wool from a coarse pile. The multi- tiered nature of thick wool, especially the presence of underfur, provided the hair with excellent heat-protective and mechanical properties that effectively protected these animals from climatic and traumatic external impacts. A comparison of the fur of Rh with the wool of large ungulates of the mammoth fauna, such as the Woolly mammoth (Mam- muthus primigenius dagger), the primitive Steppe bison (Bison priscus) and the Muskox (Ovibos moschatus that exists since the time of the mammoth fauna), with the Bison (Bison bison), the Wisent (Bison bonasus), the Cave lion (Panthera spelaea dagger) and other representatives of the mammoth fauna reveals general patterns of adaptation of their hair to living in the harsh climatic conditions of the Ice Age in the Arctic.

AB  - Pseudomonas plecoglossicida is a facultative Gram-negative bacteria that causes 'visceral granulomas disease' (VGD) in large yellow croaker (LYC; Larimichthys crocea) and several other fish species leading to high economic losses. Currently, there are no commercial vaccines against VGD. Thus, we evaluated the efficacy of a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) made by our laboratory in LYC administered orally in alginate-coated LAV-loaded feeds. To evaluate the tolerance of the LAV in the acidic environment of the stomach, we treated the alginatecoated LAV with a simulated gastric juice without pepsin. There was a 10-fold decrease in the number of viable LAV cells after treatment with the simulated gastric juice (pH 2.0). Despite so, we found a significant increase in LAV cells in the liver and hindgut within 4 h post first feeding of oral vaccine (hpff), which increased to high levels by 24 hpff indicating that LAV cells that survived the stomach acidic environment reached the hindgut for adsorption. Although there was a transient change in the composition of the gut microbiota at 24 hpff, analysis using the Shannon and beta-diversity indices showed a similarity in the bacterial composition found before and after vaccination indicating that the LAV had no long-term adverse effect on the gut microbiota. Systemic and mucosal humoral responses were characterized by high serum antibody levels and upregulation of the pig and sign while activation of cell-mediated immunity was characterized by upregulation of MHC-I alpha, MHCII beta, Prf1 and IFN gamma genes. The overall protection in vaccinated LYC was estimated at relative percent survival (RPS) of 60%. Altogether, this study has shown that LAVs can be used as oral vaccines to confer protective immunity without impacting adverse effects on the fish microbiota.

AB  - Non-native deer are becoming increasingly common in peri-urban landscapes, where they pose a risk to the health and wellbeing of people. Professional vehicle-based shooting is commonly used to control deer populations in these complex landscapes, but the effectiveness and cost of this method have seldom been evaluated. We analyzed the effectiveness and cost of using professional vehicle-based shooting to reduce the abundance and impacts of non-native rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) in a peri-urban landscape in Wollongong, eastern Australia, during 2011-2021. We incorporated the results from an independent monitoring program into a Bayesian joint-likelihood framework to model spatio-temporal changes in rusa deer abundance. Finally, we used our findings to assess the effect of the management program on the number of complaints from the residents. After eleven years and the removal of 4701 rusa deer from Wollongong LGA (712 km2), deer abundance did not change in 74.7% of the area, decreased in 19.4% of the area (mostly in and around the sites where the professional shooting occurred), and increased in 5.9% of the area. Shooting was most cost-effective during winter when the longer hours of darkness meant that shooters could visit more sites. In contrast to deer abundance, the probability of residents complaining about deer increased in space and time. Our study shows that professional vehicle-based shooting can locally reduce the abundance of invasive deer in a peri-urban landscape, providing that sufficient control effort is expended. We suggest that shooting effort is currently too thinly spread across this peri-urban landscape, and that concentrating shooting effort on the areas of greatest deer abundance and resident complaints might be a more cost-effective strategy for managing invasive deer in peri-urban landscapes.

AB  - 1. Sodium (Na) is an essential element for all animals, but not for plants. Soil Na supplies vary geographically. Animals that primarily consume plants thus have the potential to be Na limited and plants that uptake Na may be subject to higher rates of herbivory, but their high Na content also may attract beneficial partners such as pollinators and seed dispersers.
   2. To test for the effects of Na biogeochemistry on herbivory, we conducted distributed Na press experiments (monthly Na application across the growing season) in four North American grasslands.
   3. Na addition increased soil and plant Na concentrations at all sites. Grasses in Na addition plots had significantly higher herbivore damage by leaf miners and fungal pathogens than those in control plots. Forbs with higher foliar Na concentrations had significantly more chewing insect herbivore and fungal damage.
   4. While no pattern was evident across all species, several forb species had higher Na concentrations in inflorescences compared to leaves, suggesting they may allocate Na to attract beneficial partners.
   5. The uptake of Na by plants, and animal responses, has implications for the salinification in the Anthropocene. Increased use of road salt, irrigation with saline groundwater, rising sea levels and increasing temperatures and evapotranspiration rates with climate change can all increase inputs of Na into terrestrial ecosystems.
   6. Our results suggest increasing terrestrial Na availability will benefit insect herbivores and plant fungal pathogens.

AB  - Morphological and molecular methods were used to describe a new species of Trapania Pruvot-Fol, 1931 from shallow water kelp forests on the north-central coast of Peru. The new species, Trapania huarmeyana sp. nov., is distinguished from other species along the Eastern Pacific by external morphological characters such as its translucent white body with brown stripes and small spots on the dorsum, blotches on the base of the extra-branchial processes, extra rhinophoral processes and gill branches. Internally, T. huarmeyana sp. nov. is distinguishable by several morphological characteristics of the radula, jaws and genital organs. Phylogenetic trees recovered using Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood analysis of DNA sequences support its distinct status and clarify its relationship to other species from the Eastern Pacific. This new species constitutes the first record of Trapania from the Humboldt Current Ecosystem, contributing to our understanding of the distribution of the genus in the South-eastern Pacific.

AB  - Ecological theory shows that, as resource availability increases, the number of related species (S) rises from zero at first, reaches a peak (optimum), and then falls to zero again to form a unimodal (hump-shaped) curve. Although rarely demonstrated, I show support for the unimodal, S-environment model exists among studies of soil nutrients and pH, substrate water, air temperature, evapotranspiration, sunlight, fire frequency (as a surrogate for resource turnover), herbivory, and plant density and productivity (as surrogates for resource availability). The rising left-hand side of the curve is due to a positive response to the controlling variable (e.g., soil nutrients) and the falling right-hand side to metabolic suppression by supraoptimal levels (e.g., protein denaturation by heat) or the retarding effect of secondary variables (e.g., increasing self shading). Statistically significant shape outcomes depend on range of the variable tested, scale of the study, taxonomy and life form of the targeted species assemblage, extent that species are distributed along the gradient, type of curve hypothesized, and extent to which the study continues to zero S. Interpretations should consider whether the left tail of the curve will terminate at the origin (0,0). Mechanistic explanations for the unimodal pattern may involve species interactions, such as individual fitness at the microscale optimizing at moderate abundance in the species mix, the inevitable increasing presence of inhibitory secondary effects, and existence of more resource-use generalists than specialists. Six reasons for lack of support for the unimodal hypothesis are noted. Support for the unimodal model is more likely the greater the range of the variable tested and the greater its causative link to S. The concept of 'prediction' in ecology needs to go beyond the tradition of (curvi)linear relationships and accept that most relationships in nature are (must be) unimodal.

AB  - The rapid human-driven changes in the environment during the Anthropocene have placed extreme stress on many plants and animals. Beneficial interactions with microorganisms may be crucial for ameliorating these stressors and facilitating the ecosystem services host organisms provide. Foliar endophytes, microorganisms that reside within leaves, are found in essentially all plants and can provide important benefits (e.g., enhanced drought tolerance or resistance to herbivory). However, it remains unclear how important the legacy effects of the abiotic stressors that select on these microbiomes are for affecting the degree of stress amelioration provided to their hosts. To elucidate foliar endophytes' role in host-plant salt tolerance, especially if salinity experienced in the field selects for endophytes that are better suited to improve the salt tolerance of their hosts, we combined field collections of 90 endophyte communities from 30 sites across the coastal Everglades with a manipulative growth experiment assessing endophyte inoculation effects on host-plant performance. Specifically, we grew >350 red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) seedlings in a factorial design that manipulated the salinity environment the seedlings experienced (freshwater vs. saltwater), the introduction of field-collected endophytes (live vs. sterilized inoculum), and the legacy of salinity stress experienced by these introduced endophytes, ranging from no salt stress (0 parts per thousand [ppt] salinity) to high salt stress (40 ppt) environments. We found that inoculation with field-collected endophytes significantly increased mangrove performance across almost all metrics examined (15%-20% increase on average), and these beneficial effects typically occurred when the endophytes were grown in saltwater. Importantly, our study revealed the novel result that endophyte-conferred salinity tolerance depended on microbiome salinity legacy in a key coastal foundation species. Salt-stressed mangroves inoculated with endophyte microbiomes from high-salinity environments performed, on average, as well as plants grown in low-stress freshwater, while endophytes from freshwater environments did not relieve host salinity stress. Given the increasing salinity stress imposed by sea level rise and the importance of foundation species like mangroves for ecosystem services, our results indicate that consideration of endophytic associations and their salinity legacy may be critical for the successful restoration and management of coastal habitats.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities are often concentrated around coastal ecosystems. Harbours and marinas comprising artificial structures with steeper orientations and reduced topographic complexities than natural ecosystems contribute to habitat alteration and biodiversity loss. Ecological engineering aims to mitigate these impacts by integrating ecological principles into coastal development to enhance habitat potential and improve biodiversity. This study investigated the potential of gabions (rock-filled wire mesh baskets) to enhance fish abundance and biodiversity by comparing these structures to conventional seawalls in an urbanised marina in Knysna, South Africa. Remote underwater video systems were used to determine fish diversity, abundance and composition over a 12-month period from August 2020 to August 2021. Overall, a significantly greater abundance and diversity of fish were associated with gabions compared to seawalls. Importantly, the gabions supported an endangered species, the Knysna seahorse (Hippocampus capensis), and two near threatened species recorded only on the gabions. This study highlights the efficacy of using structurally complex gabions as a viable ecoengineering alternative to less complex seawalls to enhance fish habitat.

AB  - The Hkakabo Razi Landscape, in northern Kachin, Myanmar, is one of the largest remaining tracts of intact forest in South-east Asia. In 2016, we undertook a survey in its southern margins to assess bat diversity, distribution and ecology and evaluate the importance of the area for global bat conservation. Two collecting trips had taken place in the area in 1931 and 1933, with four bat species reported. We recorded 35 species, 18 of which are new for Kachin. One species, Murina hkakaboraziensis, was new to science and three, Megaerops niphanae, Phoniscus jagorii, Murina pluvialis, were new records for Myanmar. Our findings indicate high bat diversity in Hkakabo Razi; although it comprises only 1.7% of Myanmar's land area, it is home to 33.6% of its known bat species. This emphasizes Hkakabo Razi's importance for conserving increasingly threatened, forest-interior bats, especially in the families Kerivoulinae and Murininae. There is also a high diversity of other mammals and birds within the Hkakabo Razi Landscape, which supports its nomination as a World Heritage Site.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are expected to be a valuable tool to prevent habitat loss and biodiversity decline. However, assessing the effectiveness of many PAs around the world is remarkably challenging. The selection of target species becomes a critical factor influencing the effectiveness of PAs. This paper explored the comparable effectiveness of single-species versus multi-species strategies for identifying priority areas for the expansion of PAs, with the ultimate goal of enhancing future biodiversity conservation efforts. Taking Yunlong County in China, a region known for its biodiversity hotspot, as a case study, we designated 14 animal species as the surrogates for analysis, with Rhinopithecus bieti featured prominently as a flagship species. The MaxEnt and Zonation models were employed to map the potential distribution ranges of these 14 species and gap analysis was conducted across three distinct scenarios-Prioritizing Richness, Prioritizing Rarity, and Prioritizing Flagship Species-to examine what extent the surrogate species and habitats were encompassed within the existing PAs network. The analysis has enabled the identification of priority areas for conservation efforts. When aiming for a 20% conservation target, PAs designated based on the distribution of single flagship species covered only 47.64% of the distribution range of the 13 other selected species on average. In contrast, a multi-species conservation approach could expand the coverage to 76.80%. For a higher 30% conservation target, the coverage for a single species rose to 57.49%, while a multi-species conservation approach could further increase the coverage to 79.89%. Although the flagship species prioritization scenario did not perform well in representation of species distribution coverage, but it performs well in habitat representation of dryland and shrub forest. Based on the findings, we can anticipate high-priority areas and identify conservation gaps by selecting appropriate surrogate species. Using this information, we can enhance and refine protective and management measures, thereby providing valuable insights for biodiversity conservation planning and targeted allocation of conservation resources.

AB  - Planting broadleaf trees in coniferous forests has been shown to promote biogeochemical cycling in plantations; however, how species mixing influences litter decomposition and release of metallic elements from mixed coniferous broadleaf litter remains unclear. An in situ litter decomposition experiment was conducted to examine the effect of 1) a mixture from coniferous litter (Pinus massoniana) with different individual broadleaved litter (Bretschneidera sinensis, Manglietia chingii, Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Michelia maudiae, Camellia oleifera) and 2) their mixing ratio (mass ratios of coniferous and broadleaf litter of 5:5, 6:4 and 7:3) on the release of metallic elements [calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] during litter decomposition. We found that the identity of the broadleaf tree species in the mixed litter and the mixing ratio affected the release rates of metallic elements (p < 0.05). After one year of decomposition, K, Mg, Mn and Zn were released, while Na, Ca, Fe and Cu accumulated in the mixed litter. Mixing increased the release of K, Ca, Na, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn in more than one-third of the samples, but inhibited the release of K, Fe and Mn in less than 14% of the samples. Increasing the mixing ratio of coniferous to broadleaf litter enhanced the release of Na, Fe, Mn and Zn but decreased the release of Ca and Mg. Overall, these results highlight that mixed litter, particularly tree species identity and mixing ratio, can alter the release and enrichment of metallic elements during litter decomposition, thereby affecting the cycling of metallic elements in plantations with different species compositions.

AB  - The simplification of the agricultural landscape affects trophic interactions, impacting on biological pest control. On a field scale, this ecological service can be affected by the presence of natural enemies in the landscape, which move between patches in search of resources spread over time and space. We evaluated the influence of the landscape structure surrounding soybean fields, as well as the distance between native Cerrado vegetation and soybean fields, on stink bugs abundance and parasitism rates within agricultural landscapes considering three spatial scales (1000, 2000 and 3000 m diameter). The landscape components evaluated were soybean, monoculture (corn, beans, sorghum, reforestation and pasture) and native vegetation. Adults stink bugs were positively influenced by the landscape structure on scales of 2000-3000 m. The proportion of parasitism was positively influenced by the interaction of soybean-monoculture and native vegetation-monoculture components on the 1000 m scale. There was no effect of distance from native vegetation on stink bugs and parasitism. Our observations show that landscape structure influenced parasitism and stink bugs at different spatial scales. Possible effects of landscape structure on stink bugs and parasitoids are discussed.

AB  - Ground nesting birds are sensitive to habitat structure, so understanding this relationship is fundamental to managing habitat to maintain or enhance bird populations. We used an existing long-term, large-scale experiment with routine monitoring of meadow pipit territories to assess the capability of drone-based remote sensing as a means of capturing relevant habitat information. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) captured differences in stocking density between treatments, and autumn-measured NDVI was well correlated to field measurements of vegetation height and density. Spring and autumn NDVI were negatively correlated due to dominant tussock-forming species dying back over winter. Meadow pipit apparent territory size was positively correlated to autumn NDVI and to the difference between autumn and spring NDVI. Apparent territory size was larger where there was more tussocky vegetation that comprise the areas least preferred for foraging. The long-lived nature of tussocks likely constrains the effect of the grazing treatments on meadow pipit breeding apparent territory size. Drone-based remote sensing of habitat characteristics appears to be a powerful way forward to understand bird-habitat associations.

AB  - Root-colonizing fungi, such as mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophyte fungi, are often found on pioneer plant species during early primary succession. However, little is known about which fungal species are responsible for the establishment of pioneer plants when these symbionts colonize simultaneously. We investigated the root-colonizing fungal communities of Pinus thunbergii that established prior to lichens, bryophytes, and short-lived herbaceous plants in a primary successional volcanic mudflow site on Kuchinoerabu Island, Japan. We collected a total of 54 current-year and 1- to 2-year-old seedlings. The colonization of root fungi was evaluated by direct observation of key structures (e.g., mantle, arbuscule, microsclerotia, and hyphae) and molecular analysis. Of the 34 current-year seedlings collected, only 12 individuals were colonized by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. By contrast, all 1- to 2-year-old seedlings were colonized by ECM fungi. Seedlings colonized by pine-specific ECM fungi, specifically Rhizopogon roseolus and Suillus granulatus, showed higher nitrogen and phosphorus contents in their needles compared to non-ECM seedlings. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophyte fungi were found in only two and three individuals, respectively. The high density of mycophagous deer on Kuchinoerabu-jima may contribute to the favored dispersal of ECM fungi over other root-colonizing fungi. In conclusion, the seedling establishment of P. thunbergii at the volcanic mudflow may be largely supported by ECM fungi, with negligible effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytes.

AB  - Predator-prey interactions are among the most fundamental of ecological relationships. Recolonizing gray wolf (Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758) populations present new challenges for wildlife management in multi-prey, multi-carnivore systems. We documented diet composition and kill rates for wolves in a recently recolonized area over winter and summer seasons (2014- 2015). Elk (Cervus canadensis Erxleben, 1777) were the primary ungulate prey (63%) located at wolf kill sites. Deer (mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus (Rafinesque, 1817)) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780))) were less prevalent than elk in wolf diets, but the amount of deer in diets (40%-50%) varied by pack and season. Juvenile elk were the most prevalent class of prey in wolf diets during summer (63.3%) and winter (36.3%), with adult elk (32.5%) observed nearly as often as juveniles in winter. Kill rates varied by season, with rates 2.3 times higher in summer (mean = 3.5 ungulates/week per pack) than winter (mean = 1.5 ungulates/week per pack), consistent with increased availability and use of neonate prey. Prey biomass acquisition did not vary by pack or season (summer = 243 kg/week per pack; winter = 182 kg/week per pack). Our study quantified predation patterns for a recolonizing wolf population, and patterns that we documented were similar to other multi-prey systems in North America.

AB  - Systematic surveys of the distribution of epibenthic megafaunal species relative to one another and to environmental variables in the deep sea can lead to inferences and testable hypotheses regarding factors that influence their distributions. Here we use a seascape approach to provide insight into the character and spatial extent of the influence of a chemosynthetic seep on the distribution of epibenthic megafauna and the nature of transition zones (ecotones). Faunal distributions were determined from georeferenced images of the seabed collected during a systematic survey (similar to 400 m x 400 m) by the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Sentry in the vicinity of a newly discovered methane bubble plume on the Blake Ridge Diapir. The survey area was found to include both seep and non-seep habitats. The sphere of influence of seep productivity on the surrounding benthic megafaunal assemblage was limited-on the order of 10's of meters-based on ecotone analysis. Small but detectable redox anomalies in the water column (5 m above bottom) in the study area occurred on a similar horizontal scale. Distributions of background megafaunal taxa were non-random for many morphotypes and included both positive and negative associations between morphotypes and the seep habitat. Subtle variations in depth (<6 m) correlated with distributions of seep-associated vesicomyid clams, which occupy shallow depressions in the seabed. The seep habitat itself, comprising a patchy mosaic of megafaunal sub-communities (e.g., clam bed, mussel bed, background soft-sediment bathyal taxa) and transition zones, was at least as diverse as the surrounding non-seep habitat and contributes seep endemic morphotypes to regional biodiversity. While seep productivity may support prey fields for deep-diving beaked whales, any relationship between the seeps and whale feeding areas remains intriguing speculation. Like many other regions of the deep sea, Blake Ridge South has accumulated marine litter, including litter likely originating from scientific endeavors. The suite of observations and analyses deployed here underscore the importance of seep habitats in enriching regional biodiversity, provide a glimpse of the non-random complexity of species distributions from a seascape perspective, and establish ecological baselines against which future studies may measure natural and anthropogenic changes in the seascape.

AB  - Organismal traits are presumed to be well suited for performance in the tasks required for survival, growth, and reproduction. Major injuries to such traits should therefore compromise performance and prevent success in the natural world; yet some injured animals can survive for long periods of time and contribute to future generations. We here examine 3 years of camera trap observations along a remote trail through old-growth forest in northern British Columbia, Canada. The most common observations were of moose (2966), wolves (476), and brown bears (224). The moose overwhelmingly moved in one direction along the trail in the late fall and early winter and in the other direction in the spring. This movement was clustered/contagious, with days on which many moose traveled often being interspersed with days on which few moose traveled. On the video recordings, we identified 12 injured moose, representing 1.4% of all moose observations. Seven injuries were to the carpus, three were to the antebrachium, and two were to the tarsus-and they are hypothesized to reflect damage to ligaments, tendons, and perhaps bones. The injured moose were limping in all cases, sometimes severely; and yet they did not differ noticeably from uninjured moose in the direction, date, contagiousness, or speed of movement along the trail. We discuss the potential relevance of these findings for the action of natural selection in the evolution of organismal traits important for performance.

AB  - Understanding how animals respond to large-scale environmental changes is difficult to achieve because monitoring data are rarely available for more than the past few decades, if at all. Here, we demonstrate how a variety of palaeoecological proxies (e.g. isotopes, geochemistry and DNA) from an Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) guano deposit from Argentina can be used to explore breeding site fidelity and the impacts of environmental changes on avian behaviour. We found that condors used the nesting site since at least approximately 2200 years ago, with an approximately 1000-year nesting frequency slowdown from ca 1650 to 650 years before the present (yr BP). We provide evidence that the nesting slowdown coincided with a period of increased volcanic activity in the nearby Southern Volcanic Zone, which resulted in decreased availability of carrion and deterred scavenging birds. After returning to the nest site ca 650 yr BP, condor diet shifted from the carrion of native species and beached marine animals to the carrion of livestock (e.g. sheep and cattle) and exotic herbivores (e.g. red deer and European hare) introduced by European settlers. Currently, Andean Condors have elevated lead concentrations in their guano compared to the past, which is associated with human persecution linked to the shift in diet.

AB  - Projects providing alternative foods to wild meat in rural areas are commonplace across West and Central Africa to try and curb unsustainable hunting, regarded as a major concern for conservation and local food security. However, there lacks locally specific research on the preferences and drivers of wild meat consumption in rural areas-essential information for guiding such interventions. We carry out semi-structured interviews with 542 people in four rural villages around the Dja Faunal Reserve in Cameroon, to understand the importance of wild meat, explore people's food choices, identify the drivers of wild meat consumption, and explore variation in the drivers and barriers to eating wild meat and its alternatives. We found that wild meat is preferred to meat from domestic livestock or wild caught fish. Many of the most commonly preferred wild meat species (porcupine and blue duiker) are relatively abundant, with the exception of pangolin which is globally endangered but which people reportedly prefer because of its good taste. Good taste, perceived health benefits, and easy accessibility are the key drivers of consumption, while taboos, an off-putting appearance, and health concerns play a strong role in species avoidance, particularly for great apes and large ungulates. Village-level differences in the drivers of consumption were observed, possibly influenced by their proximity to the reserve, to markets, participation in alternatives projects, and to law enforcement. That people in rural Cameroon care about health and taste in their choices, rather than simply availability or cost, challenges the assumptions that underpin many alternative meat projects. Our findings provide an understanding of consumer drivers to help to guide wild meat alternative interventions in rural areas. We urge wild meat alternatives designers to account for the heterogeneity of preferences and drivers within communities, to help ensure that projects reach both their conservation and social objectives.

AB  - Spatial rarity is often used to predict extinction risk, but rarity can also occur temporally. Perhaps more relevant in the context of global change is whether a species is core to a community (persistent) or transient (intermittently present), with transient species often susceptible to human activities that reduce niche space. Using 5-12 yr of data on 1,447 plant species from 49 grasslands on five continents, we show that local abundance and species persistence under ambient conditions are both effective predictors of local extinction risk following experimental exclusion of grazers or addition of nutrients; persistence was a more powerful predictor than local abundance. While perturbations increased the risk of exclusion for low persistence and abundance species, transient but abundant species were also highly likely to be excluded from a perturbed plot relative to ambient conditions. Moreover, low persistence and low abundance species that were not excluded from perturbed plots tended to have a modest increase in abundance following perturbance. Last, even core species with high abundances had large decreases in persistence and increased losses in perturbed plots, threatening the long-term stability of these grasslands. Our results demonstrate that expanding the concept of rarity to include temporal dynamics, in addition to local abundance, more effectively predicts extinction risk in response to environmental change than either rarity axis predicts alone.

AB  - Forest roads are networks for forest management and operations closely associated with mammal habitats. Some mammals often select forest roads for movement and foraging; however, the use during winter with snow cover is unknown. This study clarified forest road use by medium-sized mammals in winter snow environments in a hilly area. We set camera traps on forest roads and interior forest sites during winter in a snowy region of northeastern Japan in 2021 and 2022. We calculated the road-use index of four medium-sized mammals, and analyzed relationships between the occurrence frequency and snow conditions and slope angle in each species. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes Linnaeus, 1758) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides (Gray, 1834)) significantly occurred at the gentle slope sites regardless of year, and these species walked along the forest road. Japanese martens (Martes melampus (Wagner, 1840)) tended to walk along forest roads with a gentle slope only in 2022. Although Japanese hares (Lepus brachyurus Temminck, 1844) significantly occurred at the gentle slope sites, they showed no tendency to walk along forest roads. No significant differences were detected in sinking depth in the analyses of each species. Our results show that forest roads with a gentle slope, a low movement cost, created by modifying landforms can alter the behavior of some mammals, even in snowy environments.

AB  - Over the last century, water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, has invaded freshwater systems in more than 50 countries, causing changes in biodiversity and widespread ecological damage. It also disrupts fisheries, navigation routes, power generation, and water supply. Although water hyacinth has invaded all tropical and subtropical countries and some parts of the Mediterranean basin, recent climate change models suggest that its distribution may soon expand into higher latitudes as temperatures rise within Europe, unless effective preventative management measures are put in place. In this paper, we explore the potential ecological and socioeconomic impacts of water hyacinth invasion using well-documented case studies from Lake Victoria. We also consider the relative effectiveness of biological, chemical, and mechanical control measures on established populations. We conclude that water hyacinth is almost impossible to remove once established, and that controlling its spread into new areas is probably the most cost-effective way of reducing its impact. We propose a framework for the preventative management of this weed by combining the use of environmental DNA as an early warning system with heightened biosecurity to prevent accidental introductions and the physical removal of invasive plants before they become established. We also recommend that nutrient concentrations be lowered in waterbodies to reduce their susceptibility to water hyacinth invasion and reduce its growth rate if introduced accidentally.

AB  - We assessed root phenolics and rhizosphere microbiomes of Populus cathayana females and males in the replicated 30-year-old plantations, including pure female plantations (PF), pure male plantations (PM), and mixed female and male plantations (MS) to reveal sex and neighbor effects, and associations between root phenolic metabolites and root-related microbes. The phenolic composition of females varied more between intrasexual and intersexual interactions compared to that of males. Thus, sexual dimorphism was present in the metabolic composition and biochemical plasticity. MS plantations enhanced the bacterial and fungal alpha diversity of both females and males. The composition of fungal communities of females and males in MS plantations was different from that in PF and PM, while such differences were not found in the composition of bacterial communities. Bacterial and fungal diversities were correlated with concentrations of specific phenolic metabolites and were most positively responsive to root benzoic acid and pinoresinol production, respectively. Our findings indicate that sex-specific interactions affect the system of plant sex - root phenolics - rhizosphere microbes, and they may contribute to sex-specific resource utilization patterns. Knowledge of such mechanisms would be helpful when establishing plantations of dioecious plants.

AB  - The capybara is the largest living rodent, attracting attention due to its large size, its formation of large herds, and because it is commonly seen in urban environments. Thus, understanding the dynamics of capybara populations living in urban environments is relevant, especially given the conflicts observed between the species and humans in these environments. Here, we investigated the hypothesis of overpopulation of the capybara in Lago Parano & aacute;, a lake in a large neotropical city, Bras & iacute;lia, Brazil. To do this, we investigated their spatial distribution at the site and estimated the capybara population using a variation of the mark-recapture method and compared it to known population estimates for the species. We found that the capybaras in our study area mainly form small flocks of 1 to 9 animals and occupy almost the entire shore of Lake Parano & aacute;. We estimated the occurrence of 0.30 to 0.52 ind./ha (average = 0.41 ind./ha), demonstrating that the number of capybaras in our region is small when compared to capybara counts in other regions (range 0.075-6.44 ind./ha). Furthermore, we found that although the capybara population fluctuates throughout the year, it appears to be stable, not supporting our initial hypothesis. Urban areas can provide habitat for some species, which may help offset negative effects of losses of unmanaged habitats; however, this raises the possibility of wildlife-human conflicts.

AB  - Understanding the mechanistic link between plant functional traits and foraging patterns across seasons and grazing intensities is crucial for implementing sustainable grazing systems and predicting ecological successions. We assessed the interaction effects of grazing intensity, season, and leaf functional traits on herbivore grazing patterns in a native grassland composed of functionally diverse patches in four 10-14 ha paddocks managed under lenient or moderate grazing intensities. Seasonal botanical composition was estimated in permanent 20 x 20 cm patches. Defoliation events of species in patches were recorded every 7-10 d, four times during summer-autumn, and five times during winter and spring. Leaf dry matter content, specific area, tensile strength, and width of dominant grass species were measured seasonally, and species were allocated to functional groups. The proportion of total defoliation events occurring in each functional group and their selectivity index were estimated for each period and season. We tested the relationship between trait community weighted mean in the pasture and that grazed by cattle for each quadrant and period within seasons. Cows focused grazing on resource-acquisitive strategy species with wider and more tender leaves during summer-autumn under both grazing intensities. As herbage mass and accumulation decreased during winter, cows shifted their foraging strategy toward shorter patches and previously rejected, tougher-thinner leaves and resource-conservative strategy species stockpiled from summer-autumn, not overgrazing the resource-acquisitive species. However, this general pattern was modulated by grazing intensity; cows grazed taller patches and more tender and wider-leaved species under lenient than moderate grazing intensity. Thus, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of desired and rejected stockpiled patches of different functional groups was managed by integrating seasonality, grazing intensity, and leaf functional traits. Therefore, the general principle of foraging selectivity toward desired species can be altered by management practices and inherent species attributes, maintaining communities of species of different ecosystem functions in equilibrium.

AB  - Simple Summary The Tianzhu white yaks is a unique species living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and has strong adaptability to high altitude and low oxygen. These yaks mainly rely on natural pasture as the source of nutrients. However, because of low temperature and insufficient pasture in winter, the Tianzhu white yak lose weight. The ruminal microbiota of yaks can efficiently acidify and hydrolyze fiber to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs). In this study, we investigated how the ruminal microbiota affects the growth performance of yaks after supplementing straw feed and assessed the changes in ruminal microbiota and VFAs. Correlation analysis revealed a correlation among the ruminal microbiota, VFAs, and daily weight gain (ADG) of yaks. Mainly, the abundance of cellulose bacteria that can hydrolyze straw feed increased to produce more levels of VFAs, which were absorbed by the yaks, increasing their ADG. The Tianzhu white yaks (Bos grunniens) live on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. During winter, a lack of resources and low nutritional levels seriously affect their growth performance. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of supplementation straw pellets on the growth performance and ruminal microbiota of yaks. Overall, at 6 (6M, n = 24), 18 (18M, n = 26), 30 (30M, n = 20), 42 (42M, n = 24), and 54 (54M, n = 22) month old Tianzhu white yaks were selected (total n = 116) and divided into the mixed straw + grazing (MSG), corn straw + grazing (CSG), and the grazing control (G) groups according to age and gender. Their growth performance was measured as per different dietary treatments. The rumen microbial community structure and levels of VFAs were analyzed from the 6M, 30M, and 54M male yaks from each group. The supplementary diets led to an increase in the ADG, which was the highest in the MSG group. The MSG group exhibited the highest level of acetate and total VFAs (TVFAs) among the three groups (p < 0.05). In addition, the 16S rRNA sequencing results proved that the microbial composition was dominated by the members of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Christensenellaceae R-7 group was significantly abundant in the CSG and MSG groups compared to the G group (p < 0.05). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed that the bacterial community structure of rumen in the MSG and CSG groups was considerably different from that in the G group; 6M samples exhibited different rumen microbial diversity compared with the other samples. Correlation analysis revealed that Christensenellaceae_R-7_group was positively correlated with the levels of acetate, TVFAs, and ADG. These results demonstrated that mixed straw pellets improved the growth performance of yaks, increased the abundance of Christensenellaceae R-7_group involved in cellulose degradation in the rumen, and produced large amounts of VFAs, which were absorbed by yaks, thus increasing their ADG. This study provides new insights into the effects of straw pellet supplementation on the changes in the rumen microbiota and growth performance of yaks.

AB  - Domestic livestock grazing is the primary land use across the planet, but the relationship between grazing and rangeland productivity is difficult to determine because it is influenced by a variety of ecological and management factors. Fine-scale environmental data available through remote sensing are increasingly used to understand land use changes, such as grazing. In this study, we assessed the relationship between a variety of grazing and rangeland productivity metrics while accounting for environmental complexity within the sagebrush steppe ecosystem of Montana. We created mixed-effect generalized linear models using remotely sensed productivity as response variables. Explanatory variables included management and field-based grazing data combined with remotely sensed abiotic and biotic environmental factors. We found point-level field measures of grazing (e.g., cow patties, percentage of dung in Daubenmire plots, and number of plants grazed) showed positive effects, especially on perennial forbs and grasses. Grazing measures at the pasture-level showed a small negative effect on annual forbs and grasses. Grazing metrics tended to have smaller covariate effects on rangeland productivity compared to environmental factors, and interaction effects between grazing and environmental factors were common. This study provides insight into the relationship between grazing and plant productivity in the sagebrush steppe rangeland of Montana and highlights the importance of assessing the effects of grazing using multiple scales while accounting for environmental complexity.

AB  - The Chilean Patagonia is characterized by extensive protected areas that encompass most of the region. Mammals are often among the priorities for these protected areas either as conservation targets (e.g., threatened species) or as threats (e.g., invasive species). Camera traps offer a cost-effective alternative to monitor these species, however baseline studies are scarce in the region. Therefore, our objective was to provide an assessment of camera-trapping detection rates for mammals that are present in protected areas of Magallanes, Chilean Patagonia. Between 2015 and 2022 we installed 278 camera traps (9,936 trap-days), distributed in seven protected areas. For each protected area, we calculated the detection rates and proportion of camera traps that detected each species. We recorded 18 mammalian species, including ten native, four domestic, and four invasive species. The culpeo fox (Lycalopex culpaeus) was the most frequently detected species, followed by invasive European hare (Lepus europaeus) and puma (Puma concolor). Endangered species like the huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and southern river otter (Lontra provocax) were detected infrequently, whereas beaver (Castor canadensis) and American mink (Neogale when species of interest are associated with specific features of the landscape (e.g., otters and water), other designs are needed. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for the design of camera-trapping monitoring plans in protected areas.

AB  - Amazonian aquatic environments are seriously impacted by dam-building and deforestation, among other threats. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine water quality in the middle and lower course of the Araguari River with respect to the composition of vegetative cover and the concentration of As, Cd and Hg in order to determine risks to the preservation of biota and risks to human health from consumption of P. squamosissimus contaminated with these inorganic elements. To accomplish this, water samples and fish specimens were collected in the middle and lower Araguari River in 2019. The concentration of inorganic contaminants was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. These stretches of the Araguari River presented higher proportions of forest fragments and evident expansion of buffalo pastures. According to Brazilian legislation, the concentrations of Cd and Hg in the water samples represented risk quotient values > 1, indicating risk to the preservation of aquatic biota. In particular, the concentrations of Cd in the muscle tissue of P. squamosissimus in the lower Araguari River also indicated risks to human health. The bioaccumulation factor indicated that Hg is bioavailable in the water. It can be concluded that water imbalances in the middle and lower Araguari River compromise the health of both aquatic and human life.

AB  - 1. Ex situ conservation is an effective approach to prevent the extinction of endangered species. Biotic interactions (e.g. herbivory and pollination) are critical to ex situ conservation success, including plant establishment, survival and reproduction. However, shifts in biotic interactions between wild and ex situ populations are still poorly understood.
   2. We compared herbivory and pollination characteristics between the only wild population (WP) and three ex situ populations (LP, local population, nearby WP; NP, north population, ca. 850 km; and SP, south population, ca. 750 km) of a critically endangered tree species (Sinojackia huangmeiensis) to explore the latitudinal changes in plant-invertebrate interactions.
   3. Larvae of the Limacodidae family were the dominant herbivores in WP, LP and NP, while the only herbivore observed in SP was snail. Compared to WP, the leaf herbivory rate was unchanged in LP but decreased in NP and SP. Leaf defence traits (total phenols, tannins, leaf thickness and leaf dry matter content) increased or remained unchanged in the three ex situ populations. A pollinator (Apis cerana) of S. huangmeiensis was present in the four populations. NP and SP lacked some pollinators that were found in both WP and LP, but they shared one pollinator that was not observed in WP and LP. The pollinator visiting frequency increased in SP, while it did not change significantly in LP and NP.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggested that both herbivory and pollination of Sinojackia huangmeiensis changed in ex situ populations, with complete or partial changes in herbivores, leaf herbivory rate, pollinators, pollinator visiting frequency and fruit set in the two distant ex situ populations. This work provides a unique empirical study of shifts in both antagonistic and mutualistic biotic interactions between wild and ex situ populations. We emphasized that it is essential to integrate herbivore and pollinator management in future ex situ conservation of plant species.

AB  - Variability of intraspecific host plant quality for phytophagous insects may have consequences on the structure and functioning of associated food webs. The quality of host plants can affect aphids fitness, influencing their life history traits and altering the nutritional resources available to higher trophic levels, potentially affecting the development of solitary parasitoids. Here, we assessed the potential bottom-up effects of intraspecific variability among three cultivars (Gala, Ariane, and Greensleeves) of the domesticated apple tree (Malus domestica) with putative resistance towards the rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea) on the aphid's performance, and its cascading effects on the parasitoid Ephedrus cerasicola. We measured aphids pre-reproductive period, lipid, and water contents, and recorded their feeding behavior using the electropenetrography technique. Parasitoid developmental duration, sex ratio, hind tibia size, and female egg load were measured and used to evaluate E. cerasicola performance according to the cultivar on which their aphid hosts had been reared. Only the development time of parasitoids was found to be longer on Ariane and Green Sleeves cultivars than on the Gala cultivar. Aphid-feeding behavior variables related to phloem consumption were negatively impacted on apple tree cultivars on which the development time of parasitoids had been reduced. We discuss ways in which cultivar quality can be an important component of tritrophic interactions: the resistant Ariane and Green Sleeves cultivars negatively impacted the aphids but appeared to have limited bottom-up effects on the parasitoids.

AB  - Since 2008, there has been a major decrease in the numbers of old and large sardines in the Gulf of Lions, which has had a major effect on regional fisheries. A bottom-up process involving a shift in diet towards smaller planktonic prey has been suggested as the main driver of this development. Yet, the reproductive capacities of the sardines have not changed, suggesting potential modifications in energy allocation trade-offs. Whether this could also affect maintenance, in particular at the end of the winter reproductive period, and explain the lower adult survival and the disappearance of older individuals remains unclear. We therefore experimentally investigated the consequences of seasonal food availability (summer vs. winter) on life-history traits and energy allocation trade-offs at the individual and population levels. Our results indicate that food resources during summer had a major effect on energy reserves and growth, limiting the maximum size and body condition reached at the end of reproduction. In addition, food restrictions during growth and/or reproduction periods led to physiological costs mediated by increased oxidative damage. Mediterranean sardines did not show any ability for compensatory growth and did not appear to be capital breeders. Instead, they displayed individual differences in coping with physiological constraints and displayed various life-history strategies regardless of food availability. We highlighted 3 main individual energy allocation strategies: (1) preferential allocation to body condition or (2) to growth, or (3) simultaneous allocation to reproduction and growth. These issues are key, as climate change is expected to favour smaller phytoplankton, which might amplify the deterioration in the condition of pelagic fish.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has been found in multiple species, including cervids such as wild white-tailed deer (WTD), in multiple regions in the United States, including Illinois. The virus has been shown to transmit among WTD, and across species in both directions (deer-to-humans and humans-to-deer). Cross-species transmission requires infectious contact between WTD and humans, the form and frequency of which is poorly understood. The aim of this cross-sectional survey was to understand the frequency and type of contact between the general public in the state of Illinois and WTD, and to identify human populations at highest risk for such contact. An online survey was distributed using convenience sampling from list serves, social media, and community partners or extension liaisons. Questions addressed frequency and distance of contact with WTD, encompassing live animals and bodily fluids. Standard and ordinal logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with contact. An overall risk score was calculated, and linear regression was used to identify factors associated with risk. We found that hunters and those who have deer feeding on their property are more likely to report contact with deer, and that people reporting a larger lot size and living in counties with higher proportions of potential deer habitat are more likely to report deer feeding on their property. These results will better identify people with a high likelihood of WTD contact for messaging and further research. Our survey did not distinguish between contact with live and dead WTD, thus the findings are most relevant to deer-to-human cross-species transmission than the human-to-deer direction.

AB  - The systematic degradation of marine ecosystems is a global phenomenon that has important and diverse consequences including biodiversity loss and reduced ecosystem service provisions. In temperate regions, subtidal kelp forests are dominant ecosystems in rocky coasts, subjected to the influence of local-scale stressors and regional environmental variation. For example, kelps within the Humboldt Current System are at risk of degradation from live-harvesting by fisheries. However, limited information exists regarding the long-term consequences of kelp harvesting, which, in turn, limits the ability to provide effective management and conservation efforts. Here, we examined the ecosystem-level consequences of the artisanal subtidal Lessonia trabeculata fishery along the coast of central Chile during a 2-year period, assessing (1) the change in adult and juvenile L. trabeculata density within harvested and nonharvested (control) plots (similar to 90 m(2)), (2) the impact of L. trabeculata harvesting on reef fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages, and (3) the change in density of the most abundant L. trabeculata-associated species. The experiment was conducted over a 2-year period, from December 2016 to May 2019. Approximately 90% of L. trabeculata was removed by an experienced kelp fisherman in experimental plots. After 2 years, L trabeculata and its associated community showed a lack of recovery in the harvested plots. Within these plots, the average abundance of the rock shrimp, Rhynchocinetes typus, and the herbivorous snail, Tegula tridentata, was greater than in nonharvested plots and the pattern persisted over the study period. The difference in abundance of associated species may be key to the (lack of) recovery of L. trabeculata forests. Our study highlights the impact of L. trabeculata harvesting on associated fauna; however, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the capacity and time frame to reestablish the original biomass of L trabeculata, as well as its associated fauna. The management of L. trabeculata fisheries needs to account for ecosystem-wide impacts in order to better manage and protect vital coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Here we describe the dietary patterns of the culpeo or Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus) on a biogeographical scale. We also analyse the influence of exotic lagomorphs on its diet and explore differences between culpeo subspecies. We selected 17 mutually comparable diet studies, which include 19 independent diet assessments. Then, we extracted and standardized the values of the different diet components from these studies and calculated the relative frequency of occurrence of the 10 main trophic groups that we found. Further, we calculated the Shannon-Wiener H ' trophic diversity index. The results showed that small mammals (41%), lagomorphs (21%), invertebrates (12.4%) and large herbivores (7.3%) were the most consumed groups. A factorial analysis of all trophic groups rendered four orthogonal factors that were used as response variables in relation to a set of environmental predictors. Altitude correlated with most factors (i.e. trophic groups). Exotic lagomorphs were consumed in lowlands, in higher latitudes and in regions showing high values of the human footprint index, enriching in those areas the culpeo's trophic spectrum. There were no differences in diet between the two main culpeo subspecies analysed, L.c. culpaeus and L.c. andinus. Finally, the best explanatory models (general linear model) of trophic diversity selected, using Akaike's information criterion, showed that the most diverse diets were those composed of large herbivores, edentates, carnivorous species, birds and herptiles (i.e. reptiles and frogs). Trophic diversity was low in rainy areas where big rodents dominated the diet. Neither latitude nor altitude seemed to have an effect on the trophic diversity of the culpeos, as they were not retained by the final models.

AB  - The charismatic Syngnathidae occur in coastal and freshwater environments across the globe and play an important role by acting as flagship species for conservation. Despite this status, many syngnathids are threatened by a range of anthropogenic impacts including exploitation and habitat destruction. In addition, the cryptic nature and generally low population densities of syngnathids make research and related conservation action difficult, which can lead to data gaps. The gap in knowledge of the biology and status of syngnathids is especially acute within Africa. This review provides the first synthesis of syngnathid diversity, biogeography, ecology, threats and conservation in sub-Saharan Africa and adjacent islands. Research focus and effort are biased towards the southeast coast of Africa, with limited research specifically on syngnathids. A total of 63 species of syngnathids in 26 genera are recorded in Africa, with higher syngnathid diversity on the east coast of Africa. Ecological research focused on population trends and diversity is identified as priorities, specifically for those species listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List. Other priorities identified include research on the extent and impact of illegal catch and trade and the development of local capacity and expertise. These findings provide an important resource that can be used for the future conservation of this iconic group of fishes.

AB  - Iran has a diverse range of mammals. Climate change can alter the species' range, leading to expansion or contraction and affect the IUCN threatened species' distribution. We assessed the effects of climate change on the climatic niche and coverage of the protected areas for 16 threatened mammal species in Iran. The species' presence-only occurrence records, four predictor variables, two future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5) and two time steps (current and 2070) were used to build species distribution models by applying the ensemble approach in BIOMOD2. Species' responses to climate change under current condition showed different results: 8 of the 16 species are likely to gain climatically suitable space, but six species will probably lose climate range by 2070. Persian fallow deer and marbled polecat respond positively to the RCP 2.6 but will experience a range reduction in the RCP 8.5. Coverage of the protected area network will increase in both scenarios for six mammals. The coverage will maximize in RCP 2.6 for four species and decrease RCP 8.5 for another four species and vice versa. According to our model, the coverage will decrease for two species in both future scenarios. The overlap of the protected areas with the distribution pattern showed that in the next 50 years, climate change will negatively affect 60% of Iranian threatened mammals. The species' current and future distribution range and the designated refugia for climate change can be considered protected areas for conservation plans.

AB  - Functional traits of organisms, especially feeding traits, influence how organisms mediate ecosystem processes. As climate change, landscape modification and industrial waste heat release continue to increase water temperatures, shifts in the composition of feeding traits within aquatic macroinvertebrate communities may alter ecosystem processes. However, it is unclear whether thermal traits of macroinvertebrates vary systematically across functional feeding groups (FFGs; i.e., categories based on feeding ecology such as herbivores, shredders, predators, etc.) or phylogeny. We used previously published datasets on hundreds of macroinvertebrate taxa to evaluate how thermal traits differed across FFGs. We also examined the strength of phylogenetic signal in both FFG and thermal traits, using a new phylogeny of insect taxa. Then, we tested whether phylogenetic patterns offered a plausible explanation for differences in thermal traits among FFGs by comparing phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic regressions. Shredders tended to have lower temperature preferences, optima and maxima (three of five of the thermal traits evaluated) than other FFGs. Patterns for other FFGs differed by thermal trait, but predators, collector-gatherers and filterers had some of the highest thermal trait values. FFG explained 40% of the variation in critical thermal maximum, but Phylogeny explained 26%-88% of the variation in thermal and feeding traits. For the subset of taxa and trait data that were available, phylogeny explained more than double the variation in thermal traits relative to FFG, but comparison of phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic regressions highlighted that FFG explained variation in thermal traits that was independent of phylogeny. Our results highlight phylogeny and FFG as predictors of thermal traits in aquatic macroinvertebrates. Our results suggest that warmer water temperatures could favour predators, filterers and collector-gatherers over shredders. Furthermore, our results confirm that certain orders of macroinvertebrates, such as Diptera, may be better suited to warmer temperatures than other orders, such as Plecoptera.

AB  - Based on the materials of 2014, the response of invertebrate communities in floodplain and steppe meadows to emissions from the Karabash copper smelter was assessed (the main pollutants are SO2 and heavy metals). Near the smelter, in the phytocenoses of meadows of both types, the phytomass of herbage decreases (2-7 times) and the proportion of graminoids increases (from 36-45 to 53-85%). The abundance of invertebrates in the meadows of both types varies similarly: the total abundance decreases (by a factor of 1.4-2.9), while the abundance of all trophic and most large taxonomic groups does not change. The taxonomic structure of invertebrates in floodplain meadows changed only in the impact zone, while in steppe meadows, already in the buffer zone. This result partially confirms the hypothesis put forward that in the communities of floodplain meadows, the reaction to pollution is less pronounced than in steppe meadows.

AB  - In the southern Kalahari Desert, cooperatively breeding Southern Pied Babblers Turdoides bicolor frequently build their nests and forage in camelthorn trees Vachellia erioloba, a keystone species in the region, and blackthorn trees Senegalia mellifera, a widespread early successional shrub. Using Ivlev's electivity indices (Ei), we show that Southern Pied Babblers preferentially nest in camelthorn trees and preferentially forage in or under camelthorn and blackthorn trees. Southern Pied Babblers primarily forage on the ground; however, they will make use of arboreal resources when these are available. We observed the birds spending the highest proportion of foraging time off the ground during October, when breeding is also most common, compared with all other months within the austral summer breeding season. They are most likely to be observed foraging in camelthorn trees earlier in the breeding season and blackthorn trees later in the breeding season. We demonstrate that Southern Pied Babblers have a strong relationship with camelthorn trees, in which they prefer to both nest and forage. We highlight the importance of protecting camelthorn trees, a keystone species in the region, as part of the conservation and management of endemic Kalahari fauna such as the Southern Pied Babbler. In addition to contributing to the literature on keystone species, our observations raise questions about the ways in which avian reproduction in the arid zone could be decoupled from rainfall via the phenology of deep-rooted tree species.

AB  - Understanding the determinants of poorly studied species' spatial ecology is fundamental to understanding climate change impacts on those species and how to effectively prioritise their conservation. Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii) are the least studied of the Antarctic pinnipeds with a limited knowledge of their spatial ecology. We present the largest tracking study for this species to date, create the first habitat models, and discuss the potential impacts of climate change on their preferred habitat and the implications for conservation. We combined newly collected satellite tracking data (2016-2019: n = 11) with previously published data (2001: n = 8) from the Weddell, King Haakon VII and Lazarev seas, Antarctica, and used 16 remotely sensed environmental variables to model Ross seal habitat suitability by means of boosted regression trees for summer and winter, respectively. Five of the top environmental predictors were relevant in both summer and winter (sea-surface temperature, distance to the ice edge, ice concentration standard deviation, mixed-layer depth, and sea-surface height anomalies). Ross seals preferred to forage in waters ranging between -1 and 2?C, where the mixed-layer depth was shallower in summer and deeper in winter, where current speeds were slower, and away from the ice edge in the open ocean. Receding ice edge and shoaling of the mixed layer induced by climate change may reduce swimming distances and diving depths, thereby reducing foraging costs. However, predicted increased current speeds and sea-surface temperatures may reduce habitat suitability in these regions. We suggest that the response of Ross seals to climate change will be regionally specific, their future success will ultimately depend on how their prey responds to regional climate effects and their own behavioural plasticity.

AB  - Quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) are synthesized by the genus Lupinus as a defense against herbivores. Synthesis of QAs in lupins is species- and organ-specific. Knowledge about their biosynthesis and their corresponding pathways are still fragmentary, in part because lupins of commercial importance were mainly investigated, representing a small sample of the chemodiversity of the genus. Here, we explore the use of three Mexican lupins: Lupinus aschenbornii, Lupinus montanus, and Lupinus bilineatus as a model to study the physiology of QA biosynthesis. The corresponding QA patterns cover widely and narrowly distributed tetracyclic QAs. Quinolizidine alkaloid patterns of seeds and plantlets at different developmental stages were determined by GLC-MS and compared to identify the onset of de novo QA synthesis and to gain insight into specific and common biosynthesis trends. Onset of de novo QA biosynthesis occurred after the metabolization of seed QA during germination and was species-specific, as expected. A common QA pattern, from which the diversity of QA observed in these species is generated, was not found; however, lupanine and 3 beta-lupanine were found in the three specieswhile sparteine was not found in Lupinus bilineatus, suggesting that this simplest tetracyclic QA is not the precursor of more complex QAs. Similar patterns of metabolization and biosynthesis of structurally related QAs were observed, suggesting a common regulation.

AB  - Samples of bryozoans collected from two localities in the Bay of C & aacute;diz with different levels of anthropogenic impact are studied. A total of 25 species was identified, of which 8 are considered non-indigenous (NIS), 12 as native and 5 cryptogenic. A new species of Hippopodina, Hippopodina similis sp. nov., is here described, and corrections to the diagnosis of the genus are proposed. The species appears to be a recent immigrant in C & aacute;diz, although it could also be present in the eastern Mediterranean. Aeverrilla setigera and the genus Hippopodina itself are recorded for the first time in the eastern Atlantic. Anguinella palmata is recorded for the first time in Spanish waters. Amathia vidovici was already recorded in the Iberian Peninsula, but previous records should be confirmed. Other species, such as Amathia verticillata, Biflustra tenuis, Watersipora subatra and Schizoporella errata, were already recorded in the Bay of C & aacute;diz very recently.

AB  - The mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) is an iconic wildlife species of western North America that inhabits steep and largely inaccessible terrain in remote areas. They are at risk from human disturbance, genetic isolation, climate change, and a variety of other stressors. Managing populations is challenging and mountain goats are particularly difficult and expensive to inventory. As a result, biologists often rely on models to estimate the species' abundance and distribution in remote areas. We used landscape characteristics evident at point locations of mountain goat visual observations, tracks, and telemetry locations, along with random locations, to learn the structure and parameters of a Bayesian network that predicted the suitability of habitats for mountain goats. We then used the model to map habitat suitability across 285,000 km(2) of potential habitat in mountain ranges of the south and central Canadian Pacific coast. Steep slopes, forest cover characteristics, and snow depth were the important drivers. Modeling the system as a Bayesian network provided several advantages over more common regression methods because input variables were heterogenous (i.e., a mix of discrete and continuous), autocorrelated, and animals exhibited non-linear responses to landscape conditions. These common characteristics of ecological data routinely violate the assumptions of parametric linear models, which are commonly used to map habitat suitability from animal observations.

AB  - In the absence of top-down and bottom-up controls, herbivores eventually drive themselves to extinction by exhausting their host plants. Poorly mobile herbivores may experiment only local disappearance, because they can recolonize intact plant patches elsewhere, leaving time to previously over-exploited patches to regrow. However most herbivores such as winged insects are highly mobile, which may prevent the formation of spatial heterogeneity. We test if long-distance dispersal can preclude coexistence using the invasion of box tree moth (Cydalima perspectalis) in Europe as a model system. We build a lattice model and estimate the parameters with a combination of field measurements, experimental data and literature sources. Space corresponds either to a realistic boxwood landscape in the Alps, or to theoretical landscapes of various sizes. We find that both species persist under a large range of realistic parameter values, despite a severe reduction in boxwood biomass, with an alternation of outbreaks and near-to-extinction moth densities. Large landscapes are necessary for coexistence, allowing the formation of spatial structure. Slow plant regrowth combined with long-distance dispersal could drive moths to extinction, because of resources depletion at the global scale even without a complete synchronization of the local dynamics. The spatial dynamics leads to formation of small plant patches evenly distributed in the landscape, because of a combination of local plant dispersal and global indirect competition between plants through their positive effect on moth population size. Coexistence is favoured by such heterogeneous landscapes, because empty patches increase moth mortality during dispersal: the system thus creates its own stability conditions.

AB  - By selectively feeding on the new vegetation from forest regeneration, cervids influence the abundance of un-derstory species. This can lead to recruitment failure for the consumed species. The impact of cervids on regeneration is generally studied at fine scales, making it difficult to generalize about the species distribution scale for co-occurring cervid and tree species. This is especially problematic for species such as northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.), which is susceptible to browsing and has been declining throughout much of its range. In our study, we aimed to determine the effect of the spatio-temporal variations in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) abundance on northern white cedar recruitment over a broad spatial scale. We combined distinct forest and wildlife monitoring databases for two Canadian provinces, Que ' bec and New Brunswick. We also surveyed cedar regeneration and deer browsing pressure in a subset of plots located in Que ' bec. In both provinces, we detected a negative effect of deer abundance and deeryard proximity on the recruitment of cedar saplings. In Que ' bec, local deer browsing pressure also had a negative effect on cedar seedling abundance. As deer browsing pressure can vary considerably over a short distance, we recommend the inclusion of browsing indicators in national forest surveys to precisely assess the impact of browsing on regeneration and recruitment. This would allow managers to identify areas that are highly vulnerable to browsing and adapt forest management accordingly to reduce browsing-induced regeneration failures.

AB  - Featured Application The improvement of effective remote sensing-based approaches to map macrophyte features can provide a baseline of adequate spatiotemporal resolution for 21st century monitoring applications equipped to play a prominent role in the context of medium-large-scale management programs of ecological conservation and scientific research. Macrophytes are of fundamental importance to the functioning of lake ecosystems. They provide structure, habitat, and a food source and are a required component in monitoring programs of lake ecological quality. The key aim of this study is to document the variation in spatial extent and density of macrophytes seasonally between 2015 and 2020 of the Sirmione Peninsula (Lake Garda, Italy), using Sentinel-2 imagery. In addition to this, our results were compared to previous data from imaging spectrometry; individual parameters affecting macrophyte communities were tested, and the possible effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on macrophyte colonization was evaluated. Satellite images allowed the mapping of the spatiotemporal dynamics of submerged rooted macrophytes in order to support monitoring of the shallow water ecosystem under study. Substantial changes were found in both spatial extent and density over the period from 2015 to 2020, particularly in 2019 when there was almost a complete absence of dense macrophytes. Variables found to influence the amount of macrophytes included transparency, chlorophyll-a, water level, winter wave height, and grazing by herbivores. A separate analysis focusing on areas associated with boat transit found a recovery in macrophyte coverage during the period of COVID-19 lockdown. The outcome of the study highlights a decline in the density of the macrophytes and a shift towards deeper areas compared to the situation in 1997. The area examined is part of an internationally important site containing the highest abundance and diversity of overwintering water birds in Italy. Exploiting satellite data at high frequency provided an insight to understand the dynamic changes and interactions with herbivorous birds, environmental factors, and anthropogenic pressures, revealing a delicately balanced and threatened ecosystem.

AB  - Urban landscapes contain many barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow, particularly for large terrestrial mammals with extensive natural home ranges. Eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) are a large macropodid, whose biological range partially coincides with areas subjected to high rates of urban expansion, including the Southeast Queensland (SEQ) bioregion of Australia. Within this region, M. giganteus populations have had recent, rapid declines in numbers with ongoing urbanisation posing a significant threat due to the isolation of populations. Therefore, we investigated the genetic profile of kangaroos in a rapidly urbanising SEQ region (Sunshine Coast) by comparing them to other SEQ kangaroos (Greater Brisbane) and to higher density kangaroo populations in a landscape matrix with greater levels of connectivity (Australian Capital Territory; ACT). We utilised a targeted genetic probe of genome-wide SNPs to obtain baseline genetic profiles of M. giganteus using scat samples collected from 24 sites in the Sunshine Coast (n = 103) and compared these to Greater Brisbane (n = 20) and ACT (n = 29) scat samples. Genetic diversity was similar when comparing the ACT, Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane regions (HE: 0.224-0.238), yet effective population size was markedly higher for the ACT region (Ne = 3453) than for both the Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane (Ne = 43.3 and 25.0, respectively), with clear genetic differentiation on a regional scale. We also identified six genetic groups within our SEQ study area, with significant differences in genetic diversity (HE: 0.188 - 0.289). The presence of high numbers of private alleles in all regions and within some SEQ populations highlights the conservation significance of preserving local populations. We also identified natural and anthropogenic barriers, which may have impacted genetic processes such as gene flow in the region. Therefore, this research highlights the need for localised management of kangaroo pop-ulations to preserve genetic diversity and structure in the SEQ region, by maintaining and improving landscape connectivity. We emphasise that for the conservation of local and global biodiversity, it is imperative to assess baseline genetic status of both common and threatened species, particularly when declines and extirpations are occurring across these species' ranges.

AB  - The US Endangered Species Act aims to recover threatened species and preserve their ecosystems, often through habitat management and restoration. In the face of climate change and phenological shifts, however, habitat management can seem futile. One of the most conspicuous effects of climate change is that many species are shifting in phenology, i.e., the timing of life history events. These shifts are assumed to have population-level effects on at-risk species, although it is less clear whether these effects are likely to be positive or negative. Here, we use a 27-year-long data set of Fender's blue (Icaricia icarioides fenderi), an endangered butterfly, to investigate long-term changes in abundance and phenology at nine sites near Eugene, Oregon, USA. For Fender's blue, day of peak flight activity consistently advanced at all sites from 1993 to 2019. At the same time, Fender's blue populations increased at some sites and abundance was not changing at others. There was no association of population growth and advancement of peak flight activity. This suggests that although phenological shifts may be a "fingerprint" of climate change, they may not always be a cause for concern. Implications for insect conservation Lessons from Fender's blue butterfly are likely applicable to conservation of other at-risk butterflies. Despite a rapidly changing climate, at least some rare species can be conserved and recovered with appropriate habitat management.

AB  - Characterising plant-herbivore interactions is important to understanding the processes that influence community structure and ecosystem functioning. Traditional methods used to identify plant-herbivore interactions are being superseded by non-destructive molecular approaches that can infer interactions with greater resolution and accuracy from environmental DNA (e.g. faeces and regurgitate). However, few studies have compared the success of using different sample types and whether they provide similar or contrasting information about species' diet. Here we compared the success of DNA amplification and host plant species identification using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) applied to faecal and regurgitate samples collected from alpine grasshoppers Paprides nitidus Hutton during a grassland community mesocosm experiment. We found that DNA amplification success was 23% and 86% higher for faecal than regurgitate samples from female and male grasshoppers, respectively. In contrast, successful host plant identification using RFLP was 9% higher for regurgitate than faecal samples. The mean number of host plant species identified per sample (1.40) did not differ between sample types or grasshopper sexes. Of the 136 paired faecal-regurgitate samples, just 41% and 74% produced exactly or partially matching host plant identifications, respectively, indicating that different sample types provided complementary information about herbivore diet. Some plant species were more likely to be identified from faecal samples than expected by chance, and we found that this identification bias skewed towards plant species with higher investment in leaf tissue. We conclude that multiple sample types may be required to fully characterise an invertebrate herbivore species' diet.

AB  - AimsIn terrestrial ecosystems, deposition of insect frass and cadavers in the soil influences soil characteristics, including microbial community composition, with consequences for plant growth and development. Insect frass and exuviae are also a major residual stream from insect production for food and feed, that may be used as soil amendment. However, only few studies have thoroughly examined the effect of soil amendment with insect frass and exuviae on rhizosphere microbial communities and plant growth.MethodsWe studied the effects of soil amendment with frass and/or exuviae originating from three insect species, Tenebrio molitor, Acheta domesticus, and Hermetia illucens, at three different concentrations, compared to synthetic fertiliser. At several time points we analysed the rhizosphere bacterial community and assessed multiple plant-growth parameters of a brassicaceous plant.ResultsSoil amendment with frass and/or exuviae improved plant growth at least as well as synthetic fertiliser, A. domesticus exuviae having the strongest impact. The origin (insect species), type (frass or exuviae) and concentration of soil amendment influenced the effects on plant traits. The rhizosphere bacterial community differed between amended and unamended soil. Bacterial genera that contain plant growth-promoting species were more abundant in the rhizosphere of plants grown in amended soil.ConclusionsAddition of insect frass and/or exuviae to the soil differentially affects the bacterial rhizosphere community and promotes plant growth in these soils, underlining their unique roles in the aboveground-belowground feedback loop, and their potential use as soil amendment in circular agriculture.

AB  - Rapid developments associated with large-scale transport infrastructure have exacerbated ecological risks, posing major threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Construction of ecological security patterns (ESPs) can effectively mitigate this threat, but existing construction of ESPs lacks consideration of the risk to landscape connectivity and resilience, as well as zoning optimization at a finer resolution. This study focused on the region along the China-Laos Railway to evaluate the landscape ecological risk (LER) based on the potential -connectedness-resilience framework and extracted ESP elements according to the LER evaluation. Clustering of LER and ecological quality index was introduced to facilitate more targeted management of ESP. We found that the regional LER was most likely elevated because the proportion of LER at the medium level and above was close to 50 %. Moreover, the segmentation and penetration of high-risk areas into low-risk areas was prominent. The distribution of low LER areas was notably shaped by regional resilience, while road expansion would create many medium and higher risk areas, and the development of industrial parks would generate high risks in urban peripheries. 2,615.88 km of ecological corridors enabled the 17,362.08 km2 ecological sources to be effectively connected. 33 ecological nodes and 115 stepping stones were extracted as valid complements to key areas of weak connectivity. Priority treatment of specific sources (4.88 %) and ecological corridors (29.93 %) enhances the resilience of ESP. Our study provides a method for integrating the assessment of ecological risks arising from future regional development with the construction and optimization of ESPs, which can be promoted in ecological conservation planning in developing countries driven by infrastructure and industrial parks.

AB  - Maintaining game animals under intensified captive conditions for production or ecotourism purposes has increased over recent years. This is especially true for the common eland, which was identified as an ideal species for captive production conditions due to its temperament and adaptability. However, little has been done to understand their social behaviour under captive conditions, especially when implementing management tools such as immunocastration, which is often used in wildlife in zoological gardens for contraception and may also aid in easing the management of eland males within mixed-sex herds in captivity, but which could potentially have adverse effects on the hierarchical rank of the immunocastrated animal, and thus welfare from a social perspective. Therefore, this study monitored the behaviour and hierarchical structure of captive common eland and the effects of immunocastrating male eland on their social rank, aggressive vs affiliative behaviours, and activity budget. Thirty common eland were divided into two groups consisting of sub-adults (n = 15; approximate to 2 years old) and juveniles (n = 15; approximate to 6 months old). Each group consisted of five intact males, five immunocastrated males, and five females. Vaccinations (Improvac (R), 2 mL per dose) were administered to the males assigned to the immunocastration treatment during week 3 and again in week 7 of the study. Behavioural observations were conducted every two weeks from week 1 of the study, for five months, using all occurrence sampling for dyadic social interactions and scan sampling for activity budget behaviours. The hierarchical structure of the two groups was examined, and the rates and proportion of dominant, aggressive and affiliative interactions were established using DomiCalc. The pre-vaccination period and the control animals (not vaccinated) were used as categories of reference. Overall, immunocastration reduced aggressive behaviour in juveniles, with no effect on activity and other agonistic behaviours. However, juveniles and subadults decreased their feeding behaviour post-vaccination and were more active socially. Immunocastration can potentially be used for controlling agonistic behaviour in farmed common eland.

AB  - Camera traps provide a low-cost approach to collect data and monitor wildlife across large scales but hand-labeling images at a rate that outpaces accumulation is difficult. Deep learning, a subdiscipline of machine learning and computer science, can address the issue of automatically classifying camera-trap images with a high degree of accuracy. This technique, however, may be less accessible to ecologists or small-scale conservation projects, and has serious limitations. In this study, we trained a simple deep learning model using a dataset of 120,000 images to identify the presence of nilgai Boselaphus tragocamelus, a regionally specific nonnative game animal, in camera-trap images with an overall accuracy of 97%. We trained a second model to identify 20 groups of animals and one group of images without any animals present, labeled as "none,'' with an accuracy of 89%. Lastly, we tested the multigroup model on images collected of similar species, but in the southwestern United States, resulting in significantly lower precision and recall for each group. This study highlights the potential of deep learning for automating camera-trap image processing workflows, provides a brief overview of image-based deep learning, and discusses the often-understated limitations and methodological considerations in the context of wildlife conservation and species monitoring.

AB  - Wasp communities are often complex and speciose and often associated with plant and herbivorous hosts. Nonpollinating wasps are one example of these communities: these communities can reach 20 species on a single species of Ficus trees. Such diversity implies that the number of interactions is high, and the trophic web may be complicated to disentangle. Some of wasp species may be gall wasps whereas the majority of them are parasitoid wasps feeding on other wasp species larvae. To understand the nonpollinating fig wasp community associated with Ficus subpisocarpa in Northern Taiwan, the oviposition timing of the fig wasps has been monitored and a bagging experiment has been done on several crops. Twenty-one morphospecies were found, and three fig crops type were defined by the wasp composition and fig traits as "typical" crops, "rare NPFWs" crops (RN), and "rare pollinators" (RP) crops. The diversity indexes showed that the typical type has the highest diversity and the RN type, which is the most dissimilar crop from the others, has the lowest diversity. From their oviposition time along the fig development, the nonpollinating fig wasps can be easily divided into two guilds: gall wasps and parasitoid wasps. Moreover, one of the most striking results of this study is the presence of figs that do not produce any pollinator in RP crops. The implications of this type of crops on the mutualism between Ficus subpisocarpa and its pollinator are discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary This study examined the differences and similarities in gut microbial diversity and ecological assembly processes of Datong yaks, including domestic males and females and wild males, which were fed together on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in a mixed group. The results revealed that mixed grouping could influence the gut microbiota of these three groups of yaks and improve the gut microbial diversity of domestic females. The findings of this study can help to understand the effects of mixed grouping on the gut microbiota of livestock on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and improve the production of Datong yaks. The Datong yak (Bos grunniens) is the first artificial breed of yaks in the world and has played an important role in the improvement of domestic yak quality on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The Datong yak breeding farm in the Qinghai province of China is the main place for the breeding and feeding of Datong yaks. It hosts domestic Datong yaks and wild male yaks, mainly in mixed groups. Different managements have different effects on livestock. The gut microbiota is closely related to the health and immunity of Datong yaks, and mixed grouping can affect the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota of Datong yaks. To reveal the effects of mixed grouping on the gut microbiota of Datong yaks and wild yaks and identify the main dominant factors, we compared the gut microbial diversities of domestic males and females and wild males based on 16S rRNA V3-V4 regions using fresh fecal samples. The data showed significant differences in the gut microbial diversity of these three groups, and the alpha-diversity was the highest in wild males. Different factors influence the gut microbiota, and the main influencing factors were different in different groups, including sex differences, host genetics, and physical interactions. We also compared ecological assembly processes in the three groups. The results showed that mixed grouping contributed to the improvement of gut microbial diversity in domestic females. Our study provides effective and feasible suggestions for the feeding and management of the Datong yaks.

AB  - European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) are main small game species of conservation concern in Mediterranean ecosystems. To date, their presence in wild boar's (Sus scrofa) diet and factors driving their consumption have been little investigated. A genetic metabarcoding approach was used on 80 wild boar faeces collected from four hunting estates devoted to small game hunting during two different seasons. Abundances of wild boar, rabbits and partridges were first estimated. Results showed DNA of seventeen chordate species. The highest frequency of occurrence (FO) corresponded to mammals and birds, with 77.6 and 22.3%, respectively. DNA of game species was detected in 39/71 (FO = 55.0%) samples, highlighting the presence of European wild rabbit in 27 (FO = 38.0%) and red-legged partridge in eight (FO = 11.3%). Dietary composition varied between seasons and estates, being rabbit the main responsible (explaining 35.26% and 39.45% of differences, respectively). Rabbit FO in the diet was positively related to the abundance of wild boar and rabbit density on the estate. It was greater in autumn and in estates where rabbits were hunted. Regarding red-legged partridge, a significant and positive relationship between its population density and its diet FO was observed, without significant differences between seasons or estates. Overall, our results suggest wild boar as an opportunistic species whose diet is largely determined by the relative availability of different food resources. Its ecological role concerning small game species in Mediterranean agroecosystems seems to be more related to consumption of carrion during the hunting season than to direct predation.

AB  - Local Sudanese sheep populations inhabiting diverse environmental conditions and holding opposing morphologies provide opportunities for molecular-genetic research. Characterizing their genome is crucial for sustainable breeding improvement and targeting favorable genes in breeding programs. However, the genome of these sheep populations, which comprises several subtypes, remains uncharacterized using whole-genome sequence data. This study aimed to elucidate genomewide genetic diversity and population structure of 11 local Sudanese sheep populations, namely, Hammari, Kabbashi, Meidobe, Ashgar, Dubasi, Watish, Bega, Naili, Fulani, Zagawi, and Garag. Ninety whole blood samples were collected, and we extracted DNA using a Qiagen DNeasy (R) extraction kit. We used the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform to sequence all the DNA samples. We included whole-genome sequence data of three Ethiopian sheep (Doyogena, Kefis, and Gafera) and one Libyan sheep (Libyan Barbary) in the study to infer the genetic relationships of local Sudanese sheep populations from a continental perspective. A total of 44.8 million bi-allelic autosomal SNPs were detected; 28.5% and 63.3% occur in introns and intergenic regions, respectively. The mean genetic diversity ranged from 0.276 for Garag to 0.324 for Kabbashi sheep populations. The lowest F sT estimates were observed between Kabbashi and Ashgar and the highest between Bega and Fulani local Sudanese sheep populations. The principal component and population structure analyses of the 11 local Sudanese sheep populations indicated three separate genetic groups categorized following their tail morphotype, geographical distribution, and population subtype. The thin-tailed local Sudanese sheep populations exhibited independent clustering from the fat-tailed Ethiopian and Libyan sheep. We also observed distinct clustering between the fat-tailed Ethiopian and Libyan sheep. The present study's findings demonstrated the population structure and principal components related to tail morphotype, geographical distribution, and population subtype of local Sudanese sheep populations. A clear signature of admixture was observed among the studied local Sudanese sheep populations.

AB  - Lions (Panthera leo) are a keystone species of many wildlife areas and, as such, understanding their dietary ecology is important for holistic wildlife management. Knowledge of lion feeding ecology enables researchers and wildlife managers to better understand predator-prey dynamics and ecological limits governing their local contexts. Where kill sites can be physically located in the field, they can provide important baseline information on lion diet. In this study, Global Positioning System (GPS) collar data were used together with field observations to investigate the dietary breadth of lions at Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, Zimbabwe. Results showed that lions in our study had a moderately specialised diet with zebra (Equus quagga) constituting the largest proportion of prey species consumed. A massive anthrax outbreak occurred during the study, drastically reducing numbers of several prey species, and this provided an opportunity to test possible shifts in lion diet in response to changes in prey abundance. Prey species selection before the anthrax outbreak was significantly different to the period after the outbreak, indicating a shift in diet post-outbreak. Notable increases were observed in kill rates of species that were not severely affected by anthrax, namely warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), zebra, wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and eland (Taurotragus oryx). Quantifying lion dietary requirements is important for assessing the ecological and economic impacts they have on prey populations. In addition to space-use ecology, this study shows that GPS collar data can facilitate diet investigation in large carnivores thereby providing useful information for ecological management.
   Les lions (Panthera leo) sont une espece cle dans de nombreuses zones de la faune ; il est important de comprendre leur ecologie alimentaire pour une gestion holistique de la faune. La connaissance de l'ecologie de l'alimentation des lions permet aux chercheurs et aux responsables de la gestion de la faune de mieux comprendre la dynamique predateur-proie et les limites ecologiques qui regissent leurs contextes locaux. Lorsque les sites d'abattage peuvent etre physiquement localises sur le terrain, ils peuvent fournir des informations de base importantes sur le regime alimentaire des lions. Dans cette etude, les donnees des colliers GPS (Global Positioning System) ont ete utilisees avec des observations sur le terrain pour etudier l'etendue du regime alimentaire des lions dans la reserve naturelle de Malilangwe, au Zimbabwe. Les resultats ont montre que les lions de notre etude avaient un regime alimentaire moderement specialise, le zebre (Equus quagga) constituant la plus grande proportion des especes de proies consommees. Une epidemie massive d'anthrax s'est declenchee pendant l'etude, reduisant considerablement le nombre de plusieurs especes de proies, ce qui a permis de tester d'eventuels changements dans le regime alimentaire des lions en reponse a des changements dans l'abondance des proies. La selection des especes de proies avant l'epidemie d'anthrax etait considerablement differente de celle de la periode suivant l'epidemie, ce qui indique un changement de regime alimentaire apres l'epidemie. Des augmentations importantes ont ete observees dans les taux d'abattage des especes qui n'ont pas ete gravement touchees par l'anthrax, a savoir le phacochere (Phacochoerus africanus), le zebre, le gnou (Connochaetes taurinus) et l'eland (Taurotragus oryx). Il est important de quantifier les besoins alimentaires des lions pour evaluer l'impact ecologique et economique qu'ils ont sur les populations de proies. Outre l'ecologie de l'utilisation de l'espace, cette etude montre que les donnees des colliers GPS peuvent faciliter l'etude du regime alimentaire des grands carnivores et fournir ainsi des informations utiles pour la gestion ecologique.

AB  - Plants produce secondary chemicals that may vary along with latitude due to changing abiotic and biotic stress gradients and local environmental conditions. Teasing apart the individual and combined effects of these different abiotic, such as soil nutrients, and biotic factors, such as soil biota and herbivores, on secondary chemicals is critical for understanding plant responses to changing environments. We conducted an experiment at different latitudes in China, using tallow tree (Triadica sebifera) seedlings sourced from a population at 31 degrees N. These seedlings were cultivated in gardens located at low, middle and high latitudes, with either local soil or soil from the original seed collection site (origin soil). The seedlings were exposed to natural levels of aboveground herbivores or had them excluded. Plant secondary chemicals (both foliar and root), aboveground herbivores and soil characteristics were measured. Results showed that most leaf and root secondary metabolites depended on the interaction of the experimental site and soil type. Leaf and root phenolic and tannin concentrations were higher at the middle latitude site, especially in the origin soil. Root and foliar flavonoid concentrations increased when aboveground herbivores were excluded. Microbial communities depended strongly on soil treatment. The different responses of tannins versus flavonoids suggest that these two chemical classes differ in their responses to the varying abiotic and biotic factors in these sites along latitudes. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of considering the interactive effects of local environmental conditions, soil properties and herbivory in regulating plant chemical defenses.

AB  - Context An understanding of species-habitat relationships is required to assess the impacts of habitat fragmentation and degradation. To date, habitat modeling in fragmented landscapes has relied on landscape composition and configuration metrics and the importance of habitat quality in determining species distributions has not been sufficiently explored. Objectives We evaluated how habitat use by herbivores and frugivorous mammals is shaped by a potential interaction of habitat amount and quality in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland. We also assessed if the contribution of habitat quality to species ' habitat use varies according to the species sensitivity to habitat loss. Methods We combined mammal detection data obtained from camera traps with thematic maps to estimate the amount of habitat and measured habitat quality using local environment variables and distance to waterbodies. Specifically, we used a single-season occupancy approach to evaluate the relative support of univariate, additive, and interactive relationships between species-specific habitat use and measures of habitat quality and quantity. Results Habitat quality was more important than habitat amount in determining species habitat use (occupancy) in a naturally fragmented landscape. Habitat quality alone was the best predictor of habitat use for two of the six species (white lipped peccary and collared peccary), but no species' habitat use was explained solely by habitat amount. Habitat amount was influential only when considered in conjunction with habitat quality covariates and only for two sensitive species to habitat loss (agouti and red brocket deer). Habitat quality alone was the best predictor of habitat use for two of the less sensitive species (white lipped peccary and collared peccary). Habitat use for two species was not explained by any covariate (tapir and gray brocket deer). Conclusions Conservation programs should incorporate both habitat quality and amount when dealing with sensitive species and prioritize habitat quality management when focusing in less sensitive species.

AB  - Assessment of medium- and large-sized mammals' species diversity, abundance, distribution, and habitat association is necessary to promote their conservation measures. The study was conducted in the former Dhidhessa wildlife sanctuary (FDWS), to assess the medium- and large-sized mammals' composition, distribution, and diversity. Transect lines were used to collect the data. A total of 1,146 +/- 91 individuals belonging to 25 species, seven orders, and 14 families were recorded. Among these, 607 +/- 186.5 (52.97%) were recorded during the wet season, whereas 539 +/- 144.5 (47.03%) during the dry season. The order Carnivora was the most diverse one, followed by Artiodactyla and Primates, respectively, while Rodentia, Hyracoidea, Tubulidentata, and Lagomorpha were the least diverse orders. Olive baboon (Papio anubis) was the most abundant species (19.2%), followed by Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibious) (17.63%) and Vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) (13.18%). Species diversity was higher in the savanna-wooded than in the riverine forest during both the wet (H' = 2.72, Fisher's alpha = 6.33) and dry (H'= 2.79, Fisher's alpha = 6.26) seasons. Species evenness was higher in the savanna-wooded habitat than in the riverine forest habitat during both the wet (J' = 0.87 and J' = 0.77, respectively) and dry (J' = 0.9 and J' = 0.80, respectively) seasons. The highest similarity in species composition was between the wet and dry seasons in the riverine forest habitat (SI = 85.58%). The lowest similarity was recorded between the dry and wet seasons of the riverine forest and the wet season of the savanna wooded habitat (SI = 45.46% and SI = 46.49%, respectively). The study suggests that mammals are at risk of anthropogenic factors in the area. So, an urgent conservation measure that involves the participation of the local community has paramount significance for the sustainable conservation of mammals in the former Dhidhessa wildlife sanctuary.

AB  - 1. Rangelands are multi-use landscapes which are socially and ecologically important in different ways. Among other interactions, shared use of rangelands by wildlife and livestock can lead to disease transmission. Understanding wildlife and livestock health and managing disease transmission in rangelands requires an integration of social and ecological knowledge.
   2. Using the example of Western Kazakhstan, home to two types of ungulate hosts, the critically endangered saiga antelopes, Saiga tatarica, and livestock, we conducted a cross-scale analysis of social-economic, ecological and climatic factors that contribute to transmission of diseases We focused on gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) because they are transmitted between hosts that share pasture and they affect ungulate fitness. We used an interdisciplinary social-ecological methods approach which included conducting faecal egg counts of GINs in saigas and livestock, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with livestock owners and herders in the region, and triangulation of information through secondary sources.
   3. Livestock rearing was done in two ways: (a) village-based livestock and (b) outlying farms. The latter overlapped more with saigas. Village-based livestock had significantly higher worm burdens than those on outlying farms, which had comparable burdens to saigas. Various factors exacerbate GIN prevalence and transmission: Veterinary services are minimal; both saiga and livestock numbers are increasing; and changing climate is increasing farmers' dependence on shared pastures for hay production. It will be crucial for saiga conservationists to engage in multi-pronged conservation interventions, which are evaluated and adapted through the lens of rural livelihoods and the livestock health on which they depend.
   4. Our work provides researchers and practitioners with an avenue to better understand complex inter-relationships and plan interventions within rangelands, while viewing host health from an interdisciplinary perspective-ultimately working towards wildlife conservation while safeguarding livelihoods across the world's rangelands.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Liparis loeselii (L.) Rich. (Fen Orchid) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, and history and conservation. Liparis loeselii is a small terrestrial orchid that has a circumboreal distribution and is widespread in Europe and North America. Despite its wide distribution, the species is locally rare and has declined considerably in most of its range. In Britain, the species has a disjunct distribution and is now known to occur consistently at only six sites in eastern England and three in south Wales. It is absent from Ireland. Its most characteristic habitats in Britain are inland fens and coastal dune slacks, but outside Britain it can also be found in wet meadows, marshes, forested seep springs, at lake borders or on mats of floating peat. Populations of Liparis loeselii in dune slacks tend to be short-lived, and can rapidly increase in size or decrease and disappear as environmental conditions change. The species does not tolerate high nutrient concentrations or low pH. It is susceptible to drought, which reduces seed germination, seedling recruitment and adult survival. Heavy predation by rabbits and rodents has been observed under drought conditions. Liparis loeselii reproduces both by sexual reproduction, and by vegetative propagation through the production of pseudobulbs. Although flowers are accessible to insects, entomophilous pollination is unusual, and most sexual reproduction is the result of selfing. Fruits ripen late in the growing season (mid-October) and the dust-like seeds are dispersed during winter by wind and water. Germination occurs during the following growing season and is supported by a wide variety of mycorrhizal fungi. Since the late 19th century Liparis loeselii has declined considerably in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, primarily due to habitat destruction and loss, natural succession, and habitat desiccation due to drainage. As a result, the species has been listed as endangered in the Bern Convention and the European Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) and is the focus of intensive conservation efforts in many countries. Restoration of habitat by mowing, extensive grazing and peat removal, and the creation of new habitat by dune slack formation in dune systems and peat removal in fens may prolong population persistence and promote establishment of new populations.

AB  - Genomes capture the adaptive and demographic history of a species, but the choice of sequencing strategy and sample size can impact such inferences. We compared whole genome and reduced representation sequencing approaches to study the population demographic and adaptive signals of the North American mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus). We applied the restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) approach to 254 individuals and whole genome resequencing (WGS) approach to 35 individuals across the species range at mid-level coverage (9X) and to 5 individuals at high coverage (30X). We used ANGSD to estimate the genotype likelihoods and estimated the effective population size (N-e), population structure, and explicitly modelled the demographic history with & delta;a & delta;i and MSMC2. The data sets were overall concordant in supporting a glacial induced vicariance and extremely low N-e in mountain goats. We evaluated a set of climatic variables and geographic location as predictors of genetic diversity using redundancy analysis. A moderate proportion of total variance (36% for WGS and 21% for RADseq data sets) was explained by geography and climate variables; both data sets support a large impact of drift and some degree of local adaptation. The empirical similarities of WGS and RADseq presented herein reassuringly suggest that both approaches will recover large demographic and adaptive signals in a population; however, WGS offers several advantages over RADseq, such as inferring adaptive processes and calculating runs-of-homozygosity estimates. Considering the predicted climate-induced changes in alpine environments and the genetically depauperate mountain goat, the long-term adaptive capabilities of this enigmatic species are questionable.

AB  - Salt-lick use and behavior around salt licks of wild Malayan tapirs (Tapirus indicus) were studied using infrared sensor cameras in the Belum-Temengor Forest Complex, Malaysia, to observe different aspects of the ecology and behavior of this otherwise very elusive mammal for which we know little. All tapirs recorded at the salt licks were adult-sized individuals, and they were observed at night. Water-drinking behavior was observed in 73% of the captures at the salt licks, suggesting that they visited the salt licks for physiological needs, e.g., to supplement plant-based diet by drinking water containing minerals. Only one or two tapirs (male-female combination) were recorded at the same time; no same-sex individuals were recorded at the same time though both tapirs could be confidently sexed in 48% of the 88 captures containing records with two tapirs. Seven males and six females were identified. Each identified individual visited 1-3 salt licks, and multiple identified males and females were recorded at the same salt lick, suggesting the overlap of their home ranges. They were recorded around the studied salt licks once per 36 days on average, though they could visit other salt licks, too. The frequency varied across individuals (once per 11-204). Analyses of one-night tapir recordings suggested that one particular individual or one male-female pair occupied a salt lick for 3-4 h, indicating their exclusive behavior particularly between same-sex individuals. The results revealed the frequent salt-lick use by tapirs, suggesting importance of salt licks for their survival and social interactions.

AB  - The diversity of bottom substrates is a primary driver of taxonomic richness and species abundance patterns of freshwater benthic insects in space and time. Here, we examine the influence of substrate composition on the seasonal patterns of benthic insect communities in streams of arid regions. Benthic insects were sampled monthly over a year at three sampling sites distributed along the Bouilef stream within the Belezma biosphere reserve (Algeria). Different substrate types (sand, gravel, pebbles, boulders, and emergent macrophytes) were sampled in the rainy and dry seasons. During the two sampling seasons, a total of 8599 insects belonging to six orders, 26 families, and 39 genera/species were sampled and identified. Student's t-test analysis showed that season influences significantly the mean abundance of benthic insects, which increases in the rainy season. However, the season does not affect taxa richness. Substrate types influence taxa composition and variation of benthic insect communities. The results showed that pebbles and boulders are the most populated by gathering and filtering collectors in terms of taxa abundance. Emergent macrophytes are more favorable for herbivores shredders. Principal Coordinates Analysis ''PCoA'' also showed that pebbles and boulders differed significantly from other substrates, whereas sand and gravel substrates exhibited similar taxa mean abundance. Such assessments can help propose conservation measures needed to successfully safeguard these fragile ecosystems.

AB  - Mammalian dispersal is characterized by long-distance movements, and whether dispersal is sex-dependent and occurs at pre-saturation densities affects colonization speed and concurrent pathogen spread. In Scandinavia, Sweden classifies wild boar Sus scrofa as a native species and retains high densities, while Norwegian authorities considers it an alien invasive species and maintains the population at a minimum. With a long shared border and the recent detection of African swine fever (ASF) in Sweden, long-distance dispersal of wild boar into Norway is a concern. Using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of relatedness among 192 wild boar distributed across Sweden and Norway, we report sex and determined the likely origin of seven dispersing individuals detected far outside of the current Norwegian range margins. Dispersal distances varied from 61 to 431 km (mean = 230) and all seven dispersers were males, which reduces the likelihood of successful reproduction and establishment. Five of the wild boar originated from the low-density population at the colonization border in Norway, indicating pre-saturation dispersal. Sweden is of interest given the risk of pathogen spread. However, in the current epidemiological situation, we nevertheless consider it very unlikely that ASF will enter Norway by long-distance wild boar dispersal.

AB  - Conservation and restoration of hedgerows promote biodiversity and multi-functionality in agricultural landscapes. However, in Mediterranean environments, natural regeneration of hedgerows is often poor, and factors hindering the establishment and growth of hedgerow woody species remain unclear. This study aimed to address this gap by (1) quantifying natural regeneration, including seedling establishment and resprouting of planted hedgerow species and the establishment of woody species coming from outside the hedgerows; and (2) experimentally assessing the impact of drought, herbivory, and herb competition on seedling establishment. We selected 12 planted, 11-13-year-old hedgerows in four sites in Central Spain to sample their natural regeneration. In addition, we transplanted 1,356 seedlings of Colutea arborescens L., Crataegus monogyna Jacq. and Rhamnus alaternus L. to two field sites under three treatments that were applied factorially for two years: irrigation to alleviate summer drought, protection against herbivory, and herb clipping to reduce competition with transplanted seedlings. We found that only 66 juveniles of woody species, including 29 of species that were not planted in the hedgerows, developed from seed germination, and 316 sprouts recruited spontaneously along 10 years (14 individuals ha-1 year-1). Of the transplanted seedlings, only 22% survived after two years with protection against herbivory strongly enhancing seedling survival. To a lesser extent, irrigation and herb competition affected survival through interactions with herbivory and species identity. Irrigation and protection against herbivores accelerated seedling growth. Survival and growth of C. arborescens (14%; seedling height = 12 & PLUSMN; 9 cm) were lower than those of C. monogyna (41%; 21 & PLUSMN; 11 cm) and R. alaternus (17%; 13 & PLUSMN; 8 cm). We conclude that natural regeneration in Mediterranean planted hedgerows is low, herbivory is the main limiting factor for seedling survival, especially for deciduous species, and summer drought and herb competition mostly limit growth. These findings have important implications for the conservation and restoration of hedgerows in Mediterranean environments.

AB  - Cephalopods are universal to the world's oceans and prey to many fish species. On the northwest European shelf, integrated ecosystem assessments are rapidly evolving into the preferred method for holistically assessing stocks, but cephalopods appear to be an overlooked component, perhaps because their roles in ecosystems have seldom been quantified in recent years. We have analysed historical fish stomach records and revisited literature at local and regional level to determine the importance of cephalopods to the diets of 26 ecologically important finfish. We conclude that, in contrast to most other large marine ecosystems, cephalopods found in the Greater North Sea and the Celtic Seas regions appear to contribute only a small fraction to the diets of ecologically important finfish (found in the stomachs of similar to 14% of specimens among some species, but generally only 1-3% in most species), though their role as predator may be important and require further investigation. Based on our findings, cephalopods may not represent a key component for integrated ecosystem assessments, though as squid populations have been shown to expand throughout the North Sea in recent years, regular monitoring is encouraged to identify the point where their inclusion into such models may be necessary.

AB  - The rapid expansion of human populations in East Africa increases human-wildlife interactions, particularly along borders of protected areas (PAs). This development calls for a better understanding of how human-modified landscapes facilitate or exclude wildlife in savannas and whether these effects change through time. Here, we used camera traps to compare the distribution of 13 large herbivore species in Serengeti National Park with adjacent village lands used by livestock and people at both seasonal and diel cycle scales. The results show that body weight and feeding guild predict habitat use. Smaller sized grazers and mixed-feeders occurred more in village lands than larger herbivores. Across seasons, mixed-feeders and large browsers used edge areas year-round, while grazers were largely excluded during the dry season. At the diel cycle scale, wild herbivores' activity shifts towards the night in village lands compared to the protected area. A closer look revealed that wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and zebra (Equus quagga) mainly used village lands from pre-dusk to midnight when pastoralists and their livestock were absent. Wildebeest and zebra activity in village lands peaked around dusk, which overlapped with peaks in predator activity. These results suggest that edge areas of PAs can provide valuable habitat to native herbivores. Intensive use of village lands by grazing herbivores during the wet season - particularly at night - suggests grazers benefit from high-quality grazing lawns and increased safety from predators during part of the year. Herbivores that (also) forage on browse can benefit year-round from both food availability and decreased predation risk. We further note that excluding nighttime observations in similar studies may underestimate the use of edge areas by wildlife. Understanding how edge areas fit into the risk-resource landscape will help identify the unique benefits of edge areas to wildlife and promote coexistence of people and wildlife around protected areas.

AB  - As landscape-scale conservation models grow in prominence, assessments of how wildlife utilise multiple-use landscapes are required to inform effective conservation and management planning. Such efforts should incorporate multi-species perspectives to maximise value for conservation, and should account for scale to accurately capture species-environment relationships. We show that the random forest machine learning algorithm can be used to model large-scale sign-based data in a multi-scale framework. We used this method to investigate scale-dependent habitat associations for 16 mammal species of high conservation importance across the southern Kavango Zambezi (KAZA) Transfrontier Conservation Area in Botswana and Zimbabwe. Our findings revealed substantial variation in factors shaping habitat use across species, and illustrate that different species often have divergent responses to the same environmental and anthropogenic factors, and differ in the scales at which they respond to them. For all variables across all species, scale optimisation most often selected our largest scale. Precipitation, soil nutrients, and vegetation appeared to be the most important factors determining mammal distributions, likely through their associations with food resources for herbivores and, in turn, prey availability for carnivores. Anthropogenic pressures also had an important influence, with many species selecting against areas with high cattle density. The variety of relationships with human density indicated that species vary in their tolerance of humans. We found a consistent positive relationship with areas under high protection, and negative relationship with unprotected and less-strictly protected areas. Policy implications. Through a novel application of random forest modelling to spoor data from 16 mammal species, this study highlights the importance of adopting a multi-scale, multi-species approach for decision-making processes that depend on understanding wildlife distributions and habitat associations, such as protected area and corridor prioritisation. The findings identify changing rainfall patterns and increasing livestock numbers as emerging trends that may impact wildlife distributions, both within sub-Saharan Africa and on a global scale. Wildlife management authorities should use modelling exercises and adaptive management to ensure that protected area networks remain fit for purpose under anticipated changes in rainfall under climate change, and explore initiatives that promote coexistence of wildlife and livestock.

AB  - Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), a neurological disease affecting white-tailed deer has been found in many states including Tennessee. To design effective CWD management programs, stakeholders including state wildlife agencies benefit from understanding hunters' attitudes and acceptability of alternative management actions. By conducting a mixed-mode survey of hunters, we compared the risk perception and relative acceptability of management actions before and after the first deer hunting season since the discovery of CWD in Tennessee. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors affecting hunters' acceptability of alternative management actions. Acceptability was significantly affected by concerns related to deer and human health, regulatory changes, trust and confidence on wildlife agency, and experience of hunting in other states with CWD. These results shed light on understanding hunter's perception of risk, and roles of trust, perceived risk and hunters' characteristics in CWD management.

AB  - Improving the methods utilized to facilitate reproduction is associated with a constant need to search for new factors that not only significantly affect reproductive processes, but also create new possibilities when assessing male reproductive potential. Aquaporins (AQPs) belong to a family of small (28 30 kDa) proteins that facilitate the transport of water and other small molecules. There have been 13 AQPs (AQP0-AQP12) discovered in mammals, and these proteins are present in a wide range of cell types. Almost all AQPs, except AQP6 and AQP12 are present in the male reproductive organs and sperm of mammals and birds. Increasing evidence suggests that these proteins are involved in a number of processes responsible for the optimal functioning of the male reproductive system. This review presents the current state of knowledge regarding the abundance and distribution of AQPs in the male reproductive organs and sperm of various livestock and poultry species, including buffalo, cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, turkeys and goose. Furthermore, the possible physiological and pathophysiological significance of AQPs in male reproduction, as well as hormonal regulation of quantities are discussed. It can be concluded from the studies analyzed in this paper that abundance patterns of AQPs may be considered in the future as specific and universal biomarkers of male fertility and infertility in animal husbandry.

AB  - There is an ever-increasing interest in behavioral differences between individuals, or "animal personality". Here we show how these differences develop over the first six months in fawns of a fallow deer population. Individuals that behave boldly as newborns when captured by humans still display bold behavior months later, which may allow them to acquire more resources. These findings shed light on the role that personality plays in ecology and evolution early in life.
   Although it is widely acknowledged that animal personality plays a key role in ecology, current debate focuses on the exact role of personality in mediating life-history trade-offs. Crucial for our understanding is the relationship between personality and resource acquisition, which is poorly understood, especially during early stages of development. Here we studied how among-individual differences in behavior develop over the first 6 months of life, and their potential association with resource acquisition in a free-ranging population of fallow deer (Dama dama). We related neonate physiological (heart rate) and behavioral (latency to leave at release) anti-predator responses to human handling to the proportion of time fawns spent scanning during their first summer and autumn of life. We then investigated whether there was a trade-off between scanning time and foraging time in these juveniles, and how it developed over their first 6 months of life. We found that neonates with longer latencies at capture (i.e., risk-takers) spent less time scanning their environment, but that this relationship was only present when fawns were 3-6 months old during autumn, and not when fawns were only 1-2 months old during summer. We also found that time spent scanning was negatively related to time spent foraging and that this relationship became stronger over time, as fawns gradually switch from a nutrition rich (milk) to a nutrition poor (grass) diet. Our results highlight a potential mechanistic pathway in which neonate personality may drive differences in early-life resource acquisition of a large social mammal.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Good-quality sperm samples are needed for the development and implementation of sperm cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination. These reproductive biotechnologies play an important role in the conservation and management of domestic and wild species. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of seasonality and social environment on sperm quality in three endangered gazelles: Cuvier's, dorcas and Mohor gazelles. Periods of better sperm quality were related with higher conception rates in Cuvier's and Mohor gazelles but not in dorcas. Cuvier's gazelle showed higher sperm quantity in April and Mohor gazelle in April and August and correlated with environmental data. In dorcas gazelle, a drop in sperm quality was observed in October. Housing conditions did not affect sperm quality in Cuvier's and Mohor gazelles, whereas dorcas males housed with females showed lower semen quality than males kept alone or with males. Considering these results could improve the success of reproductive biotechnologies in these three species.
   Knowledge of factors affecting semen quality could be of great importance for the collection and preservation of semen from threatened animals. To assess the effect of seasonality, sperm parameters and testosterone levels were examined throughout the year and compared with the distribution of conceptions. Cuvier's gazelle showed higher sperm quantity in April, coinciding with one peak of conceptions. In dorcas gazelle, sperm parameters showed a drop in October. However, percentage of conceptions increased during that month. In Mohor gazelle, sperm quality was best in April and August, in agreement with higher conception rates and high testosterone levels. Percentage of conceptions was correlated with photoperiod and rainfall in Cuvier's gazelle and with temperature in Mohor gazelle. To assess the effect of social environment, semen quality, testosterone and cortisol levels were quantified in males housed alone, in bachelor groups or with females. No differences were seen in Cuvier's and Mohor gazelles' semen traits, whereas dorcas males housed with females showed lower semen quality than males kept alone or with other males. Overall, ejaculate quality is influenced by seasonal factors in the three gazelle species, while social factors only appear to affect that of dorcas gazelle.

AB  - This paper presents a review of publications on the relationship between phyllophagous insects and the forest communities in the current ecological situation, when ongoing climate changes, manifested primarily in an increase in the air temperature and a change in the precipitation amount and distribution, affect all processes in natural communities. Changes in the ranges of many plants and animal species are observed moving up northwards and up in altitude. The spring phenophases come earlier, the autumn ones come later, the vegetation period lengthens, and the biomass of terrestrial plants increases. Such phenomena, together with changes in climatic parameters, affect herbivorous animals, which include insects with various food specializations and different life cycles. As before, despite the growing number of observations in different parts of the earth, there remains a lot of uncertainty about how individual plant and insect species and their functional groups function under the changing external conditions. It is emphasized that it is necessary to continue long-term studies in specific natural conditions in order to more accurately determine the reaction of the participants in the interactions to local climate changes and understand what the forestry strategy should be in the current and the situation predicted for the future.

AB  - Diverse hypotheses have been proposed with the aim to explain the extinction of Late Pleistocene/Holocene mammals, including the Megafauna from America. Some authors support that human being was the direct responsible of extinction by means of intensive hunting, as proposed by the "blitzkrieg" or overkilling hypothesis. However, evidence is not conclusive. As is well known by biologists, exotic diseases may play an important role in local extinction of diverse vertebrates. On this basis, some speculated that the arrival of man may also have introduced new diseases that may have played an important role on native mammals, especially megafaunal populations, probably constituting a key factor on their extinction. Recent findings of the parasite Fasciola hepatica in endemic deer from Holocene sites in Patagonia (and also probably from camelids in Peru) previous to Hispanic colonization constitute indirect evidence that may sustain this hypothesis. Because one of the main definite host of this parasite are humans, this potential disease may have been introduced by human populations as hosts and then disperse through the entire continent, as evidenced by the finding of Fasciola hepatica in Patagonia. Its presence in endemic deer and camelids previous to Hispanic colonization, reinforces the proposal that human-related diseases may have played some role in Late Pleistocene extinction of large native mammals.

AB  - Body size and secondary sexual characteristics are drivers of male reproductive success among polygynous species. A gene complex found to be associated with morphology in several species is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, while several studies have found that greater MHC diversity is associated with larger body size and secondary sexual characteristics, other studies have demonstrated that maximal MHC diversity is not always optimal for the individual's fitness. This study tested if MHC diversity, measured as pairwise allelic distances at each of two unlinked MHC II loci (exon 2 for the classical antigen-binding protein MHC-DRB and exon 2 for the accessory protein MHC-DOB), was associated with body size (male and female) or antler size in a semi-wild enclosed population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). After accounting for the effect of age on body and antler size, we used residual analysis to assess whether MHC allelic distances explained any of the remaining variation in body and antler size. While we found no associations between physical characteristics and MHC-DRB, we found that both male body and antler size were associated with MHC-DOB nucleotide allelic distances. Specifically, we found a quadratic relationship between MHC-DOB and male body size, where body size peaked at moderate MHC-DOB nucleotide allelic distance. However, we found a positive linear association between MHC-DOB nucleotide allelic distances and antler size. Neither MHC-DRB nor MHC-DOB influenced female body size, even though the average allelic distances of males and females were not significantly different. Our results suggest that MHC-DOB, or a gene genetically linked to this locus, may influence male morphological characteristics in white-tailed deer.

AB  - Large carnivores are experiencing range contraction and population declines globally. Prey depletion due to illegal offtake is considered a major contributor, but the effects of prey depletion on large carnivore demography are rarely tested. We measured African lion density and tested the factors that affect survival using mark-recapture models fit to six years of data from known individuals in Kafue National Park (KNP), Zambia. KNP is affected by prey depletion, particularly for large herbivores that were preferred prey for KNP lions a half-century ago. This provides a unique opportunity to test whether variables that explain local prey density also affect lion survival. Average lion density within our study area was 3.43 individuals/100 km(2) (95% CI, 2.79-4.23), which was much lower than lion density reported for another miombo ecosystem with similar vegetation structure and rainfall that was less affected by prey depletion. Despite this, comparison to other lion populations showed that age- and sex-specific survival rates for KNP lions were generally good, and factors known to correlate with local prey density had small effects on lion survival. In contrast, recruitment of cubs was poor and average pride size was small. In particular, the proportion of the population comprised of second-year cubs was low, indicating that few cubs are recruited into the subadult age class. Our findings suggest that low recruitment might be a better signal of low prey density than survival. Thus, describing a lion population's age structure in addition to average pride size may be a simple and effective method of initially evaluating whether a lion population is affected by prey depletion. These dynamics should be evaluated for other lion populations and other large carnivore species. Increased resource protection and reducing the underlying drivers of prey depletion are urgent conservation needs for lions and other large carnivores as their conservation is increasingly threatened by range contraction and population declines.

AB  - In the context of social and economic transformation in rural China, ecosystem disservices have emerged frequently. This study reveals the spatiotemporal patterns, hazards and driving factors of wild boar damage from 2000 to 2021 by using the meta-analysis and collecting 733 typical human and wild boar conflicts. In this period, the number, spatial scope and hazard degree of wild boar damage incidents showed an increasing trend, and the number of provincial-level regions, prefecture-level cities and districts (counties) involved increased from 18, 41 and 67 to 25, 147 and 399, respectively. Wild boar damage incidents were concentrated in Chongqing municipality and central and western Hubei province before 2005, and then expanded to the Sichuan Basin, Loess Plateau, middle-lower reaches of Yangtze River and mountainous areas such as Changbai Mountains after 2015. The main manifestations were destroying crops, infringing poultry and causing casualties, especially the destruction of crops and farmland abandonment, accompanied by a rapid increase in casualties, accounting for 23.66% of the damage incidents. Meanwhile, the spreading trend and harmfulness of wild boar damage is a typical phenomenon of ecosystem disservices. The aggravation of this phenomenon is the result of ecological restoration, hunting ban policy, unclear boundary between agricultural land and ecological land, strong viability of wild boar and lack of natural enemies. This has posed an obvious threat to the use of abandoned farmland, the improvement of farmers' livelihood and the maintenance of regional ecological security. It is urgent to formulate a policy of controlling the number of wild boars and establish a compensation mechanism for the loss by wild boars.

AB  - Populations of large herbivores can be efficiently managed by regulating the number of females, which is directly related to recruitment. This study aims to determine seasonal changes in the attractiveness of salt water to female Sika deer (Cervus nippon) in order to cull females more efficiently. Females drank saltwater well at similar times of the year for saltwater with different installation dates. In particular, the frequency of drinking increased from early April to mid-July. Previous studies have shown that salt water is an effective attractant for capturing females, but the results of this study suggest that females may be captured more effectively in spring and early summer. This is the birthing season for sika deer. Culling females in late pregnancy and lactation may also directly reduce recruitment due to higher mortality of young. Saltwater-induced culling of female sika deer may be an effective method of managing overpopulation of the deer.

AB  - Aim: Introduced mammal herbivores are predicted to negatively affect insular flora. However, disentangling which particular traits (1) developed from exaptations and (2) are functional to avoid herbivory remains mainly unknown. This study aims to assess if the flora of continental islands with historic native herbivores are exapted to the introduction of new mammal herbivores and to predict the potential vulnerability of endemic species from islands where mammal herbivores have not been introduced.Location: Balearic Islands.Taxon: 96 Balearic endemic plant species.Methods: We investigated whether the endemic flora on continental islands maintains functional traits that resist introduced mammal herbivores by analysing the chemical and morphological traits related to plant resistance of five individuals for each of 98 species. Also, we measured plant-size variables to assess plant escape strategies. Overall, we combined these traits with the accessibility to goats. Predictive models were generated for species that inhabit islands where goats have not been introduced to assess their potential vulnerability.Results: Endemic species may defend against new herbivores (e.g. goats) if they contain highly toxic compounds (alkaloids, glycosides, coumarins), spinescent and urticating structures, or specific plant architecture (low plant size, high specific leaf area). If such traits are absent, the species may become extinct-unless they inhabit areas inaccessible to goats. On continental islands, some endemic species are expected to resist the introduction of herbivores, while others may be significantly affected.Main Conclusions: From the ancient connection with the mainland, exaptations may allow the plants to resist the presence of introduced herbivores. However, non-exapted species could be threatened by the introduction of non-native ungulates.

AB  - ContextIxodes scapularis (the blacklegged tick) is a prominent disease vector that has rapidly expanded across eastern North America in recent decades due to land use and climate change. Predictive modeling is popular for ecological inference and disease management, but few models have considered the multiscale tick and host relationships that drive blacklegged tick expansion.ObjectivesPredict the probability of occurrence and relative abundance of the blacklegged tick in Ohio, USA at an informative resolution for disease surveillance (800-m2) following CDC guidelines. Determine drivers of tick expansion at the tick and host level through a multiscale analysis of climate, habitat, and host density variables.MethodsWe modeled blacklegged tick occurrence and abundance using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation to analyze the relationships of climate, habitat, and host density with field-collected data from 161 sites. We analyzed habitat variables at several spatial scales (800-5000-m2) expecting they would be most influential at scales relevant to white-tailed deer home range size.ResultsOccurrence and abundance decreased in drier, hotter areas with higher precipitation variability, and increased in heavily forested areas at the spatial scale relevant to deer home range size (1500-m2). Only the abundance model included host density variables, indicating that host densities influence abundance but not occurrence.ConclusionsOur spatial projections show a high probability of occurrence and relative abundance throughout Ohio. Multiscale frameworks are vital for understanding the continuously changing distributions and abundances of arthropod disease vectors that rely on hosts for range expansion.

AB  - Wetland habitats are changing under multiple anthropogenic pressures. Nutrient leakage and pollution modify physico-chemical state of wetlands and affect the ecosystem through bottom-up processes, while alien predators affect the ecosystems in a top-down manner. Boreal wetlands are important breeding areas for several waterbird species, the abundances of which potentially reflect both bottom-up and top-down ecosystem processes. Here, we use long-term national monitoring data gathered from c. 130 waterbird breeding sites in Finland from the 1980s to the 2020s. We hypothesised that the physico-chemical state of the waters and increasing alien predator abundance both play a role in steering the waterbird population trends. We set out to test this hypothesis by relating population changes of 17 waterbird species to changes in water chemistry and to regional alien predator indices while allowing species-specific effects to vary with foraging niche (dabblers, invertivore divers, piscivorous divers, herbivores), nesting site, female mass and habitat (oligotrophic, eutrophic). We found niche and nesting site-specific, habitat-dependent changes in waterbird numbers. While the associations with higher phosphorus levels and browning water were in overall positive at the oligotrophic lakes, the numbers of invertivore and piscivore diving ducks were most strongly negatively associated with higher phosphorus levels and browning water at the eutrophic lakes. Furthermore, increased pH levels benefitted piscivores. Invertivore diving duck species nesting on the wetlands had declined most on sites with high alien predator indices. Large herbivorous species and species preferring oligotrophic lakes seem to be successful. We conclude that the large-scale breeding waterbird decline in Finland is closely connected to both bottom-up and top-down processes, where negative associations are emphasised especially at eutrophic lakes. Niche-, nest site- and habitat-specific management actions are required to conserve declining waterbird populations. Managing wetlands on catchments level together with alien predator control may provide important approaches to future wetland management.
   Waterbird abundances reflect both bottom-up and top-down processes. Changes in water quality and alien predators have had asymmetric long-term associations with waterbirds.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Thai swamp buffalo is a domesticated swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) which has a functional significance for the livestock production system and for the economic benefit of Thailand. For instance, meat supply derived from Thai swamp buffalo is a secondary consideration in recently years. Therefore, there is mounting interest concerning the regulation of the nutrient requirements of Thai swamp buffalo to optimize their production. However, no systematic report is available on the nutrient requirements of the growing Thai swamp buffalo. This study investigates and predicts protein requirement systems that can provide an abundant energy intake and can be included in the 18-24 months old Thai swamp buffalo's diet, as well as supply the recommended amount of net nitrogen or crude protein requirement to optimize their growth and maintenance. Protein requirement, nutrient utilization, and microorganism profile are included to corroborate the influences mentioned.
   In some geographical areas and in certain breeding situations, the interpretation of increased gain in the bovine is difficult to investigate. Due to their inherent genetic variations, their energy and protein needs vary as a function of inherent genetic differences, making these requirements difficult to accurately assess in bull species, e.g., Thai swamp buffalo. The study aimed at investigating and predicting protein requirement systems, by the provision of an abundant energy intake of 2.2 Mcal/kg DM for the maintenance and growth of Thai swamp buffaloes using a comparative prolonged feeding trial for 90 days. Sixteen bull Thai swamp buffaloes at the initial (Age: 18-24 months; BW: 233 +/- 25.0 kg) were assigned into four treatment groups, four buffaloes each, fed 5.4, 6.6, 8.5, and 10.5% DM crude protein (CP). CP intake, BW, and physiological fluid were determined. The net CP requirements for maintenance and growth of Thai swamp buffaloes were 5.41 g CP/kg W-0.75 and 0.46 g CP/g average daily gain (ADG), respectively. Our results indicated that CP requirement increases when the BW increases. An increased dietary CP resulted in increased amounts of blood urine nitrogen (N), N absorption, total volatile fatty acid, urinary purine derivative, and the microbial N. Notably, the net CP requirement for growth of Thai swamp buffalo was higher than it reported in NRC, but the maintenance was lower.

AB  - We assessed the relative importance of wilderness to gray wolf (Canis lupus) population dynamics over 50 years in a population that 1) was long extant (i.e., not reintroduced or recolonized), 2) was not subject to harvest in our study area until recently, and 3) used both wilderness and adjacent, mainly public, non-wilderness. We analyzed the survival of radiocollared wolves (n = 756 collared-wolf tenures) during 1968-2018 in the Superior National Forest, Minnesota, USA, including the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Over 50 years, adult annual survival was 78%. Wolves captured in wilderness tended to exhibit higher survival than those captured in nonwilderness, but the difference was more pronounced during harvest years and post-harvest years when wilderness wolf survival remained relatively high and non-wilderness wolf survival dropped (relative to pre-harvest). During Nov-Apr of pre-harvest years for adults, the natural mortality rate was similar for non-wilderness wolves and wilderness wolves (both 6%), but the anthropogenic mortality rate was higher for non-wilderness wolves than wilderness wolves (7% versus 1%), as was the illegal mortality rate (5% versus 1%). During Nov-Apr of preharvest years, wilderness wolves were less likely to die than non-wilderness wolves (p = 0.042; hazard ratio = 0.59), pups were more likely to die than adults (p = 0.002; hazard ratio = 1.84), and males were less likely to die than females (p = 0.053; hazard ratio = 0.73). Our long-term wolf survival, cause-specific mortality, and hazard results will inform management agencies whenever wolves are delisted, and jurisdiction for them passes to states.

AB  - The Bhutanese government initiated a highland development programme in the year 2016 to promote yak farming because the number of yak farming families is declining. However, there are several cross-cutting policies and issues that affect successful implementation of interventions to support yak farming in transition. We studied the challenges and opportunities to sustain yak farming and related trade-offs around problems and solutions through individual and focus group interviews with six stakeholder groups (i.e. herders from two regions, extensionists, park rangers, livestock officials, and forest officials). Overall the herders rated forage availability and yak mortality as the main threats to yak farming, while government officials rated labour availability as the main threats. Most problems and solutions that were identified in the focus group interviews had diverging views among the stakeholder groups. There is clearly a need for a multi-stakeholder dialogue aiming to discuss problems and solutions together. This should take away misleading and disputed claims, and provide understanding about the approach to cope with risks and uncertainty around transhumance yak-based communities. A strong collaboration should lead to appropriate policy, which would reduce challenges and barriers, and simultaneously give opportunities to herders and their children to stay in yak farming in future.

AB  - Simple Summary The homeostasis of intestinal microorganisms has an important effect on the healthy development of the host, as well as for ruminants. However, the study on the intestinal microflora of the Hainan Black Goat, a special breed in Hainan, is not sufficient. Therefore, this study is devoted to the preliminary study of the composition of gut microbiota and the differences between the different intestinal segments of Hainan black goats. According to the results, the large intestine has a greater variety and a greater richness of the intestinal microbiota community than the small intestine. The microbial composition of the cecum and colon is similar. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the species diversity of gut microbiota in different intestinal segments of Hainan black goats. The intestine of animals is a complex micro-ecosystem containing a large number of microbiomes, which is essential for the host's health development. The Hainan black goat with good resistance and adaptability is a unique species in Hainan, China. These unique physiological characteristics are inseparable from their intestinal microbiota. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to investigate bacterial communities in different segments of the intestinal tract of Hainan black goat. The results showed that the indices of Chao1 and ACE in the cecum and colon were significantly greater than those in the ileum (p = 0.007, 0.018). According to PCoA, the intestinal flora composition of the cecum and colon is almost equivalent. In contexts of the phylum, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Pseudomonadota were the dominant phyla in the gut of the Hainan black goat. While in context of the genus, the dominant groups in the gut of black goats mainly include Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, Bacteroides, Paeniclostridium, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and Eubacterium coprostanoligenes _group, Prevotella_1, they have different proportions in different intestinal segments. The gut microbiota of Hainan black goat is mainly Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Pseudomonadota. Influenced by the intestinal location where they colonize, the large intestine has a more complex intestinal flora than the small intestine. In contrast, there are only minor differences between the caecum and the colon in the large intestine.

AB  - Free-ranging and captive cervid herds are at risk for chronic wasting disease transmission from direct contacts at fences, so we explored the use of a secondary electric fence to prevent contacts in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Using a captive herd of white-tailed deer in Pennsylvania, USA, we tested the efficacy of two electric fence designs (one three-strand and one six-strand) constructed along separate primary fence lines (each composed of 20 m of chain link and 20 m of woven wire fencing) dividing paddocks of captive deer. From June to November 2019, we conducted three trials of variable lengths to assess how season, age, and sex impacted behavior and motivation of deer to breach the electric fence. When no electric fence was in place, we observed 117 direct contacts through woven wire and chain link fences. With the electric fences in place, we observed electric fence breaches (which led to direct contact between deer) by weaned fawns (37 breaches, 4 direct contacts) and males in the mid- and late-rut (2 breaches, 1 direct contact). The majority of breaches occurred across the three-strand-fence. Our results suggest that no style of primary fence alone is sufficient to prevent direct contacts and that the addition of a secondary, properly designed electric fence constructed along the primary fence of captive white-tailed deer facilities could prevent direct contact between captive and free-ranging deer.
