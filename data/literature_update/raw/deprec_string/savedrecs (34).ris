AB  - Hyperglycemia is a crucial risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Chronic inflammation is a central characteristic of obesity, leading to many of its complications. Recent studies have shown that high glucose activates Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) by suppressing AMPK activity in breast cancer cells. Metformin is a commonly prescribed anti-diabetic drug best known for its AMPK-activating effect. However, the role of YAP in the vasoprotective effect of metformin in diabetic endothelial cell dysfunction is still unknown. The present study aimed to investigate whether YAP activation plays a role in obesity-associated endothelial dysfunction and inflammation and examine whether the vasoprotective effect of metformin is related to YAP inhibition. Reanalysis of the clinical sequencing data revealed YAP signaling, and the YAP target genes CTGF and CYR61 were upregulated in aortic endothelial cells and retinal fibrovascular membranes from diabetic patients. YAP overexpression impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations (EDRs) in isolated mouse aortas and increased the expression of YAP target genes and inflammatory markers in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). High glucose-activated YAP in HUVECs and aortas was accompanied by increased production of oxygen-reactive species. AMPK inhibition was found to induce YAP activation, resulting in increased JNK activity. Metformin activated AMPK and promoted YAP phosphorylation, ultimately improving EDRs and suppressing the JNK activity. Targeting the AMPK-YAP-JNK axis could become a therapeutic strategy for alleviating vascular dysfunction in obesity and diabetes.

TI  - RETRACTED: Long Noncoding RNA LINC00473 Ameliorates Depression-Like Behaviors in Female Mice by Acting as a Molecular Sponge to Regulate miR-497-5p/BDNF Axis (Retracted Article)

AB  - Background. Depression was a common life-threatening psychiatric disorder and occurs more frequently in women than in men. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as LINC00473, had been reported to be involved in the progression of depression. Methods. Chronic unpredictable moderate stress in mice (CUMS) was applied to construct a depression model. Subsequently, RT-qPCR was applied to check the level of LINC00473 and microRNA-497-5p (miR-497-5p) in the hippocampal region of the mice induced by CUMS. CUMS mice were injected with lentiviral vectors of LINC00473 (LV-LINC00473), miR-497-5p inhibitor, short hairpin- (sh-) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (sh-BDNF), or miR-497-5p mimic to evaluate depressive behaviors, including sucrose preference test, forced swim test, elevated plus maze, and tail suspension test. Moreover, the production of hypothalamic neurotransmitters was assessed with the usage of ELISA kits. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, and RIP analysis were performed to measure the relationship between miR-497-5p and LINC00473 or BDNF. Further, western blot was employed to determine the protein level of BDNF. Results. We discovered that LINC00473 level was downregulated in the female mice with depression, but not in male mice. Besides, the depressive behaviors induced by CUMS in mice, including the decrease of sucrose preference and time in open arm, as well as the increase of immobility time and swimming resting time were all ameliorated by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, the concentration of neurotransmitters was decreased in CUMS-induced mouse hypothalamus, which was blocked by LV-LINC00473 lentiviral vector administration. Mechanistically, LINC00473 directly targeted miR-497-5p. Absence of miR-497-5p revealed the antidepression effects on CUMS-induced mice, and miR-497-5p upregulation could counter the antidepressive impacts of LINC00473 upregulation on CUMS-induced mice. Furthermore, LINC00473 could target miR-497-5p to modulate BDNF level. Knockdown of BDNF could abrogate the improving influences of miR-497-5p suppression on CUMS-induced depression. Conclusions. LINC00473 ameliorated CUMS-caused depression by encouraging BDNF expression via binding to miR-497-5p, which might provide a potential therapeutic target for depression in females.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is characterized by persistent symptoms associated to the development of nasal polyps. To this day, the molecular mechanisms involved are still not well defined. However, it has been suggested that a sustained inflammation as allergy is involved in its onset. In this exploratory study, the aim was to investigate the effect of the allergic status in the development of CRSwNP. To achieve this, we recruited 22 patients with CRSwNP and classified them in non-allergic and allergic using ImmunoCAP ISAC molecular diagnosis. Plasma samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Subsequently, significant metabolites from plasma that were commercially available were then analyzed by targeted analysis in some nasal polyps. Additionally, nasal polyp and nasal mucosa samples were examined for eosinophils, neutrophils, CD3(+) and CD11c(+) cells, as well as collagen deposition and goblet cell hyperplasia. We found that 9 out of the 22 patients were sensitized to some aeroallergens (named as allergic CRSwNP). The other 13 patients had no sensitizations (non-allergic CRSwNP). Regarding metabolomics, bilirubin, cortisol, lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) 16:0, 18:0 and 20:4 and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) 20:4, which are usually related to a sustained allergic inflammation, were unexpectedly increased in plasma of non-allergic CRSwNP compared to allergic CRSwNP. LPC 16:0, LPC 18:0 and LPI 20:4 followed the same trend in nasal polyp as they did in plasma. Comparison of nasal polyps with nasal mucosa showed a significant increase in eosinophils (p < 0.001) and neutrophils (p < 0.01) in allergic CRSwNP. There were more eosinophils in polyps of non-allergic CRSwNP than in their nasal mucosa (p < 0.01). Polyps from non-allergic CRSwNP had less eosinophils than the polyps of allergic CRSwNP (p < 0.05) and reduced amounts of collagen compared to their nasal mucosa (p < 0.001). Our data suggests that there is a systemic inflammatory response associated to CRSwNP in the absence of allergy, which could be accountable for the nasal polyp development. Allergic CRSwNP presented a higher number of eosinophils in nasal polyps, suggesting that eosinophilia might be connected to the development of nasal polyps in this phenotype.

AB  - Background: Chemotherapy resistance is an obstacle to promoting the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, finding promising therapeutic targets to enhance HCC chemotherapy is necessary. Methods: Signal sequence receptor subunit (SSR2) expression analysis was performed using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blotting assays. Colony formation, apoptosis, anchorage-independent growth assay, and in vivo animal models were used to investigate the effect of SSR2 expression on the resistance of HCC cells to Cisplatin (DDP). Western blotting and luciferase reporter gene techniques were used to explore the molecular mechanism of SSR2 on the resistance of HCC cells to DDP. Results: We found that the SSR2 is upregulated in HCC and associated with poor survival. Further analysis showed that the downregulation of SSR2 increased the sensitivity of HCC to DDP. Mechanically, SSR2 inhibited the Yes-associated protein (YAP) phosphorylation and promoted the transcription of Hippo signaling downstream genes. Finally, the Hippo pathway inhibitor can suppress colony formation and tumorigenesis arising from SSR2 upregulation. Conclusions: Our study shows that SSR2 is important in HCC progression via the Hippo pathway. Thus, targeting the SSR2/Hippo axis might be a potential strategy for overcoming HCC resistance to DDP.

AB  - Diabetic cardiomyopathy remains a formidable health challenge with a high mortality rate and no targeted treatments. Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) has shown promising effects on cardiovascular diseases; however, its role and the underlying mechanism in regulating diabetic cardiomyopathy remain unclear. In this study, we developed mouse models of diabetic cardiomyopathy using leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice and streptozocin-induced C57BL/6 mice. The diabetic cardiomyopathy model mice exhibited apparent structural damage in cardiac tissues and a significant increase in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Notably, we observed a significant decreased expression of GDF11 in the myocardium of mice with diabetic cardiomyopathy. Moreover, GDF11 cardiac-specific knock-in mice (transgenic mice) exhibited improved cardiac function and reduced apoptosis. Moreover, exogenous administration of GDF11 mitigated high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GDF11 alleviated high glucose-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of the alkylation repair homolog 5 (ALKBH5)-forkhead box group O3a (FOXO3)-cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript (CDR1as)/Hippo signaling pathway. Consequently, this novel mechanism effectively counteracted myocardial cell apoptosis, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for clinical diabetic cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Exposure to adverse experiences during early life is associated with an increased risk of psychopathology during adolescence. In a previous study, we demonstrated that neonatal maternal separation (NMS) combined with social isolation led to impulsive and depressive-like behaviors in male adolescents. Additionally, it significantly reduced the expression of excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) in the hippocampus. Building upon this work, we investigated the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor to glutathione, in early-life stress (ELS) model rats and in EAAC1(-/- )mice. EAAC1 plays a dual role in transporting both glutamate and cysteine into neurons. Our findings revealed that female adolescents subjected to in the ELS model also exhibited behavioral defects similar to those of males. NAC injection rescued depressive-like behaviors in both male and female NMS models, but it improved impulsive behavior only in males. Furthermore, we observed increased reactive oxidative stress (ROS) and neuroinflammation in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and prefrontal cortex of NMS model rats, which were mitigated by NAC treatment. Notably, NAC reversed the reduced expression of EAAC1 in the vHPC of NMS model rats. In EAAC1-/- mice, severe impulsive and depressive-like behaviors were evident, and the NAC intervention improved only depressive-like behaviors. Collectively, our results suggest that ELS contributes to depression and impulsive behaviors during adolescence. Moreover, the cysteine uptake function of EAAC1 in neurons may be specifically related to depression rather than impulsive behavior.

AB  - gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The termination of GABA transmission is through the action of GABA transporters (GATs). mGAT4 (encoded by Slc6a11) is another GAT besides GAT1 (encoded by Slc6a1) that functions in GABA reuptake in CNS. Research on the function of mGAT4 is still in its infancy. We developed an mGat4 knockout mouse model (mGat4-/- mice) and performed a series of behavioral analyses for the first time to study the effect of mGat4 on biological processes in CNS. Our results indicated that homozygous mGat4-/- mice had less depression, anxiety-like behavior and more social activities than their wild-type littermate controls. However, they had weight loss and showed motor incoordination and imbalance. Meanwhile, mGat4-/- mice showed increased pain threshold and hypoalgesia behavior in nociceptive stimulus and learning and memory impairments. The expression of multiple components of the GABAergic system including GAD67, GABAA and KCC2 was altered. There is little or no compensatory change in mGat1. In a word, mGat4 may play a key role in normal motor coordination, sensation, emotion, learning and memory and could be the potential target of neurological disorders.

AB  - We analysed spatiotemporal properties of Ca2+ signals in protoplasmic astrocytes in the CA1 stratum radiatum of hippocampal slices from young (2-3 months old) mice housed in control conditions or exposed to a caloric restriction (CR) diet for one month. The astrocytic Ca2+ events became shorter in duration and smaller in size; they also demonstrated reduced velocity of expansion and shrinkage following CR. At the same time, Ca2+ signals in the astrocytes from the CR animals demonstrated higher amplitude and the faster rise and decay rates. These changes can be attributed to CR-induced morphological remodelling and uncoupling of astrocytes described in our previous study. CR-induced changes in the parameters of Ca2+ activity were partially reversed by inhibition of gap junctions/hemichannels with carbenoxolone (CBX). The effect of CBX on Ca2+ activity in CR-animals was unexpected because the diet already decreases gap junctional coupling in astrocytic syncytia. It may reflect the blockade of hemichannels also sensitive to this drug. Thus, CR-induced morphological remodelling of astrocytes is at least partly responsible for changes in the pattern of Ca2+ activity in the astrocytic network. How such changes in spatiotemporal Ca2+ landscape can translate into astrocytic physiology and neuron-glia interactions remains a matter for future studies.

AB  - Neonatal seizures pose a clinical challenge in their early detection, acute management, and long-term comorbidities. They are often caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are frequently refractory to the first-line anti-seizure medication phenobarbital. One proposed mechanism for phenobarbital inefficacy during neonatal seizures is the reduced abundance and function of the neuron-specific K+/Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2), which maintains chloride homeostasis and promotes GABAergic inhibition upon its phosphorylation during postnatal development. Here, we investigated whether this mechanism is causal and whether it can be rescued by KCC2 functional enhancement. In a CD-1 mouse model of refractory ischemic neonatal seizures, treatment with the KCC2 functional enhancer CLP290 rescued phenobarbital efficacy, increased KCC2 abundance, and prevented the development of epileptogenesis, as quantified by video electroencephalogram monitoring. These effects were prevented by knock-in expression of nonphosphorylatable mutants of KCC2 (S940A or T906A and T1007A), indicating that KCC2 phosphorylation regulates both neonatal seizure susceptibility and CLP290- mediated KCC2 functional enhancement. Our findings therefore validate KCC2 as a clinically relevant target for refractory neonatal seizures and provide insights for future drug development.

AB  - Background and Aims Social norms and legality surrounding the use of medical and recreational cannabis are changing rapidly. The prevalence of cannabis use in adolescence is increasing. The aim of this study was to assess any sex-based neurobiological effects of chronically inhaled, vaporised cannabis on adolescent female and male mice. Methods Female and male mice were exposed daily to vaporised cannabis (10.3% Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and 0.05% cannabidiol [CBD]) or placebo from postnatal day 23 to day 51. Following cessation of treatment, mice were examined for changes in brain structure and function using noninvasive multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Data from voxel-based morphometry, diffusion weighted imaging and rest state functional connectivity were registered to and analysed with a 3D mouse atlas with 139 brain areas. Following imaging, mice were tested for their preference for a novel object. Results The effects were sexually dimorphic with females showing a unique distribution and inverse correlation between measures of fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient localised to the forebrain and hindbrain. In contrast males displayed significant increased functional coupling with the thalamus, hypothalamus and brainstem reticular activating system as compared with controls. Cannabis males also presented with altered hippocampal coupling and deficits in cognitive function. Conclusion Chronic exposure to inhaled vaporised cannabis had significant effects on brain structure and function in early adulthood corroborating much of the literature. Females presented with changes in grey matter microarchitecture, while males showed altered functional connectivity in hippocampal circuitry and deficits in object recognition.

AB  - Ischemic brain injury is a widespread pathological condition, the main components of which are a deficiency of oxygen and energy substrates. In recent years, a number of new forms of cell death, including necroptosis, have been described. In necroptosis, a cascade of interactions between the kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3 and the MLKL protein leads to the formation of a specialized death complex called the necrosome, which triggers MLKL-mediated destruction of the cell membrane and necroptotic cell death. Necroptosis probably plays an important role in the development of ischemia/reperfusion injury and can be considered as a potential target for finding methods to correct the disruption of neural networks in ischemic damage. In the present study, we demonstrated that blockade of RIPK1 kinase by Necrostatin-1 preserved the viability of cells in primary hippocampal cultures in an in vitro model of glucose deprivation. The effect of RIPK1 blockade on the bioelectrical and metabolic calcium activity of neuron-glial networks in vitro using calcium imaging and multi-electrode arrays was assessed for the first time. RIPK1 blockade was shown to partially preserve both calcium and bioelectric activity of neuron-glial networks under ischemic factors. However, it should be noted that RIPK1 blockade does not preserve the network parameters of the collective calcium dynamics of neuron-glial networks, despite the maintenance of network bioelectrical activity (the number of bursts and the number of spikes in the bursts). To confirm the data obtained in vitro, we studied the effect of RIPK1 blockade on the resistance of small laboratory animals to in vivo modeling of hypoxia and cerebral ischemia. The use of Necrostatin-1 increases the survival rate of C57BL mice in modeling both acute hypobaric hypoxia and ischemic brain damage.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have garnered significant attention in the field of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's diseases due to their covalently closed loop structure. However, the involvement of circRNAs in postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is still largely unexplored. To identify the genes differentially expressed between non-POCD (NPOCD) and POCD mice, we conducted the whole transcriptome sequencing initially in this study. According to the expression profiles, we observed that circAKT3 was associated with hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in POCD mice. Moreover, we found that circAKT3 overexpression reduced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and alleviated POCD. Subsequently, through bioinformatics analysis, our data showed that circAKT3 overexpression in vitro and in vivo elevated the abundance of miR-106a-5p significantly, resulting in a decrease of HDAC4 protein and an increase of MEF2C protein. Additionally, this effect of circAKT3 was blocked by miR-106a-5p inhibitor. Interestingly, MEF2C could activate the transcription of miR-106a-5p promoter and form a positive feedback loop. Therefore, our findings revealed more potential modulation ways between circRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA, providing different directions and targets for preclinical studies of POCD.

AB  - Microtubule-associated protein tau is a central factor in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. However, the physiological functions of tau are unclear. Here, we used proximity-labelling proteomics to chart tau interactomes in primary neurons and mouse brains in vivo. Tau interactors map onto pathways of cytoskeletal, synaptic vesicle and postsynaptic receptor regulation and show significant enrichment for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and prion disease. We find that tau interacts with and dose-dependently reduces the activity of N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF), a vesicular ATPase essential for AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) trafficking. Tau-deficient (tau(-/-)) neurons showed mislocalised expression of NSF and enhanced synaptic AMPAR surface levels, reversible through the expression of human tau or inhibition of NSF. Consequently, enhanced AMPAR-mediated associative and object recognition memory in tau(-/-) mice is suppressed by both hippocampal tau and infusion with an NSF-inhibiting peptide. Pathologic mutant tau from mouse models or Alzheimer's disease significantly enhances NSF inhibition. Our results map neuronal tau interactomes and delineate a functional link of tau with NSF in plasticity-associated AMPAR-trafficking and memory.

AB  - The paper is focused on the epoxidation of methyl esters prepared from oil crops with various profiles of higher fatty acids, especially unsaturated, which are mainly contained in the non-edible linseed and Camelina sativa oil (second generation). The novelty consists in the separation and identification of all products with oxirane ring formed through a reaction and in the determination of time course. Through the epoxidation, many intermediates and final products were formed, i.e., epoxides with different number and/or different position of oxirane rings in carbon chain. For the determination, three main methods (infrared spectroscopy, high-pressure liquid chromatography and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry) were applied. Only gas chromatography enables the separation of individual epoxides, which were identified on the base of the mass spectra, molecule ion and time course of products. The determination of intermediates enables: (i) control of the epoxidation process, (ii) determination of the mixture of epoxides in detail and so the calculation of selectivity of each product. Therefore, the epoxidation will be more environmentally friendly especially for advanced applications of non-edible oil crops containing high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids.

AB  - Aging impairs cognitive function, whereas nutritional intervention can delay aging and age-related diseases. Lycopene (LYC), a naturally occurring carotenoid, posses multiple health-promoting properties, including neuroprotective function. Here, the effects of LYC on memory and behavioral deficits induced by D-galactose (D-gal) treatment and the relative contribution of LYC-derived gut microbiota in these process were investigated. Results demonstrated that LYC showed effective protection on D-gal induced cognitive deficit and neuronal damage. Moreover, LYC treatment has beneficial effects on gut barrier damage, microbiota dysbiosis and levels of SCFAs in D-gal-induced subacute aging mice. Next, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was performed and increased SCFAs were observed in mice received stools from D-gal +LYC group when compared with D-gal-FMT group. Thus, we added SCFAs treatment served as a control group in order to evaluated whether the alterations of gut-brain axis could be attributed to LYC-reshaped gut microbiota and SCFAs. Results showed that recipient mice received SCFAs and stools from D-gal +LYC group have similar beneficial effects in improving gut and brain function, demonstrated as: improved intestinal health via elevating antioxidant enzymes contents, increasing the expressions of tight junctions proteins and protecting gut barrier, enhanced mice working memory capacity via alleviating hippocampal neurons impairment, improving synaptic function and enhancing mitochondrial function in the intestinal pseudo-aseptic mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that LYC-derived microbiome played a pivotal role in the regulation of cognitive functions during aging and enhanced SCFAs formation might be an important signaling molecule connecting gut microbiome and brain.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an incurable and debilitating progressive, neurodegenerative disorder which is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Neuropathologically, AD is characterized by the accumulation of A beta amyloid plaques in the microenvironment of brain cells and neurovascular walls, chronic neuroinflammation, resulting in neuronal and synaptic loss, myelin and axonal failure, as well as significant reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The hippocampal formation is particularly vulnerable to this degenerative process, due to early dysfunction of the cholinergic circuit. Neurotrophic factors consist major regulatory molecules and their decline in AD is considered as an important cause of disease onset and progression. Novel pharmacological approaches are targeting the downstream pathways controlled by neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors, TrkA and p75NTR, which enhance hippocampal neurogenic capacity and neuroprotective mechanisms, and potentially counteract the neurotoxic effects of amyloid deposition. BNN27 is a non-toxic, newly developed 17-spiro-steroid analog, penetrating the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and mimicking the neuroprotective effects of NGF, acting as selective activator of its receptors, both TrkA and p75NTR, thus promoting survival of various neuronal cell types. Our present research aims at determining whether and which aspects of the AD-related pathology, BNN27 is able to alleviate, exploring the cellular and molecular AD components and link these changes with improvements in the cognitive performance of an animal AD model, the 5xFAD mice. Our results clearly indicate that BNN27 administration significantly reduced amyloid-beta load in whole brain of the animals, enhanced adult hippocampal neurogenesis, restored cholinergic function and synaptogenesis, reducing inflammatory activation and leading to significant restoration of cognitive functions. BNN27 may represent a new lead multimodal molecule with neuroprotective, neurogenic and anti-neuroinflammatory actions for developing druggable anti-Alzheimeric agents.

AB  - PurposeThe risk of brain exposure to ionizing radiation increases gradually due to the extensive application of nuclear technology in medical, industrial, and aerospace fields. Radiation-induced brain injury (RBI) is highly likely to cause a wide range of neurological complications, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression. Ginkgolide B (GB) is one of the effective active components extracted from ginkgo biloba leaves, exerts protective effects on CNS, which is involved in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. MST1, as one of the core kinases of the Hippo pathway, participated in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, it remains unclear whether GB attenuates radiation brain injury (RBI) and whether the radioprotective effect of GB refers to MST1 signaling. Hence, our study aimed to explore the radiation protection effect and the potential mechanism of GB.Materials and methodsC57BL/6 mice were stimulated with an X-ray (20 Gy) to establish an RBI model. Then, morris water maze test (MWM) and step-down passive avoidance test (SDPAT) were used to assess the learning and memory function of mice. The open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were used to assess changes in locomotor activity and hopelessness. Besides, X-ray-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells were used to verify the radioprotective effect of GB. Immunofluorescence double staining, Dihydroethidium (DHE), western blot, and flow cytometry were used to explore the role of DCC/MST1 signaling in RBI.ResultsIn this study, X-ray-treated mice exhibited cognitive impairment and depression-like behavior, which was ameliorated by GB treatment. GB also reduced the ROS production and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus. Moreover, GB increased the protein levels of p-AKT and Bcl2, while decreased the protein levels of MST1, p-p38, p-JNK, cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, exogenous Netrin-1 alleviated X-ray-induced ROS production and apoptosis, whereas knockout of Netrin-1 receptor DCC abolished the protective effect of GB.ConclusionOxidative stress and MST1-mediated neuronal apoptosis participated in radiation-induced cognitive impairment and depression-like behaviors, and modulation of DCC by GB was an effective intervention against RBI.

AB  - Recent pharmacological studies indicated that the modulation of tripartite-synaptic transmission plays important roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, mood disorders and adverse reactions. Therefore, to explore the mechanisms underlying the clinical and adverse reactions to atypical antipsychotics, the present study determined the effects of the sub-chronic administration of quetiapine (QTP: 3 similar to 30 mu M) on the protein expression of 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R), connexin43 (Cx43), cAMP level and intracellular signalling, Akt, Erk and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cultured astrocytes and the rat hypothalamus, using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry and capillary immunoblotting systems. QTP biphasically increased physiological ripple-burst evoked astroglial D-serine release in a concentration-dependent manner, peaking at 10 mu M. QTP enhanced the astroglial signalling of Erk concentration-dependently, whereas both Akt and AMPK signalling's were biphasically enhanced by QTP, peaking at 10 mu M and 3 mu M, respectively. QTP downregulated astroglial 5-HT7R in the plasma membrane concentration-dependently. Protein expression of Cx43 in astroglial cytosol and intracellular cAMP levels were decreased and increased by QTP also biphasically, peaking at 3 mu M. The dose-dependent effects of QTP on the protein expression of 5-HT7R and Cx43, AMPK signalling and intracellular cAMP levels in the hypothalamus were similar to those in astrocytes. These results suggest several complicated pharmacological features of QTP. A therapeutically relevant concentration/dose of QTP activates Akt, Erk and AMPK signalling, whereas a higher concentration/dose of QTP suppresses AMPK signalling via its low-affinity 5-HT7R inverse agonistic action. Therefore, 5-HT7R inverse agonistic action probably plays important roles in the prevention of a part of adverse reactions of QTP, such as weight gain and metabolic complications.

AB  - Background: The calcium/calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling cascade is crucial for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Hypothyroidism impairs hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in adult rats, which can be prevented by simple replacement therapy with L-thyroxine (thyroxine, T4) treatment. In this study, we compared animal models of hypothyroidism induced by thyroidectomy and treatment with propylthiouracil (PTU) in terms of synaptic plasticity and the effect on underlying molecular mechanisms of spatial and non-spatial types of memory.Methods: Hypothyroidism was induced using thyroidectomy or treatment with propylthiouracil (PTU). L-thyroxin was used as replacement therapy. Synaptic plasticity was evaluated using in vivo electrophysiological recording. Training in the radial arm water maze (RAWM), where rats had to locate a hidden platform, generated spatial and non-spatial learning and memory. Western blotting measured signaling molecules in the hippocampal area CA1 area.Results: Our findings show that thyroidectomy and PTU models are equally effective, as indicated by the identical plasma levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4. The two models produced an identical degree of inhibition of synaptic plasticity as indicated by depression of long-term potentiation (LTP). For non-spatial memory, rats were trained to swim to a visible platform in an open swim field. Analysis of hippocampal area CA1 revealed that training, on both mazes, of control and thyroxine-treated hypothyroid rats, produced significant increases in the P-calcium calmodulin kinase II (P-CaMKII), protein kinase-C (PKC?), calcineurin and calmodulin protein levels, but the training failed to induce such increases in untreated thyroidectomized rats.Conclusion: Thyroxine therapy prevented the deleterious effects of hypothyroidism at the molecular level.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be caused by amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation in the central nervous system due to deficient clearance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ganoderic acid A (GAA) on A beta clearance in microglia and its anti-AD activity. A beta degradation in BV2 microglial cells was determined using an intracellular A beta clearance assay. GAA stimulated autophagosome formation via the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (Axl)/RAC/CDC42-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) pathway was determined by Western blot analyses, and fluorescence-labeled A beta 42 was localized in lysosomes in confocal laser microscopy images. The in vivo anti-AD activity of GAA was evaluated by object recognition and Morris water maze (MWM) tests in an AD mouse model following intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated A beta 42. The autophagy level in the hippocampus was assayed by immunohistochemical assessment against microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light-chain 3B (LC3B). Intracellular A beta 42 levels were significantly reduced by GAA treatment in microglial cells. Additionally, GAA activated autophagy according to increased LC3B-II levels, with this increased autophagy stimulated by upregulating Axl and Pak1 phosphorylation. The effect of eliminating A beta by GAA through autophagy was reversed by R428, an Axl inhibitor, or IPA-3, a Pak1 inhibitor. Consistent with the cell-based assay, GAA ameliorated cognitive deficiency and reduced A beta 42 levels in an AD mouse model. Furthermore, LC3B expression in the hippocampus was up-regulated by GAA treatment, with these GAA-specific effects abolished by R428. GAA promoted A beta clearance by enhancing autophagy via the Axl/Pak1 signaling pathway in microglial cells and ameliorated cognitive deficiency in an AD mouse model.

AB  - The intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of amyloid peptides (A beta) models Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mice, as typified by the onset within 15 days of deficits of memory and of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) that are prevented by the blockade of adenosine A(2)A receptors (A(2)AR). Since A2AR overfunction is sufficient to trigger memory deficits, we tested if A(2)AR were upregulated in hippocampal synapses before the onset of memory deficits to support the hypothesis that A(2)AR overfunction could be a trigger of AD. Six to eight days after A fi-icv injection, mice displayed no alterations of hippocampal dependent memory; however, they presented an increased excitability of hippocampal synapses, a slight increase in LTP magnitude in Schaffer fiber-CA1 pyramid synapses and an increased density of A(2)AR in hippocampal synapses. A(2)AR blockade with SCH58261 (50 nM) normalized excitability and LTP in hippocampal slices from mice sacrificed 7-8 days after A beta-icv injection. Fifteen days after A fi-icv injection, mice displayed evident deficits of hippocampaldependent memory deterioration, with reduced hippocampal CA1 LTP but no hyperexcitability and a sustained increase in synaptic A(2)AR, which blockade restored LTP magnitude. This shows that the upregulation of synaptic A(2)AR precedes the onset of deterioration of memory and of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, supporting the hypothesis that the overfunction of synaptic A2AR could be a trigger of memory deterioration in AD.

AB  - The purpose of our study is to determine the protective effects of mitophagy enhancers against mutant APP and amyloid beta (A beta)-induced mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities in Alzheimer's disease (ad). Over two decades of research from our lab and others revealed that mitochondrial abnormalities are largely involved in the pathogenesis of both early-onset and late-onset ad. Emerging studies from our lab and others revealed that impaired clearance of dead or dying mitochondria is an early event in the disease process. Based on these changes, it has been proposed that mitophagy enhancers are potential therapeutic candidates to treat patients with ad. In the current study, we optimized doses of mitophagy enhancers urolithin A, actinonin, tomatidine, nicotinamide riboside in immortalized mouse primary hippocampal (HT22) neurons. We transfected HT22 cells with mutant APP cDNA and treated with mitophagy enhancers and assessed mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, mitophagy and synaptic genes, cell survival; assessed mitochondrial respiration in mAPP-HT22 cells treated and untreated with mitophagy enhancers. We also assessed mitochondrial morphology in mAPP-HT22 cells treated and untreated with mitophagy enhancers. Mutant APP-HT22 cells showed increased fission, decreased fusion, synaptic & mitophagy genes, reduced cell survival and defective mitochondrial respiration, and excessively fragmented and reduced length of mitochondria. However, these events were reversed in mitophagy-enhancers-treated mutant mAPP-HT22 cells. Cell survival was significantly increased, mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial fusion, synaptic and mitophagy genes were increased, mitochondrial number is reduced, and mitochondrial length is increased, and mitochondrial fragmentation is reduced in mitophagy-enhancers-treated mutant APP-HT22 cells. Further, urolithin A showed strongest protective effects against mutant APP and A beta-induced mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities in ad. Based on these findings, we cautiously propose that mitophagy enhancers are promising therapeutic drugs to treat mitophagy in patients with ad.

AB  - Introduction: Neurosteroids have a variety of neurological functions, such as neurite growth, neuroprotection, myelination, and neurogenesis. P450scc, encoded by CYP11A1 gene, is the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. In this study, we examine the dendritic morphology in developing hippocampal neurons of Cyp11a1 null mice at P15, a critical period for synapse formation and maturation. Methods: Knockout mice were maintained until P15 with hormone administration. The Golgi-Cox method stained CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus to reveal dendritic morphology. Results: We demonstrated that Cyp11a1 null mice usually die within 7 days after birth and thus collected brain samples at postnatal day 5 (P5) for examination. There was significant shrinkage of dendrite size and diminishment of dendritic branching in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus of Cyp11a1 null mice, suggesting a developmental delay. We wonder if this delay may catch up later in life. Since the age of P15 is a critical period for synapse formation and maturation, the Cyp11a1 null mice were rescued by receiving hormone administration until P15 that the dendritic morphology in the developing hippocampal neurons could be examined. The results indicated that the total dendritic length, the number of dendritic branches, as well as dendritic arborization in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons are significantly decreased in P15 knockout mice when compared to the wild type. The spine densities were also significantly decreased. In addition, the Western blot analysis revealed decreased PSD-95 expression levels in the knockout mice compared to the wild type at P15. Conclusion: These results suggested that Cyp11a1 deficiency impairs the dendritic structures in the developing hippocampal pyramidal neurons.

AB  - Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), overexpressed in prostate cancer, is a promising target for diagnostics and therapy. However, the monoclonal antibodies in current use for PSMA targeting and inhibition have suboptimal activities due to their poor tissue and cell penetration and slow normal tissue clearance. Potentially superior alternatives are nanobodies (NBs), the single-chain variable domains of heavy-chain antibodies derived from camelids. The advantages of NBs include small size (similar to 15 kDa), ability to bind hidden epitopes, and rapid clearance. In contrast to most known PSMA inhibitors, which bind to the same catalytic site in PMSA, NBs can bind to different PSMA epitopes, facilitating heterovalent binding strategies that could enhance their therapeutic and diagnostic potential. The objective of this study was to map these binding epitopes and hence to acquire an atomic-resolution understanding of NB-PMSA binding by investigating the structural interactions between PSMA and three NBs (NB7, NB8, and NB37). Using cryo-electron microscopy to generate high-resolution structures of NB-PSMA complexes, we found that NB7 had the highest affinity for PSMA due to a larger interface and to stabilizing interactions, including salt bridges and pi-pi stacking. Notably, we also found that NB7 and NB8 can bind simultaneously to different PSMA epitopes without interfering with the function of PSMA (which is still not completely known), opening the way for the development of theranostic applications for prostate cancer treatment and imaging. Importantly, NB7 binds specifically to human PSMA but not to murine PSMA, due to key amino acid differences responsible for its species specificity.

AB  - The Shab family voltage-gated K+ channels (i.e., Kv2.1, Kv2.2) are widely expressed in mammalian brain and regulate neuronal action-potential firing. In addition to their canonical functions, the Kv2 proteins help establish direct attachments between plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), also known as ER-plasma membrane junctions. However, the biochemical properties and molecular organization of these ion channels have not yet been described in human neurons. Here, we have performed a systematic analysis of endogenous expression, post-translational modification, and subcellular distribution of the major components of Kv2 complex in neurons derived from human stem cells. We found that both Kv2.1, Kv2.2, and their auxiliary subunit AMIGO1 are significantly upregulated during early neurogenesis, localize at the cell surface, and already begin to assemble with each other. Human Kv2.1 and AMIGO1, but not Kv2.2, undergo substantial post-translational modification including phosphorylation and/or N-linked glycosylation. Acute pharmacological inhibition with Kv2 blockers also revealed their functional activation in human neurons. These proteins formed prominent clusters at cell bodies, dendritic branches, and axon initial segments. Interestingly, a large fraction of them also exhibited considerable accumulation at human presynaptic terminals, where they aggregated with the local ER network. This synaptic localization of Kv2 subunits was primarily restricted to presynaptic regions, as they demonstrated limited enrichment at postsynaptic densities. These results were highly reproducible in multiple stem cell lines used and alternative differentiation protocols tested, confirming that human presynaptic compartments can actively recruit the Shab family K+ ion channels.

AB  - Plasticity-related gene (PRG) 5 is a vertebrate specific membrane protein, that belongs to the family of lipid-phosphate phosphatases (LPPs). It is prominently expressed in neurons and is involved in cellular processes such as growth-cone guidance and spine formation. At a functional level, PRG5 induces filopodia in non-neuronal cell lines, as well as the formation of plasma membrane protrusions in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of PRG5 in immature neurons leads to the induction of spine-like structures, and regulates spine density and morphology in mature neurons. Understanding spine formation is pivotal, as spine abnormalities are associated with numerous neurological disorders. Although the importance of PRG5 in neuronal function is evident, the precise mechanisms as to how exactly it induces membrane protrusions and orchestrates cellular processes remain unresolved. Here we used in vitro biochemical assays to demonstrate that in HEK293T cells a large fraction of PRG5 can be found in homo dimers and lager multimers. By using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) to quantify F & ouml;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), we were able to visualize and quantify the specific localization of PRG5 multimers in living HEK293T cells and in fixed immature primary hippocampal neurons. Here, we provide the first evidence that PRG5 multimers are specifically localized in non-neuronal filopodia, as well as in neuronal spine-like structures. Our findings indicate a potential functional role for PRG5 multimerization, which might be required for interaction with extracellular matrix molecules or for maintaining the stability of membrane protrusions.

TI  - Expression analyses of Rich2/Arhgap44, a Rho family GTPase-activating protein, during mouse brain development
T2  - DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE

KW  - RAC1
AB  - Rho family small GTPases, such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, play essential roles during brain development, through regulating cellular signaling and actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Rich2/Arhgap44, a Rac- and Cdc42-specific GTPase-activating protein, has been reported to be a key regulator for dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function. Given the essential roles of Rac and Cdc42 in brain development, Rich2 is supposed to take part in brain development. However, not only the molecular mechanism involved, but also the expression profile of Rich2 during neurodevelopment has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we carried out expression analyses of Rich2 by focusing on mouse brain development. In immunoblotting, Rich2 exhibited a tissue-dependent expression profile in the young adult mouse, and the expression was increased during brain development. In immunohistochemical analyses, Rich2 was observed in the cytoplasm of cortical neurons at postnatal day (P) 0, and then came to be enriched in the nucleus with moderate distribution in neuropils at P7. Later at P30, complex immunostaining pattern of Rich2 was observed; Rich2 was distributed in the nucleus, cytoplasm and neuropils in many cortical neurons whereas other neurons frequently displayed little expression. In the hippocampus at P7, Rich2 was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm of excitatory neurons in the cornu ammonis regions while it was moderately detected in the nucleus in the dentate granule cells. Notably, Rich2 was distributed in excitatory synapses of the cornu ammonis 1 region at P30. Biochemical fractionation analyses also detected Rich2 in the postsynaptic density. Taken together, Rich2 is found to be expressed in the central nervous system in a developmental stage-dependent manner, and may be involved in synapse formation/maintenance in cortical neurons.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Gancao Xiexin decoction (GCXXD), comprising Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Makino, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Panax ginseng C.A.Mey. , Coptis chinensis Franch. , Ziziphus jujuba Mill. , represents a traditional Chinese medicinal formulation utilized for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Nevertheless, the potential mechanism behind GCXXD treatment for UC is not yet fully elucidated. Aim of the study: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal system distinguished by intestinal barrier destruction. Previous studies have indicated that excessive ferroptosis activation in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can worsen damage and focal permeability abnormalities in the colon. One of the main mechanisms of ferroptosis is lipid peroxides, which are dependent on long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids. Recent research findings have provided evidence that GCXXD significantly reduces the symptoms of ulcerative colitis (UC) by preserving the intestinal mucosal barrier. So, we aim to demonstrate that the pharmacological mechanism of GCXXD is related to ferroptosis mediated by ACSL4 in this research. Materials and methods: In this investigation, we evaluated the GSE134025 datasets and established an experimental colitis model caused by DSS and treated with a 20 mg/kg ACSL4 inhibitor (rosiglitazone). Colon pathological alterations and Alcian blue staining were used to confirm ACSL4 inhibition as a possible therapy for UC. We then examined illness symptoms, intestinal mucosa repair, and ferroptosis markers in UC mice after treated with GCXXD (9,12,15 g/kg). Transcriptome study of colon tissues revealed more about the underlying mechanism of GCXXD in the treatment of UC. Finally, we co-administered the ACSL4 upstream agonist with GCXXD in the treatment of UC to show that GCXXD reduced inflammation in UC by modifying ACSL4-induced ferroptosis. Results: Through GSE134025 dataset analysis, we discovered that ACSL4 was substantially expressed in UC patients and that its inhibitors successfully reduced the clinical signs and symptoms of UC colon. Furthermore, we found that GCXXD improved colon length and body weight while increasing the expression of mucin, occuldin, and Claudin-1. It also lowered colon inflammatory cell infiltration and levels of IL-1(3 and TNF-alpha. In the meantime, GCXXD efficiently decreased ferroptosis-related indicators in colitis mice, such as MDA, Fe2+, COX2, and ACSL4, while also upregulated GPX4 expression. Using KEGG analysis of the genes that were differently expressed between the 3% DSS and GCXXD treatment group, we were able to discover important connections between the hippo signaling pathway, Arachidonic acid metabolism with GCXXD treatment. Due to the fact that TEAD4 functions as an upstream transcription factor for ACSL4, we combined GCXXD and Py-60, a YAP agonist in the treatment of UC. It was worth noting that GCXXD's inhibitory effect of on intestinal mucosa damage and ferroptosis was lessened when the ACSL4 upstream pathway was activated. Conclusion: Gancao Xiexin decoction attenuated ferroptosis in UC which might through TEAD4/ACSL4 pathway.

AB  - Presenilin 1 (PS1) is a transmembrane proteolytic subunit of gamma-secretase that cleaves amyloid precursor proteins. Mutations in PS1 (mPS1) are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). The link between mutated PS1, mitochondrial calcium regulation, and AD has been studied extensively in different test systems. Despite the wide-ranging role of mPS1 in AD, there is a paucity of information on the link between PS1 and neuronal cell death, a hallmark of AD. In the present study, we employed the selective mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and compared the reactivity of mPS1-transfected cultured rat hippocampal neurons with PS1 and control neurons in a situation of impaired mitochondrial functions. CCCP causes a slow rise in cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium in all three groups of neurons, with the mPS1 neurons demonstrating a faster rise. Consequently, mPS1 neurons were depolarized by CCCP and measured with TMRM, a mitochondrial voltage indicator, more than the other two groups. Morphologically, CCCP produced more filopodia in mPS1 neurons than in the other two groups, which were similarly affected by the drug. Finally, mPS1 transfected neurons tended to die from prolonged exposure to CCCP sooner than the other groups, indicating an increase in vulnerability associated with a lower ability to regulate excess cytosolic calcium.

AB  - The marsupial Monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides) utilizes both daily and seasonal bouts of torpor to preserve energy and prolong survival during periods of cold and unpredictable food availability. Torpor involves changes in cellular metabolism, including specific changes to gene expression that is coordinated in part, by the posttranscriptional gene silencing activity of microRNAs (miRNA). Previously, differential miRNA expression has been identified in D. gliroides liver and skeletal muscle; however, miRNAs in the heart of Monito del monte remained unstudied. In this study, the expression of 82 miRNAs was assessed in the hearts of active and torpid D. gliroides, finding that 14 were significantly differentially expressed during torpor. These 14 miRNAs were then used in bioinformatic analyses to identify Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that were predicted to be most affected by these differentially expressed miRNAs. Overexpressed miRNAs were predicted to primarily regulate glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, along with various signaling pathways such as Phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B and transforming growth factor-beta. Similarly, signaling pathways including phosphatidylinositol and Hippo were predicted to be regulated by the underexpression of miRNAs during torpor. Together, these results suggest potential molecular adaptations that protect against irreversible tissue damage and enable continued cardiac and vascular function despite hypothermia and limited organ perfusion during torpor.

AB  - BackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) induced diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DACD) that seriously affects the self-management of T2DM patients, is currently one of the most severe T2DM-associated complications, but the mechanistic basis remains unclear. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, whose function refers to a broad spectrum of features such as mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy and so on. Mitochondrial abnormalities have emerged as key determinants for cognitive function, the relationship between DACD and mitochondria is not well understood.MethodsHere, we explored the underlying mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction of T2DM mice and HT22 cells treated with high glucose/palmitic acid (HG/Pal) focusing on the mitochondrial fission-mitophagy axis with drug injection, western blotting, Immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. We further explored the potential role of caveolin-1 (cav-1) in T2DM induced mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic alteration through viral transduction.ResultsAs previously reported, T2DM condition significantly prompted hippocampal mitochondrial fission, whereas mitophagy was blocked rather than increasing, which was accompanied by dysfunctional mitochondria and impaired neuronal function. By contrast, Mdivi-1 (mitochondrial division inhibitor) and urolithin A (mitophagy activator) ameliorated mitochondrial and neuronal function and thereafter lead to cognitive improvement by inhibiting excessive mitochondrial fission and giving rise to mitophagy, respectively. We have previously shown that cav-1 can significantly improve DACD by inhibiting ferroptosis. Here, we further demonstrated that cav-1 could not only inhibit mitochondrial fission via the interaction with GSK3 beta to modulate Drp1 pathway, but also rescue mitophagy through interacting with AMPK to activate PINK1/Parkin and ULK1-dependent signlings.ConclusionsOverall, our data for the first time point to a mitochondrial fission-mitophagy axis as a driver of neuronal dysfunction in a phenotype that was exaggerated by T2DM, and the protective role of cav-1 in DACD.Graphical AbstractGraphic Summary Illustration. In T2DM, excessive mitochondrial fission and impaired mitophagy conspire to an altered mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial dysfunction, with a consequent neuronal damage, overall suggesting an unbalanced mitochondrial fission-mitophagy axis. Upon cav-1 overexpression, GSK3 beta and AMPK are phosphorylated respectively to activate Drp1 and mitophagy-related pathways (PINK1 and ULKI), ultimately inhibits mitochondrial fission and enhances mitophagy. In the meantime, the mitochondrial morphology and neuronal function are rescued, indicating the protective role of cav-1 on mitochondrial fission-mitophagy axis.4fVNd5UMHP9GEmZKs4s8VHVideo AbstractGraphical AbstractGraphic Summary Illustration.

AB  - G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) is a novel type of estrogen receptor. Several studies have shown that it has an anti-inflammatory action,which plays an important role in remyelination and cognitive ability adjustment. However, whether it is involved in the development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is still unknown. The present study established a TLE model by intraperitoneal injection of lithium chloride (3 mmol/kg) and pilocarpine (50 mg/kg) in rats to study the effect of GPER1 in the synaptic plasticity during the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. A microinjection cannula was implanted into the lateral ventricle region of rats via a stereotaxic instrument. G-1 is the specific GPER1 agonist and G15 is the specific GPER1 antagonist. The G1 or G15 and Dimethyl sulfoxide were injected into the rat brains in the intervention groups and control group, respectively. After G1 intervention, the learning and memory abilities and hippocampal neuron damage in epileptic rats were significantly improved, while G15 weakened the neuroprotective effect of GPER1. Meanwhile, G1 controlled the abnormal formation of hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting caused by seizures, and participated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity by reducing the expression of Synapsin I and increasing the expression of gephyrin. Inhibitory synapse gephyrin may play a significant role in synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Simple Summary Type 2 diabetes can lead to catastrophic complications, including neurodegeneration and memory impairment. Therefore, it is essential to identify effective therapeutic strategies to improve blood glucose levels and prevent the onset of complications. This study evidently showcases environmental enrichment as an effective therapy for preserving mental health in diet-induced type 2 diabetic rats. The outcomes of this study can be translated to clinical trials in diabetic patients. Environmental enrichment can be introduced as one of the alternative therapies for preventing diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals and in established diabetes alongside metformin or other hypoglycemic pharmacotherapy. Background: The Western-style diet-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) may eventually trigger neurodegeneration and memory impairment. Thus, it is essential to identify effective therapeutic strategies to overcome T2D complications. This study aimed to investigate the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) and metformin interventions on metabolic dysfunctions, hippocampal neuronal death, and hippocampal-dependent memory impairments in high-fat/high-sucrose (HFS) diet-induced T2D rats. Methods: Thirty-two male rats (200-250 g) were divided into four groups: C group (standard diet + conventional cage); D group (HFS diet + conventional cage); DE group (HFS diet + EE cage/6hr daily); and DM group (HFS diet + metformin + conventional cage). Body weight was measured every week. T-maze tasks, anthropometric, biochemical, histological, and morphometric parameters were measured. The expression changes of hippocampal genes were also analyzed. Results: The anthropometric and biochemical parameters were improved in DE and DM groups compared with the D group. DE and DM groups had significantly higher T-maze percentages than the D group. These groups also had better histological and morphometric parameters than the D group. The interventions of EE and metformin enhanced the expression of hippocampal genes related to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (BDNF/TrkB binding, PI3K-Akt, Ras-MAPK, PLC gamma-Ca2+, and LTP). Conclusion: Environmental enrichment (EE) and metformin improved metabolic functions, hippocampal neuron survival, and hippocampal-dependent memory in HFS diet-induced T2D rats. The underlying mechanisms of these interventions involved the expression of genes that regulate neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: This study has important ethnopharmacological implications since it systematically investigated the therapeutic potential of Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. (Brahmi) in treating neurological disorders characterized by oxidative stress-a - a growing issue in the aging population. Bacopa monnieri, , which is strongly rooted in Ayurveda, has long been recognized for its neuroprotective and cognitive advantages. The study goes beyond conventional wisdom by delving into the molecular complexities of Bacopa monnieri, , particularly its active ingredient, Bacoside-A, in countering oxidative stress. The study adds to the ethnopharmacological foundation for using this herbal remedy in the context of neurodegenerative disorders by unravelling the scientific underpinnings of Bacopa monnieri's ' s effectiveness, particularly at the molecular level, against brain damage and related conditions influenced by oxidative stress. This dual approach, which bridges traditional wisdom and modern investigation, highlights Bacopa monnieri's ' s potential as a helpful natural remedy for oxidative stress-related neurological diseases. Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to investigate the detailed molecular mechanism of action (in in vitro, in silico and in vivo) ) of Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. methanolic extract and its active compound, Bacoside-A, against oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders. Materials and methods: ROS generation activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, calcium deposition and apoptosis were studied through DCFDA, Rhodamine-123, FURA-2 AM and AO/EtBr staining respectively. In silico study to check the effect of Bacoside-A on the Nrf-2 and Keap1 axis was performed through molecular docking study and validated experimentally through immunofluorescence co-localization study. In vivo antioxidant activity of Bacopa monnieri extract was assessed by screening the oxidative stress markers and stress- inducing hormone levels as well as through histopathological analysis of tissues. Results: The key outcome of this study is that the methanolic extract of Bacopa monnieri (BME) and its active component, Bacoside-A, protect against oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases. At 100 and 20 mu g/ml, BME and Bacoside-A respectively quenched ROS, preserved mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased calcium deposition, and inhibited HT-22 mouse hippocampus cell death. BME and Bacoside-A regulated the Keap1 and Nrf-2 axis and their downstream antioxidant enzyme-specific genes to modify cellular antioxidant machinery. In vivo experiments utilizing rats subjected to restrained stress indicated that pre-treatment with BME (50 mg/kg) downregulated oxidative stress markers and stress-inducing hormones, and histological staining demonstrated that BME protected the neuronal cells of the Cornu Ammonis (CA1) area in the hippocampus. Conclusions: Overall, the study suggests that Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. has significant potential as a natural remedy for neurodegenerative disorders, and its active compounds could be developed as new drugs for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases.

AB  - The accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta) protein, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by inducing neuronal cell injury. This study investigated the specific functions of ubiquitin-specific protease 1-associated factor 1 (UAF1) in mediating the neurotoxic effects triggered on A beta. To model AD-related neuronal injury in vitro and in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells exposed to A beta 25-35 and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were utilized. Compared with control mice, UAF1 levels were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of experimental mice. In vitro experiments showed that UAF1 knockdown reduced A beta-induced apoptosis and enhanced cell viability. Furthermore, UAF1 knockdown markedly suppressed A beta 25-35 -induced pyroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells and reduced the production of IL-1 beta and IL-18 through the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)/Gasdermin D pathway. Mechanistic analyses revealed that UAF1 directly binds to NLRP3 to mediate its effects. In vivo, UAF1 knockdown mitigated cognitive deficits, decreased APP expression, A beta plaque deposition, and reduced hyperphosphorylated Tau levels. These findings underscore the critical role of UAF1 in regulating neuronal apoptosis and pyroptosis, thereby highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic target for AD.

AB  - Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) may lead to the cognitive dysfunction, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. EGB761, extracted from Ginkgo biloba and as a phytomedicine widely used in the world, has been showed to have various neuroprotective roles and mechanisms, and therapeutic effects in Alzheimer?s disease and other cognitive dysfunctions. However, improvements in cognitive function after CCH, following treatment with EGB761, have not been ascertained yet. In this study, we used the behavior test, electrophysiology, neurobiochemistry, and immunohistochemistry to investigate the EGB761?s effect on CCH-induced cognitive dysfunction and identify its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that EGB761 ameliorates spatial cognitive dysfunction occurring after CCH. It may also improve impairment of the long-term potentiation, field excitable potential, synaptic transmission, and the transmission synchronization of neural circuit signals between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal CA1. EGB761 may also reverse the inhibition of neural activity and the degeneration of dendritic spines and synaptic structure after CCH; it also prevents the downregulation of synaptic proteins molecules and pathways related to the formation and stability of dendritic spines structures. EGB761 may inhibit axon demyelination and ameliorate the inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway after CCH to improve protein synthesis. In conclusion, EGB761 treatment after CCH may improve spatial cognitive function by ameliorating synaptic plasticity impairment, synapse degeneration, and axon demyelination by rectifying the inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - Background: In China, stroke is the primary cause of adult death and disability. Because of the increased rate of blood vessel reperfusion, it is important to prevent cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, in which glutamate (Glu) excitotoxicity plays a critical role. The most important Glu transporter, GLT-1, is essential for the regulation of Glu, which is dependent on Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA)-induced ion concentration gradient differences. EGCG, a substance found in tea polyphenols, can reduce infarct areas in ischemia-reperfusion models, reduce stroke incidence, and prolong life in which NKA is involved. Purpose: In this study, we investigated the potential of EGCG in protecting against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulating the interaction between NKA and GLT-1. Study design: This study was designed to investigate the protective effects of EGCG against cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury by modulating the interaction between NKA and GLT-1, utilizing both the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model and the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in co-cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and astrocytes. Methods: The neuronal survival rate was assessed using CCK8, and the cerebral infarction area and neurological function were determined by TTC staining and neurological deficit scores. NKA activity was measured using an inorganic phosphorous detection method, and NKA and GLT-1 expression was detected using western blotting. The interaction between NKA alpha 2 and GLT-1 was identified by co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) assay, laser confocal microscopy, and Imaris 3D confocal rendering technology. An adenovirus vector with overexpression of NKA alpha 2 was constructed, packaged, and injected into the rat lateral ventricle. Neurological function and the cerebral infarction area were identified, and the interaction between NKA alpha 2 and GLT-1 was identified using CoIP assay. Results: EGCG reduced the infarction area and neurological deficit scores, restored NKA activity, alleviated the decrease in membrane NKA alpha 2 and GLT-1 expression, and relieved the uncoupling of NKA alpha 2 and GLT-1 in the hippocampal CA1 after rat MCAO/R injury. By promoting the coupling of NKA alpha 2 and GLT-1 in rat MCAO/R models, overexpression of NKA alpha 2 reduced the cerebral infarction area and neurological impairment scores. Conclusion: EGCG improved cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by restoring NKA activity and increasing membrane GLT-1 expression due to NKA-GLT-1 interaction. For the first time, our findings demonstrate the critical role that NKA and GLT-1 colocalization plays in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion damage. Our findings provide new strategic directions for the pathogenesis and prevention of thrombolytic injury in the clinical treatment of stroke, while also serving as a basis for further development and utilization of EGCG.

AB  - Dopamine D3 receptors (D3Rs) modulate neuronal activity in several brain regions including the hippocampus. Although previous studies reported that blocking D3Rs exerts pro-cognitive effects, their involvement in hippocampal synaptic function and memory in the healthy and aged brain has not been thoroughly investigated. We demonstrated that in adult wild type (WT) mice, D3R pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion as in D3 knock out (KO) mice, converted the weak form of long-term potentiation (LTP1) into the stronger long-lasting LTP (LTP2) via the cAMP/PKA pathway, and allowed the formation of long-term memory. D3R effects were mainly mediated by post-synaptic mechanisms as their blockade enhanced basal synaptic transmission (BST), AMPAR-mediated currents, mEPSC amplitude, and the expression of the post-synaptic proteins PSD-95, phospho(p)GluA1 and p-CREB. Consistently, electron microscopy revealed a prevalent expression of D3Rs in post-synaptic dendrites. Interestingly, with age, D3Rs decreased in axon terminals while maintaining their levels in post-synaptic dendrites. Indeed, in aged WT mice, blocking D3Rs reversed the impairment of LTP, BST, memory, post-synaptic protein expression, and PSD length. Notably, aged D3-KO mice did not exhibit synaptic and memory deficits. In conclusion, we demonstrated the fundamental role of D3Rs in hippocampal synaptic function and memory, and their potential as a therapeutic target to counteract the age-related hippocampal cognitive decline.

AB  - Concerns about inappropriate disposal of waste into unsanitary municipal solid waste landfills around the world have been on the increase, and this poses a public health challenge due to leachate production. The neurotoxic effect of Gwagwalada landfill leachate (GLL) was investigated in male adult Wistar rats. Rats were exposed to a 10% concentration of GLL for 21 days. The control group received tap water for the same period of the experiment. Our results showed that neurobehavior, absolute body and brain weights and brain histomorphology as well as parvalbumin interneurons were severely altered, with consequent astrogliosis and microgliosis after 21 days of administrating GLL. Specifically, there was severe loss and shrinkage of Purkinje cells, with their nucleus, and severe diffused vacuolations of the white matter tract of GLL-exposed rat brains. There was severe cell loss in the granular layer of the cerebellum resulting in a reduced thickness of the layer. Also, there was severe loss of dendritic arborization of the Purkinje cells in GLL-exposed rat brains, and damage as well as reduced populations of parvalbumin-containing fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons in various regions of the brain. In conclusion, data from the present study demonstrated the detrimental effects of Gwagwalada landfill leachate on the brain which may be implicated in neuropsychological conditions.

AB  - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a significant neurological disorder that can result in severe motor and cognitive impairments. Neuronal regeneration and functional recovery are critical aspects of SCI treatment, with calcium signaling being a crucial indicator of neuronal excitability. In this study, we utilized a murine model to investigate the effects of targeted wireless electrical stimulation (ES) on neuronal activity following SCI. After establishing a complete SCI model in normal mice, flexible electrodes were implanted, and targeted wireless ES was administered to the injury site. We employed fiber-optic photometric in vivo calcium imaging to monitor calcium signals in pyramidal neurons within the CA3 region of the hippocampus and the M1 region of the primary motor cortex. The experimental results demonstrated a significant reduction in calcium signals in CA3 and M1 pyramidal neurons following SCI (reduced by 76 % and 59 %, in peak respectively). However, the application of targeted wireless ES led to a marked increase in calcium signals in these neurons (increased by 118 % and 69%, in peak respectively), indicating a recovery of calcium activity. These observations suggest that wireless ES has a positive modulatory effect on the excitability of pyramidal neurons post-SCI.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease and often occurs suddenly for no reason. Eucommiae folium (EF), an edible herb, can be used in the treatment of various kinds of brain diseases in clinic. From the perspective of safety and efficacy, EF is especially suitable for the treatment of chronic brain diseases. With the help of biolabels, this study was aimed to explore the value and feasibility of EF in the treatment of epilepsy. Proteomics and metabolomics were used to explore the biolabels of EF intervention in brain tissues. Bioinformatics was then applied to topologically analyze its neuroprotective effects and mechanisms and material basis based on biolabels, which were validated in an animal model. The biolabel-led research revealed that EF may exert the therapeutic potential to treat brain diseases through the interaction between multiple compounds and multiple targets, among which its therapeutic potential for epilepsy is particularly prominent. In the pentylenetetrazole-induction model, EF and four active compounds (oleamide, catechol, chlorogenic acid, and kaempferol) protected epileptic hippocampal neurons (Nissl and FJB staining) against mitochondrial dysfunction (MYH6, MYL3, and MYBPC3, etc.) and calcium overload (TNNI3, TNNC1, and TNNT2, etc.) through the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathway. This study provides new evidence and insights for the neuroprotective effects of EF, in which four active compounds may be potential drug candidates for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Simple Summary The overall goal of this study was to examine the role of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 signaling in the regulation of the early inflammatory process following global cerebral ischemia. The results of the study reveal that G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 signaling reduces pro-inflammatory signals and enhances anti-inflammatory signals in the brain at early timepoints after global cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, the study shows that brain-derived estrogen helps to mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 signaling. As a whole, the study demonstrates an important role and synergy of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 signaling and brain-derived estrogen in the control of early inflammatory events after global cerebral ischemia. An increased understanding of the early-stage regulation of inflammation after global cerebral ischemia could lead to new and improved therapies to protect the brain from ischemic damage and improve outcomes after global cerebral ischemia. Global cerebral ischemia can elicit rapid innate neuroprotective mechanisms that protect against delayed neuronal death. Brain-derived 17 beta-estradiol (BDE2), an endogenous neuroprotectant, is synthesized from testosterone by the enzyme aromatase (Aro) and is upregulated by brain ischemia and inflammation. Our recent study revealed that G1, a specific G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) agonist, exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic roles after global cerebral ischemia (GCI). Herein, we aimed to elucidate whether G1 modulates the early inflammatory process and the potential underlying mechanisms in the ovariectomized rat hippocampal CA1 region. G1 was found to markedly reduce pro-inflammatory (iNOS, MHCII, and CD68) and to enhance anti-inflammatory (CD206, Arginase 1, IL1RA, PPAR gamma, and BDNF) markers after 1 and 3 days of reperfusion after GCI. Intriguingly, the neuroprotection of G1 was blocked by the Aro inhibitor, letrozole. Conversely, the GPER antagonist, G36, inhibited Aro-BDE2 signaling and exacerbated neuronal damage. As a whole, this work demonstrates a novel anti-inflammatory role of GPER, involving a synergistic mediation with BDE2 during the early stage of GCI.

AB  - Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation play crucial roles in aging. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a popular supplement, is a potential antioxidant and candidate therapy for depression. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of SAM on D-galactose-induced brain aging and explore its underlying mechanisms. Brain aging model was established with D-galactose (180 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. During the last 4 weeks, SAM (16 mg/kg) was co-administrated with D-galactose. Behavior tests were used to assess cognitive function and depression-like behaviors of rats. Results showed that cognitive impairment and depression-like behaviors were reversed by SAM. SAM reduced neuronal cell loss, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor level in the hippocampus, inhibited amyloid-beta level and microglia activation, as well as pro-inflammatory factors levels in the hippocampus and serum. Further, SAM enhanced antioxidant capacity and attenuated cholinergic damage by reducing malondialdehyde levels, increasing acetylcholine levels, expression levels of alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChR), nuclear factor erythrocyte 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the hippocampus. Above all, SAM has a potential neuroprotective effect on ameliorating cognitive impairment in brain aging, which is related to inhibition of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, as well as alpha 7nAChR signals.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widely occurred neurodegenerative disease and Notch1/Hes1 pathway based neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and neurogenesis are very crucial to restore cognitive ability. Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc, a famous traditional Chinese herb remedy was widely used to tonify kidney and essence to ameliorate AD symptoms. Morroniside (MOR), a prominent bioactive component of Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc has demonstrated promising neuroprotective properties, while its function of neurogenesis to improve cognitive ability largely remains unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to reveal the role of MOR promoting neurogenesis and improving cognitive function via Notch1/Hes1 pathway thus to discover more neuropharmacological merit of MOR for AD treatment. Materials and methods: An AD model was induced in C57BL/6 mice by bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ). The mice were divided into control, model, low-dose, high-dose, DAPT + MOR, and donepezil groups. Cognitive functions were assessed using open field test, novel object recognition test, and Morris water maze (MWM). Histopathological changes were evaluated by Nissl and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Immunofluorescence double-labeling was performed to detect the expression of neurogenesis biomarkers in dentate gyrus. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were employed to measure the mRNA levels and Notch1, Hes1 expression. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations were performed to assess the binding affinity and stability between MOR and Notch1/Hes1 proteins. Proteomic analysis combined with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were integrated to verify the effects of MOR on including Notch1/Hes1 pathway for neurogenesis. Results: MOR (20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly improved cognitive function of ICV-STZ mice from the behavioral tests. Histological analysis showed that MOR enhanced neuronal survival in the hippocampus, improved cellular arrangement and structure, and reduced oxidative stress. Immunofluorescence results indicated that MOR promoted NSC proliferation and neurogenesis, as evidenced by the elevated number of BrdU/Nestin and DCX/Ki67 double-positive cells. Mechanistically, MOR upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of Notch1 and Hes1 in the hippocampus and increased the expression of downstream Cyclin D1 and CDK4. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further supported stable binding of MOR to Notch1 and Hes1. Proteomics combined with GO and KEGG enrichment further confirmed MOR (40 mg/kg, & lowast;P < 0.05) could significantly regulated multiple signaling pathways including Notch1 to ameliorate AD symptoms. Conclusion: This work demonstrated MOR could promote neural stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis by activating Notch1/Hes1 pathway, thereby enhancing learning and memory abilities in ICV-STZ mice. Such findings will further promote the clinical application of MOR for AD treatment.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent solid cancer worldwide and sorafenib is a common treatment. Nevertheless, sorafenib resistance is a severe clinical problem. In the present study, we identified that epigenetic regulator, KAT6A, was overexpressed in clinical HCC tissues and sorafenib-resistant HCC samples. The depletion of KAT6A repressed the cell viability and Edu-positive cell numbers of HCC cells. The IC50 value of sorafenib was increased in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. In addition, the expression of KAT6A was induced in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. The depletion of KAT6A suppressed the IC50 of sorafenib. Mechanically, YAP was decreased by the depletion of KAT6A. KAT6A was able to enrich in the promoter of YAP. The silencing of KAT6A reduced the enrichment of histone H3 lysine 23 acetylation (H3K23ac) and RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) on the promoter of YAP in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. KAT6A inhibitor WM-1119 repressed the cell proliferation of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells, while overexpression of KAT6A or YAP could reverse the effect in the cells. Meanwhile, the treatment of sorafenib inhibited the viability of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells, while the co-treatment of WM-1119 could improve the effect of sorafenib. Collectively, KAT6A was associated with sorafenib resistance and contributes to progression of HCC by targeting YAP. Targeting KAT6A may be served as a promising therapeutic approach for HCC.

AB  - Cholinergic crisis and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of the brain have been known to induce anxiety disorders upon ageing. BOTOX (R) is a widely used therapeutic form of botulinum neurotoxin that acts by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction. BOTOX (R) can migrate from the muscle to the brain through retrograde axonal transport and modulate neuroplasticity. While a mild dose of BOTOX (R) has been used to manage various neurological deficits and psychiatric complications including depression, the efficacy and experimental evidence for its anxiolytic effects and antioxidant properties remain limited. In this study, we have investigated the effect of BOTOX (R) on the innate anxiety-like behaviours in ageing mice upon exposure to different behavioural paradigms like open field test, elevated plus maze and light-dark box test, and estimated the enzymatic activities of key antioxidants in the hippocampus. Results revealed that animals injected with a mild intramuscular dosage of BOTOX (R) showed reduced level of innate anxiety-related symptoms and increased activities of hippocampal antioxidant enzymes compared to the control group. This study strongly supports that BOTOX (R) could be implemented to prevent or treat anxiety and hippocampal oxidative stress resulting from ageing, emotional and mood disorders.

AB  - The research was conducted to examine the neuroprotective effect of thymol and its precursor p-cymene on chronic immobility stress in adult male Wistar rats. The rats were subjected to 2.5 h of stress every day for 14 consecutive days by placing them inside a restrainer. Thymol (10 mg/kg) and p-cymene (50 mg/kg) were given to the rats during the same period. The results showed that thymol and p-cymene prevented the increase of MDA level, decline of GSH level, and decrease of SOD and GPx activity in the hippocampus of rats exposed to stress. These monoterpenes also prevented the increase in the expression of Tnfa, Il1b, Tlr4, and Nfkb, and the decrease in the expression of Nrf2, Ho1, and Bdnf. In addition, thymol and p-cymene inhibited the increase in the expression and activity of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampus of animals exposed to immobility and enhanced the expression of A7nachr. They also reduced neuronal death in the CA1 region of stressed animals and improved their performance in the Morris water maze and elevated plus maze tests. Based on these findings, thymol and p-cymene may be effective in preventing neurodegenerative diseases as they reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, strengthen ACh signaling, and stimulate Bdnf expression.

AB  - Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been studied for many years owing to its protective effect on the decline in brain function. DHA intake reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and decreases amyloid deposition; however, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been completed elucidated. In this study, the effect of DHA on the cognitive function of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 in wild-type mice and its related mechanism were investigated. Results from the Morris water maze test showed that DHA improved learning and memory function in mice. Moreover, DHA reduced neuronal damage in mice brains, as determined using Nissl staining. Unsaturated fatty acid levels in the brain of mice increased (p < 0.01) after DHA administration and saturated fatty acid levels decreased (p < 0.01). The deposition of amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques and tau protein neurofibrillary tangles was significantly inhibited. The mechanism of action of DHA was attributed to the upregulation of the expression of beta-secretase (BACE)2, which competed with BACE1 to cleave APP, thus decreasing the production of extracellular A beta fragments (p < 0.01). The expression level of insulin-degrading enzyme was not significantly different. The expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors was further downregulated and the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta and tau protein was inhibited (p < 0.01). These data indicated that DHA could protect cognitive function in mice by reducing A beta plaque formation and decreasing tau phosphorylation levels.

AB  - Depression is a debilitating mental disorder that affects >322 million people worldwide. Despite the availability of several antidepressant agents, many patients remain treatment refractory. A growing literature study has indicated the role of gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders. Herein, we examined the psychobiotic-like activity of multi- strain probiotic formulation in maternal separation (MS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) models of anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes in Sprague-Dawley rats. Early- and late-life stress was employed in both male and female rats by exposing them to MS and CUMS. The multi-strain probiotic formulation (Cognisol) containing Bacillus coagulans Unique IS-2, Lactobacillus plantarum UBLP-40, Lactobacillus rhamnosus UBLR-58, Bifidobacterium lactis UBBLa-70, Bifidobacterium breve UBBr-01, and Bifidobacterium infantis UBBI-01 at a total strength of 10 billion cfu along with L-glutamine was administered for 6 weeks via drinking water. Neurobehavioral assessment was done using the forced swim test (FST), sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated plus maze (EPM), and open field test (OFT). Animals were sacrificed after behavioral assessment, and blood, brain, and intestine samples were collected to analyze the levels of cytokines, metabolites, and neurotransmitters and histology. Animals exposed to stress showed increased passivity, consumed less sucrose solution, and minimally explored the open arms in the FST, SPT, and EPM, respectively. Administration of multi-strain probiotics along with L-glutamine for 6 weeks ameliorated the behavioral abnormalities. The locomotor activity of animals in the OFT and their body weight remained unchanged across the groups. Cognisol treatment reversed the decreased BDNF and serotonin levels and increased CRP, TNF-a, and dopamine levels in the hippocampus and/or frontal cortex. Administration of Cognisol also restored the plasma levels of L-tryptophan, L-kynurenine, kynurenic-acid, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid; the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroides ratio; the levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in fecal samples; the villi/ crypt ratio; and the goblet cell count, which manifested in the restoration of intestinal functions. We suggest that the multi-strain probiotic and glutamine formulation (Cognisol) ameliorated the MS + UCMS-generated anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes by reshaping the gut microbiome-brain activity in both sexes.

AB  - BackgroundGene expression and alternative splicing are strictly regulated processes that shape brain development and determine the cellular identity of differentiated neural cell populations. Despite the availability of multiple valuable datasets, many functional implications, especially those related to alternative splicing, remain poorly understood. Moreover, neuroscientists working primarily experimentally often lack the bioinformatics expertise required to process alternative splicing data and produce meaningful and interpretable results. Notably, re-analyzing publicly available datasets and integrating them with in-house data can provide substantial novel insights. However, such analyses necessitate developing harmonized data handling and processing pipelines which in turn require considerable computational resources and in-depth bioinformatics expertise.ResultsHere, we present Cortexa-a comprehensive web portal that incorporates RNA-sequencing datasets from the mouse cerebral cortex (longitudinal or cell-specific) and the hippocampus. Cortexa facilitates understandable visualization of the expression and alternative splicing patterns of individual genes. Our platform provides SplicePCA-a tool that allows users to integrate their alternative splicing dataset and compare it to cell-specific or developmental neocortical splicing patterns. All standardized gene expression and alternative splicing datasets can be downloaded for further in-depth downstream analysis without the need for extensive preprocessing.ConclusionsCortexa provides a robust and readily available resource for unraveling the complexity of gene expression and alternative splicing regulatory processes in the mouse brain.

AB  - The world population is aging rapidly, and chronic diseases associated are cardiometabolic syndrome, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Oxidative stress and inflammation are typical hallmarks in them. Poly-oxidovanadates (POVs) have shown interesting pharmacological actions against chronic diseases. This work aimed to evaluate the POV effect on hippocampal neuroinflammation, redox balance, and recognition memory in the aging of rats. Rats 18 months old were administered a daily dose of sodium metavanadate (MV), deca-vanadate (DV), Metformin (Metf), or MetfDeca for two months. Results showed that short-term and long-term recognition memory improved by 28 % and 16 % (DV), 19 % and 20 % (Metf), and 21 % and 27 % (Metf-Deca). In hippocampi, reactive oxygen species, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha, after DV, Metf, and MetfDeca decreased at similar concentrations to young adult control, while lipid peroxidation substantially ameliorated. Additionally, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity increased by 41 % and 42 % (DV), 39 % and 41 % (Metf), and 75 % and 73 % (MetfDeca). POV treatments reduced Nrf2 and GFAP immunoreactivity in CA1 (70-87.5 %), CA3 (60-80 %), and DG (57-89 %). Metformin treatment showed a minor effect, while MV treatment did not improve any parameters. Although DV, Metf, and MetfDeca treatments showed similar results, POVs doses were 16-fold fewer than Metformin. In conclusion, DV and MetfDeca could be pharmacological options to reduce age-related neuronal damage.

AB  - The incidence of endometrial cancer is increasing worldwide. One of the main causes of this cancer is a hormone imbalance; progesterone derivatives have been used for treatment. However, reports have shown that hypoxia plays important and possibly beneficial roles in endometrial function. Here, we show the effect of hypoxia on the proliferation of human endometrial adenocarcinoma Ishikawa cells. Hypoxia induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in Ishikawa cells. Overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) confirmed that HIF-1 alpha accelerates hypoxia-induced cell death. Treatment with dimethyloxalglycine, which stabilizes HIF-1 alpha, suppressed cell proliferation. KaplaneMeier analysis showed that the expression level of HIF-1 alpha has a significant positive effect on the survival rate of endometrial cancer patients. In our search for cellular targets involved in hypoxic apoptosis, we noticed that mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 2 (MST2), a member of the Hippo pathway, was positively correlated with HIF-1 alpha expression in 176 endometrial cancer patients extracted from the TCGA database. Hypoxia induced caspase-dependent MST2 cleavage. In addition, a MST2 inhibitor suppressed HIF-1 alpha-mediated reporter activity. These results suggest HIF-1 alpha and the Hippo signaling pathway are involved in endometrial cancer. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To elucidate the effects of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) on mice and the effects of sarpogrelate (S) on CVST, mice were randomly divided into the sham-operated group, CVST group, and CVST + S group (sarpogrelate). Neurological function was evaluated using the rotarod test, balance beam test, and open-field test. Moreover, laser speckle contrast imaging was employed to observe the blood flow in the cerebral cortex of mice, and immunofluorescence was used to quantify the neurons. In the neurofunctional assessment tests (i.e., rotarod test, balance beam test, and open-field test), the CVST group exhibited poorer performance compared to the sham-operated group. However, mice treated with sarpogrelate showed significantly better performance than the CVST group (P < 0.05). Moreover, a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow was observed in the CVST group compared to the sham-operated group (P < 0.01). In contrast, a significant increase in blood flow was observed in the CVST + S group compared to the CVST group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the number of neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice in the CVST group was lower than that in the sham group (P < 0.05), and the number of neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the CVST + S group was higher than that of the CVST group (P < 0.05). Sarpogrelate can increase blood flow in the cerebral cortex of mice with CVST, leading to decreased neuronal cell damage and improved neurological function.

AB  - CD70 is overexpressed in a variety of solid and hematological tumors and plays a role in tumor proliferation and evasion of immune surveillance. Targeting and blocking its binding to the receptor CD27 have the potential to treat CD70-dependent tumors. To generate novel CD70 blocking agents, we screen a human CD70-immunized camel VHH phage display library and isolate two blocking nanobodies against human CD70 targeting different epitopes. Upon enrichment by three rounds of biopanning, two strategies are employed to identify CD70 blockers. One named affinity selection is used for detecting clones with CD70 binding by conventional PE-ELISA. However, no clone with a blocking effect is obtained from 188 enriched clones by this method. The alternative strategy named competitive selection is based on the inhibiting capacity of CD70-CD27 binding by enriched VHHs. By this method, two clones, Nb-2B3 and Nb-3B6, with strong blocking capacity are obtained from 20 enriched VHHs, suggesting the efficiency of this strategy. Furthermore, Nb-2B3 and Nb-3B6 specifically bind to CD70-positive SKOV3 and Raji cells at low concentrations. Meanwhile, Nb-2B3 has no competitive effect on the binding of Nb-3B6 to CD70, and vice versa, indicating that they target two different epitopes on CD70. Our data show that nanobodies Nb-2B3 and Nb-3B6 are potential attractive theranostic agents for CD70-expressing cancers.

AB  - Intracellular amyloid beta oligomer (iA beta o) accumulation and neuronal hyperexcitability are two crucial events at early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, to date, no mechanism linking iA beta o with an increase in neuronal excitability has been reported. Here, the effects of human AD brain-derived (h-iA beta o) and synthetic (iA beta o) peptides on synaptic currents and action potential firing were investigated in hippocampal neurons. Starting from 500 pM, iA beta o rapidly increased the frequency of synaptic currents and higher concentrations potentiated the AMPA receptor-mediated current. Both effects were PKC-dependent. Parallel recordings of synaptic currents and nitric oxide (NO)-associated fluorescence showed that the increased frequency, related to pre-synaptic release, was dependent on a NO-mediated retrograde signaling. Moreover, increased synchronization in NO production was also observed in neurons neighboring those dialyzed with iA beta o, indicating that iA beta o can increase network excitability at a distance. Current-clamp recordings suggested that iA beta o increased neuronal excitability via AMPA-driven synaptic activity without altering membrane intrinsic properties. These results strongly indicate that iA beta o causes functional spreading of hyperexcitability through a synaptic-driven mechanism and offers an important neuropathological significance to intracellular species in the initial stages of AD, which include brain hyperexcitability and seizures.

AB  - Increasing evidence links chronic neurodegenerative diseases with neuroinflammation; it is known that neuroprotective agents are capable of modulating the inflammatory processes, that occur with the onset of neurodegeneration pathologies. Here, with the intention of providing a means for active compounds' screening, a dysregulation of neuronal inflammatory marker genes was induced and subjected to neuroprotective active principles, with the aim of selecting a set of inflammatory marker genes linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Considering the important role of microglia in neurodegeneration, a murine co-culture of hippocampal cells and inflamed microglia cells was set up. The evaluation of differentially expressed genes and subsequent in silico analysis showed the main dysregulated genes in both cells and the principal inflammatory processes involved in the model. Among the identified genes, a well-defined set was chosen, selecting those in which a role in human neurodegenerative progression in vivo was already defined in literature, matched with the rate of prediction derived from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of in vitro treatment-affected genes variation. The obtained panel of dysregulated target genes, including Cxcl9 (Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9), C4b (Complement Component 4B), Stc1 (Stanniocalcin 1), Abcb1a (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 1), Hp (Haptoglobin) and Adm (Adrenomedullin), can be considered an in vitro tool to select old and new active compounds directed to neuroinflammation.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment, affecting 35 million individuals worldwide. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of low to moderate doses of streptozotocin (STZ) in adult male Wistar rats can reproduce classical physiopathological hallmarks of AD. This biological model is known as ICV-STZ. Most studies are focused on the description of behavioral and morphological aspects of the ICV-STZ model. However, knowledge regarding the molecular aspects of the ICV-STZ model is still incipient. Therefore, this work is a first attempt to provide a wide proteome description of the ICV-STZ model based on mass spectrometry (MS). To achieve that, samples from the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) of the ICV-STZ model and control (wild-type) were used. Differential protein abundance, pathway, and network analysis were performed based on the protein identification and quantification of the samples. Our analysis revealed dysregulated biological pathways implicated in the early stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), based on differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Some of these DAPs had their mRNA expression further investigated through qRT-PCR. Our results shed light on the AD onset and demonstrate the ICV-STZ as a valid model for LOAD proteome description.

AB  - (1) The neurotrophic protein S100B is a marker of brain injury and has been associated with neuroregeneration. In S100Btg mice rendering 12 copies of the murine S100B gene we evaluated whether S100B may serve as a treatment option. (2) In juvenile, adult, and one-year-old S100Btg mice (female and male; n = 8 per group), progenitor cell proliferation was quantified in the subgranular zone (SGZ) and the granular cell layer (GCL) of the dentate gyrus with the proliferative marker Ki67 and BrdU (50 mg/kg). Concomitant signaling was quantified utilizing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) immunohistochemistry. (3) Progenitor cell proliferation in the SGZ and migration to the GCL was enhanced. Hippocampal GFAP was reduced in one-year-old S100Btg mice. ApoE in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of male and BDNF in the frontal cortex of female S100Btg mice was reduced. RAGE was not affected. (4) Enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis in S100Btg mice was not accompanied by reactive astrogliosis. Sex- and brain region-specific variations of ApoE and BDNF require further elucidations. Our data reinforce the importance of this S100Btg model in evaluating the role of S100B in neuroregenerative medicine.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the pathological aggregation of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide. A potential therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease is to enhance A beta degradation by increasing the activity of A beta-degrading enzymes, including neprilysin. The somatostatin (SST) peptide has been identified as an activator of neprilysin. Recently, we demonstrated the ability of a brain-penetrating SST peptide (SST-scFv8D3) to increase neprilysin activity and membrane-bound A beta 42 degradation in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing the A beta-precursor protein with the Swedish mutation (APPswe). Using LC-MS, we further evaluated the anti-Alzheimer's disease effects of SST-scFv8D3. Following a triple intravenous injection of SST-scFv8D3, the LC-MS analysis of the brain proteome revealed that the majority of downregulated proteins consisted of mitochondrial proteins regulating fatty acid oxidation, which are otherwise upregulated in APPswe mice compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, treatment with SST-scFv8D3 significantly increased hippocampal levels of synaptic proteins regulating cell membrane trafficking and neuronal development. Finally, hippocampal concentrations of growth-regulated a (KC/GRO) chemokine and degradation of neuropeptide-Y were elevated after SST-scFv8D3 treatment. In summary, our results demonstrate a multifaceted effect profile in regulating mitochondrial function and neurogenesis following treatment with SST-scFv8D3, further suggesting the development of Alzheimer's disease therapies based on SST peptides.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by excessive deposition of beta amyloid (A beta), hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and neuronal cell death. Recent studies have shown that myelin cell damage, which leads to cognitive dysfunction, occurs before AD-related pathological changes. Here, we examine the effect of icariin (ICA), a prenylated flavonol glycoside, in improving cognitive function in AD model mice. ICA has been reported to exhibit cardiovascular protective functions and antiaging effects. In this study, we used 3 x Tg-AD mice as an AD model. The Morris water maze and Y maze tests were performed to assess the learning and memory of the mice. Immunofluorescence analysis of A beta 1-42 deposition and myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in the mouse hippocampus was performed. Tau protein phosphorylation and MBP protein expression in the hippocampus were further analyzed by Western blotting. Myelin damage in the mouse optic nerve was evaluated by electron microscopy, and LFB staining was performed to assess myelin morphology in the mouse corpus callosum. MBP, Mpp5, and Egr2 transcript levels were quantified by qPCR. We observed that ICA treatment improved the learning and memory of 3 x Tg-AD mice and reduced A beta deposition and tau protein phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Moreover, this treatment protocol increased myelin-related gene expression and reduced myelin damage.

AB  - Propofol, a general intravenous anesthetic, has been demonstrated to cause a profound neuroapoptosis in the developing brain followed by long-term neurocognitive impairment. Our study aimed to examine the neuroprotective effect of neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4), an activity-dependent neuron-specific transcription factor, on propofol-induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells. The differentially expressed genes in HT22 cells after treatment with propofol were screened from Gene Expression Omnibus dataset GSE106799. NPAS4 expression in HT22 cells treated with different doses of propofol was investigated by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, caspase-3 activity, and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT, a LDH-Cytotoxicity Assay Kit, a Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay Kit, and TUNEL assay, respectively. The protein levels of LC3-I, LC3-II, Beclin 1, p62 and NPAS4 were detected using Western blot analysis. Propofol treatment concentration-dependently decreased NPAS4 expression in HT22 cells. Propofol treatment inhibited cell viability, increased LDH release and caspase-3 activity, and induced apoptosis and autophagy in HT22 cells. NPAS4 overexpression suppressed propofol-induced cell injury and autophagy in HT22 cells. Mechanistically, autophagy agonist rapamycin attenuated the neuroprotective effect of NPAS4 in propofol-treated HT22 cells. In conclusion, NAPS4 overexpression protected hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells against propofol-induced neurotoxicity by reducing autophagy.

AB  - Tropomyosin kinase receptor B (TrkB) has been explored as a therapeutic target for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the development of TrkB agonists was hindered by our poor understanding of the TrkB agonist binding location and affinity (both affect the regulation of disorder types). This motivated us to develop a combined computational and experimental approach to study TrkB binders. First, we developed a docking method to simulate the binding affinity of TrkB and binders identified by our magnetic drug screening platform from Gotu kola extracts. The Fred Docking scores from the docking computation showed strong agreement with the experimental results. Subsequently, using this screening platform, we identified a list of compounds from the NIH clinical collection library and applied the same docking studies. From the Fred Docking scores, we selected two compounds for TrkB activation tests. Interestingly, the ability of the compounds to increase dendritic arborization in hippocampal neurons matched well with the computational results. Finally, we performed a detailed binding analysis of the top candidates and compared them with the best-characterized TrkB agonist, 7,8-dyhydroxyflavon. The screening platform directly identifies TrkB binders, and the computational approach allows for the quick selection of top candidates with potential biological activities based on the docking scores.

AB  - Glycosidically bound linalool plays important roles in the formation of excellent tea flavor, while their enantiomeric distribution in teas and the actual transformations with free linalool are still unclear. In this study, a novel chiral ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry approach to directly analyze linalyl-beta-primeveroside and linalyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside enantiomers in teas was established and then applied in 30 tea samples. A close transformation relationship existed between the two states of linalool for their consistent dominant configurations (most S-form) and corresponding distribution trend in most teas (r up to 0.81). The acidolysis characterization indicated that free linalool might be slowly released from linalyl-beta-primeveroside with stable enantiomeric ratios during long-term withering of white tea in a weakly acidic environment, along with other isomerized products, e.g., geraniol, nerol, alpha-terpineol, etc. Furthermore, a novel online thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry approach was established to simulate the pyrolysis releasing of linalyl-beta-primeveroside during tea processing. Interestingly, free linalool was not the selected pyrolysis product of linalyl-beta-primeveroside but rather trans/cis-2,6-dimethyl-2,6-octadiene during the high-fire roasting or baking step of oolong and green teas. The identification of above high-fire chemical marks presented great potential to scientifically evaluate the proper thermal conditions in the practical production of tea.

AB  - Amyloid $ (A$) inhibits hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP; a form of synaptic plasticity thought to underly learning and memory) by inhibiting the stimulation-induced synaptic accumulation of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Notably, CaMKII inhibition rescues both CaMKII movement and LTP, indicating that CaMKII mediates both LTP and the A$-induced LTP impairment. Somewhat counterintuitively, we found here that overexpression of GFP-CaMKII also rescued the A$-induced impairment of CaMKII movement. For endogenous CaMKII, we confirmed that A$ indeed induced impairment of movement, and that previous results with live-imaging approaches were not due to A$-induced dissociation of the CaMKII intrabody. For exogenous GFP-CaMKII, the effect did not depend on the expression level and was thus likely caused by the N-terminal GFP label. Surprisingly, placing the GFP label instead at the C-terminus (near the association domain) still allowed CaMKII holoenzyme formation and still protected from the A$-induced impairment of CaMKII movement. Thus, while our method allows replacing endogenous CaMKII with similar amounts of GFP-CaMKII, our results provide a rare example for GFP-CaMKII not recapitulating the function of endogenous CaMKII.

AB  - The complex growth patterns of Camellia oleifera fruits in natural environments pose significant challenges for harvesting robots. Conventional solutions often rely on complex 3D point cloud processing to detect these growth patterns and enable robotic harvesting. In this study, a method for recognizing the growth patterns of Camellia oleifera fruits in 2D images is proposed. To address the challenges of precise posture detection, the fruits are categorized into five types based on their growth patterns: Front, Up, Down, Left, and Right. Occluded fruits are classified separately, and a dedicated dataset for posture recognition is created. Furthermore, a posture detection model, CO-YOLO, based on the YOLO11n architecture, is introduced. The Multi-scale Aggregation Attention (MMA) module replaces the original C3f2 module, enabling the fusion of feature information across multiple scales, which enhances the model's perceptual capabilities and improves posture recognition accuracy. Additionally, the Depth Pointwise Convolutional (DPW) module is introduced to replace standard convolutions in the backbone and neck networks, enabling better fusion of channel features, enhancing the representation of posture features in the target region, and reducing the number of parameters. Experimental results show that CO-YOLO achieves a precision of 90.6 %, a recall of 87.0 %, and an mAP@0.5 of 93.7 %. Compared to YOLO11s, CO-YOLO reduces model size and computational complexity by 77.1 % and 69.9 %, respectively, while improving mAP@0.5 by 4.8 %. Compared to YOLOv7-tiny, YOLOv9s, and YOLOv10s, CO-YOLO achieves increases in mAP@0.5 of 3.9 %, 5.6 %, and 5.5 %, respectively. Heatmaps generated by CO-YOLO and YOLO11n indicate that these enhancements significantly improve posture recognition. In summary, the CO-YOLO model exhibits strong performance and provides valuable insights for advancing fruit-picking robotics.

AB  - Transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) resulting from cardiac arrest causes selective neurodegeneration in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Although the effect is clear, the underlying mechanisms directing this process remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of Erk1/2 promotes cell survival in response to tGCI. DUSP6 (also named MKP3) serves as a cytosolic phosphatase that dephosphorylates Erk1/2, but the role of DUSP6 in tGCI has not been characterized. We found that DUSP6 was specifically induced in the cytoplasm of hippocampal CA1 neurons 4 to 24 h after tGCI. DUSP6-deficient mice showed normal spatial memory acquisition and retention in the Barnes maze. Impairment of spatial memory acquisition and retention after tGCI was attenuated in DUSP6-deficient mice. Neurodegeneration after tGCI, revealed by Fluoro-Jade C and H&E staining, was reduced in the hippocampus of DUSP6-deficient mice and DUSP6 deficiency enhanced the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Erk1/2 in the hippocampal CA1 region. These data support the role of DUSP6 as a negative regulator of Erk1/2 signaling and indicate the potential of DUSP6 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat neurodegeneration after tGCI.

AB  - Tissue-specific somatic stem cells are characterized by their ability to reside in a state of prolonged reversible cell cycle arrest, referred to as quiescence. Maintenance of a balance between cell quiescence and division is critical for tissue homeostasis at the cellular level and is dynamically regulated by numerous extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Analysis of the activation of quiescent stem cells has been challenging because of a lack of methods for direct detection of de novo dividing cells. Here, we present and experimentally verify a novel method based on double labeling with thymidine analogues to detect de novo dividing stem cells in situ. In a proof of concept for the method, we show that memantine, a drug widely used for Alzheimer's disease therapy and a known strong inducer of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, increases the recruitment into the division cycle of quiescent radial glia-like stem cells-primary precursors of the adult-born neurons in the hippocampus. Our method could be applied to assess the effects of aging, pathology, or drug treatments on the quiescent stem cells in stem cell compartments in developing and adult tissues.

AB  - Impaired activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAR) by D-serine is linked to cognitive aging. Whether this deregulation may be used to initiate pharmacological strategies has yet to be considered. To this end, we performed electrophysiological extracellular recordings at CA3/CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices from young and aged mice. We show that 0.1 nM of the soluble N-terminal recombinant fragment of the secreted amyloid-protein precursor-alpha (sAPP alpha) added in the bath significantly increased NMDAR activation in aged but not adult mice without impacting basal synaptic transmission. In addition, sAPP alpha rescued the age-related deficit of theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation. Significant NMDAR improvement occurred in adult mice when sAPP alpha was raised to 1 nM, and this effect was drastically reduced in transgenic mice deprived of D-serine through genetic deletion of the synthesizing enzyme serine racemase. Altogether, these results emphasize the interest to consider sAPP alpha treatment targeting D-serine-dependent NMDAR deregulation to alleviate cognitive aging.

AB  - Aerobic exercise effectively ameliorates mental disorders including anxiety and depression. Current findings mainly attribute its neural mechanism to the improvement of adult neurogenesis, while leaving the possible circuitry mechanism unclear. In the current study, we identify the overexcitation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to basolateral amygdala (BLA) pathway under chronic restraint stress (CRS), and 14-day treadmill exercise selectively reverses such abnormalities. Using chemogenetic approaches, we find that the mPFC-BLA circuit is necessary for preventing anxiety-like behaviors in CRS mice. These results collectively suggest a neural circuitry mechanism by which exercise training improves the resilience against environmental stress.
   Behavioural and chemogenic studies show that treadmill exercise exerts anxiolytic effects in a mouse model chronic restraint stress by inhibiting medial prefrontal cortex- basolateral amygdala circuits.

AB  - Exposure to lead (Pb) has harmful effects on the organs of both humans and animals, particularly the spleen. However, the precise mechanisms through which Pb (IV) exposure leads to spleen toxicity remain unclear. Hence, this study aimed to identify the key genes and signaling pathways involved in spleen toxicity caused by Pb (IV) incubation. We obtained the dataset GSE59925 from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which included spleen samples treated with lead tetraacetate (PbAc4) as well as control samples on the 1st and 5th day. Through differential expression analysis, we identified 607 and 704 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the spleens on the 1st and 5th day following PbAc4 treatment, respectively, with 245 overlapping DEGs between the two time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the commonly shared DEGs were primarily involved in signal transduction, drug response, cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. Pathway analysis indicated that the common DEGs were primarily associated with MAPK, TNF, cAMP, Hippo, and TGF-beta signaling pathways. Furthermore, we identified the hub genes such as CXCL10, PARP1, APOE, and VDR contributing to PbAc4-induced spleen toxicity. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Pb (IV) toxicity in the spleen.

AB  - The hippocampus contains a diverse array of inhibitory interneurons that gate information flow through local cortico-hippocampal circuits to regulate memory storage. Although most studies of interneurons have focused on their role in fast synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA release, different classes of interneurons express unique sets of neuropeptides, many of which have been shown to exert powerful effects on neuronal function and memory when applied pharmacologically. However, relatively little is known about whether and how release of endogenous neuropeptides from inhibitory cells contributes to their behavioral role in regulating memory formation. Here we report that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons participate in social memory storage by enhancing information transfer from hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons to CA2 pyramidal neurons. Notably, this action depends on release of the neuropeptide enkephalin from VIP neurons, causing long-term depression of feedforward inhibition onto CA2 pyramidal cells. Moreover, VIP neuron activity in the CA2 region is increased selectively during exploration of a novel conspecific. Our findings, thus, enhance our appreciation of how GABAergic neurons can regulate synaptic plasticity and mnemonic behavior by demonstrating that such actions can be mediated by release of a specific neuropeptide, rather than through classic fast inhibitory transmission.

AB  - Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a crucial signal in the neurogenic niche of the hippocampus, where it is involved in antidepressant action. Here, we utilized a new transgenic rat model (TetO-shTPH2), where brain 5-HT levels can be acutely altered based on doxycycline (Dox)-inducible shRNA-expression. On/off stimulations of 5-HT concentrations might uniquely mirror the clinical course of major depression (e.g., relapse after discontinuation of antidepressants) in humans. Specifically, we measured 5-HT levels, and 5-HT metabolite 5-HIAA, in various brain areas following acute tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) knockdown, and replenishment, and examined behavior and proliferation and survival of newly generated cells in the dentate gyrus. We found that decreased 5-HT levels in the prefrontal cortex and raphe nuclei, but not in the hippocampus of TetO-shTPH2 rats, lead to an enduring anxious phenotype. Surprisingly, the reduction in 5-HT synthesis is associated with increased numbers of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus. At 3 weeks of Tph2 replenishment, 5-HT levels return to baseline and survival of newly generated cells is unaffected. We speculate that the acutely induced decrease in 5-HT concentrations and increased neurogenesis might represent a compensatory mechanism.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) induced by anesthesia or surgery has become a common complication in the aged population. Sevoflurane, a clinical inhalation anesthetic, could stimulate calcium overload and necroptosis to POCD. In addition, necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) alleviated cognitive impairment caused by multiple causes, including postoperative cognitive impairment. However, whether Nec-1 exerts a neuroprotective effect on POCD via calcium and necroptosis remains unclear. We anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats with sevoflurane to construct the POCD model and to explore the mechanism underlying neuroprotective effects of Nec-1 in POCD. Rats were treated with Nec-1 (6.25 mg/kg) 1 h prior to anesthesia. Open field test and Morris water maze were employed to detect the cognitive function. In this study, rats exposed to sevoflurane displayed cognitive dysfunction without changes in spontaneous activity; however, the sevoflurane-induced POCD could be relieved by Nec-1 pretreatment. Nec-1 decreased sevoflurane-induced calcium overload and calpain activity in the hippocampus. In addition, Nec-1 alleviated the expression of p-RIPK1, RIPK1, p-RIPK3, RIPK3, p-MLKL and MLKL. Furthermore, Nec-1 remarkably increased BDNF and p-TrkB/TrkB expression in the hippocampus of aged rats. Ultimately, our research manifests evidence that Nec-1 may play a neuroprotective role against sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment via the increase of BDNF/TrkB and suppression of necroptosis-related pathway.

AB  - Hippocampal representations of space and time seem to share a common coding scheme characterized by neurons with bell-shaped tuning curves called place and time cells. The properties of the tuning curves are consistent with Weber's law, such that, in the absence of visual inputs, width scales with the peak time for time cells and with distance for place cells. Building on earlier computational work, we examined how neurons with such properties can emerge through self-supervised learning. We found that a network based on autoencoders can, given a particular inputs and connectivity constraints, produce scale-invariant time cells. When the animal's velocity modulates the decay rate of the leaky integrators, the same network gives rise to scale-invariant place cells. Importantly, this is not the case when velocity is fed as a direct input to the leaky integrators, implying that weight modulation by velocity might be critical for developing scale-invariant spatial receptive fields. Finally, we demonstrated that after training, scale-invariant place cells emerge in environments larger than those used during training. Taken together, these findings bring us closer to understanding the emergence of neurons with bell-shaped tuning curves in the hippocampus and highlight the critical role of velocity modulation in the formation of scale-invariant place cells.

AB  - Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been extensively studied as an approach to reduce proinflammatory markers in acute brain diseases, but the anti-neuroinflammatory role of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition has been rather neglected. We report that m-terphenylamine derivatives are selective COX-1 inhibitors, able to block microglia inflammatory response and elicit a neuroprotective effect. These compounds were synthesized via a three-component reaction of chalcones, beta-ketoesters, and primary amines, followed by hydrolysis/decarboxylation of the ester group. Together with their synthetic intermediates and some urea derivatives, they were studied as inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2. The m-terphenylamine derivatives, which were selective COX-1 inhibitors, were also analyzed for their ability to block microglia inflammatory and oxidative response. Compound 3b presented an interesting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective profile by reducing nitrite release, ROS overproduction, and cell death in organotypic hippocampal cultures subjected to LPS. We thus show that COX-1 inhibition is a promising approach to provide enhanced neuroprotection against acute inflammatory processes, which are crucial in the development of a plethora of acute neurodegenerative injuries.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key event in many pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative processes. When mitochondria are damaged, they release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate mito-inflammation. The present study assessed mito-inflammation after in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation as a representation of ischaemia, followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) of HT22 cells and modulation of the inflammatory response by melatonin. We observed that melatonin prevented mitochondrial structural damage and dysfunction caused by OGD/R. Melatonin reduced oxidative damage and preserved the enzymatic activity for complexes I, III and IV, encoded by mitochondrial DNA, which were reduced by OGD/R. No effect was observed on complex II activity encoded by nuclear DNA. The release of mtDNA into the cytosol was also prevented with a consequent reduction of the cGAS-STING pathway and IFN beta and IL-6 production. Interestingly, melatonin also increased the early release of the fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21), a mitokine secreted in response to mitochondrial stress. These data indicate that melatonin reduces mito-inflammation and modulates FGF-21 release, further highlighting the key role of this molecule in preserving mitochondrial integrity in OGD/R deprivation-type ischaemic brain injury.

AB  - Refined and deodorized camellia oil has been reported to contain a high amount of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol esters (3-MCPDE) due to the high-temperature deodorization step. To reduce 3-MCPDE in camellia oil, the physical refining process of camellia oil was simulated on a laboratory scale. Response surface methodology (RSM) was designed to modify and optimize the refining process with five processing parameters (water degumming dosage, degumming temperature, activated clay dosage, deodorization temperature and deodorization time). The optimized new refining approach achieved a 76.9% reduction in 3-MCPDE contents, in which the degumming moisture was 2.97%, the degumming temperature was 50.5 degrees C, the activated clay dosage was 2.69%, the deodorizing temperature was 230 degrees C, and the deodorizing time was 90 min. A significance test and analysis of variance results demonstrated that the deodorization temperature and deodorization time contributed significantly to the reduction of 3-MCPD ester. The joint interaction effects of activated clay dosage and deodorization temperature were significant for 3-MCPD ester formation.

AB  - Lysosomal dysfunction is a pathogenic link that may explain the causal relationship between diabetes and Alzheimer disease; however, there is no information about the regulation of hyperglycemia in neuronal lysophagy modulating lysosomal function. We examined the effect and related mechanisms of action of high glucose on lysophagy impairment and subsequent A beta accumulation in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons, mouse hippocampal neurons, and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. High-glucose induced neuronal lysosomal dysfunction through reactive oxygen species-mediated lysosomal membrane permeabilization and lysophagy impairment. Among lysophagy-related factors, the expression of TRIM16 (tripartite motif containing 16) was reduced in high-glucose-treated neuronal cells and the diabetic hippocampus through MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) complex 1 (MTORC1)-mediated inhibition of TFEB (transcription factor EB) activity. TRIM16 overexpression recovered lysophagy through the recruitment of MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3), SQSTM1/p62, and ubiquitin to damaged lysosomes, which inhibited the high-glucose-induced accumulation of A beta and p-MAPT/tau. In the diabetic mice model, TFEB enhancer recovered lysophagy in the hippocampus, resulting in the amelioration of cognitive impairment. In conclusion, TRIM16-mediated lysophagy is a promising candidate for the inhibition of diabetes-associated Alzheimer disease pathogenesis.

AB  - The function of medial entorhinal cortex layer II (MECII) excitatory neurons has been recently explored. MECII dysfunction underlies deficits in spatial navigation and working memory. MECII neurons comprise two major excitatory neuronal populations, pyramidal island and stellate ocean cells, in addition to the inhibitory interneurons. Ocean cells express reelin and surround clusters of island cells that lack reelin expression. The influence of reelin expression by ocean cells and interneurons on theirown morphological differentiation and that of MECII island cells has remained unknown. To address this, we used a conditional reelin knockout (Reln cKO ) mouse to induce reelin deficiency postnatally in vitro and in vivo . Reelin deficiency caused dendritic hypertrophy of ocean cells, interneurons and only proximal dendritic compartments of island cells. Ca 2+ recording showed that both cell types exhibited an elevation of calcium frequencies in Reln cKO , indicating that the hypertrophic effect is related to excessive Ca 2+ signalling. Moreover, pharmacological receptor blockade in Reln cKO mouse revealed malfunctioning of GABA B , NMDA and AMPA receptors. Collectively, this study emphasizes the significance of reelin in neuronal growth, and its absence results in dendrite hypertrophy of MECII neurons.

AB  - Propagation of human naive pluripotent stem cells (nPSCs) relies on the inhibition of MEK/ERK signalling. However, MEK/ERK inhibition also promotes differentiation into trophectoderm (TE). Therefore, robust self-renewal requires suppression of TE fate. Tankyrase inhibition using XAV939 has been shown to stabilise human nPSCs and is implicated in TE suppression. Here, we dissect the mechanism of this effect. Tankyrase inhibition is known to block canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. However, we show that nPSCs depleted of beta-catenin remain dependent on XAV939. Rather than inhibiting Wnt, we found that XAV939 prevents TE induction by reducing activation of YAP, a co-factor of TE-inducing TEAD transcription factors. Tankyrase inhibition stabilises angiomotin, which limits nuclear accumulation of YAP. Upon deletion of angiomotin-family members AMOT and AMOTL2, nuclear YAP increases and XAV939 fails to prevent TE induction. Expression of constitutively active YAP similarly precipitates TE differentiation. Conversely, nPSCs lacking YAP1 or its paralog TAZ (WWTR1) resist TE differentiation and self-renewal efficiently without XAV939. These findings explain the distinct requirement for tankyrase inhibition in human but not in mouse nPSCs and highlight the pivotal role of YAP activity in human naive pluripotency and TE differentiation.

AB  - Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), a serine hydrolase with significant role in the hydrolysis of endocannabinoids, is a promising therapeutic target for peripheral and central nervous system related disorders, including pain, neuroinflammation and depression. Employing a structure-based approach, a novel series of indole-2-carbonyl piperazine urea derivatives were designed and synthesized as FAAH inhibitors for the treatment of pain-depression comorbidity. Among them, compound 4i emerged as the most potent inhibitor (IC50 = 0.12 mu M) with fine selectivity versus CES2, ABHD6, MAGL and the cannabinoid receptor, which also displayed superior metabolic stability in human liver microsome and an adequate pharmacokinetic profile in rodents. Treatment of depressed rats with 4i demonstrated favorable antidepressant-like effects not only by increasing the level of BDNF in the hippocampus but also by restraining the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Also, 4i effectively suppressed the LPS-induced neuroinflammation in vitro. Moreover, 4i exhibited potent analgesic activity, which indicated its promising therapeutical application for pain and depression. These meaningful results shed light on FAAH inhibitors as promising pain-depression comorbidity therapeutics.

AB  - Sevoflurane could stimulate neurotoxicity and result in postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in the regulation of nervous system disease. This study was performed to investigate role and mechanism of lncRNA Rian (RNA imprinted and accumulated in nucleus) in sevoflurane anesthesia-induced cognitive dysfunction. Mice post-sevoflurane anesthesia showed cognitive impairments and neuronal damage and apoptosis. However, intracerebroventricularly injection with Adenovirus (Ad) for the over-expression of Rian ameliorated sevoflurane-induced neuronal damage and apoptosis. Cognitive impairments induced by sevoflurane were attenuated by injection with Ad-Rian. Moreover, transfection with Ad-Rian also protected isolated primary hippocampal neurons against sevoflurane-induced decrease of cell viability and increase of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and apoptosis. Mechanistically, Rian bind to miR-143-3p, and decreased expression of LIMK1 (Lim kinase 1) through negative regulation of miR-143-3p. Knockdown of LIMK1 aggravated sevoflurane-induced decrease of cell viability and increase of LDH and apoptosis in neurons, while over-expression attenuated LIMK1 silence-induced neuronal damage post-sevoflurane anesthesia. In conclusion, Rian demonstrated neuroprotective effects against sevoflurane anesthesia-induced cognitive dysfunction through regulation of miR-143-3p/LIMK1 axis, providing promising target for sevoflurane anesthesia-induced cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - A growing number of evidence suggests that altered microRNA network in the brain contributes to the risk of Alzheimer's disease(AD). Dicer1 is a type III riboendonuclease which cleaves pre-microRNA into functional microRNA. Reduction of Dicer1 or Dicer1 mutation has been involved in cancer, aging or age-related macular degeneration. Recently, we found a possible link between Dicer1 and AD. In particular, Dicer1 protein and Dicer1 mRNA is reduced in the hippocampus and the cortex of an animal model of AD and exposure to A1342 oligomer (A13O) longer than 6 h reduces the transcription of Dicer1 gene in neuron, via depletion of NF-E2-related factor-2. In this study, exposure to A13O at shorter time increased Dicer1 protein in neuron in a dose-dependent mode; but the mRNA level remained unaltered. Under this treatment regime,A13O reduced phosphorylation level of Dicer1 and of its binding partner, transactivation response element RNA-binding protein(TRBP). Addition of a JNK inhibitor,SP600125, or an ERK inhibitor,U0126, further increased Dicer1 protein compared to A13o treatment alone, with simultaneaous reduction of phospho-Dicer1, but with different effects on phospho-TRBP. Finally, an inhibitor of calcineurin,FK506, further increased Dicer1 protein compared to A13o treatment alone. Thus, phosphorylation of Dicer1 and TRBP was determined by mitogen activated protein kinases JNK,ERK, and protein phosphatase 2B(calcineurin) which together determined Dicer1 stability. In summary, reduced phosphorylation of Dicer1 accounted for the rapid induction of Dicer1 by A13O. This study highlights a novel way by which A13O regulates Dicer1.

AB  - Cholinergic signaling plays a crucial role in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis; however, the mechanisms by which acetylcholine mediates neurogenic effects are not completely understood. Here, we report the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype M4 (M4 mAChR) on a subpopulation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the adult mouse hippocampus, and demonstrate that its pharmacological stimulation promotes their proliferation, thereby enhancing the production of new neurons in vivo. Using a targeted ablation approach, we also show that medial septum (MS) and the diagonal band of Broca (DBB) cholinergic neurons support both the survival and morphological maturation of adult-born neurons in the mouse hippocampus. Although the systemic administration of an M4selective allosteric potentiator fails to fully rescue the MS/DBB cholinergic lesion-induced decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis, it further exacerbates the impairment in the morphological maturation of adult-born neurons. Collectively, these findings reveal stage-specific roles of M4 mAChRs in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis, uncoupling their positive role in enhancing the production of new neurons from the M4-induced inhibition of their morphological maturation, at least in the context of cholinergic signaling dysfunction.

AB  - Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a commonly used plasticizer, has been demonstrated to possess reproductive toxicity; however, the precise mechanisms underlying this effect have yet to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms by which prepubertal DEHP exposure impairs testicular development and to provide possible therapeutic targets. We exposed BALB/c male mice from postnatal days 22-35 to different doses of DEHP (0, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day) and utilized lipid metabolomics and other methods to elucidate the reproductive damage caused by DEHP from a multidimensional tissue-cell-molecule perspective. Our findings indicate that DEHP exposure induces ferroptosis in testicular tissue by remodeling membrane lipid structure, in which the imbalance of phospholipid-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PL-PUFA) and phospholipid-monounsaturated fatty acids (PL-MUFA) playing a crucial role. DEHP exposure altered the expression of ACSL4 and MBOAT2 via HIPPO and androgen receptor pathways, thereby impacting PL-PUFA/PL-MUFA synthesis. In conclusion, this study highlights a link between DEHP-induced reproductive damage and lipid metabolism reprogramming, suggesting new targets for preventing DEHP-induced reproductive toxicity.

AB  - Presently there has been a growing interest in the development of dietary-based interventions as alternative therapies to combat chronic neurological conditions like epilepsy. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are composed of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone and have shown several beneficial effects in various neurological diseases. The present study investigated MCT supplementation's impact on seizure severity and associated neurobehavioral comorbidities in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) mouse kindling model. Mice were administered 35 mg/kg (i.p.) of PTZ every other day for kindling induction. The kindled mice were then subjected to MCT supplementation for over 25 days with seizure scoring at every 5th day following PTZ exposure. Behavioral analysis was initiated at the end of 25 days of the MCT supplementation. After that, lipid peroxidation assay, and, gene and protein expression studies were performed in the isolated hippocampus. MCT significantly decreased seizure severity scores compared to control. The treatment reduced immobility duration in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, indicating a reversal of seizures-associated depression-like behavior. A significant reduction in the percentage of spontaneous alternation was observed in the kindled control group in the T-maze test, which remained unchanged following MCT supplementation in the treated group. Furthermore, no change was observed in the locomotion and anxiety index of the kindled mice supplemented with MCT compared to the control group. In addition, the supplementation attenuated the altered hippocampal lipid peroxidation, and mRNA and protein levels of mTOR and Gsk-3 beta. The study concluded that MCT supplementation suppresses epileptic seizures and associated depression-like behavior in kindled mice via interacting mTOR and Gsk-3 beta signaling.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a subject that requires critical solutions in neuroscience and oncology. However, its potential mechanism of action remains ambiguous. The aim of this study was to investigate the vital role of HuR in the neuroprotection of cyclosporin A (CsA) during methotrexate (MTX)-induced cognitive impairment. A series of Hu-antigen R (HuR) gain and loss experiments were used to examine cyclosporin A (CsA)-mediated translocation of HuR's ability to improve MTX-induced cognitive impairment through NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in vitro and in vivo. Obtained results show that the administration of CsA alleviated MTX-induced cognitive impairment in mice. The presence of MTX promoted the shuttling of HuR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, whereas treatment with CsA increased cytoplasmic HuR expression levels and the levels of ferritinophagy-related proteins, such as NCOA4 and LC3II, compared to the MTX group. However, applying KH-3, an inhibitor of HuR, reversed CsA's impact on the expression of ferritinophagy-related proteins in the hippocampus and in vitro. Also, treatment with CsA attenuated microglial activation by altering Iba-1 expression and decreased TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels in mice hippocampi. Moreover, KH-3 neutralized CsA's effects on the expression of both Iba-1 and HuR in vivo and in vitro. In summary, CsA was confirmed to have a neuroprotective role in CICI. Its possible underlying mechanisms may be involved in the translocation of HuR. Mediating the translocation of HuR during CICI could mitigate neruoinflammation and neuronal apoptosis via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy and, thus, alleviate cognitive impairment in mice with CICI.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication of the central nervous system after surgery, especially in elderly patients. Many factors can influence POCD, one of which is white matter lesion. Nowadays, stellate ganglion block (SGB) is considered as an effective intervention for postoperative cognitive dysfunction and SIRT1 may play a role in that, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms that SGB improves postoperative cognitive dysfunction through SIRT1 in aged rats and its association with white matter lesion are yet to be elucidated. The role of SIRT1 in the process that stellate ganglion block improves the cognitive impairment, and its association with white matter lesion was investigated using splenectomy-induced POCD model. To investigate this result further, we performed transection of the cervical sympathetic trunk on the basis of POCD model, and the role of SIRT1 was then verified again by intraperitoneal injection of EX527 (5 mg/kg) five min before surgery. Data show that SGB treatment has neuroprotective effects in POCD rats. SGB treatment can ameliorate cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis in white matter. Moreover, SGB treatment enhanced the expression of SIRT1 in the hippocampus and white matter, decreased NF-kappa B activity in the hippocampus and white matter. It also increased the levels of inflammatory factor in serum and white matter, primarily at the level of anti-inflammatory factor. These findings indicated that SIRT1-mediate white matter repair could be a new therapeutic target for neurodegenerative illnesses.

AB  - Graptophyllum grandulosum (G. grandulosum) is a plant of the Acanthaceae family found in the Littoral region of Cameroon. This plant is traditionally used by the local population for its various medicinal properties. G. grandulosum contains multiple bioactive compounds such as chrysoeriol and luteolin. This study aimed to evaluate the preventive effect of the aqueous extract of G. grandulosum on nicotine-induced addiction. 42 Wistar pubescent adolescent male rats were used during this experiment. Nicotine addiction was induced following a 5 days injections of nicotine tartrate (0.4 mg/kg, sc). The behavioural assessment was done using the Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) test and the Elevated plus maze (EPM) test. 24 h following the last nicotine administration, animals were evaluated for preference change in the CPP and 1 h following this test, animals were submitted to the EMP. The animals were sacrificed; the hippocampus and striatum were collected for biochemicals assays (dopamine, acetylcholine, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and proinflammatory cytokines). The acute toxicity of G. grandulosum was also performed. G. grandulosum prevented CPP preference change (p < 0.001) induced by nicotine injection and reduced hyperactivity and risk taking (p < 0.001) in the EPM test. G. grandulosum reduced dopamine levels (p < 0.001) and increased acetylcholine levels (p < 0.01). Additionally, G. grandulosum modulated BDNF levels (p < 0.001) and reduced proinflammatory cytokines (Interleukine-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha)) (p < 0.01). G. grandulosum did not present any sign of toxicity. These results suggest that G. grandulosum prevents addictive behavior via the modulation of dopaminergic, cholinergic, BDNF and neuroinflammatory pathways.

AB  - S100B, a homodimeric Ca2+-binding protein, is produced and secreted by astrocytes, and its extracellular levels have been used as a glial marker in brain damage and neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases; however, its mechanism of secretion is elusive. We used primary astrocyte cultures and calcium measurements from real-time fluorescence microscopy to investigate the role of intracellular calcium in S100B secretion. In addition, the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) effect on S100B was investigated in vitro and in vivo using Wistar rats. We found that DMSO, a widely used vehicle in biological assays, is a powerful S100B secretagogue, which caused a biphasic response of Ca2+ mobilization. Our data show that astroglial S100B secretion is triggered by the increase in intracellular Ca2+ and indicate that this increase is due to Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum. Also, blocking plasma membrane Ca2+ channels involved in the Ca2+ replenishment of internal stores decreased S100B secretion. The DMSO-induced S100B secretion was confirmed in vivo and in ex vivo hippocampal slices. Our data support a nonclassic vesicular export of S100B modulated by Ca2+, and the results might contribute to understanding the mechanism underlying the astroglial release of S100B.

AB  - Background: E2F5 is a transcription factor that is overexpressed in the early stages of ovarian cancer and has been suggested as a potential biomarker for early detection. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of E2F5 in invasion and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.
   Materials and Methods: We performed cell viability, colony formation, and invasion assays using ovarian cancer cells treated with siRNA to knock down the E2F5 gene. The regulatory effects of E2F5 on proteins involved in the apoptotic, Wnt, Hippo, and retinoblastoma signaling pathways were evaluated by western blotting following E2F5 repression. In addition, we analyzed data available on Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis for correlations between E2F5 and YAP, beta-catenin, cyclin D1, cdk4, and caspase-9.
   Results: E2F5 was highly expressed in ovarian cancer cell lines and samples when compared to the nonmalignant tissues. Downregulation of E2F5 inhibited cell viability and invasion and promoted the phosphorylation of YAP, GSK-3-beta, beta-catenin, and retinoblastoma. However, cyclin D1, cdk4, and caspase-9 were downregulated when compared to control.
   Conclusion: Overall, E2F5 promotes ovarian carcinogenesis via the regulation of Hippo and Wnt pathways.

AB  - A subset of octogenarians and older maintain normal cognitive function (CNOO) despite high prevalence and incidence of cognitive decline attributed to neurodegeneration or aging in the population. The rostral prefrontal cortex (rPFC) and hippocampal formation are brain regions integral to cognition, namely attention and memory, facilitated in part by cholinergic innervation. We hypothesized that preserved cholinergic neurotransmission in these regions contributes to intact cognition in the CNOO. To test this, we evaluated the burden of neuropathological and cholinesterase-associated protein aggregates in the rPFC and hippocampal formation. Tissues from age- and sex-matched CNOO and Alzheimer's disease (AD) rPFC and hippocampal formation were stained for beta-amyloid (A beta), tau, alpha-synuclein, phosphorylated TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The relative abundance of neuropathological aggregates was semiquantitatively scored. Deposition of A beta plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and pTDP-43 inclusions were comparable between CNOO and AD cases. Intraneuronal A beta and tau-positive thorny astrocytes consistent with aging-related tau astrogliopathy, were also noted in the rPFC. Abundance of BChE-positive plaque pathology was significantly higher in AD than in CNOO cases in most regions of interest, followed closely by abundance of AChE-positive plaque pathology. BChE and AChE activities were also associated with varied NFT morphologies. CNOO cases maintained cognition despite a high neuropathological burden in the rPFC and hippocampal formation. BChE-positive and, to a lesser extent, AChE-positive pathologies were significantly lower in most regions in the CNOO compared to AD. This suggests a specificity of cholinesterase-associated neuropathology with AD. We conclude that while CNOO have cholinesterase-associated neuropathology in the rPFC and hippocampal formation, abundance in this population is significantly lower compared to AD which may contribute to their intact cognition.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are linked to neuroinflammation, a key factor in hypertension, but their causal relationship is underexplored. This study aims to investigate whether hypertension is a risk factor for PND, identify related neuroinflammatory targets, and determine if the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) candesartan can improve cognitive function in PND mouse models by modulating these targets. This study identified hypertension as a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction (OR = 1.0767, P = 0.0057) through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Subsequently, bioinformatics techniques were employed to identify the neuroinflammatory targets associated with hypertension for ARBs. Differential analysis revealed Bdkrb1, Ccr1, and Thbs1 were PND biomarkers associated with hypertension, confirmed by machine learning and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (area under the curve (AUC) > 0.9). Immune infiltration showed Thbs1 positively correlated with MoDC cells (r = 0.70), while Bdkrb1 negatively correlated with Plasma cells (r = -0.75). In the PND mouse model, we assessed whether candesartan could inhibit the onset of neuroinflammation by modulating the targets identified through our screening process. Molecular experiments, including RT-qPCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and ELISA, analyzed gene expression and neuroinflammatory changes in the hippocampus. In a PND mouse model, candesartan improved cognitive function, reducing escape latency and increasing spontaneous alternation rates. Molecular analysis demonstrated candesartan downregulated Bdkrb1 and Ccr1 expression while upregulating Thbs1 in the hippocampus. Additionally, candesartan reduced IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha levels and microglial activation, highlighting its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in PND. In conclusion, candesartan improved cognitive function in PND mice by modulating Bdkrb1, Ccr1, and Thbs1, reducing neuroinflammation, and targeting hippocampal immune responses, highlighting its therapeutic potential for PND.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) play fundamental roles in stem/progenitor cell expansion during homeostasis, and their dysregulation often leads to tissue overgrowth. Here, we show that YAP activation is sufficient to overcome the restriction of global protein synthesis induced by serum starvation, enabling cells to sustain proliferation and survival despite an unfavorable environment. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ selectively promoted the mTORC1-dependent translation of mRNAs containing 5 terminal oligopyrimidine (5 ' TOP) motifs, ultimately increasing the cellular polysome content. Interestingly, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), a negative regulator of mTORC1, was upregulated by serum starvation but repressed by YAP/TAZ. DDIT4 was sufficient to suppress the translation and transformative potential of uveal melanoma cells, which are often serum unresponsive due to G protein mutations. Our findings reveal a vital role for protein synthesis as a key modality of YAP/TAZ-induced oncogenic transformation and indicate the potential for targeting mTORC1 or translation to treat YAP/TAZ-driven malignancies.

AB  - Since depression produces a long-term negative impact on quality of life, understanding the pathophysiological changes implicated in this disorder is urgent. There is growing evidence that demonstrates a key role for dysfunctional energy metabolism in driving the onset of depression; thus, bioenergetic alterations should be extensively studied. Brain metabolism is known to be a glucocorticoid-sensitive process, but the long-lasting consequences in adulthood following high levels of glucocorticoids at the early stages of life are unclear. We examined a possible association between brain energetic changes induced by synthetic glucocorticoid-dexamethasone treatment in the prenatal period and depressive-like behavior. The results show a reduction in the oxidative phosphorylation process, Krebs cycle impairment, and a weakening of the connection between the Krebs cycle and glycolysis in the frontal cortex of animals receiving dexamethasone, which leads to ATP reduction. These changes appear to be mainly due to decreased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase, impairment of lactate transport to neurons, and pyruvate to the mitochondria. Acute stress in adulthood only slightly modified the observed alterations in the frontal cortex, while in the case of the hippocampus, prenatal exposure to dexamethasone made this structure more sensitive to future adverse factors.

AB  - Cuproptosis is a form of programmed cell death dependent on mitochondrial respiration and is crucial in cancer treatment. The study attempted to screen cuproptosis-associated genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) and reveal regulatory pathways. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to screen the co-expression modules based on gene expression in CRC patients. The cuproptosis-associated genes were screened at the intersection of co-expression modules and cuproptosis gene data set. RNA sequencing was performed to assess the transcriptome changes, followed by functional enrichment analyses to reveal the potential pathways. Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) was knocked down in in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the effects of FDX1 knockdown on CRC progression and cuproptosis. FDX1 was found as a cuproptosis-associated gene and was highly expressed in CRC tumor and CRC cells. Knockdown of FDX1 regulated cuproptosis in CRC cells, and inhibited CRC cell growth, migration and invasion. We screened 1956 upregulated DEGs and 2201 downregulated DEGs in si-FDX1 cells, which were mainly enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway and Hippo signaling pathway. Knockdown of FDX1 inhibited CRC progression by increasing the levels of dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST), lipoic acid synthetase (LIAS) and phosphorylation Yes-associated protein (pYAP)/YAP, and downregulated transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ-binding domain (TAZ). The inhibitor of Hippo pathway GA-017 blocked this process. Knocking down FDX1 regulated cuproptosis and inhibited CRC progression by mediating the Hippo signaling pathway, which shed new insights into the development of biomarkers for CRC treatment.

AB  - Social isolation is a chronic mild stressor and a significant risk factor for mental health disorders. Herein we explored the impact of social isolation on depression- and anxiety-like behaviours, as well as spatial memory impairments, in middle-aged male mice compared to post-weaning mice. We aimed to quantify and correlate social isolation-induced behaviour discrepancies with changes in hippocampal glial cell reactivity and proinflammatory cytokine levels. Post-weaning and middle-aged C57BL7/J6 male mice were socially isolated for a 3-week period and behavioural tests were performed on the last five days of isolation. We found that 3 weeks of social isolation led to depressive -like behaviour in the forced swim test, anxiety-like behaviour in the open field test, and spatial memory impairment in the Morris water maze paradigm in middle-aged male mice. These behavioural alterations were not observed in male mice after post-weaning social isolation, indicating resilience to isolationmediated stress. Increased Iba-1 expression and NLRP3 priming were both observed in the hippocampus of socially isolated middle-aged mice, suggesting a role for microglia and NLRP3 pathway in the detrimental effects of social isolation on cognition and behaviour. Young socially isolated mice also demonstrated elevated NLRP3 priming compared to controls, but no differences in Iba-1 levels and no significant changes in behaviour. Ageing-induced microglia activation and enhancement of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL -6 proinflammatory cytokines, known signs of a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, were also detected. Altogether, data suggest that social isolation, in addition to inflammaging, contributes to stress-related cognitive impairment in middle-aged mice.

AB  - Transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) results in delayed neuronal death, primarily apoptosis, in the hippocampal CA1 subregion, which leads to severe cognitive deficits. While therapeutic hypothermia is an approved treatment for patients following cardiac arrest, it is associated with various adverse effects. Secretoneurin (SN) is an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide generated in the brain, adrenal medulla and other endocrine tissues. In this study, SN was infused into the rat brain by intracerebroventricular injection 1 day after GCI, and we demonstrated that SN could significantly preserve spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze tasks examined on days 14-17 after GCI. To further investigate underlying pathways involved, we demonstrated that, on day 5 after GCI, SN could significantly inhibit GCI-induced expression levels of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) and cleaved-PARP1, as well as neuronal apoptosis and synaptic loss in the hippocampal CA1 region. Additionally, SN could attenuate GCI-induced activation of both caspase-1 and caspase-3, and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-18 in the CA1 region. Mechanically, we observed that treatment with SN effectively inhibited NLRP3 protein elevation and the bindings of NLRP3-ASC and ASC-caspase-1 in hippocampal neurons after GCI. In summary, our data indicate that SN could effectively attenuate NLRP3 inflammasome formation, as well as the activation of caspase-1 and -3, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and ultimately the neuronal apoptotic loss induced by GCI. Potential neuronal pyroptosis, or caspase-1-dependent cell death, could also be involved in ischemic neuronal death, which needs further investigation.

AB  - Background: The cognitive deficits observed after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs are obvious clinical problems. For treating chemotherapy-induced cognitive deficits (CICD), the treatment modalities must target its underlying mechanisms. Specifically, cisplatin may activate glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), thereby enhancing neuronal apoptosis. 6-bromoindirubin-3 '-oxime (6BIO) was not investigated previously in a model of CICD. Therefore, this investigation aimed to address the impacts of GSK3 inhibition on regulating cell signaling, which contributes to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Methods: Thirty adult male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into control groups, while two experimental groups were exposed to repeated cisplatin injections (2 mg/kg intraperitoneally (ip), twice weekly, nine injections), termed chemobrain groups. The rats in the two experimental groups were equally divided into the chemobrain group (untreated) and the chemobrain-6BIO group (treated with 6BIO at a dose of 8.5 mu g/kg ip every two days, started after the last dose of cisplatin and continued for two weeks). Results: Repeated exposure to cisplatin led to a marked decline in cognitive functions. GSK3 inhibition exerted neuroprotection by decreasing the expression of p-tau and amyloid beta, thereby improving cognition. 6BIO, the GSK-3 beta inhibitor, restored mitochondrial biogenesis by augmenting the protein levels of PGC1-alpha and increasing the number of mitochondria in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Conclusion: 6BIO provided neuroprotection and exhibited anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effects in a rat model of chemobrain.

AB  - Tea is one of the three most widely consumed beverages in the world, not only because of its unique flavor but also due to its various health benefits. The bioactive components in tea, such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, polypeptides, pigments, and alkaloids, are the main contributors to its health functions. Based on epidemiological surveys, the consumption of tea and its compounds in daily life has positive effects on cardiovascular diseases, cancers, hepatopathy, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In experimental studies, the antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-obesity, cardiovascular protective, liver protective, and hypoglycemic activities of tea and the related mechanisms of action have been widely investigated. The regulation of several classical signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor-Kappa B (NF-Kappa B), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and wingless/integrated (Wnt) signaling, is involved. Clinical trials have also demonstrated the potential of tea products to be applied as dietary supplements and natural medicines. In this paper, we reviewed and discussed the recent literature on the health benefits of tea and its compounds, and specifically explored the molecular mechanisms involved.

Our clinical and basic science studies demonstrate an overall immune suppression in the periphery of diabetic stroke patients, as well as within the central nervous system (CNS) of type-2 diabetic mice following hypoxia- ischemia (HI). Low doses of naltrexone (LDN) improved clinical outcomes in many autoimmune diseases by acting on opioid receptors to release beta-endorphin which in turn balances inflammatory cytokines and modulates the opioid growth factor (OGF)-opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) pathway. We hypothesized that in our model of diabetic mice, LDN treatment will induce the release of beta-endorphin and improve CNS response by promoting neuronal recovery post HI. To test this hypothesis, we induced HI in 10 week old male db/db and db/ + mice, collected tissue at 24 and 72 h post HI, and measured OGF levels in plasma and brain tissue. The infarct size and number of OGF + neurons in the motor cortex, caudate and hippocampus (CA3) were measured. Following HI, db/db mice had significant increases in brain OGF expression, increased infarct size and neurological deficits, and loss of OGFr + neurons in several different brain regions. In the second experiment, we injected LDN (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally into db/db and db/ + mice at 4, 24, and 48 h post HI, and collected brain tissue and blood at 72 h. Acute LDN treatment increased beta-endorphin and OGF levels in plasma and promoted neuronal recovery in db/db mice compared to phosphate buffer saline (PBS)-treated diabetic mice suggesting a protective or regenerative effect of LDN.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have heterogeneous etiologies involving dysfunction of central nervous systems, for which no effective pan-specific treatments are available. Ilex kudingcha (IK) C.J. Tseng is a nootropic botanical used in Asia for neuroprotection and improvement of cognition. This study establishes that a chemically characterized extract from IK (IKE) mitigates behavioral traits in the Drosophila melanogaster rugose mutant, whose traits resemble human ASD, and examines possible mechanisms. IKE treatment significantly ameliorated deficits in social interaction, short-term memory, and locomotor activity in Drosophila rugose, and significantly increased synaptic bouton number of size more than 2 mu m(2) in the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of Drosophila rugose. To clarify mechanism(s) of IKE action, methylphenidate (MPH), a dopamine transporter inhibitor, was included as a reference drug in the behavioral assays: MPH significantly improved social interaction and short-term memory deficit in Drosophila rugose; administration of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 and dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride reversed the ameliorative effects of both MPH and IKE on the social interaction deficits of Drosophila rugose. To extend analysis of IKE treatment to the vertebrate central nervous system, ASD-associated gene expression in mouse hippocampus was studied by RNA-seq: IKE treatment altered the expression of genes coding phosphoinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt), proteins in glutamatergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic synapses, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and RNA transporter proteins. These results provide a foundation for further analysis of IKE as a candidate for treatment of some forms of ASD.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction caused by sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is still poorly understood. It is reported that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in multiple diseases, while its biological function in SAE remains unclear. We aimed to figure out whether VIP has influence on sepsis-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. To induce sepsis, rats were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation. Morris water maze test and fear conditioning test were conducted to reveal cognitive dysfunctions. TUNEL assay was performed to evaluate apoptosis. We found out that the expression of VIP was downregulated in the hippocampus of septic rats. VIP was verified to attenuate sepsis-induced memory impairment following CLP. Additionally, we examined apoptosis and inflammation in rats' hippocampus. It is worth noting that VIP inhibited the apoptosis in the hippocampus and reduced the productions of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta. Furthermore, our data confirmed that VIP was involved in regulating the TLR-4/NF-kappa B signaling. In conclusion, VIP inhibited neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in hippocampus of septic rats through the TLR-4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Evidence shows that inflammatory responses may encompass the onset of severe depressive illness. Traditionally used licorice contains 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (18 beta GA), which has been demonstrated to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. This study investigates the antidepressant effects of 18 beta GA and the underlying mechanism in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Wistar rats were exposed to CUMS for 36 consecutive days to establish depression. 18 beta GA (10, 20, and 50 mg/kg) or fluoxetine was given once daily (from day 30 to day 36). Thereafter, behavior parameters (sucrose preference test, forced-swimming test, open-field test, body weight), pro-inflammatory cytokines, neurotransmitters, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT), and liver biomarkers were studied. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses were conducted to investigate the protein's expression. 18 beta GA (20 and 50 mg/kg) treatment increased sucrose intake, locomotion in the open-field test, decreased immobility time in the forced swim test, and improved body weight in CUMS-exposed rats. The therapy of 18 beta GA dramatically declined cytokines, ACTH and CORT and improved 5HT and norepinephrine in CUMS rats. Furthermore, BDNF and TrkB proteins were down-regulated in CUMS group, which was increased to varying degrees by 18 beta GA at doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg. Therefore, 18 beta GA ameliorates depressive-like behavior persuaded by chronic unpredictable mild stress, decreases neuroinflammation, liver biomarkers, stress hormones, and improves body weight, brain neurotransmitter concentration via activating on BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway in both PFC and hippocampus in rats.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex injury with a multi-faceted recovery process. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are demonstrated to be involved in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the roles of lncRNAs in long-term neurological deficits post-TBI are poorly understood. The present study depicted the microarray's lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiles at 14 days in TBI mice hippocampi. LncRNA and mRNA microarray was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to validate the microarray results. Bioinformatics analysis [including Gene Ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network, and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network] were applied to explore the underlying mechanism. A total of 264 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 232 expressed mRNAs were identified (fold change > 1.5 and P-value < 0.05). Altered genes were enriched in inflammation, immune response, blood-brain barrier, glutamatergic neurological effects, and neuroactive ligand-receptor, which may be associated with TBI-induced pathophysiologic changes in the long-term neurological deficits. The lncRNAs-mRNAs co-expression network was generated for 74 lncRNA-mRNA pairs, most of which are positive correlations. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network included 12 lncRNAs, 59 miRNAs, and 25 mRNAs. Numerous significantly altered lncRNAs and mRNAs in mice hippocampi were enriched in inflammation and immune response. Furthermore, these dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs may be promising therapeutic targets to overcome obstacles in long-term recovery following TBI.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system with autoimmune nature that is typified by varying degrees of demyelination and axonal damage. Paeonol is an active ingredient in some medicinal plants with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective property. This study was conducted to reveal whether paeonol can alleviate hippocampal demyelination and cognitive deficits in cuprizone-induced murine model of demyelination as a model of MS. C57BL/6 mice received oral cuprizone (400 mg/kg) for 6 weeks, and paeonol was administered p.o. at two doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg, starting from the second week post-cuprizone for 5 weeks. After assessment of learning and memory in different tasks, oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated besides immunohistochemical assessment of hippocampal myelin basic protein (MBP). Paeonol (100 mg/kg) properly ameliorated cognitive deficits in Y maze, novel object discrimination (NOD) test, and Barnes maze with no significant improvement of performance in passive avoidance task. In addition, paeonol treatment at the higher dose was also associated with partial restoration of hippocampal level of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers including MDA, ROS, GSH, SOD, catalase, NF-kB, and TNF. Besides, paeonol improved MMP as an index of mitochondrial integrity and health and reduced MPO as a factor of neutrophil infiltration. Furthermore, paeonol treatment prevented hippocampal MBP immunoreactivity, indicating its prevention of demyelination. In conclusion, the current study showed the preventive effect of paeonol against cuprizone-induced demyelination and cognitive deficits through reversing most oxidative stress- and inflammation-related parameters in addition to its improvement of mitochondrial health.

AB  - Objective: Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) is a well-established treatment for women at risk of preterm birth that improves neonatal outcomes. However, several concerns have been raised regarding the potential long-term adverse effects of ACS on the offspring's developing brain. Here we investigated the association between ACS and subcortical segmental volumes in preterm infants at term-equivalent age. Study design: This retrospective observational study was conducted using the clinical data of preterm singleton infants born between 22(0/7) and 33(6/7) gestational weeks at Nagoya University Hospital in 2014-2020. Subcortical volumes of the bilateral thalami, caudate nuclei, putamens, pallidums, hippocampi, amygdalae, and nuclei accumbens were evaluated using an automated segmentation tool, Infant FreeSurfer, and compared between neonates exposed to a single course of ACS (n = 46) and those who were not (n = 13) by multiple linear regression analysis (covariates: postmenstrual age at magnetic resonance imaging, infant sex, and gestational age at birth). We compared each subcortical volume stratified by gestational age at birth (<28 vs. >= 28 gestational weeks). Results: Multivariate analyses revealed significantly smaller volumes in the bilateral amygdalae (left, p < 0.03; right, p < 0.03) and caudate nuclei (left, p < 0.03; right, p = 0.04) in neonates with ACS. Significantly smaller volumes in these regions were observed only in neonates born at 28 weeks of gestation or later. Conclusions: ACS was associated with smaller volumes of the bilateral amygdalae and caudate nuclei at term- equivalent age. This association was observed exclusively in infants born at 28 weeks of gestation or later.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory decline and cognitive impairments. The clinical treatments for AD have numerous adverse effects; hence, the exploration of natural products for AD therapy is of significant importance. Protocatechuic acid (PA), a natural phenolic acid, has been shown to possess various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor effects. However, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic potential for AD remain elusive. This study utilized a beta-amyloid (A beta) injection into the hippocampus of mice as an AD model and L-glu-induced HT-22 cell neurotoxicity and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced cellular neuroinflammation models to assess reactive oxygen species (ROS), JC-1, and relevant biochemical markers. This study examined behavioral, pathological, and inflammatory factors and investigated the molecular mechanisms through transcriptomics, western blot, and molecular docking studies. This study's findings reveal that high-dose PA (50 mg/kg) improves symptoms in AD mice through the cholinergic synaptic signaling pathway. This study indicates that PA is a potential candidate for AD treatment targeting the cholinergic synaptic signaling pathway, providing a lead compound for AD therapy.

AB  - Fu brick tea (FBT) is a traditional tea manufactured by solid-state fermentation of tea leaves (Camellia sinensis). Although anti-obesity effects have been reported for FBT, the associated role of FBT polysaccharides (PSs) and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we found that FBTPSs inhibited obesity, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation; improved intestinal barrier function; and alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis in high-fat diet-fed rats. Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides, Parasutterella, Desulfovibrio, and Blautia were the core microbes regulated by FBTPSs. FBTPSs regulated the produc-tion of gut microbiota-related metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), branched-chain amino acids, and aromatic amino acids throughout the development of obesity, and regulated the SCFA-GPR signaling pathway. FBTPS-treated fecal microbiota transplant ameliorated obesity, alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis, and improved gut microbiota-associated metabolites, suggesting that the anti-obesity effect of FBTPSs was gut microbiota-dependent. FBTPSs may serve as novel prebiotic agents for the treatment of obesity and dysbiosis of gut microbiota.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The regulation and metabolism of the endocannabinoid system has received extensive attention for their potential neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by amyloid beta (A beta) -induced cell toxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Using in vitro techniques and two cell lines, the mouse hippocampus-derived HT22 cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), we investigated the ability of endocannabinoids to inhibit A beta aggregation and protect cells against A beta toxicity. The present study provides evidence that endocannabinoids N-arachidonoyl ethanol amide (AEA), noladin and O-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (OAE) inhibit A beta 42 aggregation. They were able to provide protection against A beta 42 induced cytotoxicity via receptor-mediated and non-receptor-mediated mechanisms in CB1-CHO and HT22 cells, respectively. The aggregation kinetic experiments demonstrate the anti-A beta aggregation activity of some endocannabinoids (AEA, noladin). These data demonstrate the potential role and application of endocannabinoids in AD pathology and treatment.

AB  - Some cases of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) require surgical treatment and postoperative nasal packing, but bleeding and adhesion are common complications after nasal surgery. Biodegradable drug-loaded implants hold great therapeutic options for the treatment of CRS, but little data are available regarding the properties and effects of a novel drug-loaded haemostatic sponge (DLHS) in the nasal cavity and sinus. In this study, in vitro and in vivo experiments were used to test the physicochemical properties and investigate the biocompatibility and effectiveness of DLHS. The results showed that DLHSs present outstanding porosity and liquid absorption capacity, which might enhance their haemostatic ability, and they possess sustained-release ability for drugs. Further clinical trials confirmed their clinical efficacy and safety, and there was no evidence of adrenal cortical suppression. This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of a novel biodegradable drug-loaded sponge with the possibility of being used in CRS patients, and it may reduce inflammation and minimize adhesions via controlled local drug delivery without measurable systemic exposure.

AB  - Altered energy metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major pathological hallmark implicated in the early stages of the disease process. Astrocytes play a central role in brain homeostasis and are implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Although numerous studies have investigated global changes in brain metabolism, redox status, gene expression and epigenetic markers in AD, the intricate interplay between different metabolic processes, particularly in astrocytes, remains poorly understood. Numerous studies have implicated amyloid-beta and the amyloid-beta precursor in the development and progression of AD. To determine the effects of amyloid-beta peptides or the impact of amyloid-beta precursor protein processing on astrocyte metabolism, we differentiated astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from people with early onset familial AD and controls. This study demonstrates that familial AD-derived astrocytes exhibit significantly more changes in their metabolism including glucose uptake, glutamate uptake and lactate release, with increases in oxidative and glycolytic metabolism compared to acute amyloid-beta exposure. In addition to changes in major metabolic pathways including glutamate, purine and arginine metabolism and the citric acid cycle, we demonstrate evidence of gliosis in familial AD astrocytes highlighting a potential pathological hallmark. This suggests that chronic alterations in metabolism may occur very early in the disease process and present significant risk factors for disease progression for patients with early onset AD. These findings may also reveal important drivers of disease in late onset dementia and highlights key targets for potential diagnostic features and therapeutic agents in the future.

AB  - Objective: To explore the effect and mechanism of peppermint essential oil on learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Methods: Morris water maze test and shuttle box test were used to explore the changes in learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice after sniffing essential oil. The cellular status of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region of the right hemisphere, A beta deposition, oxidative stress level, and serum metabonomics were detected to explore its mechanism. Results: Sniffing peppermint essential oil can improve the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Compared with the model group, the state of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region of the peppermint essential oil group returned to normal, and the deposition of A beta decreased. The MDA of brain tissue decreased significantly, and the activity of SOD and GSH-PX increased significantly to the normal level. According to the results of metabonomics, it is speculated that peppermint essential oil may improve cognitive function in AD by regulating arginine and proline metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and cysteine and methionine metabolism.

AB  - Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is claimed as the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which hypertension is a critical inducer. Currently, hypertension-induced cognitive impairment lacks clinical treatments. Irbesartan is a long-acting angiotensin receptor antagonist with promising antihypertensive properties. Our research will focus on the potential function of Irbesartan on hypertensioninduced cognitive impairment. Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats were orally dosed with normal saline or 20 mg/kg/day Irbesartan for 14 consecutive days, with 4 groups divided shown as below: WKY, Irbesartan, SHR, SHR+ Irbesartan. Firstly, the markedly increased systolic blood pressure observed in SHR rats was signally repressed by Irbesartan on Day 7 and 14 post-dosing. Moreover, notably decreased time of exploring the novel object in the object recognition task (ORT) test, elevated escape latency, and reduced time in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze (MWM) test were observed in SHR rats, which were prominently reversed by Irbesartan. Furthermore, the declined superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) level, increased cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) activity, and enhanced protein level of p35/p25, p-Tau (pSer(214))/Tau46, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were memorably rescued by Irbesartan. Lastly, the activity of cAMP/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling in the hippocampus of SHR rats was markedly repressed, accompanied by an upregulation of phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), which was observably rescued by Irbesartan. Collectively, Irbesartan protected against the hypertension-induced cognitive impairment in SHR rats by regulating the cAMP/CREB signaling.

AB  - Neurogenesis is an essential, lifelong process during which neural stem cells generate new neurons hippocampus, a center for learning, memory, and mood control. Neural stem cells are vulnerable mental insults spanning from chronic stress to radiation. These insults reduce their numbers and neurogenesis, leading to memory decline, anxiety, and depression. Preserving neural stem cells could prevent these neurogenesis-associated pathologies, an outcome particularly important for long-term missions where environmental exposure to radiation is significantly higher than on Earth. Multiple velopments, from mechanistic discoveries of radiation injury on hippocampal neurogenesis to new platforms the development of selective, specific, effective, and safe small molecules as neurogenesis-protective great promise to minimize radiation damage on neurogenesis. In this review, we summarize the effects like radiation on hippocampal neurogenesis. We then focus on current advances in drug discovery opment and discuss the nuclear receptor TLX/NR2E1 (oleic acid receptor) as an example of a neurogenic that might rescue neurogenesis following radiation.

AB  - Daily calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF) enhance longevity and cognition but the effects and mechanisms that differentiate these two paradigms are unknown. We examined whether IF in the form of every-other-day feeding enhances cognition and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) when compared to a matched 10% daily CR intake and ad libitum conditions. After 3 months under IF, female C57BL6 mice exhibited improved long-term memory retention. IF increased the number of BrdU-labeled cells and neuroblasts in the hippocampus, and microarray analysis revealed that the longevity gene Klotho (Kl) was upregulated in the hippocampus by IF only. Furthermore, we found that downregulating Kl in human hippocampal progenitor cells led to decreased neurogenesis, whereas Kl overexpression increased neurogenesis. Finally, histological analysis of Kl knockout mice brains revealed that Kl is required for AHN, particularly in the dorsal hippocampus. These data suggest that IF is superior to 10% CR in enhancing memory and identifies Kl as a novel candidate molecule that regulates the effects of IF on cognition likely via AHN enhancement.

Nutrients such as vitamin D3 and sphingolipids have important roles in many cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and cancer. However, the specific composition of sphingolipids in exosomes and their changes induced by vitamin D3 treatment have not been elucidated. Here, we initially observed neutral sphingomyelinase and vitamin D receptors in exosomes released from HN9.10 embryonic hippocampal cells. Using ultrafast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that exosomes are rich in sphingomyelin species compared to whole cells. To interrogate the possible functions of vitamin D3, we established the optimal conditions of cell treatment and we analyzed exosome composition. Vitamin D3 was identified as responsible for the vitamin D receptor loss, for the increase in neutral sphingomyelinase content and sphingomyelin changes. As a consequence, the generation of ceramide upon vitamin D3 treatment was evident. Incubation of the cells with neutral sphingomyelinase, or the same concentration of ceramide produced in exosomes was necessary and sufficient to stimulate embryonic hippocampal cell differentiation, as vitamin D3. This is the first time that exosome ceramide is interrogated for mediate the effect of vitamin D3 in inducing cell differentiation.

AB  - Purpose: n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6 n3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5 n3), are of concern for their health-promoting effects such as anti-inflammatory, but the tissue selectivity for n-3 PUFA (i.e., which tissues and organs are rich in n-3 PUFA) is still not well known. In addition, it is unclear which tissues and organs are more sensitive to n-3 PUFA intervention. These unresolved issues have greatly hindered the exploring of the health benefits of n-3 PUFA. Methods: Twenty-four 7-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice were assigned to the control, fish oil, DHA, and EPA groups. The last three groups were given a 4-week oral intervention of fatty acids in ethyl ester (400 mg/kg bw). The fatty acid profiles in 27 compartments were determined by gas chromatography. Results: The proportion of long-chain n-3 PUFA (the total relative percentage of EPA, DPA n3, and DHA) was analyzed. Eight tissues and organs, including the brain (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus) and pe-ripheral organs (tongue, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, kidney, and heart) were determined as being n-3 PUFA-enriched tissues and organs, owing to their high n-3 PUFA levels. The highest n-3 PUFA content was observed in the tongue for the first time. Notably, the content of linoleic acid (LA; C18:2 n6c) in peripheral organs was observed to be relatively high compared with that in the brain. Interestingly, the proportions of EPA in the kidney, heart, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and tongue increased more markedly after the EPA intervention than after the DHA or fish oil intervention. As expected, the levels of proinflammatory arachidonic acid (AA; C20:4 n6) in the kidney, quadriceps, and tongue were markedly decreased after the three dietary interventions. Conclusion: Peripheral tissues and organs, including the tongue, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, kidney, and heart, besides the brain, showed obvious tissue selectivity for n-3 PUFA. In the whole body of mice, the tongue exhibits the strongest preference for n-3 PUFA, with the highest proportion of n-3 PUFA. Moreover, these peripheral tissues and organs, especially the kidney, are more sensitive to dietary EPA administration in comparison with the brain.

AB  - The rise of life expectancy of the human population is accompanied by the drastic increases of age-associated diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), and underscores the need to understand how aging influences AD development. The Forkhead box O transcription factor 3 (FoxO3) is known to mediate aging and longevity downstream of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling across species. However, its function in the adult brain under physiological and pathological conditions is less understood. Here, we report a region and cell-type-specific regulation of FoxO3 in the central nervous system (CNS). We found that FoxO3 protein levels were reduced in the cortex, but not hippocampus, of aged mice. FoxO3 was responsive to insulin/AKT signaling in astrocytes, but not neurons. Using CNS Foxo3-deficient mice, we reveal that loss of FoxO3 led to cortical astrogliosis and altered lipid metabolism. This is associated with impaired metabolic homoeostasis and beta-amyloid (A beta) uptake in primary astrocyte cultures. These phenotypes can be reversed by expressing a constitutively active FOXO3 but not a FOXO3 mutant lacking the transactivation domain. Loss of FoxO3 in 5xFAD mice led to exacerbated A beta pathology and synapse loss and altered local response of astrocytes and microglia in the vicinity of A beta plaques. Astrocyte-specific overexpression of FOXO3 displayed opposite effects, suggesting that FoxO3 functions cell autonomously to mediate astrocyte activity and also interacts with microglia to address A beta pathology. Our studies support a protective role of astroglial FoxO3 against brain aging and AD.

AB  - The large Drosophila protocadherin Fat (Ft) is a receptor for signal transduction pathways that control growth (Hippo signaling), planar cell polarity (PCP), metabolism and the proximodistal patterning of appendages. The intracellular domain (ICD) of Ft is crucial in implementing its biological functions. Six regions of high conservation (named A-F) within the ICD have been identified, as well as distinct regions mediating Hippo pathway activity that have been functionally characterized via transgenic expression rescue assays. Here, we make targeted deletions of these highly conserved residues and the putative Hippo- and PCP-regulating domains of endogenous Ft using CRISPR/Cas9. Through transcriptomic, developmental and phenotypic analyses, we show that different regions of Ft contribute uniquely to chromatin dynamics, tissue morphogenesis, PCP and metabolic regulation. We also demonstrate that different regions of Ft regulate growth in opposite directions, with regions B and F promoting growth and region D inhibiting growth. Strikingly, conserved regions D and F are key regulators of the function of Ft in Hippo activity - exhibiting opposing effects on Hippo pathway modulation - and of the conserved regions, and D is the main regulator of PCP.

AB  - Motivation Swine leukocyte antigens (SLAs) (i.e. swine major histocompatibility complex proteins) conduct a fundamental role in swine immunity. To generate a protective vaccine across an outbred species, such as pigs, it is critical that epitopes that bind to diverse SLA alleles are used in the vaccine development process. We introduced a new strategy for epitope prediction.Results We employed molecular dynamics simulation to identify key amino acids for interactions with epitopes. We developed an algorithm wherein each SLA-1 is compared to a crystalized reference allele with unique weighting for non-conserved amino acids based on R group and position. We then performed homology modeling and electrostatic contact mapping to visualize how relatively small changes in sequences impacted the charge distribution in the binding site. We selected eight diverse SLA-1 alleles and performed homology modeling followed, by protein-peptide docking and binding affinity analyses, to identify porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus matrix protein epitopes that bind with high affinity to these alleles. We also performed docking analysis on the epitopes identified as strong binders using NetMHCpan 4.1. Epitopes predicted to bind to our eight SLA-1 alleles had equivalent or higher energetic interactions than those predicted to bind to the NetMHCpan 4.1 allele repertoire. This approach of selecting diverse SLA-1 alleles, followed by homology modeling, and docking simulations, can be used as a novel strategy for epitope prediction that complements other available tools and is especially useful when available tools do not offer a prediction for SLAs/major histocompatibility complex.Availability and implementation The data underlying this article are available in the online .

AB  - Background Nucleus pulposus mesenchymal stem cells (NPMSCs) transplantation is a promising treatment for intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). However, the transplanted NPMSCs exhibited weak cell proliferation, high cell apoptosis, and a low ability to resist the harsh microenvironment of the degenerated intervertebral disc. There is an urgent need to explore feasible methods to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of NPMSCs transplantation. Objective To identify the optimal concentration for NPMSCs pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and explore the therapeutic efficacy of NPMSCs transplantation using H2O2 pretreatment in IVDD. Methods Rat NPMSCs were pretreated with different concentrations (range from 25 to 300 mu M) of H2O2. The proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and apoptosis of NPMSCs were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, and flow cytometry in vitro. The underlying signalling pathways were explored utilizing Western blotting. A rat needle puncture-stimulated IVDD model was established. X-ray, histological staining, and a multimode small animal live imaging system were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of H2O2-pretreated NPMSCs in vivo. Results NPMSCs pretreated with 75 mu M H2O2 demonstrated the strongest elevated cell proliferation by inhibiting the Hippo pathway (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, 75 mu M H2O2-pretreated NPMSCs exhibited significantly enhanced antioxidative stress ability (P < 0.01), which is related to downregulated Brd4 and Keap1 and upregulated Nrf2. NPMSCs pretreated with 75 mu M H2O2 also exhibited distinctly decreased apoptosis (P < 0.01). In vivo experiments verified that 75 mu M H2O2-pretreated NPMSCs-transplanted rats exhibited an enhanced disc height index (DHI% = 90.00 +/- 4.55, P < 0.01) and better histological morphology (histological score = 13.5 +/- 0.5, P < 0.01), which means 75 mu M H2O2-pretreated NPMSCs can better adapt to the environment of degenerative intervertebral discs and promote the repair of IVDD. Conclusions Pretreatment with 75 mu M H2O2 was the optimal concentration to improve the proliferation, antioxidative stress, and antiapoptotic ability of transplanted NPMSCs, which is expected to provide a new feasible method to improve the stem cell therapy efficacy of IVDD.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) have been detected in the atmospheric and the human respiratory system, indicating that the respiratory tract is a significant exposure route for MPs. However, the effect of inhaled MPs on cognitive function has not been adequately studied. Here, a C57BL/6 J mouse model of inhalation exposure to polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs, 5 mu m, 60 d) is established by intratracheal instillation. Interestingly, in vivo fluorescence imaging and transmission electron microscopy reveal that PS-MPs do not accumulate in the brain. However, behavioral experiments shows that cognitive function of mice is impaired, accompanied by histopathological damage of lung and brain tissue. Transcriptomic studies in hippocampal and lung tissue have demonstrated key neuroplasticity factors as well as cognitive deficits linked to lung injury, respectively. Mechanistically, the lung-brain axis plays a central role in PS-MPs-induced neurological damage, as demonstrated by pulmonary flora transplantation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intervention, and cell co-culture experiments. Together, inhalation of PS-MPs reduces cognitive function by altering the composition of pulmonary flora to produce more LPS and promoting M1 polarization of microglia, which provides new insights into the mechanism of nerve damage caused by inhaled MPs and also sheds new light on the prevention of neurotoxicity of environmental pollutants.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders have complex origins that manifest early during embryonic growth and are associated with intricate gene regulation dynamics. A perturbed metabolic environment such as hyperglycemia or dyslipidemia, particularly due to maternal obesity, poses a threat to the optimal development of the embryonic central nervous system. Accumulating evidence suggests that these metabolic irregularities during pregnancy may alter neurogenesis pathways, thereby predisposing the developing fetus to neurodevelopmental disorders. One primary mechanism through which such disruptions may occur involves changes in histone modifications resulting from fluctuations in the expression of histonemodifying enzymes or the availability of their substrates. Herein, we have used a rat model of maternal obesity induced by a high-fat diet before and during gestation to investigate the cellular and molecular repercussions of maternal obesity on embryonic cortical neurogenesis. Maternal obesity impairs neurogenesis by reducing cell proliferation, increasing neuronal marker expression, and shifting development toward astrogliogenesis. Differentially expressed genes revealed disruptions in key developmental signaling pathways and reduced AKT phosphorylation, particularly at E14.5. These changes were associated with epigenetic alterations, mainly the differential expression and phosphorylation of EZH2 and subsequent changes in global histone modifications. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed reduced H3K27me3 at genes upregulated due to maternal obesity, which could have resulted from reduced expression and increased phosphorylation of EZH2 at Thr311. Interestingly, EZH2 also showed increased O-GlcNAcylation in high-fat diet embryos along with increased association with AMPK-Thr172 in accordance with previous studies showing that Ampk catalyzes EZH2-Thr311p. These results suggest that an epigenetic gene regulatory mechanism mediated by Ampk and Ezh2 interactions resulted in reduced H3K27me3 and derepression of key developmental genes, which could have led to cell fate changes observed in the developing embryo brain cortex due to maternal obesity.

AB  - Lindera obtusiloba Blume (family, Lauraceae), native to Northeast Asia, has been used traditionally in the treatment of trauma and neuralgia. In this study, we investigated the neuroinflammatory effect of methanol extract of L. obtusiloba stem (LOS-ME) in a scopolamine-induced amnesia model and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia cells. LOS-ME downregulated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Male C57/BL6 mice were orally administered 20 and 200 mg/kg of LOS-ME for one week, and 2 mg/kg of scopolamine was administered intraperitoneally on the 8th day. In vivo behavioral experiments (Y-maze and Morris water maze test) confirmed that LOS-ME alleviated cognitive impairments induced by scopolamine and the amount of iNOS expression decreased in the hippocampus of the mouse brain. Microglial hyper-activation was also reduced by LOS-ME pretreatment. These findings suggest that LOS-ME might have potential in the treatment for cognitive improvement by regulating neuroinflammation.

AB  - Background Corticosterone (CORT) can induce neuronal damage in various brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, the region implicated in depression. However, the underlying mechanisms of these CORT-induced effects remain poorly understood. Recently, many studies have suggested that adipose stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (A-EVs) protect neurons in the brain. Methods To investigated neuroprotection effects of A-EVs in the CORT-induced cortical neurons, we cultured cortical neurons from E15 mice for 7 days, and the cultured cortical neurons were pretreated with different numbers (5 x 10(5)-10(7) per mL) of A-EVs (A-EVs(5), A-EVs(6), A-EVs(7)) for 30 min followed by administration of 200 mu M CORT for 24 h. Results Here, we show that A-EVs exert antiapoptotic effects by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in CORT-induced cortical neurons. We found that A-EVs prevented neuronal cell death induced by CORT in cultured cortical neurons. More importantly, we found that CORT exposure in cortical neurons resulted in increased levels of apoptosis-related proteins such as cleaved caspase-3. However, pretreatment with A-EVs rescued the levels of caspase-3. Intriguingly, CORT-induced apoptosis involved upstream activation of ER stress proteins such as GRP78, CHOP and ATF4. However, pretreatment with A-EVs inhibited ER stress-related protein expression. Conclusion Our findings reveal that A-EVs exert antiapoptotic effects via inhibition of ER stress in CORT-induced cell death.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) proved to be an important tool, not only in the induction of neuroinflammatory models, but also in demonstrating the behavioral and cognitive consequences of endotoxemia. Curcumin, in its native form, has proven to be a worthy candidate for further development as it protects the dopaminergic neurons against LPS-induced neurotoxicity. However, it remains hindered by its poor bioavailability. In this study we aim to explore the possible molecular mechanism of LPS-induced neurotoxicity and the possible protective effects of orally supplemented nanocurcumin. Thirty-six adult male Wistar rats weighing 170-175 g were divided into six groups and treated with single I.P. (intra-peritoneal) dose of LPS (sigma and extracted; separately) (5 mg/kg BW) plus daily oral nanocurcumin (15 mg/kg BW). The rats were followed for 7 days after the LPS injection and nanocurcumin supplementations daily via oral gavage. After scarification, the levels of neurotransmitters, antioxidants, and amyloidogenesis markers were assessed in brain tissues. Nanocurcumin showed adequate antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, rescuing the rats which had been injected intraperitoneally with LPS endotoxin.

AB  - Author summary Oligomeric assemblies of A beta are hypothesized to be seminal pathologic agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mechanistic studies of oligomerization and neurotoxicity in humans are currently impossible, yet such studies promise to advance efforts toward target identification and drug development. To overcome this hurdle, we developed a simple, mathematical model parameterized using experimental data extant. The model couples the kinetics of oligomerization with oligomer toxicity and enables determination of age-related changes in AD risk and hippocampal volume, the effects of traumatic brain injury on lifetime AD risk, gene dosage effects, and the effects of spatial variation in A beta monomer concentrations on millimeter scales. The model is easily interpretable and provides a foundation for development of more comprehensive models of AD development and progression.
   Oligomers of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through their toxicity towards neurons. Understanding the process of oligomerization may contribute to the development of therapeutic agents, but this has been difficult due to the complexity of oligomerization and the metastability of the oligomers thus formed. To understand the kinetics of oligomer formation, and how that relates to the progression of AD, we developed models of the oligomerization process. Here, we use experimental data from cell viability assays and proxies for rate constants involved in monomer-dimer-trimer kinetics to develop a simple mathematical model linking A beta assembly to oligomer-induced neuronal degeneration. This model recapitulates the rapid growth of disease incidence with age. It does so through incorporation of age-dependent changes in rates of A beta monomer production and elimination. The model also describes clinical progression in genetic forms of AD (e.g., Down's syndrome), changes in hippocampal volume, AD risk after traumatic brain injury, and spatial spreading of the disease due to foci in which A beta production is elevated. Continued incorporation of clinical and basic science data into the current model will make it an increasingly relevant model system for doing theoretical calculations that are not feasible in biological systems. In addition, terms in the model that have particularly large effects are likely to be especially useful therapeutic targets.

AB  - Deep learning models have shown outstanding performance in hydrological modeling but are often questioned for their "black-box" nature. To address this issue, this study proposes Hybrid-GR4J, a hybrid model that embeds the structure of the GR4J hydrological model into a physics-constrained recurrent neural network, enabling endto-end training within the NODE framework. The model is evaluated using daily meteorological inputs across 569 catchments from the CAMELS-US dataset. Results indicate that Hybrid-GR4J achieves average NSE and KGE scores of 0.59 and 0.63, representing improvements of 23.52 % over RNN and 36.58 % over GR4J, respectively. Moreover, the model exhibits strong robustness under various climatic conditions and training data lengths. This study confirms the effectiveness of structurally embedded hybrid modeling in improving runoff simulation accuracy and provides a transferable framework for integrating physical knowledge with data-driven approaches.

AB  - Abuse of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) is associated with neurological and cognitive problems in athletes. The Purpose of this study was to investigate the simultaneous effect of resistance training (RT) and spirulina supplementation (Sp) on the function of the antioxidant system with emphasis on mir125b, mir146a and cognitive function in Stanazolol (S)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. This experimental animal model study was performed with a post-test design with a control group. 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups of 9 animals including (Althobaiti et al., 2022) [1]: sham (Sh/normal saline intake) (Havnes et al., 2019) [2], 25 mg/kg/wk of stanazolol (S) (Albano et al., 2021) [3], S + 100 mg/kg of Sp + (S + Sp) (Bjornebekk et al., 2021) [4], RT (six weeks with an intensity of 50-100% of body weight) + S (S + RT) (Kanayama et al., 2013) [5] S + Sp + RT. Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), gluta-thione peroxidase (GPx), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), percentage of healthy cells in the C1 and C3 regions of hippocampus, miR125b, miR146a, step-through latency (STL), time spent in dark compartment (TDC), repeated entry in dark compartment (RDC) and percentage of alternation (PA%) were measured in the post-test. Results showed that the Sp, RT and SP + RT increased levels of SOD, GPx and percentage of healthy cells in C1 region, decreased MDA, mir125b, mir146a in hippocampal tissue and decreased TDC levels in S-exposed rats (P <= 0.05). Sp + RT decreased RDC and increased SOD levels; on the other hand, RT decreased RDC levels in S-exposed rats (P <= 0.05). Levels of TAC in the Sp groups were significantly higher than the S group (P <= 0.05). Also, the effect of Sp + RT in reducing miR125b, miR146a, and STL levels was much higher than the effect of Sp and RT alone (P <= 0.05). It seems that applying resistance training and spirulina supplementation both separately and interactively is effective in improving the antioxidant system as well as memory and learning in cognitive impairment caused by stanazolol. However, more studies on microRNAs are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Juices are currently a fast-growing segment in the fruit and vegetable industry sector. However, there are still no reports on the diversity of the phytochemical profile and health-promoting properties of commercial sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) juices. This study aimed to identify and quantify phytoprostanes, phytofurans by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS), tocopherols, tocotrienols by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detector (UPLC-FL), carotenoids, and free amino acids by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode detector-quadrupole and tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-Q/TOF-MS), and assess their anti-cholinergic, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant potential by in vitro assays of commercial sea buckthorn juices.
   RESULTS: Phytoprostanes (PhytoPs) and phytofurans (PhytoFs) in sea buckthorn juices were identified for the first time. Juices contained eight F-1-, D-1-, B-1- and L-1-phytoprostanes and one phytofuran (32.31-1523.51 ng and up to 101.47 mu g/100 g dry weight (DW)), four tocopherol congeners (22.23-94.08 mg 100 g(-1) DW) and three tocotrienols (5.93-25.34 mg 100 g(-1) DW). Eighteen carotenoids were identified, including ten xanthophylls, seven carotenes and phytofluene, at a concentration of 133.65 to 839.89 mg 100 g(-1) DW. Among the 20 amino acids (175.92-1822.60 mg 100 g(-1) DW), asparagine was dominant, and essential and conditionally essential amino acids constituted 11 to 41% of the total. The anti-enzyme and antioxidant potential of juices correlated selectively with the composition.
   CONCLUSION: Sea buckthorn juice can be a valuable dietary source of vitamins E and A, oxylipins and amino acids, used in the prevention of metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and neurodegenerative processes. The differentiation of the composition and the bioactive potential of commercial juices indicate that, for the consumer, it should be important to choose juices from the declared berry cultivars and crops.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that LSTM performs well in runoff prediction in large sample regional modeling and can estimate hydrological concepts based on its internal information. However, compared to process-based models, it still produces erroneous predictions that violate the physical laws. To explore the reasons for the above phenomenon, this study analyzes the evolution of LSTM's performance in predicting runoff and estimating hydrological concepts when trained on a large basinscale dataset. Findings demonstrated that LSTM's representation of the rainfall-runoff relationship lags behind the formation of hydrological concepts. The representations of relations and concepts do not consistently increase with the number of training basins. There is a model that achieves the best representation of the rainfall-runoff relationship and hydrological concepts, ensuring physical consistency even under extreme conditions. These results suggest that LSTM, like process-based models, learns the rainfall-runoff relationship and hydrological concepts, but its confusion about these concepts may lead to inaccurate predictions.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation of Iranian commercial multi-strain probiotic (IMSP) or different levels of Pediococcus acidilactici (PA), isolated from Iranian camel milk, on some biological parameters in male Ross broilers. A total of 240 1-d-old chicks were divided into four groups as follows: (1) Control-Unsupplemented, (2) supplemented with MSP, (3)10(6) CFU PA g(-1)diet, (4)10(8) CFU PA g(-1)diet (4). Groups 2 and 3 exhibited a higher total growth rate and feed conversion ratio, compared to the control and group 4 (p < .05). Group 3 showed a larger villus length/crypt-depth compared to the control (p < .05). Groups 2 and 4 displayed lower and larger count of jejunal Gram (-) bacteria and Lactobacillus spp. compared to the control, respectively (p < .05). The control group showed the lowest levels of total serum protein (p < .05). Group 3 had lower blood triglycerides compared to the control and group 2 (p < .05). These results indicated that the IMSP and 10(6) CFU PA g(-1)diet can improve growth and FCR and can be used in the poultry industry of Iran.

AB  - To study the effect of electroacupuncture at the Siguan acupoints on the expression of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) in post-stroke depression (PSD) rats, in order to explore its possible mechanism Fifty specific pathogen-free (SPF)-grade adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into a blank group, stroke group, PSD group, Siguan acupoint group and fluoxetine group according to the random number method. PSD rats were modeled with middle cerebral artery occlusion combined with chronic unpredictable mild stress. After successful modeling, electroacupuncture was applied to Siguan acupoints for a total of 21 days at 30 min/session/day. The rats in the fluoxetine group were fed intragastrically according to body weight, once a day, for a total of 21 days. The rats in each group were bound and intragastrically administered distilled water every day. The depressive behavior of rats was measured according to the horizontal and vertical scores of the open field test and the sucrose water consumption, and the changes in the number of BDNF- and TrkB-positive cells in the hippocampus of rats were observed by immunohistochemistry. After modeling, the behavioral indicators and the numbers of BDNF- and TrkB-positive cells in each model group were significantly lower than those in the blank group (P < 0.01). After treatment, the behavioral indicators and the numbers of BDNF- and TrkB-positive cells in the Siguan acupoint group and fluoxetine group were significantly higher than that in the PSD group (P < 0.01). During the treatment, the horizontal and vertical scores of the Siguan acupoint group were significantly increased on the seventh day of treatment, and the difference was statistically significant when compared with the PSD group (P < 0.05). The sucrose water consumption was significantly increased on the 14th day of treatment, and the difference was significant when compared with the PSD group (P < 0.05), both of which were earlier than that in the fluoxetine group. During the treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Electroacupuncture at Siguan acupoints has the same antidepressant effect as fluoxetine, and is more effective than fluoxetine in relieving depression in PSD rats. Its mechanism may be related to the activation of the expression of BDNF and its receptor TrkB.

AB  - Physics-based analyses have the potential to consolidate and substantiate medical diagnoses in rhinology. Such methods are frequently subject to intense investigations in research. However, they are not used in clinical applications, yet. One issue preventing their direct integration is that these methods are commonly developed as isolated solutions which do not consider the whole chain of data processing from initial medical to higher valued data. This manuscript presents a workflow that incorporates the whole data processing pipeline based on a Jupyter environment. Therefore, medical image data are fully automatically pre-processed by machine learning algorithms. The resulting geometries employed for the simulations on high-performance computing systems reach an accuracy of up to 99.5% compared to manually segmented geometries. Additionally, the user is enabled to upload and visualize 4-phase rhinomanometry data. Subsequent analysis and visualization of the simulation outcome extend the results of standardized diagnostic methods by a physically sound interpretation. Along with a detailed presentation of the methodologies, the capabilities of the workflow are demonstrated by evaluating an exemplary medical case. The pipeline output is compared to 4-phase rhinomanometry data. The comparison underlines the functionality of the pipeline. However, it also illustrates the influence of mucosa swelling on the simulation. Graphical Abstract Workflow for enhanced diagnostics in rhinology.

AB  - Agent-based models are particularly suitable to reflect the dynamics of humans, nature, and their interactions, making them a crucial approach for understanding social-ecological systems. The formalisations of human decision-making are central to resulting model behaviours. Despite awareness of the complexity of human behaviour in social-ecological systems research, scholars tend to represent human decision-makers as simplified, perfectly informed rational optimisers, without explicitly considering the fit with decision context. Key reasons are a lacking uptake of social theories and insights. To advance, we need a practice of reflecting, sharing, and inquiring on the justification of the decision model fit with its context. This paper stimulates this practice by 1) supporting the justification of decision model (DM) fit by describing the DM landscape and providing guiding questions; and 2) by supporting researchers in considering alternative DMs through a survey-based impression of modeller practices, and through highlighting DM frontiers as inspiration for future research.

AB  - In this study, an adaptive speed prediction scheme based on reactive power was established for direct torque-controlled (DTC) permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives. The current and flux of a stator were used to establish a DTC PMSM drive. Hall effect current sensors with a non-contact sensing technique were used to detect the stator current of the PMSM. The voltage space vector pulse width modulation (VSVPWM) DTC scheme was used in place of a traditional switching table (ST) DTC scheme to reduce current and torque ripples. Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) was utilized to develop a speed prediction scheme, and its adaptation mechanism was designed using the elephant herding optimization (EHO) algorithm. The torque, flux, and speed controllers were designed using a proportional-integral (P-I)-type controller. The MATLAB/Simulink(C) toolbox was used to establish the simulation scheme, and all control algorithms were realized using a microprocessor control card. The simulation and experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) kinases are core components of the Hippo pathway, which controls neuronal polarity and neurite growth in the central nervous system (CNS). NDR2 is the principal NDR kinase in the mouse CNS, where it has been shown to regulate integrin-dependent dendritic branching as well as growth and plasticity in hippocampal mossy fibers. Given the well-established involvement of integrins in plasticity, we hypothesized that NDR2 might regulate synapse formation and plasticity through integrin-mediated mechanisms. In this study, using constitutive NDR2 null mutant mice, we demonstrate that Ndr2 deficiency leads to a reduction of T788/789 phosphorylated beta 1 integrin expression at synaptic sites both in the hippocampal area CA1 and in primary hippocampal neurons in vitro. This reduction is associated with decreased synaptic density in both conditions and accompanied by reduced long-term potentiation in the synapses between Schaffer collaterals/commissural fibers and CA1 pyramidal cells, which could be restored by activation of integrins with an arginine-glycine-aspartate-containing peptide, as well as with mild spatial memory deficits. Together, our results suggest that NDR2 is involved in integrin-dependent synapse formation and plasticity in the mouse hippocampus. image

AB  - Mediterranean farmers are searching for low input and alternative crops for cropping systems diversification and for promoting innovative value chains. Since there are still limited studies on camelina to be introduced under real on-farm conditions, a multilocation trial was conducted in four different sites of inland areas of Tuscany (central Italy) with the aim of evaluating camelina productive potential and seed quality, thus defining a complete metabolomic profile. A remarkable variability has been observed on seed and oil yield, fatty acids profile and accumulation of secondary metabolites (SMs), particularly polyphenols, gamma-tocopherol, and glucosinolates, highlighting how their accumulation is strongly influenced by environmental conditions. In particular, significant correlations have been found among air temperatures and SMs a accumulation, indicating that this element of weather could represent the best predictor for secondary metabolites in camelina seeds. So, this study aimed to demonstrate the interesting opportunity that camelina could represent for Mediterranean farmers, being a good source of oil, essential fatty acids, and bioactive compounds, thus representing a potential ingredient for the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals.

AB  - This study aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the uterotubal junction in two distinct mammalian species, the bovine (Bos taurus) and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius), focusing on histological and histomorphometric parameters. Uterotubal junction (UTJ) was dissected from 8 cows and 12 camels with dominant follicles, and processed for H&E staining for histology, and histomorphometry examination. The results showed that the camel uterotubal junction papillae (UTJP) existed only in camels and was completely absent in cattle. Histologically, the cow UTJ appears with a star-shaped lumen, and the mucosa is lined by a simple columnar epithelium with ciliated and non-ciliated cells. Superficial (SG) and deep glands (DG) were abundant in the submucosa. Camel UTJP is a conical structure, it has a pale yellowish colour, 0.5 +/- 0.2 cm height, and 0.3 +/- 0.1 cm width, and it has a distinct sphincter at the tip towards the uterine lumen. In the camel UTJP, the lumen is wider, and the mucosa showed large multiple folds lined with ciliated and non-ciliated cells in a pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The submucosa showed no mucosal glands. Lumen area, lumen epithelial height, luminal epithelial density, the thickness of the muscular layer, number of folds, fold height, epithelial height, fold area and epithelial perimeter were higher in camel UTJP (p < .001) than cow UTJ, while the total endosalpinx area and glandular epithelial density were lower in camel UTJP (p < .001) than in cow UTJ. In conclusion, this study elucidates potential variations in the uterotubal junction between bovines and dromedary camels, providing valuable insights into their reproductive adaptations. The epithelial lining, absence of glands and the thick layer of tunica muscularis might indicate that camel UTJP could play a mechanical role in selecting spermatozoa and assisting the hatching of blastocysts during their passage into the uterus.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies. Accumulating evidence suggests that Hippo signaling pathway is a crucial signaling pathway that regulates stemness in multiple cancers, including CRC. Given that, the therapeutics targeting the Hippo pathway are of great interest. At the same time, previous studies have reported that PP2A regulates the Hippo pathway in tumorigenesis. In this study, we uncover the role of PP2A in vitro and in vivo and the interaction between PP2A and Hippo signaling pathway in CRC stemness. We investigate the molecular mechanism of PP2A-mediated Hippo pathway in CRC progression from the aspect of cell stemness. Furthermore, we explore the transcription factor of PP2A in CRC. In view of circRNA's regulation of cancer-related signaling pathways in CRC, we also study the association between PP2A-mediated Hippo pathway and the CRC-related circRNA (hsa-circ-001680) confirmed in previous studies. Of note, we demonstrate how hsa-circ-001680 regulates PP2A expression. The effect of hsa-circ-001680 on PP2A stability is investigated as well. In conclusion, the study demonstrates the mechanism of PP2A-mediated pathway on CRC stemness, which may provide new sights for the treatment of CRC. Copyright: (c) 2023 by the C.M.B. Association.

AB  - Objective: There are no effective treatments for relieving neuronal dysfunction after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we evaluated therapeutic efficacy of human embryonic stem cell-derived cerebral organoids (hCOs) in a mild TBI model, in terms of repair of damaged cortical regions, neurogenesis, and improved cognitive function.
   Methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were randomly divided into sham-operated, mild TBI, and mild TBI with hCO groups. hCOs cultured at 8 weeks were used for transplantation. Mice were sacrificed at 7 and 14 days after transplantation followed by immunofluorescence staining, cytokine profile microarray, and novel object recognition test.
   Results: 8W-hCOs transplantation significantly reduced neuronal cell death, recovered microvessel density, and promoted neurogenesis in the ipsilateral subventricular zone and dentate gyrus of hippocampus after mild TBI. In addition, increased angiogenesis into the engrafted hCOs was observed. Microarray results of hCOs revealed neuronal differentiation potential and higher expression of early brain development proteins associated with neurogenesis, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling. Ultimately, 8W-hCO transplantation resulted in reconstruction of damaged cortex and improvement in cognitive function after mild TBI.
   Conclusion: hCO transplantation may be feasible for treating mild TBI-related neuronal dysfunction via reconstruction of damaged cortex and neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

AB  - Traditional tethered nerve implants have many limitations since they rely on physical wires for power and signal transmission. Wireless stimulation technology can promote the exploration of neurological diseases and meet patient requirements, stemming from its portability and efficiency. In this paper, the link transmission characteristics of a sub-millimeter inductor are investigated by simulation, electrical tests, and theoretical analysis. The inductor acts as the receiving coil of a wireless stimulation device, and the wireless energy transmission process based on magnetic induction coupling is analyzed. Second, a novel millimeter-scale wireless stimulator device for neuromodulation is designed based on the parameters of transmitting and receiving coils obtained from the simulation. Finally, rat electrophysiological experiments are conducted to assess the feasibility of the device. The field Excitatory Post Synaptic Potential baseline is first recorded in the CA1 radiation area for 10 min, followed by the addition of high-frequency stimulation, and after successful induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and recording for 10 min, the two coils are fixed at a distance of 1 cm and the hippocampal Schaffer-CA1 pathway is added. The experimental results show that the addition of wireless stimulation can modulate the transmission of synaptic electrical activity in the hippocampal Schaffer-CA1 pathway and significantly increase the level of (LTP) induction. A millimeter-scale wireless stimulation device is investigated and designed in this paper, the feasibility of the device is demonstrated through ex vivo electrophysiological experiments, and its effects on the targeted modulation of the Schaffer-CA1 pathway in the rat hippocampus are described.

AB  - Excessive fructose consumption is associated with the incidence of obesity and systemic inflammation, resulting in increased oxidative damage and failure to the function of brain structures. Thus, we hypothesized that fructose consumption will significantly increase inflammation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the mouse brain and, consequently, memory damage. The effects of different fructose concentrations on inflammatory and biochemical parameters in the mouse brain were evaluated. Male Swiss mice were randomized into four groups: control, with exclusive water intake, 5%, 10%, and 20% fructose group. The 10% and 20% fructose groups showed an increase in epididymal fat, in addition to higher food consumption. Inflammatory markers were increased in epididymal fat and in some brain structures. In the evaluation of oxidative damage, it was possible to observe significant increases in the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. In the epididymal fat and in the prefrontal cortex, there was a decrease in the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and an increase in the striatum. Furthermore, short memory was impaired in the 10% and 20% groups but not long memory. In conclusion, excess fructose consumption can cause fat accumulation, inflammation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which can damage brain structures and consequently memory.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of whey obtained by either enzyme (sweet) or acid treatment on wound healing remains unclear. This study investigated the effectiveness of camel and bovine whey prepared enzymatically (CSW and BSW) or by pH reduction (CAW and BAW). After removing the cream from milk, HCl or rennet was used to remove casein, resulting in acid or sweet whey, respectively, followed by lactose removal using dialysis. Casein removal was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Wound-healing activity was measured in vitro on HT-29 cells by scratch assay. All four whey samples (0-1000 mg L-1) were applied on the cells, and the closure of the cell-free scratched areas was monitored for 48 h. RESULTS: All whey samples increased the cell migration significantly (P < 0.05) to help close the cell-free areas as an indication of wound healing compared to the negative control. However, the closure amounts between the highest dose (1000 mg L-1) and the control were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Acid whey samples significantly (P < 0.05) elevated the closure speed compared to the sweet whey samples. The highest closure percentage (64.69%) was achieved after treatment with 10 mg L-1 CAW for 48 h. Between the sweet whey samples, BSW was significantly (P < 0.05) more effective in closing the cell-free zone compared to CSW. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the wound-healing potential of camel and bovine whey in vitro by comparing their effects on HT-29 cell migration. CAW showed the greatest activity and may find uses as a treatment agent in wound healing. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SZ) is a mental disorder that typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood. It reduces the life expectancy of patients by 15 years. Abnormal behavior, perception of emotions, social relationships, and reality perception are among its most significant symptoms. Past studies have revealed that SZ affects the temporal and anterior lobes of hippocampus regions of the brain. Also, increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and decreased volume of white and gray matter can be observed due to this disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the popular neuroimaging technique used to explore structural/functional brain abnormalities in SZ disorder, owing to its high spatial resolution. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been employed with advanced image/signal processing methods to accurately diagnose SZ. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of studies conducted on the automated diagnosis of SZ using MRI modalities. First, an AI-based computer aided-diagnosis system (CADS) for SZ diagnosis and its relevant sections are presented. Then, this section introduces the most important conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in the diagnosis of diagnosing SZ. A comprehensive comparison is also made between ML and DL studies in the discussion section. In the following, the most important challenges in diagnosing SZ are addressed. Future works in diagnosing SZ using AI techniques and MRI modalities are recommended in another section. Results, conclusion, and research findings are also presented at the end.

AB  - We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the neocortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using prediction errors. As a result, lower levels form representations that encode sequences at shorter timescales (e.g., a single step) while higher levels form representations that encode sequences at longer timescales (e.g., an entire sequence). We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation creates low-dimensional combinations of a set of learned temporal dynamics to explain input sequences. When trained on natural videos, the lower-level model neurons developed space-time receptive fields similar to those of simple cells in the primary visual cortex while the higher-level responses spanned longer timescales, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. Additionally, the network's hierarchical sequence representation exhibited both predictive and postdictive effects resembling those observed in visual motion processing in humans (e.g., in the flash-lag illusion). When coupled with an associative memory emulating the role of the hippocampus, the model allowed episodic memories to be stored and retrieved, supporting cue-triggered recall of an input sequence similar to activity recall in the visual cortex. When extended to three hierarchical levels, the model learned progressively more abstract temporal representations along the hierarchy. Taken together, our results suggest that cortical processing and learning of sequences can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical spatiotemporal generative model of the visual world.
   The brain is adept at predicting stimuli and events at multiple timescales. How do the neuronal networks in the brain achieve this remarkable capability? We propose that the neocortex employs dynamic predictive coding to learn hierarchical spatiotemporal representations. Using computer simulations, we show that when exposed to natural videos, a hierarchical neural network that minimizes prediction errors develops stable and longer timescale responses at the higher level; lower-level neurons learn space-time receptive fields similar to the receptive fields of primary visual cortical cells. The same network also exhibits several effects in visual motion processing and supports cue-triggered activity recall. Our results provide a new framework for understanding the genesis of temporal response hierarchies and activity recall in the neocortex.

AB  - Ceruloplasmin (CP) is a multi-copper ferroxidase mainly synthesized by liver, secreted into the peripheral blood, playing a critical role in regulating the iron homeostasis. In the central nervous system (CNS), the CP expressed by astrocytes plays an important role in the transportation of iron from the blood across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain. Our previous study showed that conditional knockout of astrocytic CP with Cre-LoxP system (CpGfapcKO) not only improved the learning and memory abilities of elderly mice, but also impaired the learning and memory abilities of young mice. In order to further investigate the effects of CP on learning and memory with aging, we constructed mice model with tamoxifen-induced astrocyte specific knockout of CP, induced CP knockout at 12 months old, and observed the effects on mouse learning and memory at 18 months old. We were delighted to found that ablation of astrocytic CP by tamoxifen at 12 months old could similarly enhance the learning, memory and recognition abilities in 18-month-old mice. Iron deposition in the hippocampus associated with aging was mitigated, leading to a reduction in oxidative stress. The MAPK/JNK pathway exhibited attenuation, while the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 pathway showed enhancement. This combination is expected to result in the reduction of the phosphorylation level of MYC and the elevation of the nuclear translocation of MYC, which might then contribute to reduced cellular senescence. Additionally, the ROS/MAPK/Erk and ROS/MAPK/p38 pathways-dependent cell apoptosis in hippocampus was diminished. The hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) were all significantly reduced. Ultimately, the alleviated cellular senescence along with the reduction in AD-related markers, coincided with an improvement in learning, memory, and recognition abilities. These findings further elucidated the role of CP in brain iron metabolism, offering a novel target and strategy for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD associated with aging.

AB  - Great progress has been made in diagnosing medical diseases based on deep learning. Large-scale medical data are expected to improve deep learning performance further. It is almost impossible for a single institution to collect so much data due to the time-consuming and costly collection and labeling of medical data. Many studies have turned attention to data sharing among multiple medical institutions. However, due to different data acquiring and processing procedures, multiple institutions' medical data is characterized by distribution heterogeneity. Besides, the protection of patient privacy in medical data sharing has also been a common concern. To simultaneously address the problems of heterogeneous data distribution and privacy protection, we propose a novel multi-source source free domain adaptation. When aligning distributed heterogeneous data, our method only require to transfer the pre-trained source models rather than the direct source domain data, thus protecting patients' privacy. In addition, it has the advantages of being efficient and less costly in network resources. The proposed method is evaluated on the multi-site fMRI database Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and yields an average accuracy of 69.37%. We also analyzed its effectiveness on network resource-saving and conducted additional experiments on Camelyon17 to validate the generalization.

AB  - Introduction: Cannabis sativa L. (CSL) extract has pain-relieving potential due to its cannabinoid content, so the effects of two CSL extracts on alleviating neuropathic pain were investigated in vivo. Methods and groups: Male Wistar rats (n = 130) were divided into groups and received vincristine (0.1 mg/kg) and gabapentin (60 mg/kg) to induce and relieve neuropathic pain or CSL extracts (D and B). The mRNA and protein expression of the cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2 (CB1R, CB2R) were evaluated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and lymphocytes. Behavioural tests (Tail-Flick and von Frey) were performed on all animals. Results: VK-induced neuropathic pain was accompanied by decreased CB1R protein level and CB2R mRNA expression in the cortex. Gabapentin relieved pain and increased CB1R protein levels in the hippocampus compared to the vincristine group. Hippocampus CB1R protein expression increased with the administration of extract D (10 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg) and extract B (7.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) compared to VK group. In the cerebral cortex CSL decreased CB1R protein expression (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg of extract B) and mRNA level (5 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg of extract B; 20 mg/kg of extract D) compared to the VK-group.CB2R protein expression increased in the hippocampus after treatment with extract B (7.5 mg/kg) compared to the VK-group. In the cerebral cortex extract B (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg) increased CB2R protein expression compared to VK-group. Conclusion: Alterations in cannabinoid receptor expression do not fully account for the observed behavioural changes in rats. Therefore, additional signalling pathways may contribute to the initiation and transmission of neuropathic pain. The Cannabis extracts tested demonstrated antinociceptive effects comparable to gabapentin, highlighting the antinociceptive properties of Cannabis extracts for human use.

AB  - Background: Our previous research has demonstrated that hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) can improve spatial learning and memory abilities in adult mice. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been associated with learning and memory. The Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (Notch) was involved in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as in learning and memory. It is currently unclear whether the Notch pathway regulates hippocampal neuroregeneration by modifying the DNA methylation status of the Notch gene following HPC. Method: The HPC animal model and cell model were established through repeated hypoxia exposure using mice and the mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22. Step-down test was conducted on HPC mice. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used to assess the mRNA and protein expression levels of Notch1 and hairy and enhancer of split1 (HES1). The presence of BrdU-positive cells and Notch1 expression in the hippocampal dental gyrus (DG) were examined with confocal microscopy. The methylation status of the Notch1 was analyzed using methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR). HT22 cells were employed to elucidate the impact of HPC on Notch1 in vitro. Results: HPC significantly improved the step-down test performance of mice with elevated levels of mRNA and protein expression of Notch1 and HES1 (P < 0.05). The intensities of the Notch1 signal in the control group, the H group and the HPC group were 2.62 +/- 0.57 x 10(7), 2.87 +/- 0.84 x 10(7), and 3.32 +/- 0.14 x 10(7), respectively, and the number of BrdU (+) cells in the hippocampal DG were 1.83 +/- 0.54, 3.71 +/- 0.64, and 7.29 +/- 0.68 respectively. Compared with that in C and H group, the intensity of the Notch1 signal and the number of BrdU (+) cells increased significantly in HPC group (P < 0.05). The methylation levels of the Notch1 promoter 0.82 +/- 0.03, 0.65 +/- 0.03, and 0.60 +/- 0.02 in the C, H, and HPC groups, respectively. The methylation levels of Notch1 decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The effect of HPC on HT22 cells exhibited similarities to that observed in the hippocampus. Conclusion: HPC may confer neuroprotection by activating the Notch1 signaling pathway and regulating its methylation level, resulting in the regeneration of hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Proliferation of neural stem cells is crucial for promoting neuronal regeneration and repairing cerebral infarction damage. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has recently emerged as a tool for inducing endogenous neural stem cell regeneration, but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that repetitive TMS effectively promotes the proliferation of oxygen-glucose deprived neural stem cells. Additionally, repetitive TMS reduced the volume of cerebral infarction in a rat model of ischemic stroke caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion, improved rat cognitive function, and promoted the proliferation of neural stem cells in the ischemic penumbra. RNA-sequencing found that repetitive TMS activated the Wnt signaling pathway in the ischemic penumbra of rats with cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, PCR analysis revealed that repetitive TMS promoted AKT phosphorylation, leading to an increase in mRNA levels of cell cycle-related proteins such as Cdk2 and Cdk4. This effect was also associated with activation of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which ultimately promotes the proliferation of neural stem cells. Subsequently, we validated the effect of repetitive TMS on AKT phosphorylation. We found that repetitive TMS promoted Ca2+ influx into neural stem cells by activating the P2 calcium channel/calmodulin pathway, thereby promoting AKT phosphorylation and activating the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta/beta-catenin pathway. These findings indicate that repetitive TMS can promote the proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells through a Ca2+ influx-dependent phosphorylated AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway. This study has produced pioneering results on the intrinsic mechanism of repetitive TMS to promote neural function recovery after ischemic stroke. These results provide a strong scientific foundation for the clinical application of repetitive TMS. Moreover, repetitive TMS treatment may not only be an efficient and potential approach to support neurogenesis for further therapeutic applications, but also provide an effective platform for the expansion of neural stem cells.

AB  - This study aimed to revolutionize the conventional lignocellulose refinery approach by capitalizing on the unique composition of Camellia oleifera husks, renowned for a high hemicellulose content compared to cellulose and lignin. The complete removal of hemicellulose was successfully achieved using dilute hydrochloric acid (HA) under optimized conditions (130 degrees C, 500 rpm, 40% solids, and 1 h). The resulting xylose solution, derived from the hemicellulose, served as a valuable resource for furfural production. Remarkably, S-8 macroporous resin exhibited exceptional adsorption properties for furfural, with an impressive maximum adsorption capacity of 335.68 mg g(-1), adhering to the Langmuir model; furthermore, the residual husk material was converted into biomass char (BC), which underwent characterization using FTIR, SEM, and BET techniques. The BC displayed remarkable adsorption capabilities for methylene blue dye, with a maximum theoretical adsorption capacity of 250.63 mg g(-1). Notably, the dilute HA solution and S-8 macroporous resin could be successfully recycled up to five cycles, as the furfural yields consistently exceeded 70%, and the S-8 resin fully regained its initial adsorption capacity after the regeneration process. Mass balance analysis showed that 100 g of C. oleifera husks had the potential to yield 11.3 g of furfural and 35.7 g of BC. These findings unlock promising avenues for sustainable biomass valorization, representing a significant step forward in utilizing C. oleifera husks efficiently.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradually progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting cognition functions. Predicting the cognitive scores from neuroimage measures and identifying relevant imaging biomarkers are important research topics in the study of AD. Despite machine learning algorithms having many successful applications, the prediction model suffers from the so-called curse of dimensionality. Multi-task feature learning (MTFL) has helped tackle this problem incorporating the correlations among multiple clinical cognitive scores. However, MTFL neglects the inherent correlation among brain imaging measures. In order to better predict the cognitive scores and identify stable biomarkers, we first propose a generalized multi-task formulation framework that incorporates the task and feature correlation structures simultaneously. Second, we present a novel featureaware sparsity-inducing norm (FAS-norm) penalty to incorporate a useful correlation between brain regions by exploiting correlations among features. Three multi-task learning models that incorporate the FAS-norm penalty are proposed following our framework. Finally, the algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to optimize the non-smooth problems. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed models on the cross-sectional and longitudinal Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative datasets. The inputs are the thickness measures and the volume measures of the cortical regions of interest. Compared with MTFL, our methods achieve an average decrease of 4.28% in overall error in the cross-sectional analysis and an average decrease of 7.97% in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive total score longitudinal analysis. Moreover, our methods identify sensitive and stable biomarkers to physicians, such as the hippocampus, lateral ventricle, and corpus callosum.

AB  - BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairment in reciprocal social interactions, deficits in communication, and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests. In previous studies, music has been identified as an intervention therapy for children with ASD.ObjectivesThe present study evaluated the effects of music on cognitive behavioral impairments in both sexes of adult rats exposed prenatally to Valproic acid.MethodsFor induction of autism, pregnant female rats were pretreated with either saline or VPA (600 mg/kg.i.p.) at gestational day (GD) 12.5. Male and female offspring were divided into Saline.Non-Music, VPA.Non-Music, Saline.Music, and VPA.Music groups. The adult rats in the music groups were exposed to Mozart's piano sonata K.448 for 30 days (4 h/day), from postnatal day (PND) 60 to 90. Social interaction and Morris water maze (MWM) tasks were tested at PND 90.ResultsOur results revealed that prenatal exposure to VPA decreased sociability and social memory performance in both sexes of adult rats. Moreover, prenatal exposure to VPA created learning and memory impairments in both sexes of adult rats in the MWM task. Music intervention improved sociability in both sexes of VPA-exposed rats and social memory in both sexes of VPA-exposed rats, especially in females. Furthermore, our results revealed that music ameliorated learning impairments in VPA-exposed female rats in the MWM task. In addition, music improved spatial memory impairments in VPA-exposed rats of both sexes, especially in females, which needs more investigation in molecular and histological fields in future studies.ConclusionMusic intervention improved sociability and social memory in adult VPA-exposed rats, especially in female animals. Furthermore, music improved memory impairments in VPA-exposed rats of both sexes. It seems that music had a better influence on female rats. However, future studies need more investigations in molecular and histological fields.

AB  - Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is the main monomeric component extracted from the dried roots and rhizomes of Panax notoginseng, and exerts pharmacological action against myocardial infarction (MI). Owing to the differences in compound distribution, absorption, and metabolism in vivo, exploring a more effective drug delivery system with a high therapeutic targeting effect is crucial. In the early stages of MI, CD11b-expressing monocytes and neutrophils accumulate at infarct sites. Thus, we designed a mesoporous silica nanoparticle-conjugated CD11b antibody with loaded NGR1 (MSN-NGR1-CD11b antibody), which allowed NGR1 precise targeted delivery to the heart in a noninvasively manner. By increasing targeting to the injured myocardium, intravenous injection of MSN-NGR1-CD11b antibody nanoparticle in MI mice improved cardiac function and angiogenesis, reduced cell apoptosis, and regulate macrophage phenotype and inflammatory factors and chemokines. In order to further explore the mechanism of NGR1 protecting myocardium, cell oxidative stress model and oxygenglucose deprivation (OGD) model were established. NGR1 protected H9C2 cells and primary cardiomyocytes against oxidative injury induced by H2O2 and OGD treatment. Further network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses suggested that the AKT, MAPK and Hippo signaling pathways were involved in the regulation of NGR1 in myocardial protection. Indeed, NGR1 could elevate the levels of p-Akt and p-ERK, and promote the nuclear translocation of YAP. Furthermore, LY294002 (AKT inhibitor), U0126 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) and Verteporfin (YAP inhibitor) administration in H9C2 cells indicated the involvement of AKT, MAPK and Hippo signaling pathways in NGR1 effects. Meanwhile, MSN-NGR1-CD11b antibody nanoparticles enhanced the activation of AKT and MAPK signaling pathways and the nuclear translocation of YAP at the infarcted site. Our research demonstrated that MSN-NGR1-CD11b antibody nanoparticle injection after MI enhanced the targeting of NGR1 to the infarcted myocardium and improved cardiac function. More importantly, our pioneering research provides a new strategy for targeting drug delivery systems to the ischemic niche.

AB  - Invasive neural electrodes prepared from materials with a miniaturized geometrical size could improve the longevity of implants by reducing the chronic inflammatory response. Graphene-based microfibers with tunable porous structures have a large electrochemical surface area (ESA)/geometrical surface area (GSA) ratio that has been reported to possess low impedance and high charge injection capacity (CIC), yet control of the porous structure remains to be fully investigated. In this study, we introduce wet-spun graphene-based electrodes with pores tuned by sucrose concentrations in the coagulation bath. The electrochemical properties of thermally reduced rGO were optimized by adjusting the ratio of rGO to sucrose, resulting in significantly lower impedance, higher CIC, and higher charge storage capacity (CSC) in comparison to platinum microwires. Tensile and insertion tests confirmed that optimized electrodes had sufficient strength to ensure a 100% insertion success rate with a low angle shift, thus allowing precise implantation without the need for additional mechanical enhancement. Acute in vivo recordings from the auditory cortex found low impedance benefits from the recorded amplitude of spikes, leading to an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Ex vivo recordings from hippocampal brain slices demonstrate that it is possible to record and stimulate with graphene-based electrodes with good fidelity compared with conventional electrodes.

AB  - Whether it is a plant- or animal-based bio-inspiration design, it has always been able to address one or more product/component optimisation issues. Today's scientists or engineers look to nature for an optimal, economically viable, long-term solution. Similarly, a proposal is made in this current work to use seven different bio-inspired structures for automotive impact resistance. All seven of these structures are derived from plant and animal species and are intended to be tested for compressive loading to achieve load-bearing capacity. The work may even cater to optimisation techniques to solve the real-time problem using algorithm-based generative shape designs built using CATIA V6 in unit dimension. The samples were optimised with Rhino 7 software and then simulated with ANSYS workbench. To carry out the comparative study, an experimental work of bioprinting in fused deposition modelling (3D printing) was carried out. The goal is to compare the results across all formats and choose the best-performing concept. The results were obtained for compressive load, flexural load, and fatigue load conditions, particularly the number of life cycles, safety factor, damage tolerance, and bi-axiality indicator. When compared to previous research, the results are in good agreement. Because of their multifunctional properties combining soft and high stiffness and lightweight properties of novel materials, novel materials have many potential applications in the medical, aerospace, and automotive sectors.

AB  - We aimed to study mechanisms controlling metastatic outgrowth of melanoma into clinically relevant lesions, a critical process responsible for the majority of melanoma deaths. To this end, we developed novel in vivo models and identified molecular events that can be ascribed to their distinct phenotypes, indolent or highly metastatic. Induction of a proliferative state at distant sites was associated with high levels of the stem-like/progenitor marker, SOX2, and required the upregulation of FMOD, an extracellular matrix component, which modulates tumor-stroma interactions. Functional studies revealed a possible link between FMOD and SOX2; dual FMOD and SOX2 silencing nearly abolished brain metastasis and had a similar effect on distant metastasis to other sites. Our in vitro data suggests that FMOD and SOX2 cooperation plays an important role in tumor vasculogenic mimicry. Furthermore, we found that FMOD and SOX2 functional roles might converge at the activation of transcriptional co-factors YAP and TAZ, possibly via crosstalk with the tumor suppressor Hippo pathway. Finally, high expression of both genes in patient specimens predicted early development of brain metastasis. Thus, our study identifies FMOD and SOX2 cooperation as a novel regulatory mechanism that might be linked functionally to melanoma metastatic competence.

This medicine can prevent diseases and play a certain role in fighting altitude sickness with cerebral ischemia. Aim of the study: This study used LC-MS to analyse the chemical constituents of Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills, which laid a foundation for the improvement of the quality standard and the basic research of pharmacodynamics substances. This study aims to reveal the mechanism of Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills on cerebral ischemia from the perspective of the inflammatory and apoptotic pathway. Materials and method: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS was used to analyse the chemical constituents of Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills qualitatively. HPLC-QQQ-MS was used to analyse the contents of Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills quantitatively. The therapeutic target and pathway of Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills in the treatment of ischemic stroke were predicted on the basis of network pharmacology. On the basis of the MCAO rat model, the cerebral infarction rate (TTC staining) and the number of Nissl bodies (toluidine blue staining) were measured, the pathological morphologies of cortex and hippocampus were observed (HE staining), and the mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. The protein expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase3 in the ischemic brain tissue of rats were determined using the WB method.Results: A total of 42 chemical constituents, including 11 triterpenoids, 10 flavonoids, 8 organic acids and their derivatives, 4 diterpenoids, 4 tannins, 2 steroids, and 3 other components, were identified from Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. HPLC-QQQ-MS results found that among the 16 different batches, the content difference between the two batches of preparations with the national drug approval number was small and that the quality was stable. However, significant differences were observed among the preparations of nine medical institutions. Network pharmacology study found that the effect of Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills might be related to the AGE-rage and tumour necrosis factor signalling pathways. Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills could improve the neuro-behavioral abnormalities of MCAO rats, reduce the rate of cerebral infarction, improve the pathological changes in the hippocampal area of brain tissue, and increase the number of Nissl body in the brain tissue. Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills tended to reduce the mRNA transcription levels of Bax, Caspase-3, p65, c-fos and VEGF-A and increase the expression of Bcl-2 and MAPK8 mRNA. Moreover, the Bax protein expression tended to decrease, and the bcl-2 protein expression tended to increase.Conclusions: A total of 42 chemical components were qualitatively identified from Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills, and 16 chemical components from 16 batches were determined. These components improved the quality standard level of Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills and provided reference for the later exploration of its pharmacodynamics substance basis. The protective mechanism of Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills against ischemic stroke might be related to the downregulation of the apoptosis factor caspase-3.

AB  - Background. Abdominal aortic occlusion (AAO) occurs frequently and causes ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury to distant organs. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether AAO induced I/R injury and subsequent damage in cardiac and neurologic tissue. We also aimed to investigate the how length of ischemic time in AAO influences reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammatory marker levels in the heart, brain, and serum. Methods. Sixty male C57BL/6 mice were used in this study. The mice were randomly divided into either sham group or AAO group. The AAO group was further subdivided into 1-4 hr groups of aortic occlusion times. The infrarenal abdominal aorta was clamped for 1-4 hr depending on the AAO group and was then reperfused for 24 hr after clamp removal. Serum, hippocampus, and left ventricle tissue samples were then subjected to biochemical and histopathological analyses. Results. AAO-induced I/R injury had no effect on cell necrosis, cell apoptosis, or ROS production. However, serum and hippocampus levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased in AAO groups when compared to sham group. Superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity decreased in the serum, hippocampus, and left ventricle. In the serum, AAO increased the level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and decreased the levels of anti-inflammatory factors (such as arginase-1), transforming growth factor- beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), interleukin 4 (IL-4), and interleukin 10 (IL-10). In the hippocampus, AAO increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-4, and IL-6, and decreased the level of TGF-beta 1. In the left ventricle, AAO increased the level of iNOS and decreased the levels of TGF-beta 1, IL-4, and IL-10. Conclusions. AAO did not induce cell necrosis or apoptosis in cardiac or neurologic tissue, but it can cause inflammation in the serum, brain, and heart.

AB  - Environmental enrichment devices (EEDs) have been proven to promote positive wellbeing in zoos and aquariums, and support animals' reintroduction success; however, their use in rehabilitation centers is still limited. This pilot study investigated the safety and efficacy of three EEDs, Artificial Kelp, Horse KONG((TM)) and Wubba Kong((TM)), and their ability to decrease and/or eliminate undesired stereotypic behaviors or looking at staff/staff areas in seven wild California sea lions (CSLs) and eight northern elephant seals (NESs) undergoing rehabilitation in Southern California. Observers conducted instantaneous sampling once a minute during a 30-min baseline, followed by a 30-min EED implementation on one focal animal at a time. The data were analyzed with generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). All three EEDs were found to be durable and safe throughout the study. Our results show a significant reduction in stereotypical behaviors compared to no EED treatments in CSLs, with the most significant effect being with the Horse KONG((TM)). The Wubba KONG (TM) and Artificial Kelp provisions also reduced the undesired behavior in both species of being focused on human caretakers. Individual preferences for specific EEDs were found within species and between species, with the NESs using EEDs more than the CSLs. This study highlights the beneficial aspect of EEDs for pinnipeds in rehabilitation centers for improving their quality of life.

AB  - Grape juice consumption may influence the early occurrence of ductal constriction during pregnancy, since the consumption of foods rich in polyphenols can be linked to the premature constriction of the ductus arteriosus. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of purple grape juice consumption during gestation on fetal ductus arteriosus closure, prostaglandin levels, and oxidative stress markers in Wistar rats. We divided 18 pregnant rats into four groups: a control group (C), a single-dose grape juice group (SDGJ), a two-dose grape juice group (TDGJ) of 7 mu l/g body weight per day, and an indomethacin group (I). Blood was collected on gestational day (GD) 0, 14, and 20. Prostaglandin levels were measured, and the livers and hearts were removed from the mothers and fetuses for oxidative stress analysis; histology of the fetal ductus arteriosus was performed. Prostaglandin levels (pg/ml) at GD 20 were (C:1462.10 +/- 314.61); (SDGJ:987.66 +/- 86.25); (TDGJ:1290.00 +/- 221.57), and (I:584.75 +/- 46.77). Fetal ductus arteriosus closure occurred only in the indomethacin group. Lipid peroxidation evaluated through thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (nmol/mg protein) in maternal livers was lower in the grape juice groups (C: 4.11 +/- 0.76 nmol/mg protein), (SDGJ: 2.34 +/- 0.36), (TDGJ: 1.52 +/- 0.18), and (I: 4.20 +/- 0.76). Sulfhydryls (nmol/mg protein) were lower in the TDGJ group (C:763.59 +/- 61.38 nmol/mg protein), (SDGJ:978.88 +/- 158.81), (TDGJ:385.32 +/- 86.78), and (I:727.72 +/- 49.12). Also, superoxide dismutase activity (USOD/mg protein) was higher in fetal hearts in this group: (C:5.29 +/- 0.33), (SDGJ:4.48 +/- 0.47), (TDGJ:7.35 +/- 0.43), and (I:6.00 +/- 0.18). We conclude that grape juice consumption in pregnancy does not induce ductus arteriosus closure in the fetus and presented potential antioxidant effects.

AB  - Background Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs), the precursors of trophoblast cells of placenta, possess the potential to differentiate into various trophoblastic subtypes in vitro. Establishment of extraembryonic trophoblastic lineage is preceded by the "outside versus inside" positional information in preimplantation embryos, critically synchronized by the Hippo components. Abundant expression of Hippo effector YAP in TSCs and differentiated cells with paucity of information on Hippo regulation of TSC proliferation/differentiation led us test the hypothesis that Hippo dynamics is one of the regulators of TSC proliferation/differentiation. Methods Blastocyst-derived murine TSCs were used. Dynamics of Hippo components were analyzed using immunofluorescence, western blotting, immunoprecipitation, qRT-PCR. Interaction studies were performed using full-length and deletion constructs. BrdU incorporation assay, flow cytometry-based polyploidy analysis and confocal microscopy were used to decipher the underlying mechanism. Results YAP translocates to the nucleus in TSCs and utilizes its WW2 domain to interact with the PPQY motif of the stemness factor, CDX2. YAP limits TSC proliferation with associated effect on CDX2 target CyclinD1. Trophoblast giant cells (TGC) differentiation is associated with cytoplasmic retention of YAP, heightened pYAP(Ser127), decrease in the level of the core Hippo component, LATS1, which thereby impedes LATS1-LIMK2 association. Decreased LATS1-LIMK2 complex formation in TGCs was associated with elevated pLIMK2(Thr505) as well as its target pCOFILIN(Ser3). Precocious overexpression of LATS1 during trophoblast differentiation decreased TGC marker, Prl2c2, diminished pLIMK2(Thr505) and inactive COFILIN (pCOFILIN(Ser3)) while COFILIN-phosphatase, CHRONOPHIN remained unchanged. LATS1 overexpression inhibited trophoblast endoreduplication with smaller-sized TGC-nuclei, lower ploidy level and disintegrated actin filaments. Inhibition of LIMK2 activity recapitulated the effects of LATS1 overexpression in trophoblast cells. Conclusion These results unveil a multilayered regulation of trophoblast self-renewal and differentiation by the Hippo components.

AB  - Hypothyroid encephalopathy refers to cognitive impairment caused by hypothyroidism, which is caused by low thyroid hormone signal in the brain, and further leads to an increase in oxidative stress level, a decrease in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and even affects the signal transmission process between neurons. However, traditional hormone replacement therapy (HRT) only restores the thyroid hormone concentration in serum, not in the brain, which leads to damage to hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the brain that can't be repaired. In addition, there is also oxidative damage, which makes the symptoms of encephalopathy still persist, and indicates the need for a new collaborative treatment approach for hypothyroid encephalopathy disease. In this study, a synergistic therapy system is constructed using Zn-Curcumin-based metal-organic framework (medi-MOF-1) with levothyroxine-4 is loaded (LT4@medi-MOF-1). The results showed that LT4@medi-MOF-1 can efficiently deliver thyroid hormone into the brain, co-release hormones and curcumin, and restore thyroid hormone levels in the brain. Furthermore, the curcumin can repair oxidative damage, and hormones and curcumin can work together to enhance synaptic plasticity. In the hypothyroidism rat model, LT4@medi-MOF-1 exhibits excellent capacity in ameliorating spatial learning and memory deficits, and shows the potential of a hypothyroid encephalopathy agent for cooperative treatment.

AB  - Purpose: To explore if the total body gamma-irradiation at a dose of 0.1 Gy 7 days prior to acute mixed gamma, n-irradiation of the head at the dose of 1 Gy can reduce the harmful effects of neutron irradiation on the hippocampal functions, neuroinflammation and neurogenesis.
   Materials and methods: Mice were exposed to gamma-radiation alone, mixed gamma,n-radiation or combined gamma-rays and gamma,n-radiation 7 days after gamma-irradiation. Two months post-irradiation, mice were tested in Open Field and in the Morris water maze. The content of microglia, astrocytes, proliferating cells and cytokines TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, GFAP levels, hippocampal BDNF, NT-3, NT-4, NGF mRNA expression were evaluated.
   Results: Two months after combined irradiation, we observed impaired hippocampus-dependent cognition, which was not detected in mice exposed to gamma,n-irradiation. Combined exposure and gamma,n-irradiation led to a significant increase in the level of activated microglia and astrocytes in the brains. The level of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the brain and hippocampal neurotrophine's genes changed differenly after the combined exposure and gamma,n-irradiation. The quantity of DCX-positive cells was reduced after gamma,n-irradiation exposer alone, but increased after combined irradiation.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate radio-adaptive responses in brains of mice that were exposed to low-dose gamma irradiation 7 days prior to acute 1 Gy gamma,n-irradiation.

AB  - Cognitive decline and memory impairment induced by oxidative brain damage are the critical pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based on the potential neuroprotective effects of AD-1 small molecule, we here explored the possible underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of AD-1 small molecule against scopolamine-induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. According to our findings, scopolamine administration resulted in increased AChE activity, MDA levels, and decreased antioxidant enzymes, as well as the downregulation of the antioxidant response proteins of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression; however, treatment with AD-1 small molecule mitigated the generation of oxidant factors while restoring the antioxidant enzymes status, in addition to improving antioxidant protein levels. Similarly, AD-1 small molecule significantly increased the protein expression of neuroprotective markers such as BDNF and CREB and promoted memory processes in scopolamine-induced mice. Western blot analysis showed that AD-1 small molecule reduced activated microglia and astrocytes via the attenuation of iba-1 and GFAP protein expression. We also found that scopolamine enhanced the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B/MAPK signaling and, conversely, that AD-1 small molecule significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B/MAPK signaling in the brain regions of hippocampus and cortex. We further found that scopolamine promoted neuronal loss by inducing Bax and caspase-3 and reducing the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. In contrast, AD-1 small molecule significantly decreased the levels of apoptotic markers and increased neuronal survival. Furthermore, AD-1 small molecule ameliorated scopolamine-induced impairments in spatial learning behavior and memory formation. These findings revealed that AD-1 small molecule attenuated scopolamine-induced cognitive and memory dysfunction by ameliorating AChE activity, oxidative brain damage, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - The prevalence of age-related cognitive impairment is increasing as the proportion of older individuals in the population grows. It is therefore necessary and urgent to find agents to prevent or ameliorate age-related cognitive impairment. Selenomethionine (SeMet) is a natural amino acid occurring in yeast and Brazil nuts. It mitigates cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, however, whether it works on age-related cognitive impairment remains unknown. In this study, SeMet significantly improved the performance of D-galactose-treated mice in the novel object recognition test, passive avoidance task and Morris water maze test. SeMet reversed D-galactose-induced reduction of hippocampal acetylcholine levels, suppression of choline acetyltransferase activity and activation of acetyl cholinesterase. It decreased D-galactose-induced oxidative stress and increased the selenoprotein P levels in the hippocampus. Besides, it attenuated D-galactose-induced dysbiosis by increasing the alpha-diversity and modulating the taxonomic structure. Correlations between certain taxa and physiological parameters were observed. Our results provide evidence of the effectiveness of SeMet on ameliorating D-galactose-induced cognitive impairment and suggest SeMet has potential to be used in the prevention or adjuvant treatment of age-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - The role of sniffing relative to immune function has attracted considerable attention. The present study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of peanut oil odor on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppressed mice. The subset of mice subjected to prolonged (8 h) sniffing peanut oil odor (PL) demonstrated significantly elevated levels of agouti-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, and glutamate (p < 0.05), whereas it significantly down-regulated the level of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the brain (p < 0.05). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry results indicated significantly increased expression of mGluR1/5 and decreased expression of GABA(B)R in the hippocampus and hypothalamus (p < 0.05) of the PL group. Additionally, the PL group had significantly up-regulated expression levels of cAMP, Epac, Rap1, ERK1/2 and PKA (p < 0.05) and remarkably increased phosphorylation of CREB in the cAMP signaling pathway (p < 0.05), which influenced the central nervous system. Moreover, compared with CTX-induced mice, the percentages of peripheral blood T lymphocytes (CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+)) and the levels of splenic cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, and TNF-alpha) were significantly increased following PL treatment (p < 0.05). The PL group also showed significantly up-regulated expression levels of cAMP, p-p65, and p-I kappa B alpha in the spleen (p < 0.05) by western blot analysis. In summary, PL intervention significantly up-regulated the expression levels of cAMP in the brain (p < 0.05), with subsequent transfer of cAMP to the spleen which promoted phosphorylation of p65 and I kappa B alpha. This series of events enhanced the immunity of mice, which confirmed the regulatory effect of PL on the cAMP signaling pathway, thereby enhancing immune function via the brain-spleen axis.

TI  - Ketogenic diet attenuates microglia-mediated neuroinflammation by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation via HDAC3 inhibition to activate mitophagy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis

AB  - The activation of microglia is an important cause of central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS). NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated signaling plays a decisive role in microglial activation. Mitophagy is closely related to NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation. Previous studies have shown that ketogenic diet (KD) suppresses microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and exerts mitophagy-stimulating effects, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. The current study examined the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of KD on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our data show that KD inhibited demyelination, increased co-staining of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM20) and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3II), and decreased microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the hippocampus of EAE mice. Further correlation analysis showed that the reduction of HDAC3 was negatively correlated with NLRP3 activation and positively correlated with the induction of mitophagy in KD-fed EAE mice. In BV2 microglial cells, we confirmed that the inhibition of HDAC3 promoted 5 ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase (ULK)1 and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-meditated mitophagy, which led to the up-regulation of acetylated AMPK, acetylated ULK1 and acetylated Parkin, and subsequently reduced ROS accumulation and inhibited the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a specific autophagy inhibitor, abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of HDAC3 inhibition in BV2 cells. The study illustrates that KD ameliorates EAE by reducing NLRP3-mediated inflammation in microglial cells via HDAC3 inhibition and enhancement of mitophagy-related protein acetylation.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia is associated with memory deficits. Bavachinin, a natural flavonoid derived from Psoralea Corylifolia seeds, exhibits various pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-allergic activities. We looked into the neuroprotective effects of bavachinin on rats' memory impairments brought on by transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Blocked carotid arteries caused transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Wistar male rats were randomized to bavachinin, ischemia/reperfusion, and sham groups. After surgery, bavachinin (100 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally once a day for seven days. Spatial memory was evaluated using the Morris water maze test. The vitality of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons was assessed by Nissl staining. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1(3) has been detected using ELISA. Oxidative stress was evaluated by determining the hippocampal levels of malondialdehyde (MDA). In rats with transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, bevacichinin markedly improved the performance of learning. The bavachinin-treated group had a higher number of surviving pyramidal neurons, as demonstrated by the Nissl staining. In the hippocampus, bevacichinin lowered MDA, TNF-alpha, and IL-1(3 levels. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of bavachinin likely protect against memory impairment caused by transient cerebral ischemia. These findings suggest that bavachinin could be a potent therapeutic agent for the prevention of cognitive deficits and neuronal damage associated with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. More studies are needed to explore its clinical applications and mechanisms of action.

AB  - Food protein-derived peptides with agonistic effects on receptors have great potential for treating anxiety, hypertension, and stress. In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for delta-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of beta-casomorphin (CM-10) (beta-casein 60-69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards delta- and mu-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for delta- and mu-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized delta-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of delta- or mu-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut delta- and/or mu-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.

AB  - Epilepsy frequently leads to cognitive dysfunction and approaches to treatment remain limited. Although regular exercise effectively improves learning and memory functions across multiple neurological diseases, its application in patients with epilepsy remains controversial. Here, we adopted a 14-day treadmill-exercise paradigm in a pilocarpine injection-induced mouse model of epilepsy. Cognitive assays confirmed the improvement of object and spatial memory after endurance training, and electrophysiological studies revealed the maintenance of hippocampal plasticity as a result of physical exercise. Investigations of the mechanisms underlying this effect revealed that exercise protected parvalbumin interneurons, probably via the suppression of neuroinflammation and improved integrity of blood-brain barrier. In summary, this work identified a previously unknown mechanism through which exercise improves cognitive rehabilitation in epilepsy.

AB  - Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a congenital organic acidemia characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction due to the abnormal accumulation of intermediate metabolites, which subsequently leads to brain damage. Currently, there are no specific pharmacological treatments available for MMA in clinical practice. Costunolide (COS) is a sesquiterpenoid compound derived from Radix Aucklandiae, it exhibits a broad spectrum of bioactivities. However, its effects on MMA have not yet been evaluated. For in-vivo studies, the MMA rat model was established by subcutaneous injection of methylmalonic acid (MA). The spatial learning memory flexibility observed by Morris water maze and brain damage were restored in MMA rats after COS treatment. JC-1 detection and measurements of oxidative stress indicators were performed to demonstrate that the abnormal mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and oxidative stress levels were recovered in hippocampus of MMA rats after COS (20 mg/kg) treatment. The abnormal expression of autophagy-related proteins induced by MMA was also rectified following COS treatment. In-vitro research utilized PC12 cells to further investigate the underlying mechanisms of COS in regulating MMA. Our results indicated that COS (20 mu M) ameliorated the oxidative stress level and mitophagy. Pink1 knockdown reversed the apoptosis rate and MMP which were improved by COS (20 mu M). Concurrently, the beneficial effects of COS on ATP concentration, ROS level and autophagy related protein expression level were also offset by PINK1 knockdown. In conclusion, our study confirms that COS promotes mitochondrial autophagy and mitigates oxidative stress via the PINK1/Parkin pathway, thereby improving cognitive impairments associated with MMA.

AB  - Clinical and epidemiological studies indicate that diabetic cognitive impairment often occurs in diabetes mellitus patients. Matrine (Mat), an active component of Sophora flavescens Ait root extracts, has widely pharmacological activities including anti-tumor, anti-diabetes, cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects. The present study was designed to elucidate the possibly neuroprotective effects of Mat against diabetic spatial learning and memory impairment caused by high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection in mice. The results showed that Mat treatment significantly ameliorated fasting blood glucose level, impaired glucose tolerance, and lipid metabolism disorder in diabetic mice. In addition, diabetic mice exhibited spatial learning and memory impairment in the Morris water maze test, which could be attenuated by Mat treatment. Moreover, administration of Mat remarkably alleviated histological damage in diabetic hippocampus. Also, further investigations showed that Mat treatment abated endoplasmic reticulum stress induced hippocampal ultra-structure injury as evidenced by increasing the numbers of rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, as well as down-regulating endo-plasmic reticulum stress related protein levels (GRP78, CHOP, ATF6 and Caspase-12). Furthermore, adminis-tration of Mat enhanced hippocampal protein expressions of PK2, PKR1 and PKR2, which decreased significantly in diabetic mice. Collectively, these findings suggested that Mat could ameliorate diabetes-induced spatial learning and memory impairment, possibly by alleviating ER stress, and partly through modulation of PK2/PKRs pathway.

AB  - Zinc deficiency during pregnancy and severe zinc deficiency after birth both impaired learning and memory ability, but the effects of marginal zinc deficiency (MZD) after birth on learning and memory are unclear. In the first experiment, 4-week-old male rats were randomly divided into three groups: the marginal zinc-deficient group (MZG, 10 mg kg(-1), 1/3 RNI), normal zinc group (NZG, 30 mg kg(-1), RNI), and paired zinc group (PZG, 30 mg kg(-1)). After a 4-week feeding period, the brain weight, brain coefficient, and serum zinc concentration were measured, and hippocampal proteomics analysis was performed. In the second experiment, 4-week-old male rats were fed the same diet for 8 weeks. In addition to the previously mentioned indicators, the Morris water maze results, brain pathology, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of hippocampal proteins, and the concentrations of indicators known to be related to learning and memory were analyzed. In both experiments, compared with those of the NZG, the food intake, body weight and serum zinc of the MZG were significantly decreased, and the brain weight was unchanged, but the brain coefficient was increased. Two hippocampal proteomics analyses and PTM screening showed that MZD did not change the expression and PTM of proteins. The brain pathology, learning, memory and the concentrations of indicators known to be related to learning and memory were not changed by MZD. Our study confirmed that marginal zinc deficiency (10 mg kg(-1), 1/3 RNI) had no effect on the learning and memory abilities of rats after birth.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is identified by pathological hallmarks such as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular amyloid beta plaques. Several hypotheses exist to define the neurodegeneration including microglial activation associated with neuroinflammatory processes. Recently, pharmacological inhibition of endocannabinoid (eCB)-degrading enzymes, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), is being investigated to modulate the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. While MAGL inhibitors upregulate 2-acyl glycerol (2-AG) levels and reduce neuroinflammation, FAAH inhibitors elevate anandamide (AEA) levels and prevent the degradation of HSP-70, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of tau protein and formation of NFTs in neural cells. We investigated the possible neuroprotective potential of the dual MAGL/FAAH inhibitor JZL-195 (20 mg/kg) against ICV-STZ-induced sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) in Swiss albino mice using donepezil (5 mg/kg) as the standard. The protective effects of JZL-195 were observed by the reversal of altered levels of A beta(1-42), HSP-70, neuroinflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress markers. However, JZL-195 expressed no cognitive improvement when assessed by spontaneous alternation behavior and Morris water maze tests and no effects on the AChE enzyme level in the hippocampal tissues of mice. Therefore, the findings of the present study indicate that although JZL-195 exhibited no improvement in cognitive deficits associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, it displayed significant reversal of the biochemical anomalies, thereby suggesting its therapeutic potential against the sporadic Alzheimer's disease model.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated ROS generation are predominant contributors of neuronal death that is responsible for the diabetes-related cognitive impairments. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that long noncoding RNA-MEG3 can serve as an important regulator in the pathogenesis of diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be further clarified. Here, it was observed that MEG3 was significantly down-regulated in STZ (streptozotocin)-induced diabetic rats. MEG3 overexpression noticeably improved diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunctions, accompanied by the abatement of Rac1 activation and ROS production, as well as the inhibition of mitochondria-associated apoptosis. Furthermore, either MEG3 overexpression or Rac1 inhibition promoted FUNDC1 dephosphorylation and suppressed oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation. Similarly, in vitro studies confirmed that hyperglycemia also down-regulated MEG3 expression in PC12 cells. MEG3 reintroduction protected PC12 cells against hyperglycemia-triggered neurotoxicity by improving mitochondrial fitness and repressing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, these neuroprotective effects of MEG3 relied on FUNDC1-related mitophagy, since silencing of FUNDC1 abolished these beneficial outcomes. Additionally, MEG3 rescued HG-induced neurotoxicity was involved in inhibiting Rac1 expression via interaction with Rac1 3'UTR. Conversely, knockdown of MEG3 showed opposite effects. NSC23766, a specific inhibitor of Rac1, fully abolished harmful effects of MEG3 depletion. Consistently, knockdown of Rac1 potentiated FUNDC1-associated mitophagy. Meanwhile, colocalization of Rac1 and FUNDC1 was found in mitochondria under hyperglycemia, which was interrupted by MEG3 overexpression. Furthermore, silencing of Rac1 promoted PGAM5 expression, and FUNDC1 strongly interacted with LC3 in Rac1-deleted cells. Altogether, our findings suggested that the Rac1/ROS axis may be a downstream signaling pathway for MEG3-induced neuroprotection, which was involved in FUNDC1-associated mitophagy.

AB  - Sevoflurane is an inhalation anesthetic in pediatric anesthesia which may cause cognitive dysfunction. Our study explores the mechanisms of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in neonatal rats. A neonatal rat model was established by 3% sevoflurane exposure. After FTO or miR-188-5p overexpression in rats, the motor and cognitive function and hippocampal tissue were tested. A cell model was established by 3% sevoflurane exposure in hippocampal neuronal cells. After FTO overexpression, cell viability, apoptosis, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were detected. The enrichment of m6A on the pri-miR-188 was analyzed. The binding of miR-188-5p to the SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) 3'UTR sequence was detected. Sevoflurane exposure triggered cognitive impairment in neonatal rats and decreased FTO expression in hippocampus. FTO upregulation reduced cognitive impairment in neonatal rats and hippocampal neuronal cell damage in vitro. In hippocampus and cell models, FTO inhibited miR-188-5p expression by removing m6A modification on pri-miR-188. miR-188-5p inhibited SOX4 expression. miR-188-5p overexpression or SOX4 inhibition partially reversed the protective effects of FTO overexpression on hippocampal neuronal cell damage. Overexpression of miR-188-5p partially reversed the alleviative effects of FTO overexpression on cognitive impairment. In conclusion, FTO attenuates cognitive impairment in neonatal rats through the miR-188-5p/SOX4 axis via m6A modification.

AB  - Background: Renal calculi are a very prevalent disease with a high incidence. Calcium oxalate (CaOx) is a primary constituent of kidney stones. Our paper probes the regulatory function and mechanism of miR-184 in CaOx-mediated renal cell damage.Methods: CaOx was used to treat HK2 cells and human podocytes (HPCs) to simulate kidney cell damage. The qRT-PCR technique checked the profiles of miR-184 and IGF1R. The examination of cell proliferation was conducted employing CCK8. TUNEL staining was used to monitor cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein profiles of apoptosis-concerned related proteins (including Mcl1, Bcl-XL, and Caspase3), the NF-KB, Nrf2/HO-1, and Rap1 signaling pathways. ELISA confirmed the levels of the inflammatory factors IL-6, TNF-alpha, MCP1, and ICAM1. The targeting relationship between miR-184 and IGF1R was validated by dual luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay.Results: Glyoxylate-induced rat kidney stones model and HK2 and HPC cells treated with CaOx demonstrated an increase in the miR-184 profile. Inhibiting miR-184 relieved CaOx-mediated renal cell inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress and activated the Rap1 pathway. IGF1R was targeted by miR-184. IGF1R activation by IGF1 attenuated the effects of miR-184 on renal cell damage, and Hippo pathway suppression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-184 knockdown on renal cell impairment.Conclusions: miR-184 downregulation activates the Rap1 signaling pathway to ameliorate renal cell damage mediated by CaOx.

AB  - Accumulating evidence of the critical role of Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, ferroptosis inhibitor) in cerebral ischemia has intrigued us to explore the molecular mechanistic actions of Fer-1 delivery by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles (MSCs-EVs) in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in hippocampal neurons were developed to simulate cerebral I/R injury. After Fer-1 was confirmed to be successfully delivered by MSCs-EVs to neurons, we found that MSCs-EVs loaded with Fer-1 (MSCs-EVs/Fer-1) reduced neuron apoptosis and enhanced viability, along with curtailed inflammation and ferroptosis. The regulation of Fer-1 on GPX4/COX2 axis was predicted by bioinformatics study and validated by functional experiments. The in vivo experiments further confirmed that MSCs-EVs/Fer-1 ameliorated cerebral I/R injury in mice. Furthermore, poor expression of GPX4 and high expression of COX-2 were witnessed in cerebral I/R injury models. MSCs-EVs/Fer-1 exerted its protective effects against cerebral I/R injury by upregulating GPX4 expression and inhibiting COX-2 expression. Taken together, our study indicates that MSCs-EVs/Fer-1 may be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury due to its anti-ferroptotic properties.

AB  - Our previous study revealed that G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor-30 (GPR30) agonist G1 serves as a viable alternative neuroprotectant of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) to attenuate neuroinflammation and improve cognitive function after global cerebral ischemia (GCI). Aromatase, the key enzyme of E2 biosynthesis, is widely expressed in animal and human brain, and its expression and activity are mediated by selective estrogen receptor modulators. In the present study, we explored the long-term protective and reparative effects of G1 in ovariectomized rats after GCI. We used the aromatase inhibitor letrozole to elucidate whether G1 and brain-derived E2 together induce beneficial effects. Our results showed that G1 administration for 28 days a) significantly increased neurogenesis in the hippocampal sub-granular zone and CA1 regions; b) declined CA1 neuronal impairment in a long-term fashion; c) enhanced expression of synaptic proteins and cognitive function; d) and prevented reactive astrocytes loss, wherein aromatase and brain-derived estrogen levels were markedly increased. Additionally, expression and activation of transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were increased in CA1 astrocytes of G1-treated animals. Letrozole abolished all of the observed benefits of G1. Our results suggest that GPR30 activation mediates long-term neuroprotection and neurogenesis in the hippocampus following GCI, with potential mechanism coupling with the activation of astroglial aromatase-STAT3 signaling.

AB  - Objective. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a fatal gynecological malignancy. This study explored the mechanism of TAZ in regulating drug sensitivity of cisplatin (DDP-)-resistant EOC cells through the ANGPTL4/SOX2 axis. Methods. The A2780/DDP cells were prepared by stepwise progressive concentration method. The drug resistance and TAZ expression in EOC cells were determined. Drug sensitivity was measured after TAZ overexpression in A2780 cells and TAZ downregulation in A2780/DDP cells, respectively. The effects of TAZ knockdown on apoptosis rate, stemness, and cancer stem cell (CSC) marker (CD44, OCT4, and ALDH1A) levels in A2780/DDP and DDP-treated A2780/DDP cells were assessed. The binding of TAZ and ANGPTL4 was verified using ChIP-qPCR, and ANGPTL4 and SOX2 levels were determined. The effects of different combined treatments of TAZ, ANGPTL4, and SOX2 on drug sensitivity of A2780/DDP cells and DDP-treated A2780/DDP cells were evaluated. Results. TAZ was upregulated in drug-resistant EOC cells. TAZ knockdown significantly increased the drug sensitivity of A2780/DDP cells, while TAZ overexpression markedly decreased the drug sensitivity of A2780 cells. TAZ silencing promoted apoptosis of drug-resistant EOC cells and inhibited cell stemness. TAZ targeted ANGPTL4 and TAZ silencing enhanced drug sensitivity of A2780/DDP cells by inhibiting ANGPTL4. ANGPTL4 overexpression elevated SOX2 expression, and SOX2 downregulation reduced the drug resistance and promoted the apoptosis of A2780/DDP cells. Conclusion. TAZ regulates DDP sensitivity of drug-resistant EOC cells via the ANGPTL4/SOX2 axis.

AB  - Although doxorubicin (DOX) is used in many cancer treatments, it causes neurotoxicity. In this study, the effect of thymoquinone (THQ), a powerful antioxidant, on DOX-induced neurotoxicity was evaluated. In total, 40 rats were used and 5 groups were formed. Group I: control group (n = 8); Group II: olive oil group (n = 8); Group III: the THQ group (n = 8); THQ 10 mg/kg per day was given intraperitoneally (i.p.) throughout the experiment; group IV: DOX group (n = 8); On Day 7 of the experiment, a single dose of 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally DOX injected; group V: DOX + THQ group (n = 8); Throughout the experiment, 10 mg/kg THQ per day and intraperitoneally 15 mg/kg DOX on Day 7 were injected. Immunohistochemically, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-17 (IL-17), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1-alpha), glucose regulatory protein 78 (GRP78), and the gene inducible by growth arrest and DNA damage 153 (GADD153) proteins were evaluated in the brain cortex, medulla, and hippocampus regions. Total oxidant status (TOS) levels and total antioxidant status (TAS) in the brain tissue were measured. TNF-alpha, IL-17, HIF1-alpha, GRP78, and GADD153 immunoreactivities significantly increased in the DOX group in the study. THQ significantly reduced these values. THQ increased the TAS level significantly and decreased the TOS level significantly compared to the DOX group. THQ may play a role as a neuroprotective agent in DOX-induced neurotoxicity in the cortex, medulla, and hippocampus regions of the brain.

AB  - Chronic hyperglycemia-induced neuropathological changes include neuronal apoptosis, astrogliosis, decrease in neurotrophic support, impaired synaptic plasticity, and impaired protein quality control (PQC) system. Vitamin B12 is indispensable for neuronal development and brain function. Several studies reported the neuroprotective effect of B12 supplementation in diabetic patients. However, the underlying molecular basis for the neuro-protective effect of B12 supplementation in diabetes needs to be thoroughly investigated. Two-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into three groups: Control (CN), diabetes (D; induced with streptozotocin; STZ), and diabetic rats supplemented with vitamin B12 (DBS; vitamin B12; 50 mu g/kg) for four months. At the end of 4 months of experimentation, the brain was dissected to collect the cerebral cortex (CC). The morphology of CC was investigated with H&E and Nissl body staining. Neuronal apoptosis was determined with TUNEL assay. The components of neurotrophic support, astrogliosis, synaptic plasticity, and PQC processes were investigated by immunoblotting and immunostaining methods. H& E, Nissl body, and TUNEL staining revealed that diabetes-induced neuronal apoptosis and degeneration. However, B12 supplementation ameliorated the diabetes-induced neuronal apoptosis. Further, B12 supplementation restored the markers of neuro-trophic support (BDNF, NGF, and GDNF), and synaptic plasticity (SYP, and PSD-95) in diabetic rats. Interestingly, B12 supplementation also attenuated astrogliosis, ER stress, and ameliorated autophagy-related proteins in diabetic rats. Overall, these findings suggest that B12 acts as a neuroprotective agent by inhibiting the neuropathological changes in STZ-induced type 1 diabetes. Thus, B12 supplementation could produce beneficial outcomes including neuroprotective effects in diabetic patients.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by progressive cognitive decline, for which effective treatments remain limited, and selenium is known for its neuroprotective actions. Thus, this study evaluated the neuroprotective effects of the compound 2-(((3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl(selenyl)methyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (TFSeB) in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD model in male Swiss mice. The animals received intracerebroventricular injections of STZ (3 mg/kg, a neurotoxic agent) to induce cognitive deficits, followed by treatment with TFSeB (1 and 5 mg/kg, intragastrically). Behavioral tests revealed that, like positive control (memantine), the compound TFSeB improved memory performance in the Y-maze, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance tests, suggesting its ability to counteract STZ-induced memory impairments. Biochemical analyses showed that the compound reduced oxidative stress markers in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of mice exposed to STZ, including TBARS, ROS, and nitrite levels while increasing NPSH. STZ induced an increase in monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activity in the hippocampus and cortex, as well as in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the cortex and cerebellum, which were reverted by TFSeB. Hippocampal RT-qPCR molecular analyses revealed that TFSeB modulated apoptosis-related proteins by increasing BCL-2 and decreasing BAX expression, favoring neuronal survival. Moreover, TFSeB increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NRF2), targets associated with neuroprotection. The compound also decreased key inflammatory and neurodegenerative markers, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B). In conclusion, the compound TFSeB demonstrates promising protective effects in a STZ-induced AD model by modulating key neurochemical, oxidative, and neuroinflammatory pathways.

AB  - Mammalia comprises a great diversity of diet types and associated adaptations. An understanding of the genomic mechanisms underlying these adaptations may offer insights for improving human health. Comparative genomic studies of diet that employ taxonomically restricted analyses or simplified diet classifications may suffer reduced power to detect molecular convergence associated with diet evolution. Here, we use a quantitative carnivory score-indicative of the amount of animal protein in the diet-for 80 mammalian species to detect significant correlations between the relative evolutionary rates of genes and changes in diet. We have identified six genes-ACADSB, CLDN16, CPB1, PNLIP, SLC13A2, and SLC14A2-that experienced significant changes in evolutionary constraint alongside changes in carnivory score, becoming less constrained in lineages evolving more herbivorous diets. We further consider the biological functions associated with diet evolution and observe that pathways related to amino acid and lipid metabolism, biological oxidation, and small molecule transport experienced reduced purifying selection as lineages became more herbivorous. Liver and kidney functions show similar patterns of constraint with dietary change. Our results indicate that these functions are important for the consumption of animal matter and become less important with the evolution of increasing herbivory. So, genes expressed in these tissues experience a relaxation of evolutionary constraint in more herbivorous lineages.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive and memory abilities, social disorders, and behavioral abnormalities. Ferroptosis, an irondependent type of programmed cell death, is closely associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Ferroptosis is characterized by the accumulation of iron within cells, leading to increased oxidative stress, and ultimately lipid peroxidation and cell death. Ganoderic acid A (GAA), one of the major pharmacologically active components in Ganoderma lucidum, exhibits an excellent neuroprotective effect against AD. However, it is unclear whether GAA improves the symptoms of AD by inhibiting ferroptosis. This study investigated the anti-AD effects of GAA through both in vivo and in vitro experiments, and determined its molecular mechanism from the perspective of ferroptosis modulation. The results showed that GAA administration attenuated hippocampal neuronal loss, improved mitochondrial ultrastructure, and enhanced the memory and learning ability of the AD mice. In vitro assays suggested that GAA effectively protected HT22 AD cells against ferroptosis-related morphological damage, enhanced their antioxidant capacity, maintained their iron metabolism, and reduced mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the immunofluorescence and western blotting results showed that the levels of NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 2 (NRF2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) both in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and amyloid beta (A(3)25-35-induced HT22 AD cells were markedly enhanced after GAA administration. In summary, these results revealed that GAA improves AD by activating on the NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to inhibit ferroptosis-lipid peroxidation.

AB  - Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal degradation process that has recently been found to be associated with stress-related psychological diseases. However, previous studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding the effects of various stress patterns on autophagy in different brain regions. This discrepancy may arise from differences in autophagy flux across nuclei, the type of stress experienced, and the timing of autophagy assessment after stress exposure. In this study, we assessed autophagy flux in the rat hippocampus (HPC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and basal lateral amygdala (BLA) by quantifying protein levels of p-ULK1, LC3-I, LC3-II, and p62 via Western blot analysis at 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min following various stress paradigms: restraint stress, foot shock, single corticosterone injection, and chronic corticosterone treatment. We found that: (1) hippocampal autophagy decreased within 1 h of restraint stress, foot shock, and corticosterone injection, except for a transient increase at 30 min after restraint stress; (2) autophagy increased 1 h after restraint stress and corticosterone injection but decreased 1 h after foot shock in mPFC; (3) In BLA, autophagy increased 1 h after foot shock and corticosterone injection but decreased 1 h after restraint stress; (4) Chronic corticosterone increased autophagy in mPFC and BLA but had no effects in HPC. These findings suggest that stress regulates autophagy in a brain region- and stressor-specific manner within 1 h after stress exposure, which may contribute to the development of stress-related psychological disorders.

AB  - Background Sorafenib is the standard first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its use is hampered by secondary drug resistance. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for liver tumorigenesis. As yet, however, the mechanism underlying sorafenib resistance and the role of YAP therein is not fully understood and needs to be explored further. Methods Western blotting, flow cytometry and CCK-8 assays were used to assess the role of YAP in HCC sorafenib resistance. Next, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to identify survivin as a YAP downstream effector, and rescue experiments were performed to confirm that YAP induces sorafenib resistance via survivin. Additionally, Western blotting, flow cytometry and in vivo xenograft models were used to evaluate the effect of verteporfin in combination with sorafenib on HCC. Results We found that sorafenib enhances YAP nuclear accumulation and activation, thereby promoting sorafenib resistance through inhibiting apoptosis in HCC cells. In addition, we found that survivin acts as a downstream mediator of YAP to resist sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of YAP by verteporfin increased the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib and reversed sorafenib resistance. Moreover, verteporfin in combination with sorafenib significantly suppressed in vivo HCC tumor growth. Conclusions Our data indicate that YAP promotes sorafenib resistance through upregulation of survivin expression in HCC cells. Targeting YAP may be a therapeutic strategy to improve the antitumor effects of sorafenib in HCC.

AB  - The hippocampus-dependent "trace-appetitive conditioning task" increases cell proliferation and the generation of newborn young neurons. Evidence suggests that adult hippocampal neurogenesis and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep play an essential role in memory consolidation. On the other hand, REM sleep deprivation (REM-SD) induces detrimental effects on training-induced cell proliferation in the hippocampus's dentate gyrus (DG). Nonetheless, the role of REM sleep in the traceappetitive memory and fate determination of the newly proliferated cells is not known. Here, we have studied the following: (I) the effects of 24 h of REM-SD (soon after training) on trace- and delay-appetitive memory and cell proliferation in the adult DG and (H) the effects of chronic (96 h) REM-SD (3 days after the training, the period in which newly generated cells progressed toward the neuronal lineage) on trace-appetitive memory and the generation of newborn young neurons. We used a modified multiple platform method for the selective REM-SD without altering non-REM (NREM) sleep. We found that 24 h of REM-SD, soon after trace-conditioning, impaired the trace-appetitive memory and the training-induced cell proliferation. Nevertheless, 96 h of REM-SD (3 days after the training) did not impair trace memory. Interestingly, 96 h of REM-SD altered the generation of newborn young neurons. These results suggest that REM sleep plays an essential role in training-induced cell proliferation and the fate determination of the newly generated cells toward the neuronal lineage.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive behavioral and cognitive impairments. Despite growing evidence of the neuroprotective action of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the effects and mechanism of omega-3 PUFAs on AD control are yet to be clarified. By crossing male heterozygous fat-1 mice with female APP/PS1 mice, we assessed whether elevated tissue omega-3 PUFA levels could alleviate AD progression and their underlying mechanism among the offspring WT, APP/PS1 and APP/PS1 x fat-1 groups at various stages. We found that the fat-1 transgene significantly increased brain omega-3 PUFA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels, and cognitive deficits together with brain A beta-40 and A beta-42 levels in 6-month-old APP/PS1 x fat-1 mice were significantly lower than those in APP/PS1 mice. Subsequently, the tandem mass tag (TMT) method revealed the elevated expression of cortex and hippocampus myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) in APP/PS1 x fat-1 mice at 2-6 months. Furthermore, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the MAG-related myelin sheath pathway and its interaction with AD were regulated by omega-3 PUFAs. Moreover, subsequent western blot assays showed that both increased endogenous omega-3 levels and in vitro supplemented DHA up-regulated MAG expression, and the AD-protective effects of DHA on LPS-induced BV2 cells were significantly weakened when MAG was inhibited by si-RNA transfection. In summary, our study suggested that omega-3 PUFAs might protect against AD by up-regulating MAG expression.

AB  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used to investigate the intranasal deposition of corticosteroid sprays. CFD Lagrangian tracking models terminate particle motion once particles come into contact with a surface ("trap" boundary condition) and disregard the liquid film buildup on the mucosal surfaces of the sinonasal cavity walls. However, the interaction between spray droplets and the mucosal surface is critical for corticosteroid delivery using the exhalation delivery system (EDS) nasal spray device. Droplets coalesce on sinonasal walls, forming a thin "wall-film" on which droplets spread along the surface, splash, and/or break into secondary particles, depending on impact energy. To advance nasal drug delivery modeling, three CFD models of fluticasone propionate deposition using the EDS device in a Draf III post-surgical ge-ometry were developed: (1) using traditional "trap" boundary conditions; (2) using "wall-film" boundary conditions and one-way coupling; and (3) using "wall-film" boundary conditions with two-way coupling (to account for the high-mass loading in the near-nozzle spray field). Contour plots and data sets for each CFD model were qualitatively compared with physical models in the same geometry (visualized in a 3D-printed sinonasal cast). The CFD simulations showed that EDS delivers fluticasone to all sinonasal regions, including areas superiorly and posteriorly in the sinonasal cavity. In addition, deposition improved and more closely correlated with physical experiments as the CFD model complexity evolved. "Wall-film" modeling of EDS delivery demonstrated increased surface coverage compared to the "trap" model. The "wall-film/two-way coupling" model demonstrated substantially higher deposition in the remote frontal and maxil-lary sinuses, agreeing with physical cast experiments. In conclusion, CFD simulation of EDS de-livery using the "wall-film" boundary/two-way coupling model appears to most accurately represent observations from physical model experiments in the same geometry.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to find out whether escin (ES) safeguarded experimental rats against cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced kidney injury. Twenty-four rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6). After the examination, histological and biochemical analyses were performed to assess the alterations in kidney tissue. According to histologic and biochemical analyses, renal tissue in the CP group suffered significant damage by CP. There was a significant improvement in histological damage in the group receiving CP+ES together. This suggests that ES significantly protects the kidney's functional characteristics. The present study concludes by highlighting histological and biochemical studies to illustrate the ability of ES to cure kidney injury caused by CP and its influence on the relationship between oxidative stress, apoptosis, and renal failure.

AB  - Worldwide, epilepsy is the second most prevalent neurological disorder. Disappointingly, various adverse effects are being observed with currently used antiepileptic drugs. Nanomedicine represents an effective strategy to overcome these limitations with a better central drug delivery. Hence, our work aimed to unravel the antiepileptic efficacy of rutin (Rut) loaded with selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-challenged mice. Ten days before PTZ (60 mg(.)kg(-1)) intraperitoneal injection, mice were orally administered Rut (100 mg(.)kg(-1)), sodium selenite (0.5 mg(.)kg(-1)), SeNPs (100 mg(.)kg(-1)), or sodium valproate (reference drug, 200 mg(.)kg(-1)). Remarkably, administration of Rut-loaded SeNPs (Rut-SeNPs) to epileptic mice markedly increased the latency time and decreased the severity and duration of seizures. Remarkable increases were also noticed in acetylcholinesterase, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels in epileptic mice treated with Rut-SeNPs. Furthermore, Rut-SeNPs boosted the cellular antioxidant defense by increasing superoxide dismutase, catalase, GSH, Nrf2, and HO-1, along with decreased malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels. In addition, the nanotherapy successfully mitigated the inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and nuclear factor kappa B) in mice hippocampus. Rut-SeNPs antagonized neuronal apoptosis by decreasing Bax and caspase-3 and increasing the levels of Bcl-2. Conclusively, the present work suggests Rut-loaded SeNPs as an effective antiepileptic therapy through correction of disturbed neurotransmitters, oxidative status, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication of central nervous system after anesthesia or surgery. Sevoflurane, an inhalation anesthetic, may inhibit cholinergic pathway that induce neuronal death and neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to POCD. Transauricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has neuroprotective effects in POCD rats, but the mechanisms related to cholinergic system have not been revealed. Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sevoflurane to construct the POCD model. The immunotoxin 192-IgG-saporin (192-sap) selectively lesioned cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, which is the major source of cholinergic projections to hippocampus. After lesion, rats received 5 days of taVNS treatment (30 min per day) starting 24 h before anesthesia. Open field test and Morris water maze were used to test the cognitive function. In this study, rats exposed to sevoflurane exhibited cognitive impairment that was attenuated by taVNS. In addition, taVNS treatment activated cholinergic system in the basal forebrain and hippocampus, and downregulated the expression of apoptosis- and necroptosis-related proteins, such as cleaved Caspase-3 and p-MLKL, in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, the activation of Iba1(+) microglial by sevoflurane was reduced by taVNS. 192-sap blocked the cholinergic system activation in the basal forebrain and hippocampus and inhibited taVNS-mediated neuroprotection and anti-inflammation effects in the hippocampus. Generally, our study indicated that taVNS might alleviate sevoflurane-induced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, necroptosis and microglial activation though activating cholinergic system in the basal forebrain.

AB  - During subarachnoid haemorrhage, a blood clot forms in the subarachnoid space releasing extracellular haemoglobin (Hb), which causes oxidative damage and cell death in surrounding tissues. High rates of disability and cognitive decline in SAH survivors are attributed to loss of neurons and functional connections during secondary brain injury. Haptoglobin sequesters Hb for clearance, but this scavenging system is overwhelmed after a haemorrhage. Whilst exogenous haptoglobin application can attenuate cytotoxicity of Hb in vitro and in vivo, the functional effects of sub-lethal Hb concentrations on surviving neurons and whether cellular function can be protected with haptoglobin treatment remain unclear. Here we use cultured neurons to investigate neuronal health and function across a range of Hb concentrations to establish the thresholds for cellular damage and investigate synaptic function. Hb impairs ATP concentrations and cytoskeletal structure. At clinically relevant but sub-lethal Hb concentrations, we find that synaptic AMPAR-driven currents are reduced, accompanied by a reduction in GluA1 subunit expression. Haptoglobin co-application can prevent these deficits by scavenging free Hb to reduce it to sub-threshold concentrations and does not need to be present at stoichiometric amounts to achieve efficacy. Haptoglobin itself does not impair measures of neuronal health and function at any concentration tested. Our data highlight a role for Hb in modifying synaptic function in surviving neurons, which may link to impaired cognition or plasticity after SAH and support the development of haptoglobin as a therapy for subarachnoid haemorrhage.

AB  - Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and interrupting the microglial-mediated neuroinflammation has been suggested as a promising strategy to delay or prevent the progression of neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the effects of JE-133, an optically active isochroman-2H-chromene conjugate containing a 1,3-disubstituted isochroman unit, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial neuroinflammation and underlying mechanisms both in vitro and in vivo. First, JE-133 treatment decreased LPS-induced overproduction of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitrite, and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in BV2 microglial cells. Further study revealed that JE-133 downregulated the phosphorylation level of JAK/STAT and upregulated the protein level of Nrf2/HO-1 in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and verified that JE-133 directly bound to Keap1 by a pull-down assay. Next, JE-133 administration also inhibited neuroinflammation in vivo, as indicated by a reduced CD11b protein level and an overexpressed mRNA level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in the hippocampus of LPS-injected mice. Moreover, the regulative effects of JE-133 on the JAK/STAT and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways were also verified in the hippocampus of LPS-injected mice. Taken together, our study for the first time reports that JE-133 exhibits inhibitory effects against LPS-stimulated neuroinflammation both in vitro and in vivo, which might be associated with the simultaneous regulation of the JAK/STAT and Nrf2 pathways. Our findings may provide important clues for the discovery of effective drug leads/candidates against neuroinflammation-associated neurodegeneration.

AB  - Amyloid-ss oligomers (A ss o) are the most pathologically relevant A ss species in Alzheimer's disease (AD), because they induce early synaptic dysfunction that leads to learning and memory impairments. In contrast, increasing VEGF ( Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) brain levels have been shown to improve learning and memory processes, and to alleviate A ss-mediated synapse dysfunction. Here, we designed a new peptide, the blocking peptide (BP), which is derived from an A ss o-targeted domain of the VEGF protein, and investigated its effect on A ss-associated toxicity. Using a combination of biochemical, 3D and ultrastructural imaging, and electrophysiological approaches, we demonstrated that BP strongly interacts with A ss o and blocks A ss fibrillar aggregation process, leading to the formation of A ss amorphous aggregates. BP further impedes the formation of structured A ss o and prevents their pathogenic binding to synapses. Importantly, acute BP treatment successfully rescues long-term potentiation (LTP) in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, at an age when LTP is highly impaired in hippocampal slices. Moreover, BP is also able to block the interaction between A ss o and VEGF, which suggests a dual mechanism aimed at both trapping A ss o and releasing VEGF to alleviate A ss o-induced synaptic damage. Our findings provide evidence for a neutralizing effect of the BP on A ss aggregation process and pathogenic action, highlighting a potential new therapeutic strategy.

AB  - eLife digest How the brain stores information is a question that has fascinated neuroscientists for well over a century. Two general ideas have emerged. The first is that groups of neurons hold information by staying active. The second is that they hold information by strengthening their connections to one another, making it easier for them to work together in the future. Scientists call this second idea 'long-term potentiation'. One of the molecules involved in long-term potentiation is a protein called calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II, or CaMKII for short. Blocking CaMKII, or deleting its gene, stops the connections between neurons from becoming stronger. This suggests neurons need CaMKII to learn, but it remains unclear whether neurons also use CaMKII to maintain neuronal memories after they have been created. If CaMKII does play a role in maintaining memories, blocking it after learning should reverse the learning process, but so far, experiments have not been able to show this. Tao et al. revisited these experiments to find out more. They examined slices of brain tissue from mice that had been treated with fast-acting CaMKII inhibitors. It took tens of minutes, but the inhibitors were able to reverse long-term potentiation, both for newly acquired neuronal memories and for older memories that had formed when the mice were alive. The choice of CaMKII inhibitor and the time lag could explain why scientists have not observed the effect before. Understanding long-term potentiation is a fundamental part of understanding learning and memory. It could also reveal more about the opposite phenomenon: long-term depression. This is a type of learning where the connections between neurons become weaker. Long-term depression also takes tens of minutes to occur, suggesting that future research into CaMKII might shed light on how it works.
   Long-term potentiation (LTP) is arguably the most compelling cellular model for learning and memory. While the mechanisms underlying the induction of LTP ('learning') are well understood, the maintenance of LTP ('memory') has remained contentious over the last 20 years. Here, we find that Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) contributes to synaptic transmission and is required LTP maintenance. Acute inhibition of CaMKII erases LTP and transient inhibition of CaMKII enhances subsequent LTP. These findings strongly support the role of CaMKII as a molecular storage device.

AB  - G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels are the main targets controlling excitability and synaptic plasticity on hippocampal neurons. Consequently, dysfunction of GIRK-mediated signalling has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer & PRIME;s disease (AD). Here, we provide a quantitative description on the expression and localisation patterns of GIRK2 in two transgenic mice models of AD (P301S and APP/PS1 mice), combining histoblots and immunoelectron microscopic approaches. The histoblot technique revealed differences in the expression of GIRK2 in the two transgenic mice models. The expression of GIRK2 was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of P301S mice in a laminar-specific manner at 10 months of age but was unaltered in APP/PS1 mice at 12 months compared to age-matched wild type mice. Ultrastructural approaches using the pre-embedding immunogold technique, demonstrated that the subcellular localisation of GIRK2 was significantly reduced along the neuronal surface of CA1 pyramidal cells, but increased in its frequency at cytoplasmic sites, in both P301S and APP/PS1 mice. We also found a decrease in plasma membrane GIRK2 channels in axon terminals contacting dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal cells in P301S and APP/PS1 mice. These data demonstrate for the first time a redistribution of GIRK channels from the plasma membrane to intracellular sites in different compartments of CA1 pyramidal cells. Altogether, the pre- and post-synaptic reduction of GIRK2 channels suggest that GIRK-mediated alteration of the excitability in pyramidal cells could contribute to the cognitive dysfunctions as described in the two AD animal models.</p>

AB  - This study investigated the effects of inosine on memory acquisition and consolidation, cholinesterases activities, redox status and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in a rat model of scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment. Adult male rats were divided into four groups: control (saline), scopolamine (1 mg/kg), scopolamine plus inosine (50 mg/kg), and scopolamine plus inosine (100 mg/kg). Inosine was pre-administered for 7 days, intraperitoneally. On day 8, scopolamine was administered pre (memory acquisition protocol) or post training (memory consolidation protocol) on inhibitory avoidance tasks. The animals were subjected to the step-down inhibitory avoidance task 24 hours after the training. Scopolamine induced impairment in the acquisition and consolidation phases; however, inosine was able to prevent only the impairment in memory consolidation. Also, scopolamine increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase and reduced the activity of Na+, K+-ATPase and the treatment with inosine protected against these alterations in consolidation protocol. In the animals treated with scopolamine, inosine improved the redox status by reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and restoring the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase and catalase. Our findings suggest that inosine may offer protection against scopolamine-induced memory consolidation impairment by modulating brain redox status, cholinergic signaling and ion pump activity. This compound may provide an interesting approach in pharmacotherapy and as a prophylactic against neurodegenerative mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is a crucial pathogenic process involved in the development and deterioration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Petasites japonicus is known for its beneficial effects on various disease states such as allergic reaction, oxidative stress and inflammation. However, it is still unknown whether P. japonicus has protective effects on neuroinflammation, especially microgliosis related to AD. The current study aimed to investigate whether an extract of P. japonicus (named KP-1) protects from microglial cell activation in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate the anti-neuroinflammation effects of KP-1, the current study adopted the most widely used experimental models including the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microgliosis in vitro model and amyloid beta (A beta) oligomer (A beta O)-induced neuroinflammation in vivo model, respectively. As a result, KP-1 pre-treatment reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, protein levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in BV2 cells which were significantly promoted by 100 ng ml(-1) LPS treatment. Similarly, KP-1 administration protected mice from A beta O-induced memory impairment scored by Y-maze and novel object recognition test (NORT). Moreover, KP-1 administration suppressed A beta O-induced microglial cell activation measured by counting the number of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1)-positive cells in both the cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus and measuring the mRNA expression of TNF alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6. Furthermore, A beta O-induced synaptotoxicity was prevented by KP-1 administration which is in line with behavioral changes. Collectively, these findings suggest that KP-1 could be a potential functional food for protection against neuroinflammation, and prevents or delays the progression of AD.

AB  - SiO2 nanoparticles functionalized with glutamate were investigated for their ability to alleviate oxidative stress caused by prolonged exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The study involved ten different groups, each consisting of eight animals, to examine the effects of H2O2 -induced oxidative stress. The results demonstrated that exposure to H2O2 stress oxidative biomarkers were altered accompanied with a loss of spatial learning and memory in rats performing the Morris water maze task. Furthermore, SiO2 nanoparticles functionalized with Lglutamic acid alleviated the H2O2-induced acceleration of necrotic and degenerative cell changes in the hippocampus, subiculum, caudate-putamen, and frontal cortex. Additionally, L-glutamic acid-functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles reduced the redox imbalance and interfered with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities induced by H2O2.

AB  - This study investigated the protective effect of quercetin against cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppressive indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) via the mechanism of oxidative-inflammatory stress and behavioral indices. Cyclophosphamide (CYP) was administered to male Wister rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg with or without quercetin 50 mg/kg every other day for 7 days. Experimental techniques including western blotting, immunohistochemistry analysis, and inflammatory and oxidative stress marker assays were carried out. We also conducted behavioral analyses such as open field, tail suspension, and Y-maze tests for cognitive assessment. The results indicated that quercetin attenuated oxidative-inflammatory stress induced by CYP in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of male Wister rats by augmenting the activities of antioxidant enzymes and suppressing lipid peroxidation as well as inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma. Concomitantly, quercetin partially prevented the alteration in brain tissue histological architecture and mitigated the activities of IDO/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and protein expression of IDO1. This was corroborated by the IDO-quercetin model obtained in silico, revealing a favorable inhibitory interaction between quercetin and the enzyme. Finally, the results of behavioral tests suggested that quercetin significantly prevented the depressive-like posture of the CYP-treated rats. Our study for the first time revealed that quercetin ameliorates the effect of CYP-instigated IDO/TDO activities in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus via restoration of antioxidant enzymes and preventing oxidative-inflammatory stress.

AB  - MicroRNAs have been recognized as important regulators of the aging process. Trehalose, a natural disaccharide, displays protective effects against neuronal impairment through several mechanisms. However, little is known about the interactive effects of aging and trehalose on behavioral function and underlying miRNA expression patterns in the hippocampus of young and old rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Two groups of aged (24 months) and young (4 months) rats were administered 2% trehalose solution for 30 days. Two other groups of aged and young rats received regular tap water. At the end of treatment, rats were assessed for cognitive behavior using the Morris water maze test. The expression level of miR-181c and mir-34c was also measured by qRT-PCR. We found that trehalose treatment reduced learning and memory impairment in old rats compared to control old animals (p < 0.05). In contrast, cognitive performance was not significantly improved in trehalose-treated young rats in comparison with young controls (p > 0.05). We also showed that the expression level of miR-181c was significantly increased in trehalose-treated rats (p < 0.01). However, analysis of miR-34c expression level indicated no significant difference between trehalose-treated old rats and non-treated old animals (p > 0.05). Our results indicated that trehalose treatment improved learning and memory function in aged rats by targeting miR-181c. Therefore, trehalose administration may provide a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate age-associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. Previous studies have reported that sevoflurane, a frequently used anesthetic, can induce cognitive impairment in preclinical and clinical settings. However, the mechanism underlying the development of this neurotoxicity is currently unclear.Methods: Seven-month-old APP/PS1 mice were placed in an anesthesia induction box containing 3% sevoflurane in 100% O-2 for 6 h, while BV2 cells were cultured with 4% sevoflurane for 6 h. Pyroptosis and tau protein expression in excised hippocampus tissues and cells were measured using Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay. Caspase-1 and NLRP3 were knocked out in BV2 microglia using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to determine whether they mediate the effects induced by sevoflurane.Results: Sevoflurane directly activated caspase-1 to induce pyroptosis in the mouse model of AD via NLRP3 and AIM2 activation. In addition, sevoflurane mediated cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) but not gasdermin E (GSDME), promoted the biosynthesis of downstream interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-18, and increased beta-amyloid (A beta) deposition and tau phosphorylation. The nontoxic caspase-1 small-molecule inhibitor VX-765 significantly inhibited this activation process in microglia, while NLRP3 deletion suppressed sevoflurane-induced caspase-1 cleavage and subsequently pyroptosis, as well as tau pathology. Furthermore, silencing caspase-1 alleviated the sevoflurane-induced release of IL-1 beta and IL-18 and inhibited tau-related enzymes in microglia.Conclusion: This study is the first to report that clinical doses of sevoflurane aggravate the progression of AD via the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD axis. Collectively, our findings elucidate the crucial mechanisms of NLRP3/caspase-1 in pyroptosis and tau pathogenesis induced by sevoflurane and suggest that VX-765 could represent a novel therapeutic intervention for treating AD.

AB  - Epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder, is triggered by various insults, including traumatic brain injury and stroke. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), an enzyme that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin into ceramides, is implicated in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. Ceramides, which have pro-apoptotic properties, contribute to oxidative damage and lysosomal dysfunction, exacerbating neuronal injury. This study investigates the role of ASMase in epilepsy, hypothesizing that seizure activity upregulates ASMase, increasing ceramide levels, DNA damage, and neuronal apoptosis. We employed a pilocarpine-induced rat seizure model and examined the effects of imipramine, an ASMase inhibitor, administered intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg) for four weeks post-seizure induction. Histological and cognitive analyses showed that while imipramine did not prevent early neuronal death within the first week, it significantly reduced markers of neuronal apoptosis by four weeks. Imipramine also promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and preserved cognitive function, which is often impaired following seizures. These findings suggest that ASMase inhibition could mitigate neuronal apoptosis and improve cognitive recovery after seizures. Imipramine may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for epilepsy-associated neuronal damage and cognitive deficits. Further studies should delineate the molecular mechanisms of ASMase inhibition and evaluate its long-term efficacy in addressing epilepsy-related neurodegeneration and functional impairments.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is a progressive cognitive impairment of vascular etiology. VaD is characterized by cerebral hypoperfusion, increased blood-brain barrier permeability and white matter lesions. An increased burden of VaD is expected in rapidly aging populations. The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to hypoperfusion, and the resulting memory impairment may play a crucial role in VaD. Here we have investigated the hippocampal gene expression profile of young and old mice subjected to cerebral hypoperfusion by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). Our data in sham-operated young and aged mice reveal an age-associated decline in cerebral blood flow and differential gene expression. In fact, BCAS and aging caused broadly similar effects. However, BCAS-induced changes in hippocampal gene expression differed between young and aged mice. Specifically, transcriptomic analysis indicated that in comparison to young sham mice, many pathways altered by BCAS in young mice resembled those already present in sham aged mice. Over 30 days, BCAS in aged mice had minimal effect on either cerebral blood flow or hippocampal gene expression. Immunoblot analyses confirmed these findings. Finally, relative to young sham mice the cell type-specific profile of genes in both young BCAS and old sham animals further revealed common cell-specific genes. Our data provide a genetic-based molecular framework for hypoperfusion-induced hippocampal damage and reveal common cellular signaling pathways likely to be important in the pathophysiology of VaD.

AB  - Introduction: Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease that results from loss-of-function mutations in the HEXA gene coding beta-hexosaminidase A. HEXA gene deficiency affects the central nervous system owing to GM2 ganglioside accumulation in lysosomes resulting in progressive neurodegeneration in patients. We recently generated a novel mice model with a combined deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A and neuraminidase 3 (Hexa-/-Neu3-/-) that mimics both the neuropathological and clinical abnormalities of early-onset Tay-Sachs disease. Here, we aimed to explore the secondary accumulation of lipids in the brain of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice.Materials and Methods: In the cortex and hippocampus of five-month-old WT, Hexa-/-, Neu3-/-, and Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice, lipid levels belonging to glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sterol lipids were evaluated using a shotgun lipidomics approach. The levels of myelin were also assessed by luxol fast blue staining and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against myelin basic protein. We further examined glycoconjugate and cholesterol levels by periodic acid-Schiff and filipin staining, respectively. Toluidine blue staining was also performed to display axonal degeneration.Results: Among glycerophospholipids, we demonstrated elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine-ether and lysophosphatidylcholine while decreased levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in both cortex and hippocampus of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. In the glycerolipid class, we showed an alleviated level of sphingomyelin in both cortex and hippocampus, but the higher levels of diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol were detected in only the hippocampus of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. The lower level of sterol was also detected in the cortex of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice but not in the hippocampus.Histochemical studies showed a decrease in the myelin level and axonal degeneration indicating neuronal pathology in the brain of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice. Although glycoconjugate accumulation was evident both in the cortex and hippocampus, we did not detect any changes in the level of cholesterol.Conclusion: Our results indicate that alterations in lipid metabolism and neuropathology, such as demyelination and axonal degeneration, might be related to the dysfunctionality of lipid-related cellular pathways like autophagy. Understanding of brain-specific lipid alterations contributes to evaluating the effectiveness of treatments in Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice in future studies.

AB  - Optogenetics approach is used widely in neurobiology as it allows control of cellular activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. In most studies, optogenetics is used to control neuronal activity. In the present study optogenetics was used to stimulate astrocytes with the aim to modulate neuronal activity. To achieve this goal, light stimulation was applied to astrocytes expressing a version of ChR2 (ionotropic opsin) or Opto-alpha 1AR (metabotropic opsin). Optimal optogenetic stimulation parameters were determined using patch-clamp recordings of hippocampal pyramidal neurons' spontaneous activity in brain slices as a readout. It was determined that the greatest increase in the number of spontaneous synaptic currents was observed when astrocytes expressing ChR2(H134R) were activated by 5 s of continuous light. For the astrocytes expressing Opto-alpha 1AR, the greatest response was observed in the pulse stimulation mode (T = 1 s, t = 100 ms). It was also observed that activation of the astrocytic Opto-a1AR but not ChR2 results in an increase of the fEPSP slope in hippocampal neurons. Based on these results, we concluded that Opto-a1AR expressed in hippocampal astrocytes provides an opportunity to modulate the long-term synaptic plasticity optogenetically, and may potentially be used to normalize the synaptic transmission and plasticity defects in a variety of neuropathological conditions, including models of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapy medication that is used to treat various types of cancer. However, it can cause nephrotoxic side effects, which lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although a clinically relevant in vitro model of CKD induced by repeated administration of low-dose cisplatin (RAC) has been established, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we compared single administration of high-dose cisplatin (SAC) to repeated administration of low-dose cisplatin (RAC) in myofibroblast transformation and cellular morphology in a normal rat kidney fibroblast NRK-49F cell line. RAC instead of SAC transformed the fibroblasts into myofibroblasts as determined by alpha-smooth muscle actin, enlarged cell size as represented by F-actin staining, and increased cell flattening as expressed by the semidiameter ratio of attached cells to floated cells. Those phenomena, as well as cellular senescence, were significantly detected from the time right before the second administration of cisplatin. Interestingly, inhibition of the interaction between Yes-associated protein (YAP) and the transcriptional enhanced associated domain (TEAD) using Verteporfin remarkedly reduced cell size, cellular senescence, and myofibroblast transformation during RAC. These findings collectively suggest that YAP activation is indispensable for cellular hypertrophy, senescence, and myofibroblast transformation during RAC in kidney fibroblasts.

AB  - Generally, impaired bones heal by bone repair and bone regeneration. These two processes are necessary during the healing period of dental implant. Vasculature plays a crucial role in bone healing because bones are highly vascularized tissue. Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are highly coupled processes and can be regulated by HippoYAP signaling pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated Hippo-YAP pathway may be regulated by alpha calcitonin gene-related peptide. However, the regulatory effects of alpha CGRP-YAP pathway on angiogenesis and osteogenesis during bone healing around implants remain unclear. Four groups of mice were established: KO Group: alpha CGRP (-/-) mice; KO + alpha CGRP group: alpha CGRP (-/-) mice with alpha CGRP overexpressing lentiviral trans fection; KO + YAP group: alpha CGRP (-/-) mice with YAP overexpressing lentiviral transfection; WT group: wildtype mice. After 14 or 28 days, animals were sacrificed and tested. Results showed alpha CGRP deficiency hampered osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In addition, the impaired bone healing can be rescued by overexpressing alpha CGRP and YAP in alpha CGRP (-/-) mice. In-vivo results indicate alpha CGRP-YAP pathway promotes angiogenesis and osteo genesis in bone healing, especially at the early stage. Taken together, present study demonstrated alpha CGRP upregulate the expression of YAP, and down-stream genes to promote the osteogenesis and angiogenesis around the implants.

AB  - Echinacea purpurea is a perennial medicinal herb with important immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, especially purported for the alleviation of cold and flu symptoms. Different classes of secondary metabolites of the plant, such as alkylamides, caffeic acid derivatives, polysaccharides, flavonoids, and glycoproteins, are believed to be biologically and pharmacologically active. Although previous research suggests that the alkylamides present in Echinacea may be responsible for reducing the symptoms associated with the common cold or flu through their immunomodulatory activity, the roles of specific alkylamides and their targets (i.e., immune and/or antiviral) have not been well-elucidated or established. This study tested the antiviral and cytokine regulatory activity of various specific alkylamides that are present predominantly in Echinacea root extracts and found that one specific alkylamide, Dodeca-2E,4E-Dienoic acid isobutylamide, had potent antiviral activity against rhinovirus (the causative agent of most common colds) and influenza virus, as well as potent inhibition of IL-8 cytokine production. IL-8 is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with the common cold and is upregulated in other common respiratory infections. The broad activity and low cytotoxicity of this specific alkylamide support its potential use for treating rhinovirus and influenza virus infections.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) is the main active ingredient in the cannabis plant used for treating epilepsy and related diseases. However, how CBD ameliorates epilepsy and its effect on the hippocampus remains unknown. Herein, we evaluated how CBD ameliorates seizure degree in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced epilepsy mice after being exposed to CBD (10 mg/kg p.o). In addition, transcriptome and metabolomic analysis were performed on the hippocampus. Our results suggested that CBD could alleviate PTZ-induced seizure, of which the NPTX2, Gprc5c, Lipg, and Stc2 genes were significantly down-regulated in mice after being exposed to PTZ. Transcriptome analysis showed 97 differently expressed genes (CBD) and the PTZ groups. Metabonomic analysis revealed that compared with the PTZ group, 41 up-regulated and 67 down-regulated metabolites were identified in the hippocampus of epileptic mice exposed to CBD. The correlation analysis for transcriptome and metabolome showed that (+/-) 15-HETE and carnitine C6:0 were at the core of the network and were involved in the positive or negative regulation of the related genes after being treated with CBD. In conclusion, CBD ameliorates epilepsy by acting on the metabolism, calcium signaling pathway, and tuberculosis pathways in the hippocampus. Our study provided a practical basis for the therapeutic potential of treating epilepsy using CBD.

AB  - The sole difference between white tea (WT) and green tea (GT) is the former that made only from the buds and young leaves of the Camelia sinensis plant, whilst the latter is made from matured tea leaves. The phytochemical profiles, phenolic compounds, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activity of two varieties of Camellia sinensis teas, white and green, were compared in this study. Total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, DPPH radical scavenging, and Fe+2 chelating activities were used to determine antioxidant activities in water extract of GT and WT. The largest level of phenolic content was discovered in WGTE compared with the lowest amount was found in WWTE (290.67 mg/100 g tea and 185.96 mg/100 g tea, respectively). Phenoilc acids (gallic, benzoic, chlorogenic, ellagic, and rho-coumaric acids) and flavonoids (rutin and kampherol) were found in the two extracts. The findings of DPPH radical scavenging assays were 84.06 and 82.37% inhibition. In vitro antimicrobial activity was indicated that (WWTE and WGTE) had a high level of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and gave negative activity against Salmonella typhimurium, and Aspergillus Niger. The WT and GT extracts are a great source of natural antioxidants with biological effects on human health.

AB  - Menthol is a cyclic monoterpene alcohol of the essential oils of plants of the genus Mentha, which is in demand by various industries due to its diverse sensorial and physiological properties. However, its poor water solubility and its toxic effect limit possible applications. Glycosylation offers a solution as the binding of a sugar residue to small molecules increases their water solubility and stability, renders aroma components odorless and modifies bioactivity. In order to identify plant enzymes that catalyze this reaction, a glycosyltransferase library containing 57 uridine diphosphate sugar-dependent enzymes (UGTs) was screened with (+/-)-menthol. The identity of the products was confirmed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Five enzymes were able to form (+/-)-menthyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in whole-cell biotransformations: UGT93Y1, UGT93Y2, UGT85K11, UGT72B27 and UGT73B24. In vitro enzyme activity assays revealed highest catalytic activity for UGT93Y1 (7.6 nkat/mg) from Camellia sinensis towards menthol and its isomeric forms. Although UGT93Y2 shares 70% sequence identity with UGT93Y1, it was less efficient. Of the five enzymes, UGT93Y1 stood out because of its high in vivo and in vitro biotransformation rate. The identification of novel menthol glycosyltransferases from the tea plant opens new perspectives for the biotechnological production of menthyl glucoside.

AB  - Arisaema cum bile (known as Dan Nanxing in Chinese, DNX) is a herbal medicine used for treating febrile seizure (FS), which commonly prepared by using Arisaematis Rhizoma and animal bile. This study was designed to explore the optimal processing time of DNX and its potential mechanism on the anti-FS effect. A total of 17 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were the characteristic ones to distinguish different fermentation stages of DNX by using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS), such as 2-heptanone monomer, and heptanal monomer. DNX with fermentation for 3 months had an obvious pattern of VOCs with others, which could be regarded as the optimal fermentation time. The Enterococcus and Staphylococcus might be the core bacteria on the production of VOCs. Additionally, DNX (2.8 g/kg, p.o.) reversed hot water bath-induced FSs of rats, as indicated by increased seizure latency and decreased seizure duration time. It also prevented hippocampal neuronal loss, increased GABAAR, and decreased GRIA1 expression. At the genus level, relative abundance of Enterococcus and Akkermansia were enriched after DNX treatment. These findings suggested that fermentation for 3 months might be the optimal process time for DNX, and DNX possess an anti-FS effect through regulating neurotransmitter disorder and gut microbiota.

AB  - Nutritional influences have been discussed as potential modulators of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology through various epidemiological and physiological studies. In animal models, a high-fat diet (HFD) with greater intake of lipid-derived calories leads to accelerated disease onset and progression. The underlying molecular mechanisms of HFD-induced aggravated pathology, however, remain largely unclear. In this study, we aimed to further illuminate the effects of a fat-enriched diet in PD by examining the brainstem and hippocampal transcriptome of alpha-synuclein transgenic mice exposed to a life-long HFD. Investigating individual transcript isoforms, differential gene expression and co-expression clusters, we observed that transcriptional differences between wild-type (WT) and transgenic animals intensified in both regions under HFD. Both brainstem and hippocampus displayed strikingly similar transcriptomic perturbation patterns. Interestingly, expression differences resulted mainly from responses in WT animals to HFD, while these genes remained largely unchanged or were even slightly oppositely regulated by diet in transgenic animals. Genes and co-expressed gene groups exhibiting this dysregulation were linked to metabolic and mitochondrial pathways. Our findings propose the failure of metabolic adaptions as the potential explanation for accelerated disease unfolding under exposure to HFD. From the identified clusters of co-expressed genes, several candidates lend themselves to further functional investigations.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration in the sinonasal mucosa. Eosinophil and neutrophil extracellular traps (EETs and NETs, respectively) are prominently found in CRS. This study aimed to investigate the effect of airborne fungi, Alternaria alternata and Aspergillus fumigatus, on EET and NET formation. Nasal epithelial cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils were isolated from eosinophilic CRS (ECRS), non-ECRS (NECRS), and healthy control. We determined eosinophil and neutrophil transepithelial migration after fungal treatment. We then determined the release of EETs and NETs by fungi using Sytox Green staining and determined the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using ROS inhibitors. We identified more abundant EETs and NETs in ECRS than in NECRS. A. alternata and A. fumigatus enhanced eosinophil and neutrophil transepithelial migration. A. fumigatus strongly induced EET and NET formation in CRS and, simultaneously, suppressed fungal metabolic activity. EET formation in CRS is associated with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase and NET formation with NADPH-oxidase and mitochondrial ROS. A. fumigatus, but not A. alternata, induced EET and NET formation, and peripheral blood eosinophils and neutrophils exhibited different immune responses against A. fumigatus following the inflammatory status of the host. Aspergillus-fumigatus-induced EET and NET formation plays a crucial role in CRS pathogenesis.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a highly variable expression of phenotypes (restricted interest or activity and repetitive behavior in communication and social interactions), genes (mutation), markers (alteration of transcription) and pathways. Loss of function of the CC2D1A gene appears to primarily affect the brain, leading to a range of behavioral problems in humans. In our study published in 2020, we found that the expressions of miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-126-3p and miR-499a-5p were downregulated in the serum samples of autistic patients, their families and mouse models (Cc2d1a +/- and valproic acid treated males). Here, acquired non-Mendelian hereditary character in a genetically defined mouse model of autism (Cc2d1a +/-) correlates with the transcriptional alteration of five miRNAs. We seek to test the hypothesis that miRNA levels vary by changes in RNA/DNA structure during development, thereby creating transcription alteration and cell memory. Behavioral tests were conducted on the offspring of Cc2d1a (+/-) mutant and control mice, such as novel object, social interaction, marble burying and tail suspension behavior. Two RNA fractions were isolated from mouse hippocampal tissues and sperm cells via standard TRIzol extraction: free RNA and the fraction of RNA bound to DNA in the form of a DNA/RNA hybrid (R-loop). The expression levels of miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p and miR-499a-5p were investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We report differences in the distribution of five miRNAs in the hippocampus between male and female mice, particularly in colonies of Cc2d1a (+/-) mice. Furthermore, the number of miRNAs engaged in the DNA/RNA hybrid fraction is generally higher in the mutant pedigree than in the control group. On the other hand, in sperm, both fractions are at lower levels than in controls. R-loops contribute to the physiology and pathology of organisms including human disease. Here, we report a variation in five miRNA levels between gender and tissue. Our results suggest that the transcription levels of these five miRNAs are directly regulated by their RNA.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy with focal seizures which in some conditions can develop into secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures by the propagation of epileptic activities in the temporal lobe to other brain areas. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been suggested as a treatment target for TLE as accumulating evidence indicates that the NAc, especially its shell, participates in the process of epileptic seizures of patients and animal models with TLE. The majority of neurons in the NAc are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) or dopamine receptor D2 (D2R). However, the direct evidence of the NAc shell participating in the propagation of TLE seizures is missing, and its cell type-specific modulatory roles in TLE seizures are unknown. In this study, we microinjected kainic acid into basolateral amygdala (BLA) to make a mouse model of TLE with initial focal seizures and secondarily generalized seizures (SGSs). We found that TLE seizures caused robust c-fos expression in the NAc shell and increased neuronal excitability of D1R-expressing MSN (D1R-MSN) and D2R-expressing MSN (D2R-MSN). Pharmacological inhibition of the NAc shell alleviated TLE seizures by reducing the number of SGSs and seizure stages. Cell-type-specific chemogenetic inhibition of either D1R-MSN or D2R-MSN showed similar effects with pharmacological inhibition of the NAc shell. Both pharmacological and cell-type-specific chemogenetic inhibition of the NAc shell did not alter the onset time of focal seizures. Collectively, these findings indicate that the NAc shell and its D1R-MSN or D2R-MSN mainly participate in the propagation and generalization of the TLE seizures.

AB  - BackgroundSleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is associated with hypertension and vascular remodeling. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and the Hippo-YAP pathway are implicated in these processes, but their specific roles remain unclear. This study investigated the HIF-1 alpha/Hippo-YAP pathway in SAS-related hypertension.MethodsWe established a rat model of SAS-induced hypertension via chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Rats were treated with siRNA targeting HIF-1 alpha. Blood pressure, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular remodeling, and VSMC function were assessed. In vitro experiments with A7r5 cells and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) explored the effects of HIF-1 alpha silencing and YAP1 overexpression.ResultsCompared with the control group, the CIH group presented significant increases in both HIF-1 alpha and YAP1 expression, which correlated with increased blood pressure and vascular changes. HIF-1 alpha silencing reduced hypertension, oxidative stress, inflammation, and the severity of vascular remodeling. Specifically, siRNA treatment for HIF-1 alpha normalized blood pressure, decreased the levels of oxidative damage markers (increased SOD and decreased MDA), and reversed the changes in the levels of inflammatory markers (decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble E-selectin (sE-s)). Structural analyses revealed reduced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen deposition, along with normalization of cellular markers, such as alpha-SMA and TGF-beta 1. Furthermore, the Hippo-YAP pathway appeared to mediate these effects, as evidenced by altered YAP1 expression and activity upon HIF-1 alpha modulation.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the significance of the HIF-1 alpha/Hippo-YAP pathway in CIH-induced hypertension and vascular remodeling. HIF-1 alpha contributes to these pathophysiological processes by promoting oxidative stress, inflammation, and aberrant VSMC behavior. Targeting this pathway could offer new therapeutic strategies for CIH-related cardiovascular complications in SAS patients.

AB  - The Kv2 channels encode delayed rectifier currents that regulate membrane potential in many tissues. They also have a non-conducting function to form stable junctions between the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes, creating membrane contact sites that mediate functions distinct from membrane excitability. Therefore, proteins that interact with Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 channels can alter conducting and/or non-conducting channel properties. One member of the AMIGO family of proteins is an auxiliary beta-subunit for Kv2 channels and modulates Kv2.1 electrical activity. However, the AMIGO family has two additional members of similar to 50% similarity that have not yet been characterized as Kv2 beta-subunits. In this work, we show that the surface trafficking and localization of all three AMIGOs are controlled by their assembly with both Kv2 channels. Additionally, assembly of each AMIGO with either Kv2.1 or Kv2.2 hyperpolarizes the channel activation midpoint by similar to 10 mV. However, only AMIGO2 significantly slows inactivation and deactivation, leading to a prolonged open state of Kv2 channels. The co-regulatory effects of Kv2s and AMIGOs likely fine-tune both the electrical and non-electrical properties of the cells in which they are expressed.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of intracellular tension signaling in endplate chondrocytes and its impact on extracellular matrix synthesis. Human endplate chondrocytes were subjected to tension load using Flexcell FX-5000 (TM), and changes in phenotype, morphology, and the expression of Hippo signaling pathway and alpha-Catenin were assessed through various techniques. Through the overexpression of YAP and inhibition of alpha-Catenin, the study clarified the intracellular tension signaling pathway and its regulation of extracellular matrix synthesis in endplate cartilage. In vitro-cultured human endplate chondrocytes significantly suppressed phenotype-related genes and proteins, accompanied by distinct changes in cytoskeleton morphology. Tension activation resulted in the substantial activation of the Hippo pathway, increased phosphorylation of YAP, and reduced nuclear translocation of YAP. YAP overexpression alleviated the inhibitory effect of tension on extracellular matrix synthesis in endplate chondrocytes. Tension also upregulated the expression of alpha-Catenin in endplate chondrocytes, which was attenuated by inhibiting alpha-Catenin expression, thereby reducing the impact of tension on cytoskeletal morphology and YAP nuclear translocation. Taken together, the alpha-Catenin/actin skeleton/Hippo-coupled network is a crucial signaling pathway for tension signaling in endplate chondrocytes, providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of endplate cartilage degeneration.

AB  - Background: Creatine (Cr) levels are strongly dependent on diets, including animal-derived proteins. Cr is an important metabolite as it represents a source of stored energy to support physical performance and potentially sustain positive effects such as improving memory or intelligence. This study was planned to assess Cr levels in PKU children adhering to a diet low in phenylalanine (Phe) content and compared with those of children with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) on a free diet. Methods: This retrospective pilot study analyzed Cr levels from Guthrie cards in 25 PKU and 35 MHP subjects. Anthropomorphic and nutritional data of the study populations were assessed, compared and correlated. Results: Cr levels of PKU subjects were significantly lower than those of MHP subjects and correlated to the low intake of animal proteins. Although no deficiencies in PKU subjects were identified, PKU subjects were found to have a 26-fold higher risk of displaying Cr levels <25 degrees percentile than MHP counterparts. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that Cr levels might be concerningly low in PKU children adhering to a low-Phe diet. Confirmatory studies are needed in PKU patients of different age groups to assess Cr levels and the potential benefits on physical and intellectual performance of Cr supplementation.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive malignancy and represents the most common brain tumor in adults. To better understand its biology for new and effective therapies, we examined the role of GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B (GMPPB), a key unit of the GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GDP-MP) that catalyzes the formation of GDP-mannose. Impaired GMPPB function will reduce the amount of GDP-mannose available for O-mannosylation. Abnormal O-mannosylation of alpha dystroglycan (alpha-DG) has been reported to be involved in cancer metastasis and arenavirus entry. Here, we found that GMPPB is highly expressed in a panel of GBM cell lines and clinical samples and that expression of GMPPB is positively correlated with the WHO grade of gliomas. Additionally, expression of GMPPB was negatively correlated with the prognosis of GBM patients. We demonstrate that silencing GMPPB inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells both in vitro and in vivo and that overexpression of GMPPB exhibits the opposite effects. Consequently, targeting GMPPB in GBM cells results in impaired GBM tumor growth and invasion. Finally, we identify that the Hippo/MMP3 axis is essential for GMPPB-promoted GBM aggressiveness. These findings indicate that GMPPB represents a potential novel target for GBM treatment.

AB  - Background: Nanobodies, or VHHs, are derived from heavy chain-only antibodies (hcAbs) found in camelids. They overcome some of the inherent limitations of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and derivatives thereof, due to their smaller molecular size and higher stability, and thus present an alternative to mAbs for therapeutic use. Two nanobodies, Nb23 and Nb24, have been shown to similarly inhibit the self-aggregation of very amyloidogenic variants of beta 2-microglobulin. Here, the structure of Nb23 was modeled with the Chemical-Shift (CS)-Rosetta server using chemical shift assignments from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments, and used as prior knowledge in PONDEROSA restrained modeling based on experimentally assessed internuclear distances. Further validation was comparatively obtained with the results of molecular dynamics trajectories calculated from the resulting best energy-minimized Nb23 conformers. Methods: 2D and 3D NMR spectroscopy experiments were carried out to determine the assignment of the backbone and side chain hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon resonances to extract chemical shifts and interproton separations for restrained modeling. Results: The solution structure of isolated Nb23 nanobody was determined. Conclusions: The structural analysis indicated that isolated Nb23 has a dynamic CDR3 loop distributed over different orientations with respect to Nb24, which could determine differences in target antigen affinity or complex lability.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCA) is an epithelial malignant tumor occurring in the prostate gland. It is the second most common male cancer in the world and one of the top five cancer deaths in men. To combat this disease, it is needed to identify important tumor suppressor genes and elucidate the molecular mechanisms. S100 calcium-binding protein A14 (S100A14), a member of the S100 family, is located on chromosome 1q21.3 and contains an EF-hand motif that binds calcium. S100A14 is involved in a variety of tumor biological processes in several types of cancers. Its expression level and related biological functions are tissue or tumor specific. However, its possible effects on prostate cancer are still unclear. Herein, we found the low expression of S100A14 in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. S100A14 suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and promoted cell apoptosis. Additionally, S100A14 suppressed the motility and EMT processes of prostate cancer cells. We further found S100A14 promoted the expression of FAT1 and activated the Hippo pathway, which, therefore, suppressed the prostate cancer progression. The in vivo assays confirmed that S100A14 suppressed tumor growth of prostate cancer cells through FAT1-mediated Hippo pathway in mice. In conclusion, we clarified the mechanism underlying S100A14 suppressing prostate cancer progression and, therefore, we thought S100A14 could serve as a tumor suppressor protein.

AB  - Background Quercetin (QUE) is a flavonol reported with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, and previous results from the group of this study have demonstrated its neuroprotective effect against lipopolysaccharide-induced neuropsychiatric injuries. However, little is known about its potential effect on neuropsychiatric injuries induced or accompanied by metabolic dysfunction of glucose and lipids. Methods A nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) rat model was induced via a high-fat diet (HFD), and glucolipid parameters and liver function were measured. Behavioral performance was observed via the open field test (OFT) and the Morris water maze (MWM). The plasma levels of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) and TREM2 were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein expression levels of Synapsin-1 (Syn-1), Synaptatogmin-1 (Syt-1), TREM1 and TREM2 in the hippocampus were detected using western blotting. Morphological changes in the liver and hippocampus were detected by HE and Oil red or silver staining. Results Compared with the control rats, HFD-induced NAFLD model rats presented significant metabolic dysfunction, hepatocyte steatosis, and impaired learning and memory ability, as indicated by the increased plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG), the impaired glucose tolerance, the accumulated fat droplets and balloon-like changes in the liver, and the increased escaping latency but decreased duration in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze. All these changes were reversed in QUE-treated rats. Moreover, apart from improving the morphological injuries in the hippocampus, treatment with QUE could increase the decreased plasma concentration and hippocampal protein expression of TREM1 in NAFLD rats and increase the decreased expression of Syn-1 and Syt-1 in the hippocampus. Conclusions These results suggested the therapeutic potential of QUE against NAFLD-associated impairment of learning and memory, and the mechanism might involve regulating the metabolic dysfunction of glucose and lipids and balancing the protein expression of synaptic plasticity markers and TREM1/2 in the hippocampus.

AB  - Mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits and their resulting glucose hypometabolism are the key pathophysiological modulators that promote neurodegeneration. However, there are no specific potential molecules that have been identified to treat neurological diseases by regulating energy metabolism and repairing mitochondrial damage. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex (PDC), which can be phosphorylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), is the gate-keeping enzyme for mitochondrial glucose oxidation. In this study, a small-molecule scutellarin (SG) is discovered that can significantly alleviate the neuropathological changes in hippocampal CA1 of cerebral hypoperfusion model rats, rescued the morphological changes of abnormal mitochondria, and restored mitochondrial homeostasis. Mitochondrial proteomics, energy metabolism monitoring, and C-13-metabolic flux analysis targeted SG activity on PDK2, thus regulating PDK-PDC-mediated glycolytic metabolism to TCA cycle during mitochondrial OXPHOS damage. The knockdown of PDK2 in the SK-N-SH cells validated that SG could rescue mitochondrial damage via the PDK-PDC axis, promote the MMP level and reduce the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Collectively, this study explored the novel therapeutic approach: the PDK-PDC axis for neurological injury and cognitive impairment and uncovered the effect of SG on mitochondrial protection via the PDK-PDC axis and mitochondrial glucose oxidation. The findings indicate that active components ameliorating mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits could be of significant value for neurological disease therapy.

AB  - In this article, we describe the effects of tail pinch (TP), a mild acute stressor, on the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its tyrosine kinase receptor B (trkB) proteins in the hippocampus (HC) of the outbred Roman High- (RHA) and Low-Avoidance (RLA) rats, one of the most validated genetic models for the study of fear/anxiety- and stress-related behaviors. Using Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry assays, we show for the first time that TP induces distinct changes in the levels of BDNF and trkB proteins in the dorsal (dHC) and ventral (vHC) HC of RHA and RLA rats. The WB assays showed that TP increases BDNF and trkB levels in the dHC of both lines but induces opposite changes in the vHC, decreasing BDNF levels in RHA rats and trkB levels in RLA rats. These results suggest that TP may enhance plastic events in the dHC and hinder them in the vHC. Immunohistochemical assays, carried out in parallel to assess the location of changes revealed by the WB, showed that, in the dHC, TP increases BDNF-like immunoreactivity (LI) in the CA2 sector of the Ammon's horn of both Roman lines and in the CA3 sector of the Ammon's horn of RLA rats while, in the dentate gyrus (DG), TP increases trkB-LI in RHA rats. In contrast, in the vHC, TP elicits only a few changes, represented by decreases of BDNF- and trkB-LI in the CA1 sector of the Ammon's horn of RHA rats. These results support the view that the genotypic/phenotypic features of the experimental subjects influence the effects of an acute stressor, even as mild as TP, on the basal BDNF/trkB signaling, leading to different changes in the dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the HC.

AB  - Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment (PD-CI) results in several clinical outcomes for which specific treatment is lacking. Although the pathogenesis of PD-CI has not yet been fully elucidated, it is related to neuronal plasticity decline in the hippocampus region. The dopaminergic projections from the substantia nigra to the hippocampus are critical in regulating hippocampal plasticity. Recently, aerobic exercise has been recognized as an effective therapeutic strategy for enhancing plasticity through the secretion of various muscle factors. The exact role of FNDC5-an upregulated, newly identified myokine produced after exercise-in mediating hippocampal plasticity and regional dopaminergic projections in PD-CI remains unclear. In this study, the effect of treadmill exercise on hippocampal synaptic plasticity was evaluated in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced chronic PD models. The results showed that treadmill exercise substantially alleviated the motor dysfunction, cognition disorder, and dopaminergic neuron degeneration induced by MPTP. Here, we discovered that the quadriceps, serum, and brain FNDC5 levels were lower in PD mice and that intervention with treadmill exercise restored FNDC5 levels. Moreover, treadmill exercise enhanced the synaptic plasticity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons via increased dopamine levels and BDNF in the PD mice. The direct protective effect of FNDC5 is achieved by promoting the secretion of BDNF in the hippocampal neurons via binding the integrin alpha V beta 5 receptor, thereby improving synaptic plasticity. Regarding the indirect protection effect, FNDC5 promotes the dopaminergic connection from the substantia nigra to the hippocampus by mediating the interaction between the integrin alpha V beta 5 of the hippocampal neurons and the CD90 molecules on the membrane of dopaminergic terminals. Our findings demonstrated that treadmill exercise could effectively alleviate cognitive disorders via the activation of the FNDC5-BDNF pathway and enhance the dopaminergic synaptic connection from SNpc to the hippocampus in the MPTP-induced chronic PD model.

AB  - Obesity confers risk for cardiovascular disease and vascular dementia. However, genomic alterations modulated by obesity in endothelial cells in the brain and their relationship to other neurovascular unit (NVU) cells are unknown. We performed single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of the NVU (endothelial cells, astrocytes, microglia, and neurons) from the hippocampus of obese (ob/ob) and wild-type (WT) male mice to characterize obesity-induced transcriptomic changes in a key brain memory center and assessed blood-brain barrier permeability (BBB) by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ob/ob mice displayed obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. snRNAseq profiled 14 distinct cell types and 32 clusters within the hippocampus of ob/ob and WT mice and uncovered differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in all NVU cell types, namely, 4462 in neurons, 1386 in astrocytes, 125 in endothelial cells, and 154 in microglia. Gene ontology analysis identified important biological processes such as angiogenesis in endothelial cells and synaptic trafficking in neurons. Cellular pathway analysis included focal adhesion and insulin signaling, which were common to all NVU cell types. Correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations between endothelial cells and other NVU cell types. Differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were observed in cells of the NVU-affecting pathways such as TNF and mTOR. BBB permeability showed a trend toward increased signal intensity in ob/ob mice. Taken together, our study provides in-depth insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in obesity and may have implications for therapeutic gene targeting.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) system modulates alcohol seeking and consumption, and GLP-1 analogues may represent novel pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Accordingly, it is important to understand the potential effects of alcohol on the endogenous GLP-1 system. In a series of secondary analyses of previous human laboratory experiments, we first examined the effects of alcohol administration, with different doses and routes of administration, on peripheral active GLP-1 concentrations in heavy-drinking individuals with AUD enrolled in placebo-controlled pharmacological studies (only placebo conditions were analysed here). Alcohol administration resulted in a significant reduction of GLP-1 levels across the four experiments (oral alcohol, variable dose: F-3,F-28 = 6.52, p = 0.002; oral alcohol, fixed dose: F-7,F-75.94 = 5.08, p < 0.001; intravenous alcohol, variable dose: F-4,F-37.03 = 20.72, p < 0.001; intravenous alcohol, fixed dose: F-4,F-13.92 = 10.44, p < 0.001). Next, central expression of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in post-mortem brain tissues (amygdala, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) was compared between individuals with AUD and controls. Fold change of GLP-1R mRNA in the hippocampus was significantly higher in individuals with AUD, compared to controls (F-1,F-21 = 6.80, p = 0.01). A trend-level effect with the same direction was also found in the prefrontal cortex (F-1,F-20 = 3.07, p = 0.09). Exploratory analyses showed that GLP-1R gene expression levels were correlated with behavioural measures of alcohol drinking (hippocampus) and cigarette smoking (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex). Collectively, these data provide novel information on the crosstalk between alcohol and GLP-1 in a clinically relevant sample. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of this link.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related dementia. Neuronal calcium homeostasis impairment may contribute to AD. Here we demonstrated that voltage-gated calcium (VGC) entry and store-operated calcium (SOC) entry regulated by calcium sensors of intracellular calcium stores STIM proteins are affected in hippocampal neurons of the 5xFAD transgenic mouse model. We observed excessive SOC entry in 5xFAD mouse neurons, mediated by STIM1 and STIM2 proteins with increased STIM1 contribution. There were no significant changes in cytoplasmic calcium level, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bulk calcium levels, or expression levels of STIM1 or STIM2 proteins. The potent inhibitor BTP-2 and the FDA-approved drug leflunomide reduced SOC entry in 5xFAD neurons. In turn, excessive voltage-gated calcium entry was sensitive to the inhibitor of L-type calcium channels nifedipine but not to the T-type channels inhibitor ML218. Interestingly, the depolarization-induced calcium entry mediated by VGC channels in 5xFAD neurons was dependent on STIM2 but not STIM1 protein in cells with replete Ca2+ stores. The result gives new evidence on the VGC channel modulation by STIM2. Overall, the data demonstrate the changes in calcium signaling of hippocampal neurons of the AD mouse model, which precede amyloid plaque accumulation or other signs of pathology manifestation.

AB  - Soluble oligomeric forms of Amyloid-beta (A beta) are considered the major toxic species leading to the neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, drugs that prevent oligomer formation might be promising. The atypical dipeptide GAL-201 is orally bioavailable and interferes as a modulator of A beta aggregation. It binds to aggregation-prone, misfolded A beta monomers with high selectivity and affinity, thereby preventing the formation of toxic oligomers. Here, we demonstrate that the previously observed protective effect of GAL-201 on synaptic plasticity occurs irrespective of shortages and post-translational modifications (tested isoforms: A beta(1-42), A beta(p3-42), A beta(1-40) and 3NTyr(10)-A beta). Interestingly, the neuroprotective activity of a single dose of GAL-201 was still present after one week and correlated with a prevention of A beta-induced spine loss. Furthermore, we could observe beneficial effects on spine morphology as well as the significantly reduced activation of proinflammatory microglia and astrocytes in the presence of an A beta(1-42)-derived toxicity. In line with these in vitro data, GAL-201 additionally improved hippocampus-dependent spatial learning in the "tgArcSwe" AD mouse model after a single subcutaneous administration. By this means, we observed changes in the deposition pattern: through the clustering of misfolded monomers as off-pathway non-toxic A beta agglomerates, toxic oligomers are removed. Our results are in line with previously collected preclinical data and warrant the initiation of Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies for GAL-201. By demonstrating the highly efficient detoxification of beta-sheet monomers, leading to the neutralization of A beta oligomer toxicity, GAL-201 represents a promising drug candidate against A beta-derived pathophysiology present in AD.

AB  - Elevated arsenic (As) contamination in drinking water was detected in many areas of Pakistan. The intoxication of As causes various neurological diseases in humans, which can be inhibited by the administration of potent antioxidants. Trace elements are also found in drinking water such as selenium (Se), which possess antioxidant potential. The main purpose of the current study is to find out the protective effect of Se against As toxicity which can cause anxiety- and depression-like behaviors as well as memory impairment. Thirty-six male rats were divided into six groups: (1) distilled water (dw)+dw, (2) dw+Se (0.175 mg/ml/kg), (3) dw+Se (0.35mg/ml/kg), (4) dw+As (2.5mg/ml/kg), (5) As (2.5mg/ml/kg) + Se (0.175 mg/ml/kg), and (6) As (2.5mg/ml/kg) + Se (0.35 mg/ml/kg). Rats were treated with respective treatment for 4 weeks. Sub-chronic treatment of As reduced time spent in open arm (elevated plus maze), and lightbox (light-dark activity test) and increased immobility time in forced swim test indicate anxiety- and/or depression-like behavior, respectively. Conversely, rats treated with As+Se (at both doses) increased time spent in open arm (elevated plus maze), and lightbox (light-dark activity test) and decreased immobility time in forced swim test indicate the anxiolytic and anti-depressive effect of Se, respectively. Co-administration of Se (0.175 and 0.35) inhibited As instigated reduction of spatial memory performed in Morris water maze. The reversal in the reduced level of malondialdehyde and activity of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampus by Se was observed in As-treated animals, while the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the hippocampus was increased in As+Se than dw+As-treated animals. Histopathological studies have shown the reversal of hippocampus deterioration by Se in As-treated rats. The results may imply to prevent the intoxication of As instigated impairment in behavioral and biochemical indices by Se supplementation and/or increased safer intake.

AB  - Verbenalin, among the major constituents of Verbena officinalis, has been reported to exhibit sleep-promoting and antioxidant activities. This study demonstrates the effects of verbenalin on amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide generation in Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing Neuro2a cells (SweAPP/N2a) and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models. We further performed molecular biological analyses of these in vitro and in vivo models of AD. The effects of verbenalin were assessed based on the expression of factors related to A beta peptide production using Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The intracellular expression and release of APP protein were both decreased by verbenalin treatment in SweAPP/N2a cells. Thus, the production of A beta peptides was decreased. Compared to those in AD transgenic (Tg) mice, IHC revealed that verbenalin-treated animals showed decreased A beta and tau expression levels in the hippocampus. In addition, verbenalin restored the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of AD animal models. These findings suggest that verbenalin may decrease A beta formation both in vitro and in vivo. Verbenalin may also help improve the pathological hallmarks of AD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ischemic stroke is a common and frequent clinical disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that sphingolipid plays an important role in the pathological process of ischemic stroke. PI3K-Akt is a classic protective signaling pathway of cerebral ischemic injury. After acting on the S1P receptor, S1P can activate the downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and play an anti-cerebral ischemia role. Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula used to treat ischemic stroke. However, the mech-anisms of BHD on ischemic stroke remain unclear based on S1P/S1PR1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Aim of the study: The present study is intended to investigate the action mechanism of BHD on ischemic stroke based on the S1P/S1PR1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway from multiple perspectives. Materials and methods: The BHD lyophilized product was prepared by vacuum freeze-drying method, of which the chemical composition was determined by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The mouse permanent middle cerebral artery oc-clusion (pMCAO) model was established by the suture-occluded method. Male KM mice were randomly divided into seven groups: sham group, model group, FTY720 (positive control) group, BHD group, BHD + W146 (se-lective S1PR1 inhibitor) group, SEW2871 (selective S1PR1 agonist) group, and Calycosin group. Each group was administered continuously for 14 days and evaluated with modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and cerebral infarct volume on the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 14th days. The SphK1, SphK2, S1PR1, PI3K, Akt, and p-Akt protein in the prefrontal lobe, hippocampus, and striatum was quantified by Western blot and immunohisto-chemical (IHC) experiment respectively. The qRT-PCR method was employed to evaluate SphK1, SphK2, and S1PR1 mRNA expression in the above tissue.Results: BHD and Calycosin both effectively improved mNSS scores with smaller infarct volumes. The SphK1 level in the prefrontal lobe, hippocampus, and striatum of mice in the BHD group was significantly lower, and SphK2, PI3K, and p-Akt in the hippocampus and striatum were significantly higher than those in the model group. BHD significantly decreased SphK1 mRNA expression in the prefrontal lobe, hippocampus, and striatum, and significantly up-regulated SphK2 mRNA and S1PR1 mRNA expression. Additionally, SphK1 protein expression levels of the prefrontal lobe, hippocampus, and striatum in the BHD group was significantly lower than model group, and SphK2, S1PR1, PI3K, Akt, and p-Akt protein expressions levels were increased obviously. Furthermore, SEW2871 can increase S1PR1 and Akt expression, and up-regulate SphK2 and S1PR1 mRNA expression. The effect of BHD on the expression of S1P/S1PR1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related proteins and mRNA were weakened by BHD + W146. Conclusion: BHD and Calycosin significantly improved the symptoms of neurological deficits in pMCAO mice, reduced the cerebral infarction volume, up-regulated SphK2 and S1PR1 mRNA levels, enhanced SphK2, S1PR1, PI3K, Akt, p-Akt protein expression of the prefrontal lobe, hippocampus and striatum, and down-regulated SphK1 mRNA and protein expression, which may be helpful to clarify the mechanism of BHD through S1P/S1PR1/PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway to protect against cerebral ischemic injury.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle to the development of effective therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This has been particularly true in the case of monoclonal antibody (mAbs) therapeutic candidates, due to their large size. To tackle this issue, we developed new nanoformulations, comprising bio-based Triozan polymers along with kinin B1 and B2 receptor (B1R and B2R) peptide agonist analogues, as potent BBB-permeabilizers to enhance brain delivery of a new anti-C1q mAb for AD (ANX005). The prepared B1R/B2R-TRIOZAN (TM) nanoparticles (NPs) displayed aqueous solubility, B1R/B2R binding capacity and uniform sizes (similar to 130-165 nm). The relative biodistribution profiles of the mAb loaded into these NPs versus the naked mAb were assessed in vivo through two routes of administrations (intravenous (IV), intranasal (IN)) in the Tg-SwDI mouse model of AD. At 24 h post-administration, brain levels of the encapsulated mAb were significantly increased (up to 12-fold (IV) and 5-fold (IN), respectively) compared with free mAb in AD brain affected regions, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus of aged mice. Liver uptakes remained relatively low with similar values for the nanoformulations and free mAb. Our findings demonstrate the potential of B1R/B2R-TRIOZAN (TM) NPs for the targeted delivery of new CNS drugs, which could maximize their therapeutic effectiveness.

AB  - The purpose of our study is to understand the protective effects of small molecule ligands for phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Many reports show evidence that phosphorylated tau is reported to be an important contributor to the formation of paired helical filaments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD neurons. In AD, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta), cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), are the three important kinases responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation. Currently, there are no drugs and/or small molecules that reduce the toxicity of phosphorylated tau in AD. In the present study, we rationally selected and validated small molecule ligands that bind to the phosphorylated tau at SER23 (Ser 285) and TYR44 (Tyr310). We also assessed the molecular dynamics and validated molecular docking sites for the three best ligands. Based on the best docking scores -8.09, -7.9 and -7.8 kcal/mol, we found that ligand 1 binds to key hyperphosphorylation residues of phosphorylated tau that inhibit abnormal PHF-tau, DYRK1A and GKS3 beta that reduce phosphorylated tau levels in AD. Using biochemical, molecular, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy analyses, we studied the ligand 1 inhibition as well as mitochondrial and synaptic protective effects in immortalized primary hippocampal neuronal (HT22) cells. We found interactions between NAT10-262501 (ligand 1) and phosphorylated tau at key phosphorylation sites and these ligand-based inhibitions decreased PHF-tau, DYRK1A and GSK3 beta levels. We also found increased mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fusion and synaptic activities and reduced mitochondrial fission in ligand 1-treated mutant tau HT22 cells. Based on these results, we cautiously conclude that phosphorylated tau NAT10-262501 (ligand 1) reduces hyperphosphorylation of tau based GKS3 beta and CDK5 kinase regulation in AD, and aids in the maintenance of neuronal structure, mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis with a possible therapeutic drug target for AD.

AB  - L-serine is a non-essential amino acid endogenously produced by astrocytes and is abundant in human diets. Beneficial roles of the metabolic products from L-serine in various conditions in the brain including neuronal development have been reported. Through several preclinical studies, L-serine treatment was also shown to offer beneficial therapeutic effects for brain damage such as ischemic stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Despite evidence for the value of L-serine in the clinic, however, its beneficial effects on the propionic acid (PPA)-induced neuronal toxicity and underlying mechanisms of L-serine-mediated neuroprotection are unknown. In this study, we observed that PPA-induced acidic stress induces abnormal lipid accumulation and functional defects in lysosomes of hippocampal neurons. L-serine treatment was able to rescue the structure and function of lysosomes in PPA-treated hippocampal neuronal cells. We further identified that L-serine suppressed the formation of lipid droplets and abnormal lipid membrane accumulations inside the lysosomes in PPA-treated hippocampal neuronal cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that L-serine can be utilized as a neuroprotective agent for the functionality of lysosomes through restoration of cathepsin D in disease conditions.

AB  - It remains difficult for mobile robots to continue accurate self-localization when they are suddenly teleported to a location that is different from their beliefs during navigation. Incorporating insights from neuroscience into developing a spatial cognition model for mobile robots may make it possible to acquire the ability to respond appropriately to changing situations, similar to living organisms. Recent neuroscience research has shown that during teleportation in rat navigation, neural populations of place cells in the cornu ammonis-3 region of the hippocampus, which are sparse representations of each other, switch discretely. In this study, we construct a spatial cognition model using brain reference architecture-driven development, a method for developing brain-inspired software that is functionally and structurally consistent with the brain. The spatial cognition model was realized by integrating the recurrent state-space model, a world model, with Monte Carlo localization to infer allocentric self-positions within the framework of neuro-symbol emergence in the robotics toolkit. The spatial cognition model, which models the cornu ammonis-1 and -3 regions with each latent variable, demonstrated improved self-localization performance of mobile robots during teleportation in a simulation environment. Moreover, it was confirmed that sparse neural activity could be obtained for the latent variables corresponding to cornu ammonis-3. These results suggest that spatial cognition models incorporating neuroscience insights can contribute to improving the self-localization technology for mobile robots.

AB  - Despite the well-accepted role of the two main neuropathological markers (beta-amyloid and tau) in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the interaction and specific contribution of each of them is not fully elucidated. To address this question, in the present study, an adeno-associated virus (AAV9) carrying the mutant P301L form of human tau, was injected into the dorsal hippocampi of APP/PS1 transgenic mice or wild type mice (WT). Three months after injections, memory tasks, biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. We found that the overexpression of hTauP301L accelerates memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice, but it did not affect memory function of WT mice. Likewise, biochemical assays showed that only in the case of APP/PS1-hTauP301L injected mice, an important accumulation of tau was observed in the insoluble urea fraction. Similarly, electron microscopy images revealed that numerous clusters of tau immunoparticles appear at the dendrites of APP/PS1 injected mice and not in WT animals, suggesting that the presence of amyloid is necessary to induce tau aggregation. Interestingly, these tau immunoparticles accumulate in dendritic mitochondria in the APP/PS1 mice, whereas most of mitochondria in WT injected mice remain free of tau immunoparticles. Taken together, it seems that amyloid induces tau aggregation and accumulation in the dendritic mitochondria and subsequently may alter synapse function, thus, contributing to accelerate cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice.

AB  - Memory impairment is a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with amnesia often appearing as its earliest symptom. Given the multifactorial nature of AD pathogenesis, this study investigates the multi-target therapeutic potential of sobrerol (coded as NRM-331) in a scopolamine-induced amnesia mouse model, focusing specifically on its effects in ameliorating memory deficits and enhancing neuronal plasticity. Sixty male C57BL/6NCrljOri mice were divided into six groups (10 mice/group): vehicle control (CTL, saline), scopolamine (SPA, 10 mg/kg/day), Aricept (APT, 2 mg/kg/day), and three treatment groups receiving NRM-331 at doses of 40, 80, and 100 mg/kg/day. Several behavioral tests were conducted, including the Y-maze test, passive avoidance test, and Morris water maze test. Additionally, biochemical assays were performed in serum (to measure A ss 1-40 and A ss 1-42) and in the brain (to assess ACh and AChE levels), along with histopathological examination of the brain using Nissl staining and p-tau IHC. No significant change was observed in the Y-maze test or the acquisition trial of the passive avoidance test. However, improvements were noted in the retention trial of the passive avoidance test and the Morris water maze test (including escape latency, swim distance, and number of platform crossed) for the NRM-331 groups compared to the SPA group. Serum levels of A ss 1-40 and A ss 1-42 decreased in the NRM-331 groups compared to the SPA group. In the brain, levels of ACh significantly increased, while AChE levels significantly decreased compared to the SPA group. The number of neuronal cells improved in the CA1, CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus, as indicated by Nissl staining. A significant reduction in p-tau accumulation was also observed in the NRM-331 groups. In conclusion, NRM-331 demonstrated an anti-amnesic effect by enhancing hippocampal cholinergic signaling, alongside exhibiting anti-tau and anti-A beta synthesis properties. These therapeutic effects suggest that NRM-331 significantly mitigates memory impairment induced by SPA through a neuroprotective mechanism.

AB  - Fracture of the alveolar bone resorption is a common complication in orthodontic treatment, which mainly caused by extreme mechanical loading. However, the ferroptosis with orthodontic tooth movement(OTM) relationship has not been thoroughly described. We here analysed whether ferroptosis is involved in OTM-associated alveolar bone loss. Mouse osteoblasts (MC-3T3) and knockdown glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) MC-3T3 were stimulated with compressive force loading and ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor), and the changes in lipid peroxidation morphology, expression of ferroptosis-related factors and osteogenesis levels were detected. After establishing the rat experimental OTM model, the changes in ferroptosis-related factors and osteogenesis levels were reevaluated in the same manner. Ferroptosis was involved in mechanical stress regulating osteoblast remodelling, and Fer-1 and erastin affected osteoblasts under compression force loading. Fer-1 regulated ferroptosis and autophagy in MC-3T3 and promoted bone proliferation. GPX4-dependent ferroptosis stimulated the YAP (homologous oncoproteins Yes-associated protein) pathway, and GPX4 promoted ferroptosis via the YAP-TEAD (transcriptional enhanced associate domain) signal pathway under mechanical compression force. The in vivo experiment results were consistent with the in vitro experiment results. Ferroptosis transpires during the motion of orthodontic teeth, with compression force side occurring earlier than stretch side within 4 h. GPX4 plays an important role in alveolar bone loss, while Fer-1 can inhibit the compression force-side alveolar bone loss. GPX4's Hippo-YAP pathway is activated by the lack of compression force in the lateral alveolar bone.

AB  - Oxidative stress has been implicated in the aging process and the progression of many neurodegenerative disorders. We previously reported that a novel oxindole compound, GIF-0726-r, effectively prevents endogenous oxidative stress, such as oxytosis/ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death, in mouse hippocampal cells. In this study, using two hundred compounds that were developed based on the structure-activity relationship of GIF-0726-r, we screened for the most potent compounds that prevent glutamate- and erastin-induced oxytosis and ferroptosis. Using submicromolar concentrations, we identified nine neuroprotective compounds that have N,N-dimethylaniline as a common structure but no longer contain an oxindole ring. The most potent derivatives, GIF-2114 and GIF-2197-r (the racemate of GIF-2115 and GIF-2196), did not affect glutathione levels, had no antioxidant activity in vitro, or ability to activate the Nrf2 pathway, but prevented oxytosis/ferroptosis via reducing reactive oxygen production and decreasing ferrous ions. Furthermore, we developed fluorescent probes of GIF-2114 and GIF-2197-r to image their distribution in live cells and found that they preferentially accumulated in late endosomes/lysosomes, which play a central role in iron metabolism. These results suggest that GIF-2114 and GIF-2197-r protect hippocampal cells from oxytosis/ferroptosis by targeting late endosomes and lysosomes, as well as decreasing ferrous ions.

AB  - Purpose: It has been hypothesized that compounds with strong anti-oxidant activity might mitigate lead-induced neurotoxicity that resulted to neuronal degeneration.Ginkgo biloba supplement (GB-S) is a neuroactive supplement which has been reported to demonstrate neuroprotective effects. In this study, we investigated the reversal effect and the underlying mechanism of GB-S following lead-induced neurotoxicity in mice.& nbsp;Methods: Male Swiss mice (n = 8) were pre-treated with lead acetate (100 mg/kg) for 30 min before GB-S (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) or Ethylenedia minetetra acetic acid (EDTA) (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 14 consecutive days. Memory impairment symptoms were evaluated on day 13 and 14 using Y-maze and Novel object recognition test (NORT) respectively. Thereafter, spectrophotometry, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and histomorphormetry were used to estimate the degree and expression of biomarkers of neuronal inflammation: oxidoinflammatory stress, apoptosis and degeneration in the hippocampus (HC).& nbsp;Results: Lead acetate treatment significantly (p < 0.05) induced neurobehavioral impairment which was reversed by GB-S as evident in increased percentage alternation and discrimination index. GB-S significantly (p < 0.05) reduced lipid peroxidation and nitrite level, inhibited TNF-alpha and acetylcholinesterase activity and improved glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in the HC. Moreover, GB-S inhibited hippocampal apoptosis via elevated expression of caspase-3 with marked increase level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Also, the histomorphormetric study showed that GB-S rescued death of pyramidal neurons (CA3) in the HC.& nbsp;Conclusion: Our findings however suggest that GB-S decreased memory impairment progression induced by lead acetate via mechanisms connected to inhibition of oxido-inflammatory stress mediators, restrained acetylcholinesterase activity, up-regulated BDNF/Caspase-3 expression and suppression of hippocampal pyramidal neuron degeneration in mice.

AB  - Ageing population is a tough task worldwide, and the aggravating trend of ageing population in China brings enormous pressure to healthcare system. Chinese acupuncture has shown definite anti-ageing effect as arthralgia relief, movement improvement, energy increase and immunity enhancement; however, the mechanisms underlying are far away from illumination. Increasing literature has highlighted the role of alterations in mitochondrial function as a potential central regulator in ageing biology; mitophagy plays a critical role in mitochondrial quality control. In the present study, we demonstrated that acupoint catgut embedding treatment ameliorated ageing-related alterations in appearance, muscle function and spatial memory in rats, reduced degenerated cells in hippocampus, and maintained relatively normal structures in the hippocampus tissue and neurons. These changes were proved to be associated with the regulation of mitochondrial function and autophagic activity. Furthermore, we investigated part of the molecular mechanisms and demonstrated that the PINK1 other than PINK1-Parkin signalling pathway involved in the effects of acupoint catgut embedding, and the imbalancement between mitochondrial fusion and fission and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis may aggravate or compensate for impaired mitochondria. The factors act downstream PINK, and the interaction between them for mitochondrial homeostasis in this process remains to be identified.

AB  - This study investigated the ameliorative effects of beta-carotene (BC) on diabetes-associated vascular dementia and its action against biomolecule oxidation. The diabetic vascular dementia (VaD) was induced by administration of nicotinamide (NA; 50 mg/kg; i.p.) and streptozotocin (STZ; 50 mg/kg; i.p.). The test compound, BC (50 and 100 mg/kg; p.o.), and the reference compound, donepezil (DP) (1 mg/kg; p.o.), were administered for 15 consecutive days. Changes in learning and memory were assessed by escape latency time (ELT) and times spent in target quadrant (TSTQ) in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The changes in neurotransmitter, i.e., acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and oxidative stress markers, i.e., thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH), were estimated in hippocampal tissue of the rat brain. The administration of STZ caused significant deterioration of cognitive function (decreased ELT and raised the TSTQ) as compared to the normal group. Treatment with BC and DP diminished the increased AChE activity, TBARS level and decreased GSH level caused by STZ. Thus, BC ameliorates the diabetic vascular complications in VaD due to its potential anticholinergic, antioxidative and free radical scavenging actions.

AB  - Neurogenesis in the adult brain comprises the entire set of events of neuronal development. It begins with the division of precursor cells to form a mature, integrated, and functioning neuronal network. Adult neurogenesis is believed to play an important role in animals' cognitive abilities, including learning and memory. In the present study, significant neuronal differentiation-promoting activity of 80% (v/v) ethanol extract of P. cocos (EEPC) was found in Neuro-2a cells and mouse cortical neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Subsequently, a total of 97 compounds in EEPC were identified by UHPLC-Q-Exactive-MS/MS. Among them, four major compounds-Adenosine; Choline; Ethyl palmitoleate; and L-(-)-arabinitol-were further studied for their neuronal differentiation-promoting activity. Of which, choline has the most significant neuronal differentiation-promoting activity, indicating that choline, as the main bioactive compound in P. cocos, may have a positive effect on learning and memory functions. Compared with similar research literature, this is the first time that the neuronal differentiation-promoting effects of P. cocos extract have been studied.

AB  - Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA-binding protein implicated in juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the FUS gene, particularly those affecting the nuclear localization signal (NLS), impair nuclear import and lead to cytoplasmic accumulation of FUS inclusions in motor neurons. However, the pathological and clinical significance of FUS variants outside the NLS remains less understood. Here, we describe clinical and histopathological findings from three ALS patients carrying FUS variants: two with NLS-region variants (R495X and P525L), and one with a variant in the N-terminal region outside the NLS (Q23L). The patients carrying NLS variants presented with aggressive, juvenile-onset spinal and bulbar ALS, characterized primarily by lower motor neuron involvement and rapid disease progression. In contrast, the Q23L patient exhibited a slowly progressive disease course, with predominantly upper motor neuron signs. Neuropathological analysis revealed cytoplasmic FUS inclusions in motor neurons of patients with NLS variants, consistent with typical FUS pathology. In contrast, the Q23L patient lacked FUS inclusions and instead displayed pTDP-43 pathology in the hippocampus, neocortex (including the motor cortex), nucleus olivaris, lentiform nucleus, striatum, and some lower motor neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that Q23L is most likely a benign variant. As antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting FUS are currently being explored in clinical trials, further neuropathological investigations are needed to determine whether ASO-mediated FUS silencing would be effective for patients carrying FUS variants outside the NLS region.

AB  - Fibrosis is one of the parameters of lung tissue remodeling in asthma. Relaxin has emerged as a natural suppressor of fibrosis, showing efficacy in the prevention of a multiple models of fibrosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the aptitudes of relaxin, in the context of its immunomodulatory properties, in the development of airway remodeling. WI-38 and HFL1 fibroblasts, as well as epithelial cells (NHBE), were incubated with relaxin. Additionally, remodeling conditions were induced with two serotypes of rhinovirus (HRV). The expression of the genes contributing to airway remodeling were determined. Moreover, NF-kappa B, c-Myc, and STAT3 were knocked down to analyze the pathways involved in airway remodeling. Relaxin decreased the mRNA expression of collagen I and TGF-beta and increased the expression of MMP-9 (p < 0.05). Relaxin also decreased HRV-induced expression of collagen I and alpha-SMA (p < 0.05). Moreover, all the analyzed transcription factors-NF-kappa B, c-Myc, and STAT3-have shown its influence on the pathways connected with relaxin action. Though relaxin requires further study, our results suggest that this natural compound offers great potential for inhibition of the development, or even reversing, of factors related to airway remodeling. The presented contribution of the investigated transcription factors in this process additionally increases its potential possibilities through a variety of its activity pathways.

AB  - As energy metabolism regulation factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is thought to be a potential target for the treatment of depression. The present study was performed to evaluate the effects of activating PPAR beta/delta, the most highly expressed subtype in the brain, in depressive in vivo and in vitro models. We observed that PPAR beta/delta agonist GW0742 significantly alleviated depressive behaviors in mice and promoted the formation of autophagosomes around the damaged mitochondria in hippocampal astrocytes. Our in vitro experiments showed that GW0742 could reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress, and thereby attenuate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis pathway via inhibiting IRE1 alpha phosphorylation, subsequently protect against astrocytic apoptosis and loss. Furthermore, we found that PPAR beta/delta agonist induces astrocytic mitophagy companied with the upregulated UCP2 expressions. Knocking down UCP2 in astrocytes could block the anti-apoptosis and pro-mitophagy effects of GW0742. In conclusion, our findings reveal PPAR beta/delta activation protects against ER stress-induced astrocytic apoptosis via enhancing UCP2-mediated mitophagy, which contribute to the anti-depressive action. The present study provides a new insight for depression therapy.

AB  - In the present study, we used a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (3xTg-AD mice) to longitudinally analyse the expression level of PDIA3, a protein disulfide isomerase and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, in selected brain limbic areas strongly affected by AD-pathology (amygdala, entorhinal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus). Our results suggest that, while in Non-Tg mice PDIA3 levels gradually reduce with aging in all brain regions analyzed, 3xTg-AD mice showed an age-dependent increase in PDIA3 levels in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and ventral hippocampus. A significant reduction of PDIA3 was observed in 3xTg-AD mice already at 6 months of age, as compared to age-matched Non-Tg mice. A comparative immunohistochemistry analysis performed on 3xTg-AD mice at 6 (mild AD-like pathology) and 18 (severe AD-like pathology) months of age showed a direct correlation between the cellular level of A beta and PDIA3 proteins in all the brain regions analysed, even if with different magnitudes. Additionally, an immunohistochemistry analysis showed the presence of PDIA3 in all post-mitotic neurons and astrocytes. Overall, altered PDIA3 levels appear to be age- and/or pathology-dependent, corroborating the ER chaperone's involvement in AD pathology, and supporting the PDIA3 protein as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss and a decline in activities of daily life. Ventricular enlargement has been associated with worse performance on global cognitive tests and AD. Our previous studies demonstrated that brain sulfatides, myelin-enriched lipids, are dramatically reduced in subjects at the earliest clinically recognizable AD stages via an apolipoprotein E (APOE)-dependent and isoform-specific process. Herein, we provided pre-clinical evidence that sulfatide deficiency is causally associated with brain ventricular enlargement. Specifically, taking advantage of genetic mouse models of global and adult-onset sulfatide deficiency, we demonstrated that sulfatide losses cause ventricular enlargement without significantly affecting hippocampal or whole brain volumes using histological and magnetic resonance imaging approaches. Mild decreases in sulfatide content and mild increases in ventricular areas were also observed in human APOE4 compared to APOE2 knock-in mice. Finally, we provided Western blot and immunofluorescence evidence that aquaporin-4, the most prevalent aquaporin channel in the central nervous system (CNS) that provides fast water transportation and regulates cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles, is significantly increased under sulfatide-deficient conditions, while other major brain aquaporins (e.g., aquaporin-1) are not altered. In short, we unraveled a novel and causal association between sulfatide deficiency and ventricular enlargement. Finally, we propose putative mechanisms by which sulfatide deficiency may induce ventricular enlargement.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, but no drugs can cure this disease. Chalcones possess good antioxidant activity, anti-neuroinflammatory activity, neuroprotective effects, inhibitory effects on A beta aggregation, and A beta disaggregation ability. Therefore, chalcones are ideal lead compounds, and the discovery of novel anti-AD agent-based chalcones is necessary. Methods: Hydroxy groups and aryl benzyl ether groups were introduced into chalcone scaffolds to obtain a series of 2-hydroxyl-4-benzyloxy chalcone derivatives. These derivatives were further synthesized, biologically evaluated, and docked. Results: Most target derivatives exhibited good anti-AD activities. In particular, compound 11d had excellent inhibitory effects on self-induced A beta(1-42) aggregation (90.8% inhibition rate at 25 mu M) and Cu2+ induced A beta(1-42) aggregation (93.4% inhibition rate at 25 mu M). In addition, it also exhibited good A beta(1-42) fibril disaggregation ability (64.7% at 25 mu M), significant antioxidative activity (ORAC = 2.03 Trolox equivalent), moderate MAO-B inhibition (IC50 = 4.81 mu M), selective metal chelation, appropriate BBB permeation, and dramatic anti-neuroinflammatory ability. In addition, compound 11d relieved AD symptoms and protected hippocampal neurons in vivo. Conclusion: Compound 11d is a promising multifunctional anti-A beta agent.

AB  - The current study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of Paris polyphylla polysaccharide component 1 (PPPm-1) to improve learning and memory in D-galactose-induced aging model mice. We determined the effects of PPPm-1 on the brain, organ index, and behavior in the aging model mice induced by D-galactose to study learning and memory improvement. UV-Vis spectrophotometry helped determine the PPPm-1 effect on antioxidant parameters associated with learning and memory in the brain and related organs of aging mice. Moreover, in the hippocampi of aging model mice, PPPm-1 effect on the mRNA and protein expressions of p19, p53, p21, P16, Rb, Wnt/1, beta-catenin, CyclinD1, TCF-4, and GSK-3 beta were detected using the quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The results indicated that PPPm-1 could increase the brain and organ indexes, the avoidance latency, the total distance and average speed in the water maze, and the SOD and GSH-P-X activities in the brain, liver tissues, and plasma. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expressions of Wnt/1, beta-catenin, CyclinD1, and TCF-4 were also elevated in the hippocampi of aging model mice. However, the error times in step-through tests, the MDA content in the brain and liver tissues, the AChE activity in the brain tissue, the protein expressions of P16, Rb in the hippocampi, and the mRNA and protein expressions of p19, p53, p21, and GSK-3 beta in the hippocampi of aging model mice were significantly decreased. Thus, PPPm-1 significantly enhanced the learning and memory impairment induced by D-galactose in mice. The action mechanisms were associated with anti-oxidative stress, cholinergic nervous system function regulation, LTP enhancement in long-term memory, down-regulated expression of p19/p53/p21 signaling pathway factors, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway activation.

AB  - Aim: We aimed to explore the protective effects and mechanism of velvet antler polypeptides (VAP) against Dgalactose (D-gal)-induced aging model in vivo and in vitro. Methods: The mouse model of mild cognitive impairment was established by intraperitoneal injection of D-gal (400 mg/kg). After gavage of VAP (50 and 200 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, the water maze behavior test was performed. HIF - 1 alpha and BDNF expression levels in hippocampus were detected by immunofluorescence, neuron damage was detected by HE and Nissl staining, and inflammatory factors and oxidative stress were detected by Elisa. Protein expression was detected by western blot. The aging model of HT22 cells was established in vitro by D-gal (40 mg/L), the total enzymatic hydrolysis products were fractionated, and the best peptide (VAP-III) was screened out. The effects of VAP-III (200 and 600 mu g/mL) on D-gal induced apoptosis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation were detected. Then, Nano LC-MS/MS and molecular docking were used to predict the binding activity of VAP-III to BDNF, PI3K and Akt. Results: VAP can improve D-gal-induced neuronal damage and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory factors and oxidative stress-related products. VAP can promote the activation of BDNF/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Conclusion: VAP may play a neuroprotective role by regulating the BDNF/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases feature changes in cognition, and anxiety-like and autism-like behaviors, which are associated with epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. The amino acid L-serine has been shown to have beneficial effects on neurological symptoms. Here, we found that growth hormone-releasing hormone knockout (GHRH-KO) mice, a GH-deficiency mouse model characterized by extended lifespan and enhanced insulin sensitivity, showed a lower anxiety symptom and impairment of short-term object recognition memory and autism-like behaviors. Interestingly, L-serine administration exerted anxiolytic effects in mice and ameliorated the behavioral deficits in GHRH-KO. L-serine treatment upregulated histone epigenetic markers of H3K4me, H3K9ac, H3K14ac and H3K18ac in the hippocampus and H3K4me in the cerebral cortex in both GHRH-KO mice and wild type controls. L-serine-modulated epigenetic marker changes, in turn, were found to regulate mRNA expression of BDNF, grm3, foxp1, shank3, auts2 and marcksl1, which are involved in anxiety-, cognitive- and autism-like behaviors. Our study provides a novel insight into the beneficial effects of L-serine intervention on neuropsychological impairments.

AB  - BackgroundAlthough metastasis is the foremost cause of cancer-related death, a specialized mechanism that reprograms anchorage dependency of solid tumor cells into circulating tumor cells (CTCs) during metastatic dissemination remains a critical area of challenge.MethodsWe analyzed blood cell-specific transcripts and selected key Adherent-to-Suspension Transition (AST) factors that are competent to reprogram anchorage dependency of adherent cells into suspension cells in an inducible and reversible manner. The mechanisms of AST were evaluated by a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. Paired samples of primary tumors, CTCs, and metastatic tumors were collected from breast cancer and melanoma mouse xenograft models and patients with de novo metastasis. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and tissue staining were performed to validate the role of AST factors in CTCs. Loss-of-function experiments were performed by shRNA knockdown, gene editing, and pharmacological inhibition to block metastasis and prolong survival.ResultsWe discovered a biological phenomenon referred to as AST that reprograms adherent cells into suspension cells via defined hematopoietic transcriptional regulators, which are hijacked by solid tumor cells to disseminate into CTCs. Induction of AST in adherent cells 1) suppress global integrin/ECM gene expression via Hippo-YAP/TEAD inhibition to evoke spontaneous cell-matrix dissociation and 2) upregulate globin genes that prevent oxidative stress to acquire anoikis resistance, in the absence of lineage differentiation. During dissemination, we uncover the critical roles of AST factors in CTCs derived from patients with de novo metastasis and mouse models. Pharmacological blockade of AST factors via thalidomide derivatives in breast cancer and melanoma cells abrogated CTC formation and suppressed lung metastases without affecting the primary tumor growth.ConclusionWe demonstrate that suspension cells can directly arise from adherent cells by the addition of defined hematopoietic factors that confer metastatic traits. Furthermore, our findings expand the prevailing cancer treatment paradigm toward direct intervention within the metastatic spread of cancer.

AB  - Background: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), regulated by AMPK, is an important regulator of mitochondrial fusion. At present, whether the AMPK/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway regulates mitochondrial dynamics in epileptic rats is still unknown. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into fourgroups: the control group (0.9% saline, n = 5), the EP groups (lithium-pilocarpine was used to induce epilepsy, and tissues were harvested at 6 and 24 h, every time point, n = 5), the EP + Compound C group (the specific inhibitor of PGC-1 alpha, 15 mg/kg in 2% DMSO, n = 5), and the EP + DMSO group (0.9% saline + 2% DMSO, n = 5). To investigate whether PGC-1 alpha participates in seizures by regulating the expression of mitofusin1/2(MFN1/2)in rats. Results: In this study, the behavioral results indicate that the seizure susceptibility of the rats to epilepsy was increased when the expression of PGC-1 alpha was inhibited. Subsequently, Western blot results suggested that the expression level of both MFN1 and MFN2 in the hippocampus was higher at 6 and 24 h after an epileptic seizure. Besides, the expression of PGC-1 alpha and MFN2 was significantly decreased in the hippocampus when the epileptic rats were treated with Compound C. Furthermore, the immunofluorescence analysis of the localization of MFN1/2 and PGC-1 alpha showed that MFN1/2 was mainly expressed in neurons but not astrocytes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats. Meanwhile, PGC-1 alpha colocalized with the excitatory post-synaptic marker PSD95, suggesting that PGC-1 alpha may regulate the seizure susceptibility of the rats by mediating excitatory post-synaptic signaling. Conclusion: The AMPK/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway may play an important role in the lithium-pilocarpine-induced epileptic rat model by mediating the expression of fusion proteins.

AB  - Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) is a potent neurotoxic substance known to cause memory impairment and oxidative stress-dependent neurodegeneration. Naringenin (NAR) is a dietary flavonoid with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which was implemented against AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity to ascertain its neuroprotective efficacy. Experimental neurotoxicity in mice was induced by exposure of AlCl3 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) followed by treatment with NAR (10 mg/kg, p.o.) for a total of 63 days. Assessed the morphometric, learning memory dysfunction (novel object recognition, T- and Y-maze tests), neuronal oxidative stress, and histopathological alteration in different regions of the brain, mainly cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. AlCl3 significantly suppressed the spatial learning and memory power which were notably improved by administration of NAR. The levels of oxidative stress parameters nitric oxide, advanced oxidation of protein products, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione, and the activity of acetylcholine esterase were altered 1.5-3 folds by AlCl3 significantly. Treatment of NAR remarkably restored the level of oxidative stress parameters and maintained the antioxidant defense system. AlCl3 suppressed the expression of neuronal proliferation marker NeuN that was restored by NAR treatment which may be a plausible mechanism. NAR showed therapeutic efficacy as a natural supplement against aluminum-intoxicated memory impairments and histopathological alteration through a mechanism involving an antioxidant defense system and neuronal proliferation.
   Representing the summary of aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced neurotoxicity and prevention by naringenin (NAR). Oral administration of AlCl3 caused spatial memory impairment, neuronal oxidative stress, and histopathological alteration in the different regions of mice brains. NAR administration exerted a preventive effect by reversing the impacts of AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity and improving the antioxidant defense system. image

AB  - Ethanol-induced neurodegeneration refers to the progressive loss of structure and function of neurons caused by chronic ethanol consumption. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 2.3 billion people globally consume alcohol. This contributes to a significant amount of alcohol-related brain damage. This study evaluated the effect of chrysophanol in ethanol-induced neurodegeneration. Mice were administered 10 mg/kg i.p. chrysophanol, 30 min after a 2 g/kg i.p. injection of ethanol, for 11 days. Y-maze, Morris water maze (MWM), and novel object recognition (NOR) test were carried out to analyze learning and memory impairment. Analysis of antioxidant levels, histopathological examinations, measurement of COX-2 & NLRP3 using ELISA, and gene expression analysis of TLR4, NF kappa B, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, Caspase-3, and Nrf-2, HO-1, and in hippocampus and cortex using RT-PCR, as well as DNA damage by comet assay, were carried out. Chrysophanol has shown a remarkable impact in reversing cognitive decline and spatial memory. It effectively boosted antioxidant levels such as GSH, GST, and CAT, while simultaneously reducing the levels of MDA and NO. The histopathological analysis also showed improvement in overall morphology and survival of neurons. Chrysophanol treatment effectively showed an increase in the expression of HO-1 and Nrf-2, with a decrease in TLR4, NF kappa B, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and Caspase-3 expression confirmed through RT-PCR. Production of inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic gene expression was successfully reversed after chrysophanol treatment. COX-2 & NLRP3 levels decreased, and an improvement in DNA damage was observed after chrysophanol treatment. In conclusion, chrysophanol demonstrated remarkable neuroprotective activity against ethanol-induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - Low-grade systemic inflammation contributes to ageing-related cognitive decline, possibly by triggering a neuroinflammatory response through glial activation. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) at 7T in normal human individuals from 18 to 79 years in a cross-sectional study, we previously observed higher regional levels of myo-inositol (mins), total creatine (tCr) and total choline (tCho) in older than younger age groups. Moreover, visuo-spatial working memory (vsWM) correlated negatively with tCr and tCho in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and mins in hippocampus and thalamus. As mins, tCr and tCho are higher in glia than neurons, this suggest a potential in vivo connection between cognitive ageing and higher regional levels of glia-related metabolites. In the present study, we tested whether these metabolic differences may be related to low-grade systemic inflammation. In the same individuals, plasma concentrations of the proinflammatory markers Creactive protein (CRP), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured on the same day as H-1-MRS assessments. We tested whether CRP, IL-8, and TNF-alpha concentrations correlated with the levels of glia-related metabolites. CRP and IL-8, but not TNF-alpha, were higher in older (69-79 years) than younger (18-26 years) individuals. CRP correlated positively with thalamic mins and negatively with vsWM. IL-8 correlated positively with ACC tCho and hippocampal mins, but not with vsWM. Mediation analysis revealed an indirect effect of IL-8 on vsWM via ACC tCho. Together, these findings corroborate the role of glial cells, perhaps via their role in neuroinflammation, as part of the neurobiological link between systemic inflammation and cognitive ageing.

AB  - The current observation was designed to give a complete ultrastructural description of the pecten oculi of the common ostrich (Struthio camelus). Moreover, this study represents the first attempt to measurements the elements composition of the pecten oculi using scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) at three regions (apical, body, and basal). To accomplish this study, eight ostrich were examined grossly and under the electron microscope. The vaned-shaped pecten oculi consisted of three regions (apex, body, and base) with 24-25 plates. The pecten oculi was located postero-anteriorly near to the optic nerve disc that was attached by their bases to the retina forming a slightly elevated basal border joining the bases of all pleats, while the apex was linked in a circular bridge. The pleats are separated from each other by the inter-pleat spaces that are very clear at the base and nearly not observed at the apical part. The outer pleat's surface carried numerous prominences that pointed to the existence of numerous afferent and efferent pecteneal blood capillaries vessels. The vitreopecteneal limiting membrane separated the pecten oculi from the vitreous body. Our findings concluded that, the high number of thick pecteneal pleats was related to the diurnal activity of the common ostrich. SEM-EDX shows that the carbon percentage in the three regions is the highest that representing about half of all elements, while the oxygen percent is about one-third; meanwhile, the lowest percentage is the sulfate at the apical region, and the calcium at the body and basal regions.

AB  - Ebola fever is an acute, highly contagious viral disease with a mortality rate that can reach 90%. There are currently no licensed therapeutic agents specific to Ebola in the world. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with viral-neutralizing activity and high specificity to the Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV GP) are considered as highly effective potential antiviral drugs. Over the past decade, nanobodies (single-domain antibodies, non-canonical camelid antibodies) have found wide use in the diagnosis and treatment of various infectious and non-infectious diseases. In this study, a panel of nanobodies specifically binding to EBOV GP was obtained using recombinant human adenovirus 5, expressing GP (Ad5-GP) for alpaca (Vicugna pacos) immunization, for the first time. Based on specific activity assay results, affinity constants, and the virus -neutralizing activity against the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with EBOV GP (rVSV-GP), the most promising clone (aEv6) was selected. The aEv6 clone was then modified with the human IgG1 Fc fragment to improve its pharmacokinetic and immunologic properties. To assess the protective activity of the chimeric molecule aEv6-Fc, a lethal model of murine rVSV-GP infection was developed by using immunosuppression.

AB  - Thermoelectric materials have drawn significant attention due to their potential for energy harvesting and waste heat utilization. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have become promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to their unique electronic and thermal properties. The camelback-shaped band structures of 2D topological insulators (TIs), coupled with the low-frequency lattice vibrations of heavy elements, synergistically enhance the Seebeck coefficient while suppressing the lattice thermal conductivity. These combined effects make 2D TIs highly promising candidates for thermoelectric applications. Herein, we studied the electronic and thermal properties of 2D topological insulator MBiH (M = Ga, In) based on first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory. The result demonstrates that the extremely low lattice thermal conductivities of 0.080 W/mK for GaBiH and 0.101 W/mK for InBiH at 700 K can be attributed to strong phonon anharmonicity and short relaxation times. Consequently, the maximum thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) for GaBiH and InBiH reaches 3.95 and 2.87, respectively, significantly surpassing those of 2D nontopological insulator materials containing heavy elements. These findings indicate that MBiH (M = Ga, In) monolayers are promising candidates for thermoelectric applications.

AB  - We previously reported that abnormal emotionality in stress-maladaptive mice was ameliorated by chronic treatment with flesinoxan, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Furthermore, the maintenance of hippocampal myelination appeared to contribute to the development of stress adaptation in mice. However, the effects of 5-HT1A receptor activation on myelination under the stress-maladaptive situations and the underlying mechanisms remain un-known. In the present study, we examined using flesinoxan whether activation of 5-HT1A receptor can reduce an abnormal emotional response by acting on oligodendrocytes to preserve myelin proteins in stress-maladaptive mice. Mice were exposed to repeated restraint stress for 4 h/day for 14 days as a stress-maladaptive model. Flesinoxan was given intraperitoneally immediately after the daily exposure to restraint stress. After the final exposure to restraint stress, the emotionality of mice was evaluated by the hole-board test. The expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), phosphorylated-cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), myelin basic protein (MBP) and oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (olig2) in the hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal oligodendrogenesis were examined by immunohistochemistry. Chronic treatment with flesinoxan suppressed the decrease in head-dipping behaviors in stress-maladaptive mice in the hole-board test. Under this condition, the decreases in MAG and MBP in the hippocampus recovered with in-crease in BDNF, p-ERK, p-CREB, and olig2. Furthermore, hippocampal oligodendrogenesis in stress-maladaptive mice was promoted by chronic treatment with flesinoxan. These findings suggest that 5-HT1A receptor activation may promote oligodendrogenesis and myelination via an ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway in the hippo-campus and reduces abnormal emotionality due to maladaptation to excessive stress.

AB  - The poor water resistance of protein adhesives seriously restricted their practical applications. Though many crosslinking agents, i.e. phenol formaldehyde, epoxy resins etc., can enhance the wet adhesion, high-proportion use of synthetic additives reduce intrinsic sustainability of protein formulations, and thus green yet robust protein adhesives are still highly expected. Herein, tannic acid (TA), a woody bio-extract abundant in catecholic hydroxyls, was used to improve the wet adhesion of soy protein (SP) adhesive. For further improved water resistance, the supramolecular architecture of SP-TA was tuned by different stabilizers, including zinc oxide nanoparticle (ZnO), ferric chloride (FeCl3) and glutaraldehyde (GH), aiming to enhance the intermolecular hydrogen bonding (H-bond), coordination or covalent bonding respectively. Results indicate that the ZnOinduced H-bond could simultaneously strengthen SP-TA interaction while retain the catechol reactivity of TA to the substrate, thus demonstrating the best water resistance. The optimized dry and wet adhesion strength reached 2.02 and 1.40 MPa respectively, which even exceeded the values of commercially available adhesives. Advantageously, these findings provide a rational perspective to modulate the adhesion/cohesion balance of protein-TA complex and pave the way toward facile processing of high-performance soy adhesive.

AB  - Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most abundant neurotrophic factors, and its deficits are involved in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorders (MDD). Loureirin C (Lou C) is a compound derived from red resin extracted from the stems of Chinese dragon's blood. Xanthoceraside (Xan) is a triterpenoid saponin extracted from the husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge. These compounds have neuroprotective effects through upregulation of BDNF. The present study aimed to evaluate whether Lou C and Xan attenuate abnormal behaviors induced by chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration. CORT was administered subcutaneously to mice for 3 weeks, and Lou C and Xan, dispensed orally once a day during the last 2 weeks of CORT administration. Chronic CORT administration induced abnormal behaviors such as prolonged starting latency in the open field test, decreased social interaction time in the social interaction test and prolonged latency to eat in the novelty suppressed feeding test. Chronic CORT administration decreased the expression levels of BDNF and the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the prefrontal cortex. Lou C and Xan dose-dependently prevented the abnormal behaviors and decreased the expression levels of BDNF and in phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and CREB in the prefrontal cortex of CORT mice. These results suggest that Lou C and Xan could be attractive candidates for pharmacotherapy of MDD at least in part, given their propensity to increase BDNF expression and phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and CREB.

AB  - The ubiquitin-like interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a unique molecular effector that functions both intra- and extracellularly. Central to its pleiotropic nature is the ability to coordinate cellular responses following its conjugation to target proteins via ISGylation or in its free form. The activity of ISG15 is highly context-dependent: in the case of viral infections, ISG15 can serve as a pro- or antiviral factor. While ISG15 has been studied extensively, several gaps persist in our understanding of its role in dysregulated immune homeostasis. In particular, the role of ISG15 in the central nervous system (CNS), which has traditionally been considered an immune-privileged site, remains ill-defined. Interestingly, elevated ISG15 expression is observed in the CNS following instances of brain injury, autoimmunity, neurodegeneration, and viral infection. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive analysis of these studies as they pertain to ISG15 and its potential roles in the CNS. Furthermore, we discuss questions and challenges in the field while highlighting ISG15 as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target.Impact statement While ISG15 has been studied extensively, several gaps remain in our understanding of its role in dysregulated immune homeostasis and its impact within the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the emerging roles of ISG15 in brain injury, autoimmunity, neurodegeneration, and viral infection within the CNS.

AB  - Post -translational modification and fine-tuned protein turnover are of great importance in mammalian early embryo development. Apart from the classic protein degradation promoting ubiquitination, new forms of ubiquitination-like modification are yet to be fully understood. Here, we demonstrate the function and potential mechanisms of one ubiquitination-like modification, neddylation, in mouse preimplantation embryo development. Treated with specific inhibitors, zygotes showed a dramatically decreased cleavage rate and almost all failed to enter the 4 -cell stage. Transcriptional profiling showed genes were differentially expressed in pathways involving cell fate determination and cell differentiation, including several down -regulated zygotic genome activation (ZGA) marker genes. A decreased level of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II was detected, indicating impaired gene transcription inside the embryo cell nucleus. Proteomic data showed that differentially expressed proteins were enriched in histone modifications. We confirmed the lowered in methyltransferase (KMT2D) expression and a decrease in histone H3K4me3. At the same time, acetyltransferase (CBP/p300) reduced, while deacetylase (HDAC6) increased, resulting in an attenuation in histone H3K27ac. Additionally, we observed the up -regulation in YAP1 and RPL13 activities, indicating potential abnormalities in the downstream response of Hippo signaling pathway. In summary, we found that inhibition of neddylation induced epigenetic changes in early embryos and led to abnormalities in related downstream signaling pathways. This study sheds light upon new forms of ubiquitination regulating mammalian embryonic development and may contribute to further investigation of female infertility pathology.

AB  - Cytokines, particularly IL-6, play a crucial role in modulating immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS). Elevated IL-6 levels have been observed in neuroinflammatory conditions, as well as in the sera and brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Multiple Sclerosis, and Alzheimer's. Additionally, alterations in regional brain pH have been noted in these conditions. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), including ASIC1a, activated by low pH levels, are highly abundant in the CNS and have recently been associated with various neurological disorders. Our study examined the impact of IL-6 on ASIC1a channels in cell cultures, demonstrating IL-6-induced the redistribution of cytosolic ASIC1a channels to the cell membrane. This redistribution was accompanied by increased ASIC1a current amplitude upon activation, as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated CaMKII and ERK kinases. Additionally, we observed posttranslational modifications on the ASIC1a channel itself. These findings provide insight into a potential link between inflammatory processes and neurodegenerative mechanisms, highlighting ASIC1a channels as promising therapeutic targets in these conditions.

AB  - Autophagy and Hippo signalling pathways both play important roles in cell homeostasis and are often involved in tumourigenesis. However, the crosstalk between these two signal pathways in response to stress conditions, such as nutrient deficiency, is incompletely understood. Here, we show that vesicular localised coiled-coil domain containing 115 (CCDC115) inhibits autophagy as well as Hippo signalling pathway under starvation. Moreover, we show that CCDC115 interacts with the HOPS complex. This interaction competes with STX17, thus inhibiting the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Hence, CCDC115 inhibits the autophagic degradation of yes-associated protein (YAP), thereby promoting cell proliferation in nutrient-restricted situation.

AB  - This study explores the therapeutic benefits of tannic acid (TnA) in an experimental protocol of chronic hypermethioninemia in rats. Rats were categorized into four groups: Group I - control, Group II - TnA 30 mg/kg, Group III - methionine (Met) 0.2-0.4 g/kg + methionine sulfoxide (MS) 0.05-0.1 g/kg, Group IV - TnA/Met + MS. Saline was administered by subcutaneous pathway into groups I and II twice daily from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P28, whereas those in groups III and IV received Met + MS. From P28 to P35, groups II and IV received TnA orally. Animals from group III presented cognitive and memory impairment assessed through object recognition and Y-maze tests (p < 0.05). Elevated levels of reactive species, lipid peroxidation, and nitrites followed by a decline in sulfhydryl content, catalase activity, and superoxide dismutase activity were observed in animals treated with Met + MS (p < 0.05). However, TnA treatment reversed all these effects (p < 0.05). In group III, there was an increase in acetylcholinesterase activity and IL-6 levels, coupled with a reduction in Na+/K+ATPase activity (p < 0.05). TnA was able to protect against these effects (p < 0.05). The gene expression of catalase, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 was decreased in the hippocampus and striatum from group III (p < 0.05). TnA reversed almost all of these alterations (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that TnA is a therapeutic target for patients with hypermethioninemia.

AB  - Oxytocin is a neuropeptide hormone that plays an important role in social bonding and behavior. Recent studies indicate that oxytocin could be involved in the regulation of neurological disorders. However, its role in modulating cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has never been explored. Hence, the present study aims to investigate the potential of chronic intranasal oxytocin in halting memory impairment & AD pathology in aluminum chloride-induced AD in female rats. Morris water maze was used to assess cognitive dysfunction in two-time points throughout the treatment period. In addition, neuroprotective effects of oxytocin were examined by assessing hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity, beta-amyloid 1-42 protein, and Tau levels. In addition, ERK1/2, GSK3 beta, and caspase-3 levels were assessed as chief neurobiochemical mediators in AD. Hippocampi histopathological changes were also evaluated. These findings were compared to the standard drug galantamine alone and combined with oxytocin. Results showed that oxytocin restored cognitive functions and improved animals' behavior in the Morris test. This was accompanied by a significant decline in acetylcholinesterase activity, 1-42 beta-amyloid and Tau proteins levels. Hippocampal ERK1/2 and GSK3 beta were also reduced, exceeding galantamine effects, thus attenuating AD pathological hallmarks formation. Determination of caspase-3 revealed low cytoplasmic positivity, indicating the ceasing of neuronal death. Histopathological examination confirmed these findings, showing restored hippocampal cells structure. Combined galantamine and oxytocin treatment showed even better biochemical and histopathological profiles. It can be thus concluded that oxytocin possesses promising neuroprotective potential in AD mediated via restoring cognition and suppressing beta-amyloid, Tau accumulation, and neuronal death.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the probable protective effects of gallic acid (GA) on cognitive deficits, hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) impairments, and molecular changes induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in rats following exposure to ambient dust storm. After pretreatment with GA (100 mg/kg), or vehicle (Veh) (normal saline, 2 ml/kg) for ten days, and 60 minutes' exposure to dust storm including PM (PM, 2000-8000 g/m3) every day, 4-vessel occlusion (4VO) type of I/R was induced. Three days after I/R induction, we evaluated behavioral, electrophysiological, histopathological, molecular and brain tissue inflammatory cytokine changes. Our findings indicated that pretreatment with GA significantly reduced cognitive impairments caused by I/R (P < 0.05) and hippocampal LTP impairments caused by I/R after PM exposure (P < 0.001). Additionally, after exposure to PM, I/R significantly elevated the tumor necrosis factor alpha content (P < 0.01) and miR-124 level (P < 0.001) while pre-treatment with GA reduced the level of miR-124 (P < 0.001). Histopathological results also revealed that I/R and PM caused cell death in the hippocampus CA1 area (P < 0.001) and that GA decreased the rate of cell death (P < 0.001). Our findings show that GA can prevent brain inflammation, and thus cognitive and LTP deficits caused by I/R, PM exposure, or both.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of DUSP1 on the hippocampal injury of young rats with epilepsy (EP) through mediating ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Methods: Young SD rats were selected and divided into Control, EP, EP + LV-GFP, EP + LV-DUSP1, EP + LVsiDUSP1, and EP + LV-siDUSP1 + U0126 groups. Morris Water Maze Test was used to detect the spatial learning and memory. Nissl staining and TUNEL staining were conducted and the inflammatory factors and oxidative stress-related indicators were also measured. Western blotting was utilized to detect the expression of DUSP1 and ERK1/2 pathway. EP cell model was constructed in vitro to verify the in vivo results. Results: Compared with Control group, young rats in EP group had decreased spatial learning and memory abilities and increased apoptotic rate and decreased number of Nissl positive cells. Besides, the up-regulated levels in inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, IL-6), MDA content, and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 protein expression, as well as the down-regulated levels in DUSP1 protein expression and SOD content were also observed in EP rats. The EP rats treated with LV-DUSP1 showed obvious improvements regarding the above indicators, while those treated with LV-siDUSP1 had aggravated injury. But the effect of LV-siDUSP1 can be reversed by the treatment with ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor U0126. Further in vitro investigation verified the in vivo results. Conclusion: DUSP1 may ameliorate the oxidative stress and inflammatory injury, as well as improve spatial learning and memory abilities via inhibiting ERK1/2 pathway, eventually playing protective roles in hippocampal injury of young rats with EP.

AB  - Early embryos are vulnerable to environmental insults, such as medications taken by the mother. Due to increasing prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, more women of childbearing potential are taking cholesterol-lowering medications called statins. Previously, we showed that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by statins impaired mouse preimplantation development, by modulating HIPPO signaling, a key regulator for trophectoderm (TE) lineage specification. Here, we further evaluated molecular events that are altered by mevalonate pathway inhibition during the timeframe of morphogenesis and cell lineage specification. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed that statin treatment dysregulated gene expression underlying multiple processes, including cholesterol biosynthesis, HIPPO signaling, cell lineage specification and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. We explored mechanisms that link the mevalonate pathway to ER stress, because of its potential impact on embryonic health and development. Upregulation of ER stress-responsive genes was inhibited when statin-treated embryos were supplemented with the mevalonate pathway product, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Inhibition of geranylgeranylation was sufficient to upregulate ER stress-responsive genes. However, ER stress-responsive genes were not upregulated by inhibition of ras homolog family member A (RHOA), a geranylgeranylation target, although it interfered with TE specification and blastocyst cavity formation. In contrast, inhibition of Rac family small GTPase I (RACI), another geranylgeranylation target, upregulated ER stress-responsive genes, while it did not impair TE specification or cavity formation. Thus, our study suggests that the mevalonate pathway regulates cellular homeostasis (ER stress repression) and differentiation (TE lineage specification) in preimplantation embryos through GGPP-dependent activation of two distinct small GTPases, RACI and RHOA, respectively. Translation of the findings to human embryos and clinical settings requires further investigations.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are identified to contribute to the mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Scopolamine (SCO) as a potent drug for inducing memory and learning impairment is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. In AD clinical trials molecules with antioxidant properties have shown modest benefit. Betanin as a multifunctional molecule with powerful antioxidative properties may be effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative. Hence, this study was designed to investigate the possible therapeutic effect of betanin against SCO-induced AD on Wistar rats. SCO (1 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally to induce the AD in Wistar rats. The rats were treated with betanin doses (25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 9 consecutive days. At the end of the 9th day, the animals were subjected to behavioral examination such as novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests and killed to study the mitochondrial and histological parameters. The results showed attenuation of SCO-induced memory and learning impairment by betanin at 50 mg/kg dose. Also, mitochondrial toxicity parameters such as mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, mitochondrial swelling, decreased activity of succinate dehydrogenase, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were reversed by betanin (50 mg/kg) compared to the SCO group. In addition, the ameliorative effect of betanin against SCO was demonstrated in histopathological results of hippocampus. The present investigation established that the betanin ameliorates the SCO-induced memory impairments, tissue injuries, and mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing mitochondrial ROS, which may be due to the potent antioxidant action of betanin.

Clinical studies have confirmed significant depletion of GSH in the hippocampus and the substantia nigra as an early diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD), respectively. External agents like anesthetics (inhaled and intravenous) have a different impact on GSH. There is significant depletion of the serum GSH peroxidase level after surgery with isoflurane anesthesia that is not found in patients administered intravenous propofol. The objective of this study is to evaluate the GSH level associated with isoflurane in vitro phantom model using non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and to detect residual isoflurane in a solution. MRS data was generated utilizing a 3T MR scanner (Prisma, Siemens) equipped with a 64-channel H-1 head coil and dual tune (F-19/H-1) head coil. The GSH data acquisition was performed using the MEGA-PRESS pulse sequence using experimental parameters: ON = 4.40 ppm, OFF = 5.00 ppm, TE = 120 ms, TR = 2500 ms, voxel size = 25 x 25 x 25 mm and average = 32. Isoflurane was detected using F-19 MRS studies using F-19/H-1 head coil. GSH data was processed using KALPANA package and F-19 data was processed using Siemens package. The GSH peak area (without isoflurane) in a phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) solution (control) showed a slow decline over time due to natural oxidation of GSH to dimeric glutathione (GSSG). On the contrary, the GSH peak area in similar model is reduced significantly (p = 0.016) due to isoflurane induced oxidation of GSH to GSSG compared to control. We also report a concise general method for data generation and processing of H-1 MRS data for GSH as well as F-19 monitoring platform using F-19 MR spectroscopy. This is the first report wherein both H-1 and F-19 spectroscopy are applied to generate MRS data along with a unique data processing method. This method is highly sensitive and specifically detects GSH without ambiguity as well as isoflurane due to the unique chemical shift patterns of CF3 and CHF2 moieties. This non-invasive MRS approach is developed to monitor GSH-isoflurane interaction leading to oxidative stress and this approach can be extended for other inhaled anesthetics. This methodology using non-invasive F-19 MR spectroscopy needs further development for future clinical studies.

AB  - Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is expressed throughout the brain, including the hippocampus, where it plays a potential role in synaptic regulation and forming emotional and spatial memories. PRDX6 is predominantly detected in the female mouse's hippocampus; thus, we investigate the effect of the Prdx6 gene on behavioral phenotypes and synaptic functions using female Prdx6 knockout (Prdx6(-/-)) mice. Our results demonstrate that female Prdx6(-/-) mice exhibited anxiety-like behavior, enhanced contextual fear memory, and impaired spatial memory. We also found increased, paired-pulse facilitation ratios, and decreased long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal region of these female Prdx6(-/-) mice. The present study helps to understand better the PRDX6's role in emotional response and spatial memory formation in female mice.

AB  - Background: The precise mechanisms whereby apelin-13 acts against ischemic stroke have remained in the dark. Hence, this study aims to examine the effects of apelin-13 on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis over activation, Jak2-STAT3 signaling pathway, and inflammation following ischemic stroke.Methods: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to induce the cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury (I/RI). Thirty-five male Wistar rats (250-300 g, 8 weeks old) were randomly divided into sham, MCAO, and intravenous (IV) apelin-13 treated groups which received 10, 20, and 40 mu g/kg 5 min before reperfusion (n = 7). Neurological status (modified Longa scoring scale), infarct volume, serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), interleukin 6 (IL-6), corticosterone, and the expressions of the Jak2/STAT3 were assessed.Results: Our results confirm that IV administration of all three doses of apelin-13 significantly improved neurological defects and reduced infarct volume following cerebral I/RI. Furthermore, we observed that acute stroke caused a rise in the expression of the Jak2/STAT3, IL-6, corticosterone, and MDA content, while apelin-13 could reduce the expression of the Jak2/STAT3 and the serum indices in a dose-dependent manner. The 40 mu g/kg dose of apelin-13 was also more effective in reducing the infarct volume and improving TAC.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that apelin-13 has protective effects against cerebral I/RI-related inflammation and also could attenuate the HPA axis over activation.

AB  - Depression is a common, severe, and debilitating psychiatric disorder of unclear etiology. Our previous study has shown that protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent 1F (PPM1F) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) displays significant regulatory effects in depression-related behaviors. miR-132-3p plays a potential role in the etiology of depression. This study explored the effect of miR-132-3p on the onset of depression and the possible underlying mechanism for modulating PPM1F expression during the pathology of depression. We found that miR-132-3p levels in the hippocampus of depressed mice subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) were dramatically reduced, which were correlated with depression-related behaviors. Knockdown of miR-132-3p in hippocampal DG resulted in depression-related phenotypes and increased susceptibility to stress. miR-132-3p overexpression in hippocampal DG alleviated CUS-induced depression-related performance. We then screened out the potential target genes of miR-132-3p, and we found that the expression profiles of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1) and forkhead box protein O3a (FOXO3a) were positively correlated with PPM1F under the condition of miR-132-3p knockdown. Finally, as anticipated, we revealed that the activities of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were reduced, which underlies the target signaling pathway of PPM1F. In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-132-3p was designed to regulate depression-related behaviors by indirectly regulating PPM1F and targeting Srebf1 and FOXO3a, which have been linked to the pathogenesis and treatment of depression.

AB  - Subtle memory and cognitive changes may occur in uninephrectomized (Unix) patients long before the development of chronic kidney disease, such changes may be unnoticed. The dietary polyphenol, Resveratrol, displayed various neuroprotective effects, its role in chronic kidney disease is an area of intense studies. This work was designed to investigate the behavioural and molecular changes that may occur following 7 months of Unix in rats, and to determine whether Resveratrol intake can improve such pathology. Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: sham operated, Unix and Unix group treated with Resveratrol (20 mg/kg/day). Rats were subjected to series of behavioural testing, different biochemical parameters along with RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry of the hippocampal tissue to track the development of functional or structural brain changes. Anxiety behaviour and reduced spatial memory performance were observed in rats 7 months post-nephrectomy; these deficits were remarkably reversed with Resveratrol. Among the species typical behaviour, burrowing was assessed; it showed significant impairment post-nephrectomy. Resveratrol intake was almost able to increase the burrowing behaviour. Decreased SIRT1 in immune-stained sections, oxidative stress, inflammatory changes, and increased AChE activity in hippocampal homogenates were found in Unix rats, and Resveratrol once more was capable to reverse such pathological changes. This work has investigated the occurrence of behavioural and structural brain changes 7 months following Unix and underlined the importance of Resveratrol to counterbalance the behavioural impairment, biochemical and brain pathological changes after uninephrectomy. These findings may raise the possible protective effects of Resveratrol intake in decreased kidney function.

AB  - Monoterpene alpha-pinene possesses antioxidant, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties. We evaluated the effect of alpha-pinene on oxidative/nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and molecular and behavioral changes induced by beta-amyloid (A beta)(1-42) in rats and investigated the possible mechanisms of these outcomes. Male Wistar rats received alpha-pinene (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) for 14 consecutive days after intrahippocampal injection of A beta(1-42). Alpha-pinene decreased malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels, increased glutathione content, and enhanced catalase activity in A beta-injected rats. Also, messenger RNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, nuclear factor kappa B, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits 2A and 2B reduced in the hippocampus of these animals. Besides this, alpha-pinene repressed the A beta(1-42)-induced reduction of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 7 subunit and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Treatment with alpha-pinene caused A beta-receiving rats to spend more time in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze test and led to an increase in percentages of open arm entrance and time spent in the open arm in the elevated plus-maze test. We concluded that alpha-pinene strengthens the antioxidant system and prevents neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of rats receiving A beta. It improves spatial learning and memory and reduces anxiety-like behavior in these animals. Consequently, alpha-pinene alleviates A beta-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and behavioral deficits. It is probably a suitable candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sensitive to perturbations in thyroid hormone signaling, with evidence supporting a key role for thyroid hormone and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in the regulation of postmitotic progenitor survival and neuronal differentiation. In this book chapter we summarize the current understanding of the effects of thyroid hormone signaling on adult hippocampal progenitor development, and also critically address the role of TRs in regulation of distinct aspects of stage-specific hippocampal progenitor progression. We highlight actions of thyroid hormone on thyroid hormone responsive target genes, and the implications for hippocampal progenitor regulation. Given the influence of thyroid hormone on both mitochondrial and lipid metabolism, we discuss a putative role for regulation of metabolism in the effects of thyroid hormone on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, we highlight specific ideas that require detailed experimental investigation, and the need for future studies to obtain a deeper mechanistic insight into the influence of thyroid hormone and TRs in the developmental progression of adult hippocampal progenitors.

AB  - In elderly individuals, aging can cause changes in the structure and function of one or more organs, increasing their susceptibility to various damage factors, especially the heart, kidney, brain and other important organs. Therefore, the incidence of cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic kidney disease in the elderly population is significantly higher than that in the general population. In our previous study, the hearts of aged mice did not express the antiaging protein Klotho (KL), but peripheral elevation of KL may significantly delay cardiac aging. The kidney and brain are the main organs that produce KL, but the effects and mechanism of peripheral KL supplementation on the kidney and hippocampus are still unclear. To study the effect and possible mechanism of KL against kidney and hippocampus aging, 60 male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the Adult group, the KL group, the D-gal-induced Aged group, and the KL + Aged group. The results showed that KL increased anti-inflammatory M2a/M2c macrophages in the kidney and hippocampus of aging mice, significantly reduced tissue inflammation and oxidative stress, and improved organ function and aging status. More impor-tantly, we demonstrate that despite the impermeable blood-brain barrier in mice, peripherally administered KL surprisingly enhances M2-type microglia polarization, induces cognitive enhancement and reduces neuro-inflammation. Cellular experimental results suggest that KL may play a role in delaying senescence by regulating the TLR4/Myd88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway to regulate macrophage polarization and reduce aging-related inflammation and oxidative stress.

AB  - Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders and it is generally characterized by negative mood. Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for depression, however, it can cause cognitive deficit. Hesperetin, an active ingredient in citrus peels, has antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we evaluated the effect of hesperetin on memory impairment induced by ECT in a reserpineinduced depression model in male rat. For this purpose, 105 male rats weighing 230-250 g were randomly divided into control and reserpine-treated groups. The reserpine-treated animals were subdivided into: Reserpine, Hesperetin (10 and 20 mg/kg), ECT and ECT+Hesperetin (10 and 20 mg/kg). After taking the drugs, the effect of hesperetin was evaluated through behavioral NORT, Y Maze, FST, SPT and also via assessment of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and oxidative stress biomarkers i.e., MDA, SOD and GSH. As a result, our biochemical studies showed a significant decrease of MDA in groups treated with ECT+Hesperetin as compared to ECT and hesperetin groups (P < 0.001) and a marked increase in SOD, GSH and BDNF in ECT+Hesperetin 20 group as compared to other groups (p < 0.05). Also, the results of behavioral tests revealed that treatment with hesperetin can increase the novel object recognition index and alternation behaviors in Y maze test as compared to the groups treated with hesperetin or ECT (p < 0.05). These results suggest that co-administration of hesperetin with ECT is effective for improvement of cognitive function and can alleviate ECT-induced memory impairment in reserpine-treated rats.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline. Despite extensive research, therapeutic options remain limited. Varenicline, an alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, shows promise in enhancing cognitive function. This study aimed to evaluate varenicline's effect on memory and hippocampal activity in rat model of AD. Forty-eight adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control, sham, AD, and varenicline (0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg/po for 14 days) groups. AD was induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 4 mu l amyloid-beta (A beta)1-42 (1 mu g/mu l). Spatial learning and memory, hippocampal synaptic function, and CA1 electrophysiological activity were evaluated using appropriate methods. Barnes maze and T-maze behavioral tests revealed that varenicline, particularly at 1 mg/kg, significantly improved spatial memory compared to the AD group. Western blot analysis showed varenicline's ability to upregulate synaptic proteins PSD-95, synaptophysin, and GAP-43 in the hippocampus, with the most significant effects observed at 1 mg/kg. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that varenicline at 1 mg/kg enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), indicating improved synaptic plasticity. Single-unit recordings showed an increase in spike count with varenicline administration. These findings suggest that varenicline, particularly at 1 mg/kg, ameliorates memory deficits in AD rats possibly through modulation of synaptic proteins and enhancement of hippocampal LTP and electrical activity. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate varenicline's precise mechanisms of action in alleviating AD-induced cognitive deficits and its potential as a therapeutic intervention for AD-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - Propofol can partly ameliorate electroconvulsive shock (ECS)-induced learning and memory impairment by restoring synaptic plasticity. However, the exact mechanism is unknown. Microglia exert different immune functions by regulating their glucose metabolism, which is closely related to synaptic plasticity. We aimed to investigate whether the mechanism underlying the cognitive enhancement effects of propofol is associated with microglial glucose metabolism. Rats depression model was established by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Sucrose preference test (SPT) and open field test (OFT) were used to detect anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviors in rats, respectively. Morris water maze (MWM) was used to evaluate the spatial learning and memory ability of rats. Transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, enzymatic activity assays, Western blotting, and RT-qPCR were employed to evaluate hippocampal synaptic structural integrity, microglial glucose metabolism, and the expression of glycolytic regulators p-AMPK/AMPK and HIF-1 alpha. The AMPK inhibitor compound C was used for reverse validation. Propofol attenuated the ECS-induced reduction of hippocampal synaptic proteins PSD-95 and SYN1, suppressed the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and reduced microglial activation. It also reduced the key glycolytic enzymes in microglia, increased AMPK expression, and decreased HIF-1 alpha expression, thereby improving learning and memory impairment in ECS-treated rats. Compound C reversed propofol's neuroprotective effect. ECS-induced learning and memory deficits in depressive-like rats are associated with increased microglial glycolysis via the AMPK/HIF-1 alpha pathway, a metabolism process that could be mitigated by propofol.

AB  - Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a critical mechanism underlying the pathophysiological effects of sleep deprivation (SD) and neurological consequences. Recent studies have highlighted the significant neuroprotective role of the GABA(B) receptor. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SD-induced ferroptosis on the expression of the GABA(B) receptor in the hippocampus. Thirty-six male C57BL/6 mice were used in this study, with twenty-four subjected to SD through a modified multiple-platform water method and twelve serving as controls. Learning and memory capacities were evaluated using the Morris water maze, while hippocampal neuron morphology was examined via Nissl staining. Biochemical assays were conducted to measure levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum, hippocampal tissue, and cultured cells. Transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry were employed to observe mitochondrial alterations and reactive oxygen species levels. Western blotting was performed to analyze the expression of the GABA(B) receptor and ferroptosis-related proteins. SD resulted in impaired learning and memory, hippocampal neuronal damage, morphological alterations in hippocampal neuronal mitochondria, and abnormal expression of the GABA(B) receptor and ferroptosis-related proteins in the hippocampus of mice. Similarly, in vitro experiment, we observed a increase in oxidative stress, mitochondrial structural damage, aberrant expression of the GABA(B) receptor, and changes in ferroptosis-related protein levels. SD induced ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons of mice, reduced the expression of the GABA(B) receptor, and led to impairments in learning and memory.

AB  - Depression is a clinically common and easily overlooked mental disease. Quercetin is a flavonoid compound, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant roles. Previous reports presented the anti-depressant role of quercetin. Nevertheless, the latent mechanism of the anti-depressant function of quercetin is blurry. This research aimed to probe its effects on corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression-like behaviors and explore the underlying mechanism. A depression model was established by subcutaneous injection of CORT (20 mg/kg). Thereafter, CORT-treated mice were given 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg of quercetin by gavage. This study found that quercetin mitigated depression-like behaviors, as evidenced by increased the number of line crossings, swimming time, and time spent in open arm and reduced thigmotaxis time in CORT-challenged mice in open field test and decreased immobility time as well as the swimming and climbing time in forced swim test and increased number of head dips, time spent and entries in open arm elevated plus maze test. Also, quercetin exerted antiinflammatory and anti-oxidation effects in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of CORT-induced mice. Additionally, quercetin alleviated the pathological injury of the liver tissue and weakened alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations of the serum in CORT-induced mice. Quercetin also suppressed Caspase-3 content but advanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) contents in hippocampus of CORT-treated mice. Based on these results, quercetin mitigated CORT-induced depression-like behaviors, and the mechanism was partly related to the repression of neuroinflammation and oxidative damage.

AB  - Despite the increase in the prevalence of postpartum depression among maternal disorder, its treatment outcomes remain suboptimal. Studies have shown that exercise can reduce postpartum depressive episodes in the mother, but the effects of exercise during pregnancy on maternal behavior and the potential mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. From the second day of pregnancy to the day of birth, dams exercised for 1 h a day by running on a controlled wheel. The maternal behaviors of the dams were assessed on postpartum day 2 to postpartum day 8. Chronic restraint stress was applied from postpartum day 2 to day 12. Blood was collected on postpartum days 3 and 8, then subjected to ELISA to determine the serum concentration of prolactin. The weight of each dam and the food intake were recorded. Anxiety- and depression-like behavioral tests were conducted, and hippocampal neuroinflammation and prolactin receptor levels were measured. The dams exhibited elevated levels of anxiety and depression, decreased serum prolactin levels, decreased prolactin receptor expression, and activation of NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation in the hippocampus following the induction of postpartum chronic restraint stress, which were reversed with controlled wheel running during pregnancy. Overall, the findings of this study revealed that the preventive effects of exercise during pregnancy on postpartum anxiety-and depression-like behaviors were accompanied by increased serum prolactin levels, hippocampal prolactin receptor expression and hippocampal NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation.

AB  - Corticosterone (CORT) damages hippocampal neurons as well as induces neuroinflammation. The tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolite itaconate has an anti-inflammatory role. Necroptosis is a form of programmed cell death, also known as inflammatory cell death. Menin is a multifunctional scaffold protein, which deficiency aggravates neuroinflammation. In this study, we explored whether itaconate inhibits CORT-induced neuroinflammation as well as necroptosis and further investigated the mediatory role of Menin in this protective effect of itaconate by using an exposure of CORT to HT22 cells (a hippocampal neuronal cell line). The viability of HT22 cells was examined by the cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8). The morphology of HT22 cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The expressions of necroptosis-related proteins (p-RIP1/RIP1, p-RIP3/RIP3, and p-MLKL/MLKL) were evaluated by western blotting. The contents of inflammatory factors were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Our results showed that CORT increases the contents of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha) as well as decreases the contents of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-4, IL-10) in HT22 cells. We also found that CORT increases the expressions of necroptosis-related proteins (p-RIP1/RIP1, p-RIP3/RIP3, and p-MLKL/MLKL) and decreases the cell viability in HT22 cells, indicating that CORT induces necroptosis in HT22 cells. Itaconate improves CORT-induced neuroinflammation and necroptosis. Furthermore, itaconate upregulates the expression of Menin in CORT-exposed HT22 cells. Importantly, silencing Menin abolishes the antagonistic effect of itaconate on CORT-induced necroptosis and neuroinflammation. In brief, these results indicated that itaconate protects HT22 cells against CORT-induced neuroinflammation and necroptosis via upregulating Menin.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disorder with unclear pathogenesis. Single-target drugs have very limited efficacy in treating AD, but synthetic multi-target drugs have poor efficacy and safety. Therefore, finding suitable natural multi-target drugs against AD is of great interest for research studies. We chose two flavonols, myricetin and morin, for the relevant study. In this study, we used microinjection of A beta 1-42 oligomers into the CA1 region of rat hippocampus, combined with gavage of Aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl3.6H2O) solution to establish AD rat models, and myricetin and morin were selected as intervening drugs to explore the protective effects against neurological impairment. Experimental results showed that myricetin or morin could reduce the production of A beta, Tubulin-associated unit (Tau), and Phosphorylated tubulin-associated unit (p-Tau), down-regulate the expression of relevant inflammatory factors, reduce hippocampal cell apoptosis in rats. There was a significant increase in the activity of adenosine triphosphatase, catalase, total superoxide dismutase, and the content of glutathione in the brain tissue. However, the content of malondialdehyde, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and the activity of acetylcholinesterase were decreased in the brain tissue. These two flavonols can regulate the imbalance of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter levels. In conclusion, Myricetin or morin can effectively improve learning and memory dysfunction in AD rats induced by A beta 1-42/Al3+ through anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptotic features.

AB  - Aging is characterized by a progressive deterioration in physiological functions that is associated with cognitive decline as well as other physical functional impairments. Microglia activation leading to neuroinflammation has been generally recognized as playing a critical role in the development of age-related cognitive decline. NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia is fundamental for IL-1 beta maturation and subsequent inflammatory events. However, it remains unknown whether NLRP3 activation contributes to aging-induced cognitive decline in vivo. Here, our study demonstrated that aging rats showed declined cognitive function and impaired synaptic plasticity as well as decreased density of dendritic spines. Importantly, our data demonstrated strongly enhanced expression of NLRP3, ASC and Caspase-1 in the hippocampus of aged rats as well as decreased AMPA receptor and phosphorylated levels of CaMKII and CREB in the hippocampus of natural aging rats. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor elevated the surface expression of AMPA receptor and the phosphorylated levels of CaMKII, CREB in hippocampus, and finally contributed to the attenuation of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) deficits and the improvement of cognitive decline of natural aging rats. These results revealed an important role for the NLRP3-Caspase-1 pathway in aging-induced cognitive decline and suggested that inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome represented a novel therapeutic intervention for aging-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - The study aimed to assess gamma-Terpinene's (gamma-TER) neuroprotective potential in acute cerebral ischemia, characterized by reduced cerebral blood flow in rats. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), a standard method for inducing cerebral ischemia, was employed in male Wistar rats. gamma-TER at varying doses (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administered during reperfusion onset. Neurological outcomes, cerebral infarct size, edema, and enzymatic activities (SOD, GPx, and catalase) in the brain were evaluated using diverse techniques. The study examined gene expression and pathways associated with neuroinflammation and apoptosis using Cytoscape software, identifying the top 10 genes involved. Pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic factors were assessed through real-time PCR and ELISA, while apoptotic cell rates were measured using the TUNEL and Flow cytometry assay. Immunohistochemistry assessed apoptosis-related proteins like Bax and bcl-2 in the ischemic area. gamma-TER, particularly at doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg, significantly reduced neurological deficits and cerebral infarction size. The 15 mg/kg dose mitigated TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, Bax, and caspase-3 gene and protein levels in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum compared to controls. Furthermore, Bcl-2 levels increased in these regions. gamma-TER show cased neuroprotective effects by suppressing inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidation. In conclusion, gamma-TER, possessing natural anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, shields the brain against ischemic damage by reducing infarction, edema, oxidative stress, and inflammation. It modulates the expression of crucial genes and proteins associated with apoptosis in diverse brain regions. These findings position gamma-TER as a potential therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke.

AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases. There is increasing evidence for ferroptosis playing an important role in the occurrence and development of epilepsy. Vitamin E is a common fat-soluble antioxidant that can regulate ferroptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin E on ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons in epileptic rats. Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 35 mg/kg), vitamin E (200 mg/kg) + PTZ, and Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1; 2.5 mu mol/kg) + PTZ groups, with drugs administered intraperitoneally 15 times every other day for 29 days. The behavioral manifestations (epileptic score, latency, and number of seizures in 30 min) and EEG changes were observed and recorded. Nissl staining and electrophysiological recording were used to assess neuronal damage and excitability in the hippocampal CA1 region, respectively. The levels of iron, glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the hippocampus were assessed by spectrophotometry. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect lipoxygenase 15 (15-LOX) expression. Western blot was used to determine glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and 15-LOX protein levels. Vitamin E treatment was associated with decreased epileptic grade, seizure latency, and number of seizures in the PTZ-kindled epileptic model. Vitamin E treatment also decreased 15-LOX expression, inhibited MDA and iron accumulation, and increased GPX4 and GSH expression. In conclusion, vitamin E can reduce neuronal ferroptosis and seizures by inhibiting 15-LOX expression.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) exerts neuroprotective or proinflammatory effects, depending on what VEGF forms (A-E), receptor types (VEGFR1-3), and intracellular signaling pathways are involved. Neonatal monosodium glutamate (MSG) treatment triggers neuronal death by excitotoxicity, which is commonly involved in different neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of VEGFR-2 inhibition on neuronal damage triggered by excitotoxicity in the cerebral motor cortex (CMC) and hippocampus (Hp) after neonatal MSG treatment. MSG was administered at a dose of 4 g/kg of body weight (b.w.) subcutaneously on postnatal days (PD) 1, 3, 5, and 7, whereas the VEGFR-2 inhibitor SU5416 was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg b.w. subcutaneously on PD 5 and 7, 30 min before the MSG treatment. Neuronal damage was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining, fluoro-Jade staining, and TUNEL assay. Additionally, western blot assays for some proteins of the VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway (VEGF-A, VEGFR-2, PI3K, Akt, and iNOS) were carried out. All assays were performed on PD 6, 8, 10, and 14. Inhibition of VEGFR-2 signaling by SU5416 increases the neuronal damage induced by neonatal MSG treatment in both the CMC and Hp. Moreover, neonatal MSG treatment increased the expression levels of the studied VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway proteins, particularly in the CMC. We conclude that VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway activation could be part of the neuroprotective mechanisms that attempt to compensate for neuronal damage induced by neonatal MSG treatment and possibly also in other conditions involving excitotoxicity.

AB  - Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a synthetic inhibitor of human cytokines with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This study was designed to investigate the expression variation of IL-10 in the multiple sites including cortex, hippocampus, and lung tissues of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) rats and explore the crucial role of IL-10 in alleviating HI brain damage. In this study, neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to the right common carotid artery ligation, followed by 2 h of hypoxia. The expression of IL-10 in the cortex, hippocampus, and lung tissues was measured with immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blot (WB). Immunofluorescence double staining was performed to observe the localization of IL-10 in neurons and astrocytes. Moreover, not-targeting and targeting IL-10 siRNA lentivirus vectors were injected into the rats of the negative control (NC) and IL-10 group, respectively, and the mRNA levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29) were detected by RT-qPCR following IL-10 silence. The results demonstrated that the IL-10 expression was markedly increased after HI and IL-10 were colocalized with neurons and astrocytes which were badly injured by HI insult. In addition, Bcl-2 and ERp29 were remarkably decreased following IL-10 mRNA interference compared with the NC group. Our findings revealed that IL-10 exerted its antiapoptotic and neuroprotective effects by regulating the expression of Bcl-2 and ERp29, indicating that IL-10 may be a promising molecule target for HIE treatment.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is common and has poor clinical outcome. Sepsis increases autophagy in the brain. This study was designed to determine the role of autophagy on SAE including the brain structures related to learning and memory and the effects of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an anti-inflammatory agent, on autophagy and SAE. Six- to eight-week old CD-1 male mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Some mice received intracerebroventricular injection of the autophagy suppressor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or intraperitoneal injection of PDTC immediately at the completion of the CLP. ELISA was used to measure interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Autophagy-related protein expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was analyzed by Western blotting. The cognitive functions of mice were analyzed by Barnes maze and fear conditioning tests. CLP increased microtubuleassociated protein light chain 3 II (LC3II) and Beclin 1 and decreased p62 in the brain. CLP also increased proinflammatory cytokines and impaired learning and memory. These effects were inhibited by 3-MA and PDTC. Spine proliferation and maturation were impaired by CLP, which was attenuated by PDTC and 3MA. Abundant autophagic vacuoles were observed by transmission electron microscopy in CLP group. LC3II immunostaining was co-localized with that of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and microtubule-associated protein-2. The co-staining was attenuated by 3-MA and PDTC. Our results suggest that sepsis increases autophagy in the microglia and neurons. Inhibiting autophagy improves SAE and brain structures related to learning and memory in mice. Autophagy and inflammation in the brain may regulate each other during sepsis.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and ginsenoside Rg2 (Rg2) is proven to inhibit AD's progression. This study investigates the potential benefits of Rg2 treatment on 3xTg-AD mice. Following 6 weeks of gavage treatment, Rg2-treated 3xTg-AD mice exhibited improved spatial recognition memory behav-iors, regional cerebral blood flow, and histopathological injury of the hippocampus, which were observed through a Y-maze test, laser Doppler flowmetry, and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Additionally, Rg2 treatment caused a decrease in the levels of amyloid beta 25-35, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as well as a reduction in mRNA levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 in 3xTg-AD mouse brains using quantitative real-time PCR. In particular, NeuN and CD31 levels were inhibited and GFAP level was elevated in 3xTg-AD mice that were observed through immunofluorescence, and these levels were all antagonized by Rg2, suggesting the effects of Rg2 on neurovascular damage, astrocyte activation, and neuronal loss. Furthermore, Western blot and qRT-PCR assays showed that Rg2 blocked the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in 3xTg-AD mice. By Western blot, the ratios of p-ERK/ERK and p-MAPK/MAPK in 3xTg-AD mice were upregulated by Rg2 treatment, suggesting the neuroprotective effects of Rg2 may be related to the MAPK-ERK pathway. In summary, this study demonstrated the potential of Rg2 to improve AD and provided a scientific basis for research on the biological mechanism of AD and the development of Rg2.

AB  - Mucus secretion and its composition are vital in the maintenance of airway health, among which hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are thought to be involved in the regulation of mucin synthesis and regulation. Nasal mucus composition difference between healthy individuals and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients may contribute to the pathology of chronic nasal diseases, but so far, their role has yet to be completely understood. Nasal biopsy specimens were obtained from 24 healthy subjects and 99 patients with CRS without (CRSsNP, n=36) or with (CRSwNP, n=63) nasal polyps. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescent (IF) staining, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blot were performed to compare the nasal mucus composition between the subjects. Areas of the serous gland and mucous gland were both significantly increased in CRSsNP patients. In CRSwNP patients, a decrease in submucosal gland density and a marked increase in goblet cells were observed. The major gel-forming mucins in the sinonasal mucosa of CRSsNP and CRSwNP are MUC5B and MUC5AC respectively. Mucous cells are found in a higher proportion in both CRSsNP and CRSwNP. The proportion of MUC5AC-positive goblet cells was increased in CRSwNP. The mRNA level of HIF-2 alpha was significantly increased in CRS, and both HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha were expressed in serous cell but not mucous cell. Over secretion and altered composition of mucus are observed in sinonasal mucosa of CRS, which was mainly associated with glandular hyperplasia in CRSsNP and goblet cell hyperplasia in CRSwNP. Mucus abnormality compromised both non-specific and specific antimicrobial capabilities in the sinonasal mucosa. HIF expression may contribute to differences in mucin synthesis and serous gland regulation, which needs further investigation to understand the pathology of CRS.

AB  - There is mounting evidence that metabolic syndrome (MetS) contributes to the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Honey, which has been used for generations, is high in antioxidants and has been demonstrated to benefit the brain and mental health by reducing oxidative stress and boosting cognitive outcomes. Honey from the stingless bees of Heterotrigona itama has been found to have higher phenolic content compared to other types of honeys. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of stingless bee honey (SBH) supplementation and to compare it with a pure form of antioxidant, caffeic acid (CA), on MetS parameters and inflammatory markers in the brains of MetS-induced rats. A total of 32 male Wistar rats were divided equally into groups of control, high-carbohydrate high-fructose (HCHF) diet (MetS), HCHF + SBH supplemented (1 g/kg) (SBH), and HCHF + CA supplemented (10 mg/kg) (CA) groups. The total duration for SBH and CA supplementation was eight weeks. The HCHF diet was found to promote hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, and to increase brain TNF-alpha levels. Supplementation with SBH and CA significantly reversed (p < 0.05) the hyperglycemic and hypertensive effects of the HCHF diet. Although both supplemented groups showed no significant changes to serum HDL or TG, SBH significantly reduced (p < 0.05) brain TNF-alpha levels and increased (p < 0.05) brain BDNF levels. Immunohistochemistry investigations of neurogenesis (EdU) and apoptosis (TUNEL) on the cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) areas of the hippocampus showed no changes with SBH and CA supplementation compared to the control. These findings suggest that SBH and CA have the potential to mitigate HCHF-induced MetS effects and possess neuroprotective abilities.

AB  - Epilepsy represents a hazardous neurological disorder, underpinned by a pathophysiological process that is yet to be fully understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the effect of methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 3 (MBD3) on hippocampal neuronal damage in epileptic mice by targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway. The expression of MBD3 was determined by Western blot in a hippocampal neuronal culture (HNC) epileptic model established using the low Mg-2+ECF culture method. The interaction between MBD3 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was determined via co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. Bisulfite modification and sequencing was performed to evaluate the degree of methylation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). The viability and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons were detected by CCK-8 and TUNEL assays, respectively. Finally, the effect of MBD3 was verified in vivo. MBD3 was highly expressed in the HNC model of epilepsy, with its interaction with DNMT1 found to promote the hypermethylation of TREM2 at site cg25748868. Additionally, decreased TREM2 and inhibited PI3K/Akt pathway was observed in the HNC epileptic model. Simultaneous inhibition of MBD3 and DNMT1 decreased the methylation level at cg25748868, up-regulated TREM2 expression, and activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby arresting neuronal damage. Inhibition of MBD3 reduced the level of epileptic seizures, down-regulated cg25748868 methylation, activated TREM2-mediated signaling pathways, and alleviated hippocampal neuronal damage in the acute seizure mouse models. The present study unveiled that MBD3 and DNMT1 synergistically enhanced hypermethylation of cg25748868 in TREM2, and promoted the onset of epilepsy via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

AB  - Natural remedies have emerged as promising alternative or complementary therapies for combating depression. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hesperidin (HSP-NPs) and quercetin (QUR-NPs) nanoparticles on oxidative stress markers, enzyme activities, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and monoamine levels in the cortex and hippocampus of a reserpine-induced rat model of depression. The depression model was established by administering reserpine (0.2 mg/kg) to the animals for 25 days. On the 26th, rats were administered i.p. with reserpine (0.1 mg/kg) and oral isotonic saline solution for another 21 days. Following reserpine administration, the animals exhibited a significant reduction in nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) levels. Additionally, a significant decrease in Na, K,ATPase activity and a significant increase in acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity were observed in the cortex and hippocampus as compared to the control group of animals. Treatment with either HSP-NPs and QUR-NPs for 14 days mitigated the oxidative stress in the cortex and hippocampus. The treatments restored the changes Na, K,ATPase, and MAO, AchE activities in the two brain regions. Notably, QUR-NPs was superior in alleviating the adverse changes induced by reserpine concerning monoamines and BDNF levels. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of HSP-NPs and QUR-NPs in mitigating the underlying etiology of depressive symptoms rat model. Further investigations are warranted to exploAuthorre the potential synergistic effects of hesperidin and quercetin when used in combination at different doses and treatment durations.

AB  - Isoliensinine (ISO), a natural compound, is a bibenzyl isoquinoline alkaloid monomer in lotus seed, which has strong antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. The oxidative toxicity caused by glutamic acid overdose is one of the important mechanisms of nerve cell injury, and the oxidative toxicity caused by glutamic acid is related to ferroptosis. This study aims to establish a glutamate-induced injury model of mouse hippocampal neurons HT-22 cells, and investigate the protective effect of ISO on the neurotoxicity of glutamate-induced HT-22 cells. The results showed that ISO inhibited glutamate-induced ferroptosis of neuronal cells through nuclear factor E2-related factor 2/glutathione peroxidase 4 (Nrf2/GPX4) signaling pathway. Pretreatment of HT-22 cells with ISO significantly reduced glutamate-induced cell death. Ferroptosis inhibitors have the same effect. ISO inhibited the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential detection and the increase of iron content induced by glutamate, the increase of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species in cytoplasm and lipid, and protected the activities of GPx and superoxide dismutase enzymes. In addition, WB showed that glutamic acid could induce the upregulated expression of long-chain esteryl coA synthase 4 (ACSL4) protein and the downregulated expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4 protein in HT-22 cells, while ISO could prevent the abnormal expression of these proteins induced by glutamic acid. The nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in HT-22 cells was increased, and the expression of downstream heme oxygenase-1 protein was upregulated. In summary, ISO protects HT-22 cells from glutamate-induced ferroptosis through a novel mechanism of the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway.

AB  - The effect of a ketogenic diet (KD) on middle aged female mice is poorly understood as most of this work have been conducted in young female mice or diseased models. We have previously shown that an isocaloric KD started at middle age in male mice results in enhanced mitochondrial mass and function after 2 months on diet and improved cognitive behavior after being on diet for 14 months when compared with their control diet (CD) fed counterparts. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of an isocaloric 2-month KD or CD on healthy 14-month-old female mice. At 16 months of age cognitive behavior tests were performed and then serum, skeletal muscle, cortex, and hippocampal tissues were collected for biochemical analysis. Two months on a KD resulted in enhanced cognitive behavior associated with anxiety, memory, and willingness to explore. The improved neurocognitive function was associated with increased PGC1 alpha protein in the gastrocnemius (GTN) muscle and nuclear fraction. The KD resulted in a tissue specific increase in mitochondrial mass and kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) levels in the GTN and soleus muscles, with a corresponding decrease in kynurenine and increase in kynurenic acid levels in serum. With KAT proteins being responsible for converting kynurenine into kynurenic acid, which is unable to cross the blood brain barrier and be turned into quinolinic acid-a potent neurotoxin, this study provides a potential mechanism of crosstalk between muscle and brain in mice on a KD that may contribute to improved cognitive function in middle-aged female mice.

AB  - Background: Anti-IgLON5 disease is a rare late-onset neurological disease associated with autoantibodies against IgLON5, neuronal accumulation of phosphorylated Tau protein (p-Tau), and sleep, respiratory, and motor alterations. Purpose: We performed a pilot study of whether the neuropathological and clinical features of anti-IgLON5 disease may be recapitulated in mice with chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of human anti-IgLON5 disease IgG (Pt-IgG). Methods: Humanized transgenic hTau mice expressing human Tau protein and wild-type (WT) control mice were infused intracerebroventricularly with Pt-IgG or with antibodies from a control subject for 14 days. The sleep, respiratory, and motor phenotype was evaluated at the end of the antibody infusion and at least 30 days thereafter, followed by immunohistochemical assessment of p-Tau deposition. Results: In female hTau and WT mice infused with Pt-IgG, we found reproducible trends of diffuse neuronal cytoplasmic p-Tau deposits in the brainstem and hippocampus, increased ventilatory period during sleep, and decreased inter-lick interval during wakefulness. These findings were not replicated on male hTau mice. Conclusion: The results of our pilot study suggest, but do not prove, that chronic ICV infusion of mice with Pt-IgG may elicit neuropathological, respiratory, and motor alterations. These results should be considered as preliminary until replicated in larger studies taking account of potential sex differences in mice.

AB  - PARP6, a member of a family of enzymes (17 in humans) known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), is a neuronally enriched PARP. While previous studies from our group show that Parp6 is a regulator of dendrite morphogenesis in rat hippocampal neurons, its function in the nervous system in vivo is poorly understood. Here, we describe the generation of a Parp6 loss-of-function mouse model for examining the function of Parp6 during neurodevelopment in vivo. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we generated a mouse line that expressed a Parp6 truncated variant (Parp6(TR)) in place of Parp6(WT). Unlike Parp6(WT), Parp6(TR) is devoid of catalytic activity. Homozygous Parp6(TR) do not exhibit obvious neuromorphological defects during development, but nevertheless die perinatally. This suggests that Parp6 catalytic activity is important for postnatal survival. We also report PARP6 mutations in six patients with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including microencephaly, intellectual disabilities, and epilepsy. The most severe mutation in PARP6 (C563R) results in the loss of catalytic activity. Expression of Parp6(C563R) in hippocampal neurons decreases dendrite morphogenesis. To gain further insight into PARP6 function in neurons we also performed a BioID proximity labeling experiment in hippocampal neurons and identified several microtubule-binding proteins (e.g., MAP-2) using proteomics. Taken together, our results suggest that PARP6 is an essential microtubule-regulatory gene in mice, and that the loss of PARP6 catalytic activity has detrimental effects on neuronal function in humans.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of cancer necessitates the development of novel and effective therapeutic agents. This study evaluates the anticancer potential of biosynthesized copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) using Camellia sinensis extract against human colon and breast cancer cells. The CuO NPs were characterized using various techniques to confirm their structure, size, morphology, and functional groups. The average size of CuO NPs synthesized was 20-60 nm, with spherical shape. The cytotoxic effects of these CuO NPs reveal a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) at 58.53 +/- 0.13 and 53.95 +/- 1.1 mu g/mL, respectively. Further investigation into the mechanism of action was conducted using flow cytometry and apoptosis assays, which indicated that CuO NPs induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, caspase activity assay, and comet assay were also performed to elucidate the underlying pathways, suggesting that oxidative stress and DNA damage play pivotal roles in the cytotoxicity observed. Overall, our findings demonstrate that biosynthesized CuO NPs exhibit notable anticancer activity against colon and breast cancer cells, with moderate selectivity over normal cells, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic agent due to their biocompatibility. However, further studies are required to validate their selectivity and safety profile.

AB  - Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is a metabolic enzyme that converts 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to 3phosphoglycerate. In the current study, we synthesized a PEP-1-PGK1 fusion protein that can cross the bloodbrain barrier and cell membrane, and the effects of PEP-1-PGK1 against oxidative stress were investigated HT22 cells and ischemic gerbil brain. The PEP-1-PGK1 protein and its control protein (Con-PGK1) were treated and permeability was evaluated HT22 cells. The PEP-1-PGK1 was introduced into HT22 cells depending on its concentration and incubation time and was gradually degraded over 36 h after treatment. PEP-1-PGK1, but not Con-PGK1, significantly ameliorated H2O2-induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species formation in HT22 cells. Additionally, PEP-1-PGK1, but not Con-PGK1, mitigated ischemia-induced hyperlocomotion 1 d after ischemia and 4 d after ischemia of neuronic cell death. PEP-1-PGK1 treatment significantly alleviated the raised lactate and succinate dehydrogenase activities in the early (15 min to 6 h) and late (4 and 7 d) stages of ischemia, respectively. In addition, PEP-1-PGK1 treatment ameliorated the decrease in ATP and pH levels in the late stage (2-7 d) of ischemia. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels accelerated the ischemiainduced increase in the hippocampus 1 d after ischemia after PEP-1-PGK1 treatment. Neuroprotective and ameliorative effects were prominent at a low concentration (0.1 mg/kg), but not at a high concentration (1 mg/kg), of PEP-1-PGK1. Collectively, low concentrations of PEP-1-PGK1 prevented neuronal stress by increasing energy production.

AB  - Proinflammatory T-lymphocytes recruited into the brain and spinal cord mediate multiple sclerosis (MS) and currently there is no cure for MS. IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells induce ascending paralysis in the spinal cord while IL-17-producing Th17 cells mediate cerebellar ataxia. STAT1 and STAT3 are required for Th1 and Th17 development, respectively, and the simultaneous targeting of STAT1 and STAT3 pathways is therefore a potential therapeutic strategy for suppressing disease in the spinal cord and brain. However, the pharmacological targeting of STAT1 and STAT3 presents significant challenges because of their intracellular localization. We have developed a STAT-specific single-domain nanobody (SBT-100) derived from camelids that targets conserved residues in Src homolog 2 (SH2) domains of STAT1 and STAT3. This study investigated whether SBT-100 could suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. We show that SBT-100 ameliorates encephalomyelitis through suppressing the expansion of Th17 and Th1 cells in the brain and spinal cord. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that lymphocytes from SBT-100-treated EAE mice have reduced capacity to induce EAE, indicating that the immunosuppressive effects derived from the direct suppression of encephalitogenic T-cells. The small size of SBT-100 makes this STAT-specific nanobody a promising immunotherapy for CNS autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Oat is considered the second crop in Iraq. It needs to select good varieties and improve its quality to increase its yield. This study evaluates the effect of ascorbic acid (AsA) on the growth and yield of four oat (Avena sativa L.)varieties-Kangaroo, Possum, ICARDA Short, and ICARDA Tall-under field conditions in Koya, Erbil, Iraq. The experiment was conducted during the winter season using a split-plot design in a randomized complete block layout with three replicates. Four concentrations of ascorbic acid (0, 100, 200, and 300 ppm) were applied via foliar spray at two critical growth stages: tillering and flowering. The critical parameters of the study such as plant height, number of panicles, grain yield, biological yield and harvest index were assessed at harvest.The ICARDA Short cultivar gave the highest seed and biological yield with ascorbic acid treated plants not showing any significant change. ICARDATall and Kangaroo showed a significant increase in yield, especially at the 300-ppm concentration of ascorbic acid. The Possum variety responded minimally to all treatments. It seemed that ICARDA Short can be produced successfully without additional ascorbic acid, making it an economically viable product for growers, but that ICARDA Tall and Kangaroo may require additional ascorbic acid to achieve higher yields. Findings from this research give perspective on how to improve oat products by strategically utilizing of plant growth regulators.

AB  - Group rearing is a common housing condition, but group-housed older mice show increased adrenal hypertrophy, a marker of stress. However, the ingestion of theanine, an amino acid unique to tea leaves, suppressed stress. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism of theanine's stress-reducing effects using group-reared older mice. The expression of repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which represses excitability-related genes, was increased in the hippocampus of group-reared older mice, whereas the expression of neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4), which is involved in the regulation of excitation and inhibition in the brain, was lower in the hippocampus of older group-reared mice than in same-aged two-to-a-house mice. That is, the expression patterns of REST and Npas4 were found to be just inversely correlated. On the other hand, the expression levels of the glucocorticoid receptor and DNA methyltransferase, which suppress Npas4 transcription, were higher in the older group-housed mice. In mice fed theanine, the stress response was reduced and Npas4 expression tended to be increased. These results suggest that Npas4 expression was suppressed by the increased expression of REST and Npas4 downregulators in the group-fed older mice, but that theanine avoids the decrease in Npas4 expression by suppressing the expression of Npas4 transcriptional repressors.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and its prevalence rises with age. Inflammation and altered antioxidant systems play essential roles in the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we looked at the effects of Memophenol(TM), a compound rich in polyphenols derived from French grape (Vitis vinifera L.) and wild North American blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium A.) extracts, in a rat model of AD. Methods: For 60 days, the animals were administered with AlCl3 (100 mg/kg, orally) and D-galactose (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), while from day 30, Memophenol(TM) (15 mg/kg) was supplied orally for 30 consecutive days. AlCl3 accumulates mainly in the hippocampus, the main part of the brain involved in memory and learning. Behavioral tests were performed the day before the sacrifice when brains were collected for analysis. Results: MemophenolTM decreased behavioral alterations and hippocampus neuronal degeneration. It also lowered phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) levels, amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpression, and beta amyloid (A beta) buildup. Furthermore, Memophenol2 reduced the pro-oxidative and proinflammatory hippocampus changes caused by AD. Our finding, relevant to AD pathogenesis and therapeutics, suggests that MemophenolTM, by modulating oxidative and inflammatory pathways and by regulating cellular brain stress response mechanisms, protects against the behavioral and histopathological changes associated with AD.

AB  - Recently, morphological impairments have been detected in the brain of a triple-hit rat schizophrenia model (Wisket), and delayed depressive effects of caffeine treatment in both control and Wisket animals have also been shown. The aims of this study were to determine the basal and caffeine-induced acute (30 min) and delayed (24 h) changes in the cerebral (18)fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) uptake by positron emission tomography (PET) in control and Wisket rats. No significant differences were identified in the basal whole-brain metabolism between the two groups, and the metabolism was not modified acutely by a single intraperitoneal caffeine (20 mg/kg) injection in either group. However, one day after caffeine administration, significantly enhanced F-18-FDG uptake was detected in the whole brain and the investigated areas (hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and hypothalamus) in the control group. Although the Wisket animals showed only moderate enhancements in the F-18-FDG uptake, significantly lower brain metabolism was observed in this group than in the caffeine-treated control group. This study highlights that the basal brain metabolism of Wisket animals was similar to control rats, and that was not influenced acutely by single caffeine treatment at the whole-brain level. Nevertheless, the distinct delayed responsiveness to this psychostimulant in Wisket model rats suggests impaired control of the cerebral metabolism.

AB  - Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common birth defects in humans, present in around 40% of newborns with Down's syndrome (DS). The SH3 domain-binding glutamic acid-rich (SH3BGR) gene, which maps to the DS region, belongs to a gene family encoding a cluster of small thioredoxin-like proteins sharing SH3 domains. Although its expression is confined to the cardiac and skeletal muscle, the physiological role of SH3BGR in the heart is poorly understood. Interestingly, we observed a significant upregulation of SH3BGR in failing hearts of mice and human patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Along these lines, the overexpression of SH3BGR exhibited a significant increase in the expression of hypertrophic markers (Nppa and Nppb) and increased cell surface area in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCMs), whereas its knockdown attenuated cellular hypertrophy. Mechanistically, using serum response factor (SRF) response element-driven luciferase assays in the presence or the absence of RhoA or its inhibitor, we found that the pro-hypertrophic effects of SH3BGR are mediated via the RhoA-SRF axis. Furthermore, SH3BGR knockdown resulted in the induction of apoptosis and reduced cell viability in NRVCMs via apoptotic Hippo-YAP signaling. Taking these results together, we here show that SH3BGR is vital for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and cellular viability in NRVCMs through its modulation of the SRF/YAP signaling pathways.

AB  - Plumbagin, a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, confers neuroprotection via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aimed to assess the effect of plumbagin on behavioral and memory deficits induced by intrahippocampal administration of Quinolinic acid (QA) in male Wistar rats and reveal the associated mechanisms. QA (300 nM/4 mu L in Normal saline) was administered i.c.v. in the hippocampus. QA administration caused depression-like behavior (forced swim test and tail suspension tests), anxiety-like behavior (open field test and elevated plus maze), and elevated anhedonia behavior (sucrose preference test). Furthermore, oxidative-nitrosative stress (increased nitrite content and lipid peroxidation with reduction of GSH), inflammation (increased IL-1 beta), cholinergic dysfunction, and mitochondrial complex (I, II, and IV) dysfunction were observed in the hippocampus region of QA-treated rats as compared to normal controls. Plumbagin (10 and 20 mg/kg; p.o.) treatment for 21 days significantly ameliorated behavioral and memory deficits in QA-administered rats. Moreover, plumbagin treatment restored the GSH level and reduced the MDA and nitrite level in the hippocampus. Furthermore, QA-induced cholinergic dysfunction and mitochondrial impairment were found to be ameliorated by plumbagin treatment. In conclusion, our results suggested that plumbagin offers a neuroprotective potential that could serve as a promising pharmacological approach to mitigate neurobehavioral changes associated with neurodegeneration.

AB  - The complement is a component of the innate immune system designed to fight infections and tissue- or age-related damages. Complement activation creates an inflammatory microenvironment, which enhances cell death. Excessive complement inflammatory activity has been linked to alterations in the structure and functions of the blood-brain barrier, contributing to a poor prognosis for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the AD preclinical phase, individuals are often clinically asymptomatic despite evidence of AD neuropathology coupled with heightened inflammation. Considering the involvement of the complement system in the risk of developing AD, we hypothesize that inhibiting complement activation could reduce this inflammatory period observed even before clinical signs, thereby slowing down the onset/progression of AD. To validate our hypothesis, we injected complement inhibitor factor H into the brain of APP/PS1 AD mice at early or late stages of this pathology. Our results showed that the injection of factor H had effects on both the onset and progression of AD by reducing proinflammatory IL6, TNF-alpha, IL1 beta, MAC and amyloid beta levels. This reduction was associated with an increase in VGLUT1 and Psd95 synaptic transmission in the hippocampal region, leading to an improvement in cognitive functions. This study invites a reconsideration of factor H's therapeutic potential for AD treatment.

AB  - Incidence of opioid-related overdoses in the United States has increased dramatically over the past two decades. Despite public emphasis on overdose fatalities, most overdose cases are not fatal. Although there are case reports of amnestic syndromes and acute injury to the hippocampus following non-fatal opioid overdose, the effects of such overdoses on brain structure are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the neuroanatomical correlates of non-fatal opioid overdoses by comparing hippocampal volume in opioid use disorder (OUD) patients who had experienced an opioid overdose (OD; N = 17) with those who had not (NOD; N = 32). Voxel-based morphometry showed lower hippocampal volume in the OD group than in the NOD group, which on post hoc analysis was evident in the left but not the right hippocampus. These findings strengthen the evidence that hippocampal injury is associated with non-fatal opioid overdose, which is hypothesized to underlie overdose-related amnestic syndrome.
   Opioid-related overdoses, both fatal and non-fatal, have steadily risen in recent years. Voxel-based morphometry analyses demonstrated lower hippocampal volume in patients with opioid use disorder who had experienced an opioid overdose in their lives (OD) compared to those who had not (NOD). This study suggests that non-fatal opioid overdose is associated with hippocampal injury, which may underlie overdose-related neurocognitive consequences.image

AB  - Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) molecular chaperone is responsible for the stabilization and biological activity of a diverse set of client proteins. We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of HSP90 by 17-Demethoxy-17-allyaminogeldanmycin (17-AAG) not only reverses the glucocorticoid-induced bone loss but also enhances the basal level of bone mass in mice. Here, we investigate the potential mechanism underlying HSP90-associated osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Knockdown of HSP90 beta but not HSP90 alpha or inhibition of HSP90 by 17-AAG or NVP-BEP800 negates the protein levels of large tumor suppressor (LATS), the core kinases of Hippo signaling, resulting in the inactivation of LATS and activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), in the enhancement of osteoblastic differentiation. In contrast, genetic ablation of Lats1 in mesenchymal stem cells is sufficient to abolish the HSP90 inhibition-induced osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation. Mechanistically, HSP90 beta but not HSP90 alpha chaperones and prevents the SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (SMURF1)-mediated and ubiquitination-dependent LATS protein protea-somal degradation, whereas 17-AAG abolishes these effects of HSP90 beta. Thus, these results uncover the HSP90 beta chaperoning SMURF1-mediated LATS protein proteasomal degradation and the subsequent YAP/TAZ activation as a hitherto uncharacterized mechanism controlling osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is a Type 2 inflammatory disease associated with a significant burden on quality of life. While biological therapies have shown efficacy in randomized controlled trials, data on long-term real-world outcomes remain limited. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the clinical efficacy, safety, and treatment dynamics of biologics, particularly anti-IL-4 (dupilumab), over a five-year period at a tertiary medical center. Fifty-two patients with CRSwNP meeting the EPOS/EUFOREA eligibility criteria were included. Clinical parameters, including nasal polyp score, SNOT-22, and olfactory function, were assessed across follow-up intervals. Anti-IL-4 therapy demonstrated the most consistent and sustained improvements in all clinical parameters, with a significant proportion of patients maintaining response beyond 36 months. A subset of patients underwent interval extension of dupilumab injections without loss of efficacy. Subdomain analysis of the SNOT-22 questionnaire revealed improvements predominantly in nasal and emotional domains. Treatment response, assessed according to the EUFOREA criteria, favored anti-IL-4 over anti-IL-5 and anti-IgE. Side effects were infrequent and mostly mild. These findings support the durable effectiveness of biologics in real-world CRSwNP management and suggest that tapering down the injection intervals may be a feasible strategy for selected patients. Further studies are needed to refine treatment response definitions and optimize patient-specific therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (MSCs-exosomes) reportedly possess cardioprotective effects. This study investigated the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of MSCs-exosomes on heart failure (HF). H9c2 cells were used to establish a cardiomyocyte hypertrophy model by angiotensin II (Ang II) treatment. Isolated MSCs-exosomes were identified by transmission electron microscope and CD63 detection. Apoptosis rate was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay. Levels of inflammatory factors [interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha] and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were determined by ELISA. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins [Bax, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and caspase 3] and Hippo-Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway-related proteins [YAP, phosphor (p)-YAP, and tafazzin (TAZ)] was detected by western blotting. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy of H9c2 cells induced by Ang II was ameliorated by MSCs-exosomes treatment. MSCs-exosomes downregulated Bax and caspase 3 levels and upregulated Bcl-2 level in Ang II-induced H9c2 cells. MSCs-exosomes also reduced the levels of BNP, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in Ang II-induced H9c2 cells. Meanwhile, p-YAP was downregulated and TAZ was upregulated after MSCs-exosomes administration. In conclusion, MSCs-exosomes alleviate the apoptosis and inflammatory response of cardiomyocyte via deactivating Hippo-YAP pathway in HF.

AB  - The effect of a high glycemic diet (HGD) on brain microvasculature is a crucial, yet understudied research topic, especially in females. This study aimed to determine the transcriptomic changes in female brain hippocampal microvasculature induced by a HGD and characterize the response to a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor (sEHI) as a mechanism for increased epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) levels shown to be protective in prior models of brain injury. We fed mice a HGD or a low glycemic diet (LGD), with/without the sEHI (t-AUCB), for 12 weeks. Using microarray, we assessed differentially expressed protein-coding and noncoding genes, functional pathways, and transcription factors from laser-captured hippocampal microvessels. We demonstrated for the first time in females that the HGD had an opposite gene expression profile compared to the LGD and differentially expressed 506 genes, primarily downregulated, with functions related to cell signaling, cell adhesion, cellular metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases. The sEHI modified the transcriptome of female mice consuming the LGD more than the HGD by modulating genes involved in metabolic pathways that synthesize neuroprotective EETs and associated with a higher EETs/dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) ratio. Our findings have implications for sEHIs as promising therapeutic targets for the microvascular dysfunction that accompanies vascular dementia.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) can result in significant global rates of neonatal death or permanent neurological disability. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNA influences fundamental aspects of RNA metabolism, and m6A dysregulation is implicated in various neurological diseases. However, the biological roles and clinical significance of m6A in HIBD remain unclear. We currently evaluated the effect of HIBD on cerebral m6A methylation in RNAs in neonatal rats. The m6A dot blot assay showed a global augmentation in RNA m6A methylation post-HI. Herein, we also report on demethylase FTO, which is markedly downregulated in the hippocampus and is the main factor involved with aberrant m6A modification following HI. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq data and m6A microarray results, we found that transcripts with m6A modifications were more highly expressed overall than transcripts without m6A modifications. The overexpression of FTO resulted in the promotion of Akt/mTOR pathway hyperactivation, while simultaneously inhibiting autophagic function. This is carried out by the demethylation activity of FTO, which selectively demethylates transcripts of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), thus promoting its degradation and reduced protein expression after HI. Moreover, the synaptic and neurocognitive disorders induced by HI were effectively reversed through the overexpression of FTO in the hippocampus. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate the functional importance of FTO-dependent hippocampal m6A methylome in cognitive function and provides novel mechanistic insights into the therapeutic potentials of FTO in neonatal HIBD.

AB  - Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) is the first known G protein-coupled receptor specific for bile acids and is recognized as a new and critical target for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. It is expressed in many brain regions associated with memory such as the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Here, we hypothesize that activation of TGR5 may ameliorate streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced cognitive impairment. The mouse model of cognitive impairment was established by a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of STZ (3.0 mg/kg), and we found that TGR5 activation by its agonist INT-777 (1.5 or 3.0 mu g/mouse, ICV injection) ameliorated spatial memory impairment in the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. Importantly, INT-777 reversed STZ-induced downregulation of TGR5 and glucose usage deficits. Our results further showed that INT-777 suppressed neuronal apoptosis and improved neurogenesis which were involved in tau phosphorylation and CREB-BDNF signaling. Moreover, INT-777 increased action potential firing of excitatory pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA3 and medial prefrontal cortex of ICV-STZ groups. Taken together, these findings reveal that activation of TGR5 has a neuroprotective effect against STZ-induced cognitive impairment by modulating apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal firing in the brain and TGR5 might be a novel and potential target for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Neural plasticity was considered as the principal mechanism for learning and memory many decades ago. So our study aims to figure out the underlying mechanisms of myelin plasticity associated with learning and memory. Myelin was considered for a long time as static, inert insulator, irrelevant to learning. But recent studies showed that myelination is dynamically changed to enhance neuronal plasticity. The study was conducted on 24 rats, divided into 3 groups, with 8 rats in each: Group 1: control in cages; Group 2: control untrained; and Group 3: rats were trained using Barnez maze behavior test. The gene expression analysis for Sox10, Myrf, Nrg1, Bdnf, Serpine2 and Mbp was evaluated by qRT-PCR in hippocampus tissues with correlation assessment, and histopathological and immunohistochemistry assessment were done. The present study showed improved spatial memory with increased myelination in the trained group, in addition to high expression of Sox10, Myrf, Nrg1 and Bdnf in the trained group compared to all others (P < 0.001). Serpine2 and GFAP as markers of astrocytes showed high expression in the trained group in comparison with other groups (P < 0.001) with strong positive correlation between Serpine2 and Mbp (r = 0.76, P = 0.02). Myelin plasticity as one of the crucial learning mechanisms, was influenced by different neural and environmental signals. In addition, there was a significant role of astrocytes in promoting such myelination effect.

AB  - TDP-43 aggregation is a pathological feature of ALS and FTLD. This study demonstrates that the IKK complex promotes the degradation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 through proteasomes, and IKK beta is a major factor in TDP-43 degradation. IKK beta phosphorylates TDP-43 and significantly reduces the expression level and toxicity of the aggregation-prone TDP-43.
   Cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 in neurons is a pathological feature common to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). We demonstrate that the I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex promotes the degradation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 through proteasomes. While IKK beta is a major factor in TDP-43 degradation, IKK alpha acts as a cofactor, and NEMO functions as a scaffold for the recruitment of TDP-43 to the IKK complex. Furthermore, we identified IKK beta-induced phosphorylation sites of TDP-43 and found that phosphorylation at Thr8 and Ser92 is important for the reduction of TDP-43 by IKK. TDP-43 phosphorylation at Ser92 was detected in a pattern different from that of C-terminal phosphorylation in the pathological inclusion of ALS. IKK beta was also found to significantly reduce the expression level and toxicity of the disease-causing TDP-43 mutation. Finally, the favorable effect of IKK beta on TDP-43 aggregation was confirmed in the hippocampus of mice. IKK and the N-terminal phosphorylation of TDP-43 are potential therapeutic targets for ALS and FTLD.

AB  - CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by early-onset drug-resistant epilepsy and impaired cognitive and motor skills. CDD is caused by mutations in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), which plays a well-known role in regulating excitatory neurotransmission, while its effect on neuronal inhibition has been poorly investigated. We explored the potential role of CDKL5 in the inhibitory compartment in Cdkl5-KO male mice and primary hippocampal neurons and found that CDKL5 interacts with gephyrin and collybistin, two crucial organisers of the inhibitory postsynaptic sites. Through molecular and electrophysiological approaches, we demonstrated that CDKL5 loss causes a reduced number of gephyrin puncta and surface exposed gamma(2) subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors, impacting the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which we ascribe to a postsynaptic function of CDKL5. In line with previous data showing that CDKL5 loss impacts microtubule (MT) dynamics, we showed that treatment with pregnenolone-methyl-ether (PME), which promotes MT dynamics, rescues the above defects. The impact of CDKL5 deficiency on inhibitory neurotransmission might explain the presence of drug-resistant epilepsy and cognitive defects in CDD patients. Moreover, our results may pave the way for drug-based therapies that could bypass the need for CDKL5 and provide effective therapeutic strategies for CDD patients.

AB  - The precise neural mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of depression are largely unknown, though stress-induced brain inflammation and serotonergic plasticity are thought to be centrally involved. Moreover, we previously demonstrated that neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (NPFFR2) overexpression provokes depressive-like behaviors in mice. Here, we assess whether NPFFR2 is involved in priming of depressive-like behaviors and downregulation of serotonergic 1A receptor (5HT1AR) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. The forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT) were used to quantify depressive-like phenotypes in wild-type (WT) and NPFFR2-knockout (KO) mice. A single dose of LPS (i.p. 1 mg/kg) readily caused increases in toll-like receptor 4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha along with decreases in 5-HT1AR mRNA in the ventral hippocampus of WT mice. Furthermore, LPS treatment of WT mice increased immobility time in FST and decreased sucrose preference in SPT. In contrast, none of these effects were observed in NPFFR2-KO mice. While WT mice injected with lentiviral 5-HT1AR shRNA in the ventral hippocampus displayed an unaltered response after LPS challenge, LPS-challenged NPFFR2-KO mice displayed a profound decrease in sucrose preference when pretreated with 5-HT1AR shRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that NPFFR2 modulates LPS-induced depressive-like behavioral phenotypes by downregulating 5HT1AR in the ventral hippocampus.

AB  - L-methionine, an essential amino acid, plays a critical role in cell physiology. High intake and/or dysregulation in methionine (Met) metabolism results in accumulation of its intermediate(s) or breakdown products in plasma, including homocysteine (Hcy). High level of Hcy in plasma, hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcy), is considered to be an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases, stroke and dementias. To evoke a mild hHcy in adult male Wistar rats we used an enriched Met diet at a dose of 2 g/kg of animal weight/day in duration of 4 weeks. The study contributes to the exploration of the impact of Met enriched diet inducing mild hHcy on nervous tissue by detecting the histo-morphological, metabolomic and behavioural alterations. We found an altered plasma metabolomic profile, modified spatial and learning memory acquisition as well as remarkable histo-morphological changes such as a decrease in neurons' vitality, alterations in the morphology of neurons in the selective vulnerable hippocampal CA 1 area of animals treated with Met enriched diet. Results of these approaches suggest that the mild hHcy alters plasma metabolome and behavioural and histo-morphological patterns in rats, likely due to the potential Met induced changes in "methylation index" of hippocampal brain area, which eventually aggravates the noxious effect of high methionine intake.

AB  - Voltage-gated sodium ion channels (NaVs) are integral membrane protein complexes responsible for electrical signal conduction in excitable cells. Methods that enable selective labeling of NaVs hold potential value for understanding how channel regulation and post-translational modification are influenced during development and in response to diseases and disorders of the nervous system. We have developed chemical reagents patterned after (+)-saxitoxin (STX) - a potent and reversible inhibitor of multiple NaV isoforms - and affixed with a reactive electrophile and either a biotin cofactor, fluorophore, or 'click' functional group for labeling wild-type channels. Our studies reveal enigmatic structural effects of the probes on the potency and efficiency of covalent protein modification. Among the compounds analyzed, a STX-maleimide-coumarin derivative is most effective at irreversibly blocking Na+ conductance when applied to recombinant NaVs and endogenous channels expressed in hippocampal neurons. Mechanistic analysis supports the conclusion that high-affinity toxin binding is a prerequisite for covalent protein modification. Results from these studies are guiding the development of next-generation tool compounds for selective modification of NaVs expressed in the plasma membranes of cells.
   Trifunctional chemical probes derived from the potent shellfish poison, (+)-saxitoxin (STX), irreversibly inhibit wild-type voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs). Saxitoxin derivatives decorated with a maleimide electrophile and either biotin, a fluorescent dye, or biorthogonal-reactive group were synthesized and evaluated using whole-cell, voltage-clamp electrophysiology.**image

AB  - Febrile seizures (FS) are one of the most common seizure disorders in childhood which are classified into short and prolonged, depending on their duration. Short FS are usually considered as benign. However, epidemiological studies have shown an association between prolonged FS and temporal lobe epilepsy. The development of animal models of FS has been very useful to investigate the mechanisms and the consequences of FS. One of the most used, the "hair dryer model", has revealed that prolonged FS may lead to temporal lobe epilepsy by altering neuronal function. Several pieces of evidence suggest that Na+/ K+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase may play a role in this epileptogenic process. In this work, we found that hyperthermia-induced seizures (HIS) significantly increased the activity of Na+/ K+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase five and twenty days after hyperthermic insult, respectively. These effects were diminished in response to AMPA, D-2 dopamine A(1) and A(2A) receptors activation, respectively. Furthermore, HIS also significantly increased the protein level of the AMPA subunit GluR1. Altogether, the increased Na+/ K+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase agree well with the presence of protective mechanisms. However, the reduction in ATPase activities in the presence of NMDA and AMPA suggest an increased propensity for epileptic events in adults.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is altered during aging and under different neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Melatonin shows neurogenic and neuroprotective properties during aging and neuropathological conditions. In this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with melatonin on different markers of neurodegeneration and hippocampal neurogenesis using immunohistochemistry in the aged and neurodegenerative brains of SAMP8 mice, which is an animal model of accelerated senescence that mimics aging-related Alzheimer's pathology. Neurodegenerative processes observed in the brains of aged SAMP8 mice at 10 months of age include the presence of damaged neurons, disorganization in the layers of the brain cortex, alterations in neural processes and the length of neuronal prolongations and beta-amyloid accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus. This neurodegeneration may be associated with neurogenic responses in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of these mice, since we observed a neurogenic niche of neural stem and progenitor/precursors cells in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice. However, hippocampal neurogenesis seems to be compromised due to alterations in the cell survival, migration and/or neuronal maturation of neural precursor cells due to the neurodegeneration levels in these mice. Chronic treatment with melatonin for 9 months decreased these neurodegenerative processes and the neurodegeneration-induced neurogenic response. Noticeably, melatonin also induced recovery in the functionality of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in aged SAMP8 mice.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors like programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies have revolutionized cancer treatment, but patient response rates remain limited. Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) has emerged as a promising new immune checkpoint target. Through phage display technology using a Bactrian camel immunized with recombinant human Siglec-15, we generated six anti-Siglec-15 camelid nanobodies and constructed chimeric heavy-chain antibodies by fusing the VHH domains with human IgG-Fc. Following expression in HEK293-F cells and purification, three antibodies (S1, S5, S6) demonstrated specific binding to both human and murine Siglec-15 in ELISA and biolayer interferometry assays. In a xenograft model established by subcutaneous inoculation of NCI-H157-S15 cells into BALB/c nude mice, these antibodies showed distinct tumor targeting and significant blockade of Siglec-15 interactions with CD44, MAG, sialyl-Tn, and LRR4C ligands. All three antibodies exhibited anti-tumor effects, with S1 showing the most potent activity. S1-treated mice had significantly smaller tumor volumes and weights compared to controls. The S1, S5, and S6 treatment groups showed enhanced anti-tumor immunity, with reduced TGF-beta, IL-6, and IL-10 levels. Notably, S1 treatment significantly increased tumor-associated macrophages in tumor tissues (p < 0.05). In conclusion, S1 exhibits remarkable anti-tumor activity and has the potential to be developed as a cancer immunotherapy targeting Siglec-15.

AB  - The transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) gene is a susceptibility factor and disease modifier of frontotemporal dementia, but few studies have investigated its role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The aim of this work was to assess the impact of the TMEM106B rs1990622 (A-major risk allele; G-minor allele) on phenotypic variability of 865 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Demographic and clinical features were compared according to genotypes by additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models. Bulbar onset was overrepresented among carriers of the AA risk genotype, together with enhanced upper motor neuron involvement and poorer functional status in patients harboring at least one major risk allele (A). In a subset of 195 patients, we found that the homozygotes for the minor allele (GG) showed lower scores at the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Screen, indicating a more severe cognitive impairment, mainly involving the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-specific cognitive functions and memory. Moreover, lower motor neuron burden predominated among patients with at least one minor allele (G). Overall, we found that TMEM106B is a disease modifier of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, whose phenotypic effects encompass both sites of onset and functional status (major risk allele), motor functions (both major risk and minor alleles), and cognition (minor allele).

AB  - The adapter protein SH2B1 is recruited to neurotrophin receptors, including TrkB (also known as NTRK2), the receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Herein, we demonstrate that the four alternatively spliced isoforms of SH2B1 (SH2B1 alpha-SH2B1 delta) are important determinants of neuronal architecture and neurotrophin-induced gene expression. Primary hippocampal neurons from Sh2b1(-/-) [knockout (KO)] mice exhibit decreased neurite complexity and length, and BDNF-induced expression of the synapse-related immediate early genes Egr1 and Arc. Reintroduction of each SH2B1 isoform into KO neurons increases neurite complexity; the brain-specific delta isoform also increases total neurite length. Human obesity-associated variants, when expressed in SH2B1 delta, alter neurite complexity, suggesting that a decrease or increase in neurite branching may have deleterious effects that contribute to the severe childhood obesity and neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with these variants. Surprisingly, in contrast to SH2B1 alpha, SH2B1 beta and SH2B1 gamma, which localize primarily in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, SH2B1 delta resides primarily in nucleoli. Some SH2B1 delta is also present in the plasma membrane and nucleus. Nucleolar localization, driven by two highly basic regions unique to SH2B1 delta, is required for SH2B1 delta to maximally increase neurite complexity and BDNF-induced expression of Egr1, Arc and FosL1.

AB  - Elevated uptake of saturated fatty acid palmitic acid (PA) is associated with tumor metastasis; however, the precise mechanisms remain partially understood, hindering the development of therapy for PA-driven tumor metastasis. The Hippo-Yes-associated protein (Hippo/YAP) pathway is implicated in cancer progression. Here it is shown that a high-palm oil diet potentiates tumor metastasis in murine xenografts in part through YAP. It is found that the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC15 is a YAP-regulated gene that forms a feedback loop with YAP. Notably, PA drives the ZDHHC15-YAP feedback loop, thus enforces YAP signaling, and hence promotes tumor metastasis in murine xenografts. In addition, it is shown that ZDHHC15 associates with Kidney and brain protein (KIBRA, also known as WW- and C2 domain-containing protein 1, WWC1), an upstream component of Hippo signaling, and mediates its palmitoylation. KIBRA palmitoylation leads to its degradation and regulates its subcellular localization and activity toward the Hippo/YAP pathway. Moreover, PA enhances KIBRA palmitoylation and degradation. It is further shown that combinatorial targeting of YAP and fatty acid synthesis exhibits augmented effects against metastasis formation in mice fed with a Palm diet. Collectively, these findings uncover a ZDHHC15-YAP feedback loop as a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying PA-promoted tumor metastasis and support targeting YAP and fatty acid synthesis as potential therapeutic targets in PA-driven tumor metastasis.

AB  - Astrocytic networks and gap junctional communication mediated by connexins (Cxs) have been repeatedly implicated in seizures, epileptogenesis, and epilepsy. However, the effect of seizures on Cx expression is controversial. The present study focused on the response of Cxs to status epilepticus (SE), which is in turn an epileptogenic insult. The expression of neuronal Cx36 and astrocytic Cx30 and Cx43 mRNAs was investigated in the brain of rats in the first day after pilocarpine-induced SE. In situ hybridization revealed a progressive decrease in Cx43 and Cx30 mRNA levels, significantly marked 24 h after SE onset in neocortical areas and the hippocampus, and in most thalamic domains, whereas Cx36 mRNA did not exhibit obvious changes. Regional evaluation with quantitative real-time-RT-PCR confirmed Cx43 and Cx30 mRNA downregulation 24 h after SE, when ongoing neuronal cell death was found in the same brain regions. Immunolabeling showed at the same time point marked a decrease in Cx43, microglia activation, and interleukin-1 beta induction in some microglial cells. The data showed a transient downregulation of astroglial Cxs in the cortical and thalamic areas in which SE triggers neurodegenerative events in concomitance with microglia activation and cytokine expression. This could potentially represent a protective response of neuroglial networks to SE-induced acute damage.

AB  - The brain plays a central role in aging and longevity in diverse model organisms. Morphological and functional alteration in the aging brain elicits age-associated neuronal dysfunctions. However, the primary mechanism deteriorating the brain functions to regulate the aging process remains incompletely understood. Here, it is shown that neuronal CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP beta) escalation during aging dictates the frailty and lifespan via inactivating nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Upregulated C/EBP beta drives neuronal senescence and neuronal loss, associated with NAMPT fragmentation by active asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), leading to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) depletion. Knockout of AEP or expression of AEP-resistant NAMPT N136A mutant significantly elongates the lifespan of neuronal-specific Thy 1-C/EBP beta transgenic mice. Overexpression of the C. elegans C/EBP beta ortholog cebp-2 in neurons shortens lifespan and decreases NAD(+) levels, which are restored by feeding nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or AEP inhibitor #11a. Feeding NMN or #11a substantially ameliorates the cognitive and motor impairments of Thy 1-C/EBP beta mice and increases the life expectancy. Notably, #11a demonstrates a better therapeutic effect than NMN in improving aging phenotype in Thy 1-C/EBP beta transgenic mice, which show accelerated aging features. Hence, blockade of AEP via therapeutic intervention may provide an unprecedented strategy for fighting aging and various age-associated diseases.

AB  - Most approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are indicated for early to moderate stages and primarily target amyloid-beta or neurotransmitter systems. While these treatments may slow cognitive decline, they do not halt disease progression and are often limited by high cost and modest efficacy. Natural compounds are increasingly being explored as alternative interventions. Our previous study showed that oral administration of Avenanthramide-C (Avn-C), a natural polyphenol from oats, for 14 days from early AD stages improved cognition and reduced neuroinflammation in AD mice. To assess its long-term potential, in this study we extended Avn-C treatment to three months starting from early disease stages in 5xFAD and Tg2576 models. Sustained administration preserved recovered long-term potentiation (LTP) by maintaining AMPK activation and inhibiting caspase-3 and GSK3 beta, thereby reducing amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus. Avn-C also maintained anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing NF-kappa B-mediated proinflammatory cytokine release and preventing chronic microglial activation. This promoted microglial coverage of plaques in vivo and enhanced phagocytosis in vitro. Our findings suggest that early and sustained Avn-C treatment preserves cognitive function, modulates multiple pathological pathways, and may slow or prevent AD progression by targeting early neurodegenerative processes before irreversible damage occurs.

AB  - The gut microbiomes of non-human primates have received a great deal of attention due to their close relationship to humans. In recent years, these studies have mainly focused on the gut microbiome of wild primates, which will be helpful to understanding the evolution of primates and their gut microbiomes (e.g., gut microbiome plasticity and diet flexibility). However, there is still a lack of basic information on the gut microbiomes from wild populations. Here, we investigated the gut microbial composition (16S rRNA gene) and function (metagenome and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)) of Yunnan snub-nosed monkey populations in Weixi County, Yunnan Province, China, that had diets either completely based on wild-foraging or were regularly supplemented with human provisioned food. We found a significant difference in the gut microbiome between these two populations: the gut microbiome of the wild-foraging (no food provision) population was enriched genes involved in the detoxification of bamboo cyanide (high proportion of bamboo shoot intake) and chitin (from insect diet) digestion, while the gut microbiome of the food provisioned (e.g., fruits) wild populations were enriched genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, the gut microbiome of the wild-foraging population shared a putatively functional convergence with the gut microbiome of wild bamboo-eating pandas: such as microbes and genes involved in the cyanide detoxification. Therefore, the gut microbiome of the Yunnan snubnosed monkey displayed the potential plasticity in response to diet flexibility. Long-term food provisioning of the wild population has led to dramatic changes in gut microbial composition, function, and even antibiotic resistance. The antibiotic resistance profile for the wild Yunnan snub-nosed monkey population could be considered the baseline and an important piece of information for conservation.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Exposure to heavy metals, such as vanadium, poses an ongoing environmental and health threat, heightening the risk of neurodegenerative disorders. While several compounds have shown promise in mitigating vanadium toxicity, their efficacy is limited. Effective strategies involve targeting specific subunits of the NMDA receptor, a glutamate receptor linked to neurodegenerative conditions. The potential neuroprotective effects of ZA-II-05, an NMDA receptor antagonist, against vanadium-induced neurotoxicity were explored in this study. Organotypic rat hippocampal slices, and live mice, were used as models to comprehensively evaluate the compound's impact. Targeted in vivo fluorescence analyses of the hippocampal slices using propidium iodide as a marker for cell death was utilized. The in vivo study involved five dams, each with eight pups, which were randomly assigned to five experimental groups (n = 8 pups). After administering treatments intraperitoneally over six months, various brain regions were assessed for neuropathologies using different immunohistochemical markers. High fluorescence intensity was observed in the hippocampal slices treated with vanadium, signifying cell death. Vanadium-exposed mice exhibited demyelination, microgliosis, and neuronal cell loss. Significantly, treatment with ZA-II-05 resulted in reduced cellular death in the rat hippocampal slices and preserved cellular integrity and morphological architecture in different anatomical regions, suggesting its potential in countering vanadium-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Background: Sevoflurane is a volatile anesthetic that is widely used in pediatric anesthesia due to its low toxicity. However, whether neonatal exposure to sevoflurane induces long-lasting cognitive impairment remains unclear. It has been reported that neuronal injury is the main cause of sevoflurane-induced learning and memory disabilities in the development of brain. But, the specific mechanism is not well elucidated. The injury of synapse occurs earlier than that of neuronal cell in brain injury. The synaptic plasticity is involved in learning and memory. Methods: We compared the learning and memory ability of neonatal mice to sevoflurane for once or three times in vitro and synaptic plasticity as well as neuronal excitability in vivo. In this study, neonatal C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2 h on postnatal day 7 (P7) or once daily for 3 consecutive days (P7/8/9). The Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate the cognitive performance on P31 and P61, respectively. Theta burst stimulation-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was measured in acute hippocampal slices from P38 and P68 mice to assess the synaptic plasticity. Primary hippocampal neurons were isolated from 24-h-old mice and exposed to different doses of sevoflurane (1, 2, and 3 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration [MAC]) for 6 h to examine the neuronal excitability. Results: The results showed that compared with the control, repeated exposure to sevoflurane resulted in significant cognitive impairment in adolescent mice, while showing no effect on adult mice. Repeated exposure to sevoflurane remarkably attenuated hippocampal LTP of adolescent mice, which turned to normal in adult mice. No significant difference of LTP was observed between control mice and one-dose sevoflurane-treated mice both in adolescent and adult mice. In primary hippocampal neurons, 2 MAC and 3 MAC sevoflurane delayed neuronal excitation and dose-dependently reduced the number of evoked action potentials compared with control. These effects disappeared after a 24-h recovery. Conclusions: These data suggested that sevoflurane may impair cognitive performance and neuronal plasticity when administered repeatedly or in a high MAC during infancy, which is noticeable during adolescence but alleviates during adulthood.

AB  - Colorectal cancer is a common type of digestive tract cancer with a significant morbidity and death rate across the world, partially attributing to the metastasis-associated problems. In this study, integrative bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify genes that might contribute to colorectal cancer metastasis, and 293 genes were dramatically increased and 369 genes were decreased within colon cancer samples. Among up-regulated genes, top five genes correlated with colorectal cancer patient's prognosis were verified for expression in clinical samples and syntrophin beta 1 (SNTB1) was the most up-regulated. In vitro, SNTB1 knockdown suppresses the malignant behaviors of colorectal cancer cells, including cell viability, colony formation capacity, as well as the abilities to migrate and invade. Furthermore, SNTB1 knockdown decreased the levels of Wnt1, C-Jun, C-Myc, TCF7, and cyclin D1, and inhibited EMT in both cell lines. In vivo, SNTB1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice models. SNTB1 positively regulated Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) expression; YAP1 partially reversed the effects of SNTB1 on colorectal cancer cell phenotypes and the Wnt/beta-catenin/MYC signaling. In conclusion, SNTB1 knockdown inhibits colorectal cancer cell aggressiveness in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo through the Wnt/beta-catenin/MYC signaling; YAP1 might mediate SNTB1 functions on colorectal cancer.

AB  - AP2S1 is the sigma 2 subunit of adaptor protein 2 (AP2) that is essential for endocytosis. In this study, we investigated the potential role of AP2S1 in intracellular processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) by generating the toxic beta-amyloid peptide (A beta). We found that knockdown or overexpression of AP2S1 decreased or increased the protein levels of APP and A beta in cells stably expressing human full-length APP695, respectively. This effect was unrelated to endocytosis but involved lysosomal degradation. Morphological studies revealed that silencing of AP2S1 promoted the translocalization of APP from RAB9-positive late endosomes (LE) to LAMP1-positive lysosomes, which was paralleled by the enhanced LE-lysosome fusion. In support, silencing of vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 41 (VPS41) that is implicated in LE-lyso fusion prevented AP2S1-mediated regulation of APP degradation and translocalization. In APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of AD, AAV-mediated delivery of AP2S1 shRNA in the hippocampus significantly reduced the protein levels of APP and A beta, with the concomitant APP translocalization, LE-lyso fusion and the improved cognitive functions. Taken together, these data uncover a LE-lyso fusion mechanism in APP degradation and suggest a novel role for AP2S1 in the pathophysiology of AD.

AB  - Aging drives cognitive decline, and mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of age-induced neurodegeneration. Recently, we demonstrated that astrocytes secrete functional mitochondria (Mt), which help adjacent cells to resist damage and promote repair after neurological injuries. However, the relationship between age-dependent changes in astrocytic Mt function and cognitive decline remains poorly understood. Here, we established that aged astrocytes secret less functional Mt compared to young astrocytes. We found the aging factor C-C motif chemokine 11 (CCL11) is elevated in the hippocampus of aged mice, and that its level is reduced upon systemic administration of young Mt, in vivo. Aged mice receiving young Mt, but not aged Mt improved cognitive function and hippocampal integrity. Using a CCL11-induced aging-like model in vitro, we found that astrocytic Mt protect hippocampal neurons and enhance a regenerative environment through upregulating synaptogenesis-related gene expression and anti-oxidants that were suppressed by CCL11. Moreover, the inhibition of CCL11-specific receptor C-C chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) boosted the expression of synaptogenesis-related genes in the cultured hippocampal neurons and restored the neurite outgrowth. This study suggests that young astrocytic Mt can preserve cognitive function in the CCL11-mediated aging brain by promoting neuronal survival and neuroplasticity in the hippocampus.

AB  - Background/Aims: to determine the role of surgical stress on the formation of p53-positive and dark neurons (DN) in the hippocampus, and to examine the parallelism of their formation in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus. Methods: Simulated septoplasty was performed on 20 Wistar rats. The hippocampus and dentate gyrus (DG) were examined, in which the number of DN and p53-positive neurons was determined at 2, 4 and 6 days after surgery. In each rat, 10 brain slices were stained with antibodies to p53 protein with Meyer's haematoxylin and 10 slices were stained with Nissl toluidine blue. Hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3 and DG were studied. In the pyramidal subfield layer, the absolute number of neurons that were nuclear antibody-positive to p53 protein was counted, as well as the number of dark neurons. The counting area in each subfield was 20934 +/- 1260 mu m2. Neurons are counted using the Aperio ImageScope program. For the histological specimen analysis, the ImageJ software was used. The data obtained using cell counting methods were presented as mean +/- SE. Then, they were compared between both groups using a t-test SPSS 21software. Results: Compared with the control group (n = 5), the number of DN and p53-positive neurons increased in experimental animals at all periods. A direct relationship was obtained between the increase in the number of DN and p53-positive neurons in the hippocampal formation. Septoplasty simulation in rats results in the pathogenetic cascades onset, which, in its turn, changes the morpho-functional properties of neurons of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus and contributes to their neuroplasticity. Activation of NMDS receptors of neurons during stress apparently, initiates two ways of neuron life - the beginning of p53 protein expression and the DN formation. Both ways can finally lead to apoptosis. Conclusion: The formation of dark neurons and the expression of the p53 protein in them are most likely to be interconnected and can probably provide neuroprotective mechanisms.

AB  - The dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway leads to the aberrant activation of oncogenic YAP and TAZ, driving tumor progression. In breast cancer, this disruption promotes proliferation and metastasis. This study investigates the effects of CA3, a selective YAP inhibitor, on the proteome of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and luminal-A-like MCF7 cells. Proteomic changes were analyzed via nano-LC-MS/MS, while cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and autophagy were assessed through WST-1 assays, flow cytometry, and Western blot analyses. Bioinformatics tools were employed to identify enriched pathways. MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited an increased expression of DNA repair proteins (p < 0.05), indicating a compensatory response to maintain genomic stability. In contrast, MCF7 cells showed a downregulation of DNA repair factors (p < 0.005). Additionally, metabolic reprogramming was apparent in MCF7 cells (p < 0.001). Apoptosis assays revealed a rise in cell death, while cell cycle analysis indicated pronounced G1-phase arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells (p < 0.01). Moreover, autophagic suppression was particularly evident in MCF7 cells. This study, for the first time, provides evidence that breast cancer subtypes exhibit distinct dependencies on YAP-driven pathways, revealing potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Targeting Hippo signaling alongside DNA repair in triple-negative breast cancer or combining YAP inhibition with metabolic blockade in luminal breast cancer holds significant potential to enhance treatment efficacy.

AB  - The response of ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels to increases in free cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) is tuned by several mechanisms, including redox signaling. Three different responses to [Ca2+] have been described in RyR channels, low, moderate and high activity responses, which depend on the RyR channel protein oxidation state. Thus, reduced RyR channels display the low activity response, whereas partially oxidized channels display the moderate response and more oxidized channels, the high activity response. As described here, RyR channels from rat brain cortices or hippocampi displayed aged-related marked changes in the distribution of these channel responses; RyR channels from aged rats displayed reduced fraction of low activity channels and increased fraction of high activity channels, which would favor Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. In addition, compared with young rats, aged rats displayed learning and memory defects, with lower hit rates when tested in the Oasis maze, a dry version of the Morris water maze. Previous oral administration of N-acetylcysteine for 3 weeks prevented both the age-dependent effects on RyR channel activation by [Ca2+], and the learning and memory defects. Based on these results, it is proposed that redox-sensitive neuronal RyR channels partake in the mechanism underlying the learning and memory disruptions displayed by aged rats.

AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia that affects millions of old people. Despite significant advances in the understanding of AD pathobiology, no disease modifying treatment is available. MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) is the most abundant miRNA in the normal brain with great potency to ameliorate AD-like pathology, while it is deficient in AD brain. Herein, the authors develop a DNA nanoflowers (DFs)-based delivery system to realize exogenous supplementation of miR-124 for AD therapy. The DFs with well-controlled size and morphology are prepared, and a miR-124 chimera is attached via hybridization. The DFs are further modified with RVG29 peptide to simultaneously realize brain-blood barrier (BBB) penetration and neuron targeting. Meanwhile, Rutin, a small molecular ancillary drug, is co-loaded into the DFs structure via its intercalation into the double stranded DNA region. Interestingly, Rutin could synergize miR-124 to suppress the expression of both BACE1 and APP, thus achieving a robust inhibition of amyloid beta generation. The nanosystem could pro-long miR-124 circulation in vivo, promote its BBB penetration and neuron targeting, resulting in a significant increase of miR-124 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and robust therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Such a bio-derived therapeutic system shows promise as a biocompatible nanomedicine for AD therapy.

AB  - The intrauterine environment is a critical location for exposure to exogenous and endogenous factors that trigger metabolic changes through fetal programming. Among the external factors, chemical compounds stand out, which include caffeine, since its consumption is common among women, including during pregnancy. Thereby, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the behavioral, genetic, and biochemical parameters in the offspring of female mice treated with caffeine during pregnancy and lactation. Swiss female mice (60 days old) received tap water or caffeine at 0.3 or 1.0 mg/mL during copulation (7 days), pregnancy (21 days) and lactation (21 days). After the end of the lactation period, the offspring were divided into groups (water, caffeine 0.3 or 1.0 mg/ mL) with 20 animals (10 animals aged 30 days and 10 animals aged 60 days per group per sex). Initially, the offspring were submitted to behavioral tasks and then euthanized for genetic and biochemical analysis in the brain (cortex, striatum, and hippocampus). Behavioral changes in memory, depression, and anxiety were observed in the offspring: 30-day-old female offspring at 1.0 mg /mL dose presented anxiogenic behavior and male offspring the 0.3 mg/mL dose at 30 days of age did not alter long-term memory. Furthermore, an increase in DNA damage and oxidative stress in the brain were observed in the offspring of both sexes. Furthermore, there were changes in Ape-1, BAX, and Bcl-2 in the female offspring hippocampus at 30 days of life. Thus, with this study, we can suggest genotoxicity, oxidative stress, and behavioral changes caused by caffeine during pregnancy and lactation in the offspring that were not treated directly, but received through their mothers; thus, it is important to raise awareness regarding caffeine consumption among pregnant and lactating females.

AB  - Simple Summary Alpacas have a quite recent history in Europe. Only in the 1990's were a considerable number of alpacas imported into the UK and then into continental Europe, where the number of animals increased significantly. This development has necessitated a more thorough knowledge of infectious diseases in alpaca husbandry. One of the most serious infectious diseases in alpacas is caseous lymphadenitis (CLA), which is caused by Corynebacterium (C.) pseudotuberculosis. As shown by the post-mortem examinations in this study, CLA is characterized by the formation of multiple, visible abscesses, particularly affecting the lungs and liver as the pathogen spreads throughout the body. While post-mortem examinations and isolation of the pathogen are pivotal for a proven diagnosis, serological examinations are the basis of epidemiological and monitoring studies. We examined 232 alpacas living in three independent herds for this current study. C. pseudotuberculosis was able to be isolated in several alpacas. All of the alpacas were tested serologically using a commercially available ELISA, an in-lab ELISA, and, in select animals, immunoblot. The immunoblot showed the highest sensitivity in the early phase of the infection in alpacas proven to be infected with C. pseudotuberculosis. Testing for antimicrobial susceptibility based on minimal inhibitory concentration using the broth microdilution method revealed uniform susceptibility to aminopenicillins, cephalosporines, macrolides, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tetracycline, sulfonamid/trimethoprime, tiamulin, gentamicin, neomycin, spectinomycin, and vancomycin, but resistance to colistin, nitrofurantoin, and oxacillin. The present study shows that C. pseudotuberculosis poses an imminent health risk for alpaca husbandry. Laboratory diagnostics based on post-mortem, bacteriological and serological examinations are valuable tools for implementing specific measures as a basis for tackling this infectious disease in alpaca herds. Alpacas are the major camelid species in Europe held for hobbies, animal-aided therapy, and commercial reasons. As a result, health-related issues associated with alpacas are of growing significance. This especially holds true for one of the most serious infectious diseases, caseous lymphadenitis, which is caused by the bacterial pathogen Corynebacterium (C.) pseudotuberculosis. Our study focuses on post-mortem examinations, the laboratory diagnostic tool ELISA, and the immunoblot technique for the detection of specific antibodies against C. pseudotuberculosis and detection of the causative pathogen in alpaca herds. We examined a total of 232 alpacas living in three herds. Four of these alpacas were submitted for post-mortem examination, revealing abscesses, apostematous and fibrinous inflammation in inner organs, pleura, and peritoneum. Serological investigation using a commercial ELISA based on phospholipase D (PLD) as antigen and an in-lab ELISA based on whole cell antigens (WCA) revealed an overall seroprevalence of 56% and 61.2%, respectively. A total of 247 alpaca sera originating from 232 animals were tested comparatively using the in-lab and the commercial ELISA and showed a substantial degree of agreement, of 89.5% (Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.784), for both tests. Further comparative serological studies using the two ELISAs and the immunoblot technique were carried out on selected sera originating from 12 breeding stallions and six breeding mares for which epidemiological data and partial C. pseudotuberculosis isolates were available.
   The results showed the immunoblot to have a sensitivity that was superior to both ELISAs. In this context, it should be emphasized that evaluation of these investigations and the epidemiological data suggest an incubation period of one to two months. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of 13 C. pseudotuberculosis isolates based on the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations using the broth microdilution method revealed uniform susceptibility to aminopenicillins, cephalosporines, macrolides, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tetracycline, sulfonamid/trimethoprime, tiamulin, gentamicin, neomycin, spectinomycin, and vancomycin, but resistance to colistin, nitrofurantoin, and oxacillin.

AB  - Background Allergic diseases induced by dust have seriously threatened human health, while Bactrian camels can live in a sandy environment for a long time. Objective To prepare rabbit anti-Bactrian camel IgE antibody and explore the distribution characteristics of IgE(+) secretory cells in the palatine tonsils, which lays a theoretical foundation for the distribution of local antibodies in the palatal tonsils of Bactrian camel and the study of immune function. Methods In this study, the amino acid sequences of Bactrian camel IgE, IgA, IgM and IgG heavy chain constant regions were compared, and a specific IgE gene fragment were selected (447 bp). The recombinant plasmid pET-28a-IgE was induced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by IPTG and its expression conditions were optimized. The antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with purified IgE recombinant protein, its titer and specificity were detected by indirect ELISA and Western blotting. Immunohistochemical and statistical methods investigated the distribution of IgE(+) secretory cells in the palatine tonsils. Results The IgE recombinant protein was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies with a size of 16 kDa. The optimal IPTG induction concentration was 0.7 mmol/L and the induction time was 8 h. The titer of the antibody was 1:16000 by ELISA, and the antibody could specifically bind to the recombinant protein by Western blotting. IgE(+) secretory cells were mainly distributed in the subepithelial compartments of reticulated crypt epithelium of the palatine tonsil of the Bactrian camel, followed by the subepithelial compartments of stratified squamous epithelium and occasionally in the extrafollicular region. Conclusion The rabbit anti-Bactrian camel IgE polyclonal antibody was successfully prepared. It is confirmed that IgE exists in the palatine tonsils of Bactrian camels under normal living conditions. In addition, IgE(+) secretory cells are mainly distributed in the subepithelial compartments of reticulated crypt epithelium of the palatine tonsil, which is consistent with the distribution characteristics of IgG(+) and sIgA(+) secretory cells in the palatal tonsils of the Bactrian camel.

AB  - Whole-body exposure to high-energy particle radiation remains an unmitigated hazard to human health in space. Ongoing experiments at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory and elsewhere repeatedly show persistent changes in brain function long after exposure to simulations of this unique radiation environment, although, as is also the case with proton radiotherapy sequelae, how this occurs and especially how it interacts with common comorbidities is not well-understood. Here, we report modest differential changes in behavior and brain pathology between male and female Alzheimer's-like and wildtype littermate mice 7-8 months after exposure to 0, 0.5, or 2 Gy of 1 GeV proton radiation. The mice were examined with a battery of behavior tests and assayed for amyloid beta pathology, synaptic markers, microbleeds, microglial reactivity, and plasma cytokines. In general, the Alzheimer's model mice were more prone than their wildtype littermates to radiation-induced behavior changes, and hippocampal staining for amyloid beta pathology and microglial activation in these mice revealed a dose-dependent reduction in males but not in females. In summary, radiation-induced, long-term changes in behavior and pathology, although modest, appear specific to both sex and the underlying disease state.

AB  - Background Household air pollution (HAP) from polluting cooking fuels, a rampant issue in rural India, is suspected to be a significant modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment; however, evidence supported by neuroimaging in this population, is lacking. Methods Baseline cross-sectional data (n = 4145) of participants aged >= 45 years from the ongoing Centre for Brain Research-Srinivaspura Aging, Neuro Senescence, and COGnition (CBR-SANSCOG) study in a rural South Indian aging population, was utilised. HAP exposure was proxied via polluting cooking fuel or technology use (only clean vs. at least one polluting vs. only polluting cooking technology use). Global and domain-specific cognitive functioning was assessed using computerised culturally adapted test batteries. A subset (n = 994) underwent brain MRI (3T) to estimate regional brain volumes and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) burden. Fully adjusted linear regression models were used to test the associations between HAP exposure, cognition, and brain MRI parameters. Findings Only polluting cooking technology users had significantly lower scores in global cognition (beta(std.) = -0.28 [-0.44, -0.11], p(adj) [FDR corrected p-value] = 0.002), visuospatial ability (beta(std.) = -0.28 [-0.48, -0.08], p(adj.) = 0.013), and executive functions (beta(std.) = -0.25 [-0.44, -0.07], p(adj.) = 0.019), whereas at least one polluting cooking technology users had lower scores in global cognition only (beta(std.) = -0.10 [-0.15, -0.04], p(adj.) <0.001), compared to the clean cooking technology users. Upon sex-stratification, only female polluting cooking technology users had lower global cognitive scores (beta(std.) = -0.11 [-0.20, -0.03], p(adj.) = 0.018) and lower hippocampus volumes (beta(std.) = -0.18 [-0.35, -0.01], p = 0.030). Interpretation Polluting cooking technology users may be at a higher risk for cognitive impairment. Rural females, who tend to be more exposed than males, could have greater vulnerability to HAP's adverse effects on the brain. Policies promoting clean cooking fuel/technology adoption are imperative.

AB  - The follicle is the basic structural and functional unit of the ovary in female mammals. The excessive depletion of follicles will lead to diminished ovarian reserve or even premature ovarian failure, resulting in diminished ovarian oogenesis and endocrine function. Excessive follicular depletion is mainly due to loss of primordial follicles. Our analysis of published human ovarian single-cell sequencing results by others revealed a significant increase in rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) expression during primordial follicle development. However, the role of ROCK1 in primordial follicle development and maintenance is not clear. This study revealed a gradual increase in ROCK1 expression during primordial follicle activation. Inhibition of ROCK1 resulted in reduced primordial follicle activation, decreased follicular reserve, and delayed development of growing follicles. This effect may be achieved through the HIPPO pathway. The present study indicates that ROCK1 is a key molecule for primordial follicular reserve and follicular development.

AB  - Hypoxic preconditioning can protect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the underlying mechanisms that mediate this effect are not completely clear. In this study, mice were pretreated with continuous, intermittent hypoxic preconditioning; 1 hour later, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion models were generated by middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. Compared with control mice, mice with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury showed increased Bederson neurological function scores, significantly increased cerebral infarction volume, obvious pathological damage to the hippocampus, significantly increased apoptosis; upregulated interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 levels in brain tissue; and increased expression levels of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), NLRP inflammasome-related protein caspase-1, and gasdermin D. However, hypoxic preconditioning significantly inhibited the above phenomena. Taken together, these data suggest that hypoxic preconditioning mitigates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome expression. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Fourth Hospital of Baotou, China (approval No. DWLL2019001) in November 2019.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of drug-resistant epilepsy. Lowering the levels of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) ligands has been suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy for TLE. d-Serine gates synaptic NMDARs in the hippocampus but the effect of d-serine on seizure activity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that serine levels in the hippocampus were increased in persons with TLE and in a mouse model of TLE. Eliminating d-serine or blocking its binding with NMDARs suppressed seizures in mouse models. Astrocyte-derived l-serine was found to regulate interstitial d-serine levels and seizure activity through a process controlled by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH). We identified a potent PSPH inhibitor, Z218484536, and found that its systemic administration reduced spontaneous epileptic discharges in mouse and cynomolgus monkey models of TLE. Overall, these results indicate that PSPH is a promising therapeutic target for TLE and support further preclinical studies of Z218484536.

AB  - Expression of camelid-derived, single-domain antibodies (V(H)Hs) within the cytoplasm of mammalian cells as "intrabodies" has opened up novel avenues for medical countermeasures against fast-acting biothreat agents. In this report, we describe a heterodimeric intrabody that renders Vero cells virtually impervious to ricin toxin (RT), a potent Category B ribosome-inactivating protein. The intrabody consists of two structurally defined V(H)Hs that target distinct epitopes on RT's enzymatic subunit (RTA): V9E1 targets RTA's P-stalk recruitment site, and V2A11 targets RTA's active site. Resistance to RT conferred by the biparatopic VHH construct far exceeded that of either of the V(H)Hs alone and effectively inhibited all measurable RT-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. We propose that the targeted delivery of bispecific intrabodies to lung tissues may represent a novel means to shield the airways from the effects of inhalational RT exposure.

AB  - Flavonoids such as sterubin and fisetin-and derivatives thereof-show strong neuroprotective effects in vitro as well as in vivo, combined with negligible toxicity and can therefore be considered novel treatment options for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, their subcellular locations responsible for neuroprotection and exact modes of action still remain unclear. Here, we present chemical probes based on both flavonoids sterubin and fisetin that were utilized in fluorescence microscopy and click-correlative light and electron microscopy to detect and visualize the localization of specific intracellular targets. We successfully adapted the workflow of correlative light and electron microscopy to a click-chemistry-based approach in a murine hippocampal cell line (HT22) on ultrathin resin sections making visualization of a small molecule for the first time possible in this setup. Utilizing this newly adapted technique, we could demonstrate that sterubin and fisetin show specific enrichment in the endoplasmic reticulum.

AB  - Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is characterized by poorer prognosis of patients and limited thera-peutic approach, partly due to the lack of effective target. Using mouse models and tumor organoids, this study reported a tripartite motif 21 (TRIM21) protein, exerting potential inhibitory effects on the inva-sion and metastasis of CRC. Mechanistically, TRIM21 directly interacted with and ubiquitinated MST2 at lysine 473 (K473) via K63-linkage. This ubiquitination enabled the formation of MST2 homodimer and enhanced its kinase activity, ultimately resulting in the functional inactivation of yes-associated protein (YAP) and inhibition of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) feature. We identified that vilazodone, an antidepressant, directly bound to TRIM21 to exert effective anti-metastatic action both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these findings revealed a previously unrecognized interplay between TRIM21 and the Hippo-YAP signaling. These results suggested that vilazodone could be repositioned as an anti-tumor drug to inhibit CRC metastasis by targeting TRIM21.

AB  - BackgroundLysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a simple bioactive lysophospholipid, has been reported to regulate bone homeostasis and bone remodeling. This study aimed to elucidate the function and intrinsic mechanism of LPA in osseointegration in murine models.MethodWe constructed immediate implant models in murine maxillae. Micro-CT, H&E staining, and PCR assays were performed to evaluate the effects of LPA on osseointegration. Furthermore, Prx1-Cre;Yapf/f mice and Sp7-Cre;Yapf/f mice were generated to investigate the role of YAP on LPA-induced osseointegration.ResultIn this study, we identified that LPA might promote bone deposition on the tissue-implant interface and improve osseointegration. In addition, conditional knockout of YAP from MCSs and pre-osteoblasts blunts LPA-induced osteogenesis and osseointegration in mice.ConclusionOur data demonstrated that LPA-YAP signaling is particularly important to regulate osseointegration, which expands our understanding of LPA and provide the potential of LPA to be used in osseointegration.

   The structure and behaviour of individual muscles greatly influence an animal's ability to move and perform tasks. Experimental investigation of how muscles function within a living animal can be difficult, providing insight on limited aspects for few muscles. Computer models of the musculoskeletal system can partly overcome this challenge, and provide valuable insight into features not easily (if at all) measurable in experiments alone. Here a detailed three-dimensional musculoskeletal model of the hindlimb of a small ground bird, a tinamou, is combined with experimental motion and force data for walking and running, and used to explore muscle function during these gaits. Feeding experimental data into the model, a simulation is used to estimate muscle activity, and the pattern of change in their constituent fibres. Fibre length change is an important determinant of muscle function because the amount of force that can be produced varies with the amount and rate of contraction or stretch. For the first time, patterns of fibre length change in every key muscle of the bird hindlimb have been studied, broadening understanding of muscle function across the diversity of modern animals. The results also have bearing on how muscle function is reconstructed for extinct animals (e.g., dinosaurs).
   The arrangement and physiology of muscle fibres can strongly influence musculoskeletal function and whole-organismal performance. However, experimental investigation of muscle function during in vivo activity is typically limited to relatively few muscles in a given system. Computational models and simulations of the musculoskeletal system can partly overcome these limitations, by exploring the dynamics of muscles, tendons and other tissues in a robust and quantitative fashion. Here, a high-fidelity, 26-degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model was developed of the hindlimb of a small ground bird, the elegant-crested tinamou (Eudromia elegans, similar to 550 g), including all the major muscles of the limb (36 actuators per leg). The model was integrated with biplanar fluoroscopy (XROMM) and forceplate data for walking and running, where dynamic optimization was used to estimate muscle excitations and fibre length changes throughout both gaits. Following this, a series of static simulations over the total range of physiological limb postures were performed, to circumscribe the bounds of possible variation in fibre length. During gait, fibre lengths for all muscles remained between 0.5 to 1.21 times optimal fibre length, but operated mostly on the ascending limb and plateau of the active force-length curve, a result that parallels previous experimental findings for birds, humans and other species. However, the ranges of fibre length varied considerably among individual muscles, especially when considered across the total possible range of joint excursion. Net length change of muscle-tendon units was mostly less than optimal fibre length, sometimes markedly so, suggesting that approaches that use muscle-tendon length change to estimate optimal fibre length in extinct species are likely underestimating this important parameter for many muscles. The results of this study clarify and broaden understanding of muscle function in extant animals, and can help refine approaches used to study extinct species.

AB  - Background The pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) is closely associated with cellular oxidative stress which can result in the accumulation of toxic proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading to ER stress and subsequent unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling, a mechanism that aggravate these disorders. Vitamin D has been suggested to have important neuroprotective role and its administration has been shown to reduce neuronal injury, neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in various animal systems. Objective The current study was undertaken to examine the effect of vitamin D-3 on UPR in ER stress induced Mus musculus neuronal cells. Methods Mus musculus cortical and hippocampal primary neuronal cultures were pretreated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1, 25-(OH)(2)D-3), the active form of vitamin D, followed by ER stress induction with a chemical ER stress inducer thapsigargin and with an advanced glycated protein, AGE-BSA. The UPR genes and related microRNAs (miRNA) expressions were analyzed mainly using real-time PCR. Results The experiment resulted in the suppression of ER stress marker BiP and UPR pathway genes such as Perk, Ire1 alpha, Chop and Puma which mediate cellular apoptosis indicating the protective effect of 1, 25-(OH)(2)D-3 against neuronal ER stress. Further studies into the molecular aspects showed that ER stress mediated down-regulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) such as mmu-miR-24, 27b, 124, 224, 290, 351 and 488 which are known to regulate the UPR pathway genes were also reduced with vitamin pretreatment, of which the miRNAs miR-24 and 27b which shares the same cluster are potentially involved in various human diseases. Conclusion This study emphasizes the therapeutic role of vitamin D in reducing neuronal ER stress and the need for maintaining sufficient amount of this vitamin in our diet.

AB  - Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) has been implicated in several types of neuroplasticity phe-nomena. Interferon beta-1b (IFN-8) increases MHC-I expression by motoneurons after sciatic nerve crush in mice, improving axonal growth and functional recovery. Additionally, IFN-8 induces glial hypertrophy associated with upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and MHC-I in murine astrocytes in vitro. As knowledge about MHC-I and its role in synaptic plasticity in human astrocytes (HAs) is scarce, we investigated these aspects in mature HAs obtained from the neocortex of patients undergoing surgery due to hippocampal sclerosis. Cells were exposed to media in the absence (0 IU/ml) or presence of IFN-8 for 5 days (500 IU/ml). Beta-2 microglobulin (82m), a component of the MHC-I, GFAP and vimentin proteins, was quantified by flow cytometry (FC) and increased by 100%, 60% and 46%, respectively, after IFN-8 exposure. We also performed qRT-PCR gene expression analyses for 82m, GFAP, vimentin, and pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Our data showed that IFN-8-treated astrocytes displayed 82m and GFAP gene upregulation. Additionally, they presented a proin-flammatory profile with increase in the IL-6 and IL-18 genes and a tendency to upregulate TNF-a. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of HAs conditioned medium (CM) on the formation/maintenance of neurites/synapses by the PC12 lineage. Synaptophysin protein expression was quantified by FC. The CM of IFN-8-activated astrocytes was not harmful to PC12 neurites, and there was no change in synaptophysin protein expression. Therefore, IFN-8 activated HAs by increasing GFAP, vimentin and MHC-I protein expression. Like MHC-I modulation and astro-cyte activation may be protective after peripheral nerve damage and in some neurodegenerative conditions, this study opens perspectives on the pathophysiological roles of astroglial MHC-I in the human CNS.

AB  - Light at night (LAN) induced cognitive impairment associated with oxidative stress in mice has been reported. Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) exhibits anti-tumor, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective effects, yet the neuroprotective effect on light-induced neuron damage still unclear. Here, mice exposed to LAN displayed cognitive impairment and depressive like behavior, which was reversed by LBP treatment. Meanwhile, LBP alleviated light-induced higher apoptosis and mitochondrial damage in HT-22 cells. Also, LBP prevented the decreased of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) level in light-treated cells. Additionally, LBP demonstrated its antioxidant potential by reducing ROS production and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, while simultaneously enhancing the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidases (GSH-Px) in both light-treated mice and HT-22 cells. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), heme oxygenease-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) were decreased in both light-treated mice and cells. Additionally, LBP treatment reversed light-induced the inhibition of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in both mice and cells. Moreover, Nrf2 antagonist ML385 significantly eliminated the neuroprotection of LBP on cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in light-treated cells. These results indicate that LBP can rescue light-induced neurotoxicity in mice and HT-22 cells by activating the Nrf2/ HO-1 signaling pathway.

KW  - CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Yuping Tongqiao Tablets is a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula commonly employed in China for managing various ailments, especially allergic conditions. Clinical reports indicate its potential as an effective treatment for persistent allergic rhinitis. Nevertheless, there remains a dearth of placebo-controlled studies to definitively establish its safety and efficacy. Aims of the study: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a global health problem with an annually increasing prevalence and no radical cure to date. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Yuping Tongqiao tablets for the treatment of persistent allergic rhinitis and to provide a basis for using Chinese herbal medicine to treat AR. Materials and methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with PAR. A total of 540 patients with PAR were randomly assigned to the test group (n = 360) or the placebo group (n = 180) at a 2:1 ratio. The clinical trial lasted for 4 weeks, evaluating various outcomes including total nasal symptom scores, rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) scores, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) symptom scores and The incidence of adverse events. Results: A total of 768 participants were enrolled, with 540 randomized and 516 successfully completed the research. The experimental group using Yuping Tongqiao tablets showed a significant reduction in TNSS, with the least squares mean of the average decrease being -2.56 points, compared to -1.74 points in the placebo group (p < 0.01). The experimental group exhibited a higher nasal symptom response rate at 4 weeks, substantial clinical improvements, and notable enhancements in TCM symptoms and RQLQ scores. Treatment efficacy increased with duration, and adverse events were mild-to-moderate and occurred at similar rates in both groups. Conclusion: Yuping Tongqiao tablets have been proven to be an effective and safe medication for the treatment of PAR.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression and contribute to all aspects of cellular function. We previously reported that the activities of several mitochondria-enriched miRNAs regulating inflammation (i.e., miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, and miR-146a) are altered in the hippocampus at 3-12 hours following a severe traumatic brain injury. In the present study, we investigated the temporal expression profile of these inflammatory miRNAs in mitochondria and cytosol fractions at more chronic post-injury times following severe controlled cortical impact injury in rats. In addition, several inflammatory genes were analyzed in the cytosol fractions. The analysis showed that while elevated levels were observed in cytoplasm, the mitochondria-enriched miRNAs, miR-142-3p and miR-142-5p continued to be significantly reduced in mitochondria from injured hippocampi for at least 3 days and returned to near normal levels at 7 days post-injury. Although not statistically significant, miR-146a also remained at reduced levels for up to 3 days following controlled cortical impact injury, and recovered by 7 days. In contrast, miRNAs that are not enriched in mitochondria, including miR-124a, miR-150, miR-19b, miR-155, and miR-223 were either increased or demonstrated no change in their levels in mitochondrial fractions for 7 days. The one exception was that miR-223 levels were reduced in mitochondria at 1 day following injury. No major alterations were observed in sham operated animals. This temporal pattern was unique to mitochondria-enriched miRNAs and correlated with injury-induced changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics as well as expression levels of several inflammatory markers. These observations suggested a potential compartmental re-distribution of the mitochondria-enriched inflammatory miRNAs and may reflect an intracellular mechanism by which specific miRNAs regulate injury-induced inflammatory signaling. To test this, we utilized a novel peptide-based nanoparticle strategy for in vitro and in vivo delivery of a miR-146a mimic as a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting nuclear factor-kappaB inflammatory modulators in the injured brain. Nanoparticle delivery of miR-146a to BV-2 or SH-SY5Y cells significantly reduced expression of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), two important modulators of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) pro-inflammatory pathway. Moreover, injections of miR-146a containing nanoparticles into the brain immediately following controlled cortical impact injury significantly reduced hippocampal TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 levels. Taken together, our studies demonstrate the subcellular alteration of inflammatory miRNAs after traumatic brain injury and establish proof of principle that nanoparticle delivery of miR-146a has therapeutic potential for modulating pro-inflammatory effectors in the injured brain. All of the studies performed were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee (IACUC protocol # 2014-1300) on August 17, 2017.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance: Platycladus orientalis seeds are recorded in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations for modulation of mood and physical activity in "Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing" and "Compendium of Materia Medica" and so on. Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. Aim of the study: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. Materials and methods: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. Conclusions: We demonstrated that S4 was a potential inhibitor of MAO reuptake that could rescue depression in a CUMS-model rats by restoring monoamine neurotransmitters in different encephalic regions.

AB  - Children who survive cardiac arrest often develop debilitating sensorimotor and cognitive deficits. In animal models of cardiac arrest, delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region has served as a fruitful paradigm for investigating mechanisms of injury and neuroprotection. Cardiac arrest in humans, however, is more prolonged than in most experimental models. Consequently, neurologic deficits in cardiac arrest survivors arise from injury not solely to CA1 but to multiple vulnerable brain structures. Here, we develop a rat model of prolonged pediatric asphyxial cardiac arrest and resuscitation, which better approximates arrest characteristics and injury severity in children. Using this model, we characterize features of microglial activation and neuronal degeneration in the thalamus 24 h after resuscitation from 11 and 12 min long cardiac arrest. In addition, we test the effect of mild hypothermia to 34 degrees C for 8 h after 12.5 min of arrest. Microglial activation and neuronal degeneration are most prominent in the thalamic Reticular Nucleus (nRT). The severity of injury increases with increasing arrest duration, leading to frank loss of nRT neurons at longer arrest times. Hypothermia does not prevent nRT injury. Interestingly, injury occurs selectively in intermediate and posterior nRT segments while sparing the anterior segment. Since all nRT segments consist exclusively of GABA-ergic neurons, we asked if GABA-ergic neurons in general are more susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic injury. Surprisingly, cortical GABA-ergic neurons, like their counterparts in the anterior nRT segment, do not degenerate in this model. Hence, we propose that GABA-ergic identity alone is not sufficient to explain selective vulnerability of intermediate and posterior nRT neurons to hypoxic-ischemic injury after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Our current findings align the animal model of pediatric cardiac arrest with human data and suggest novel mechanisms of selective vulnerability to hypoxic-ischemic injury among thalamic GABA-ergic neurons.

AB  - Functional characterization of peptide fraction (PF) from snake venom has provided novel opportunities to investigate possible neuroprotective compounds relevant to pharmaceuticals. This study was performed to investigate the PF-mediated neuroprotection obtained from Naja mandalayensis snake venom, a member of the Elapidae family, using two neuronal cell lines, undifferentiated PC12 and differentiated mHippoE-18, in response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Cells were pre-treated for 4 h with PF (10, 1, 0.01, and 0.001 mu g mL-1), and thereafter exposed to H2O2 (0.5 mmol L-1) for 20 h. Then, the oxidative stress markers and label-free differential proteome strategy were analyzed to understand the neuroprotective effects of PF. In PC12 cells, PF showed no neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress. In mHippoE-18 cells, PF at 0.01 and 0.001 mu g mL-1 increased the viability and metabolism of cells against H2O2-induced neurotoxicity, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Interestingly, PF also exhibited a substantial reduction in baseline ROS levels compared to the control, indicating that PF could have compounds with antioxidant features. The comparative proteomic profiling identified 53 proteins with differential expression related to antioxidant action, catalysis, molecular function regulators, structural molecule activity, translation regulatory activity, ATP, and binding. The PF + H2O2 group indicated that protein expression is 6% upregulated, 4% downregulated, and 94% unchanged compared to the H2O2 group. Three significant proteins upregulated in the PF + H2O2 group, including elongation factor 2 (P58252), proteasome subunit alpha type (E9Q0X0), and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (A0A338P786), suggested that PF-mediated neuroprotection happens through translational regulation and the degradation of defective proteins via the proteasome complex. Additionally, differential protein expression in PF changed the metabolism, protein synthesis, synaptic activity, and intracellular transport, suggesting that PF contains the rich mixture of bioactive peptides of interest pharmacologically. Overall, this study offers new opportunities for evaluating whether PF's neuroprotective features in specific neuronal cells are maintained and to investigate neurodegenerative disease drug development processes.

AB  - Alveolar bone loss is a main manifestation of periodontitis. Human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are considered as optimal seed cells for alveolar bone regeneration due to its mesenchymal stem cell like properties. Osteogenic potential is the premise for PDLSCs to repair alveolar bone loss. However, the mechanism regulating osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs remain elusive. In this study, we identified Neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 (NOR1), was particularly expressed in PDL tissue in vivo and gradually increased during osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs in vitro. Knockdown of NOR1 in hPDLSCs inhibited their osteogenic potential while NOR1 overexpression reversed this effect. In order to elucidate the downstream regulatory network of NOR1, RNA-sequencing was used. We found that downregulated genes were mainly enriched in TGF-beta, Hippo, Wnt signaling pathway. Further, by western blot analysis, we verified that the expression level of phosphorylated-SMAD2/3 and phosphorylated-SMAD4 were all decreased after NOR1 knockdown. Additionally, ChIP-qPCR and dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that NOR1 could bind to the promoter of TGFBR1 and regulate its activity. Moreover, overexpression of TGFBR1 in PDLSCs could rescue the damaged osteogenic potential after NOR1 knockdown. Taken together, our results demonstrated that NOR1 could activate TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway and positively regulates the commitment of osteoblast lineages of PDLSCs by targeting TGFBR1 directly.

AB  - Background: Age -related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic retinal disease that significantly influences the vision of the elderly. Purpose: There is no effective treatment and prevention method. The pathogenic process behind AMD is complex, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and neovascularization. It has been demonstrated that several natural products can be used to manage AMD, but systematic summaries are lacking. Study Design and Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using the keywords "Biological Products" AND "Macular Degeneration" for studies published within the last decade until May 2023 to summarize the latest findings on the prevention and treatment of age -related macular degeneration through the herbal medicines and functional foods. Results: The eligible studies were screened, and the relevant information about the therapeutic action and mechanism of natural products used to treat AMD was extracted. Our findings demonstrate that natural substances, including retinol, phenols, and other natural products, prevent the development of new blood vessels and protect the retina from oxidative stress in cells and animal models. However, they have barely been examined in clinical studies. Conclusion: Natural products could be highly prospective candidate drugs used to treat AMD, and further preclinical and clinical research is required to validate it to control the disease.

AB  - We previously showed a hydroxamic acid-based histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), compound 13, provides neuroprotection against chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) both in vitro under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions and in vivo under bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) conditions. Intriguingly, the protective effect of this HDACi is via H3K14 or H4K5 acetylation-mediated differential BDNF isoform activation. BDNF is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in development, synaptic plasticity and in learning and memory related with receptors or synaptic proteins. B6 mice underwent BCCAO and were randomized into 4 groups; a sham without BCCAO (sham), BCCAO mice injected with DMSO (DMSO), mice injected with HDACi-compound 13 (compound 13) and mice injected with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). The cortex and hippocampus of mice were harvested at 3 months after BCCAO, and levels of BDNF, AMPA receptor and dopamine receptors (D1, D2 and D3) were studied using Western blotting analysis or immunohistochemistry. We found that the AMPA receptor plays a key role in the molecular mechanism of this process by modulating HDAC. This protective effect of HDACi may be through BDNF; therefore, activation of this downstream signalling molecule, for example by AMPA receptors, could be a therapeutic target or intervention applied under CCH conditions.

AB  - Changes in the transcriptome are critical in shaping the structural plasticity of neurons, which underpins learning and long-term memory storage. Here, we explored the effect of two opposing, plasticity-associated pathways-cAMP second-messenger signaling and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1 and mGluR5) signaling-on the transcriptome in hippocampal neurons and how these pathways operate in distinct and coordinated manners to induce structural changes. Integration of transcriptome data and molecular pathway analysis identified central "hub" genes that were rapidly induced by cAMP and/or mGluR1/5 in hippocampal neurons. These included the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Gas5, whose expression was induced specifically by cAMP and which was targeted to dendrites by the kinesin motor protein KIF1A. In the dendrites, Gas5 interacted with various proteins and coding and noncoding RNAs associated with synaptic function and plasticity, and these interactions were altered by cAMP signaling. Gas5 interacted with the microRNA miR-26a-5p and sequestered it from several of its mRNA targets associated with neuronal function and whose translation was induced by cAMP. Gas5 was critical for excitatory synaptic transmission induced by cAMP but not those induced by mGluR1/5. Furthermore, Gas5 deficiency impaired dendritic branching and synapse morphology, and Gas5 abundance was decreased in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Together, these findings provide insight into the transcriptional networks involved in synaptic plasticity and a lncRNA interactome that mediates dendritically localized regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal architecture.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory impairment in patients. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been reported to stimulate neurogenesis. This study was conducted to determine the regenerative effects of EPO in an AD model and to assess its underlying mechanism. Recombinant human EPO was intraperitoneally administered to AD mice induced by intracerebroventricular A beta oligomer injection. Behavioral assessments with novel object recognition test and passive avoidance task showed improvement in memory function of the EPO-treated AD mice compared to that of the saline-treated AD mice (p < 0.0001). An in vivo protein assay for the hippocampus and cortex tissue indicated that EPO treatment modulated neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and adrenaline. EPO treatment also restored the activity of serotonin receptors, including 5-HT4R, 5-HT7R, and 5-HT1aR (p < 0.01), at mRNA levels. Furthermore, EPO seemed to exert an anti-inflammatory influence by downregulating TLR4 at mRNA and protein levels (p < 0.05). Finally, an immunohistochemical assay revealed increments of Nestin(+) and NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the CA3 region in the EPO-treated AD mice compared to those in the saline-treated AD mice. The conclusion is that EPO administration might be therapeutic for AD by activating the serotonergic pathway, anti-inflammatory action, and neurogenic characteristics.

AB  - Rehmannia glutinosa polysaccharide (RGP) has been reported to exhibit anti-anxiety effects, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Chronic constant light (CCL) induced cognitive dysfunction associated with oxidative stress in mice has been reported. Here, the neuroprotective effect of RGP on hippocampal neuron damage in CCL-treated mice was investigated. In vivo study, mice were subjected to CCL for 4 weeks and/or oral administration of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg RGP every other day. In vitro experiment, hippocampal neuron cells (HT-22) was exposed to LED light and/or supplemented with 62.5, 125 and 250 mu g/mL RGP. Mice exposed to CCL showed impaired cognitive and depressive-like behavior in the hippocampus, which were reversed by RGP. Meanwhile, RGP reversed light-induced oxidative stress and autophagy both in mice and hippocampal neuron cells (HT-22). Furthermore, compared with Light-exposed group, RGP treatment activated the AKT/mTOR pathway. Importantly, the AKT inhibitor Perifosine significantly weakened the neuroprotective of RGP on Lightinduced oxidative stress and autophagy in HT-22 cells by inhibiting AKT/mTOR pathway and increasing the content of autophagy-related protein. Our data demonstrated, for the first time, that oxidative stress and the AKT/mTOR pathway plays a critical role in Light-induced apoptosis and autophagic cell death in mice and HT-22 cells.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, has no effective treatment. We studied the potential effects of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an alkaloid in the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (chuanxiong) to treat ischemic stroke, on AD progression in two AD mouse models. Eight-month-old 3xTg-AD mice received TMP treatment (10 mg/kg/d) for 1 month, and 4-month-old APP/PS1-AD mice received TMP treatment (10 mg/kg/d) for 2 months. Behavioral tests, including step-down passive avoidance (SDA), new object recognition (NOR), Morris water maze (MWM), and Contextual fear conditioning test showed that TMP significantly improved the learning and memory of the two AD-transgenic mice. In addition, TMP reduced beta-amyloid (Ass) levels and tau phosphorylation (p-tau). Venny map pointed out that 116 proteins were commonly changed in 3xTg mice vs. wild type (WT) mice and TMP-treated mice vs. -untreated mice. The same 130 proteins were commonly changed in APP/PS1 mice vs. WT mice and TMP-treated mice vs. -untreated mice. The functions of the common proteins modified by TMP in the two models were mainly involved in mitochondrial, synaptic, cytoskeleton, ATP binding, and GTP binding. Mitochondrial omics analysis revealed 21 and 20 differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins modified by TMP in 3xTg-AD mice and APP/PS1 mice, respectively. These differential proteins were located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondrial outer membrane, mitochondrial gap, and mitochondrial matrix, and the function of some proteins is closely related to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Western-blot analysis confirmed that TMP changed the expression of OXPHOS complex proteins (sdhb, ndufa10, uqcrfs1, cox5b, atp5a) in the hippocampus of the two AD mice. Taken together, we demonstrated that TMP treatment changed the hippocampal proteome, reduced AD pathology, and reduced cognitive impairment in the two AD models. The changes might be associated with modification of the mitochondrial protein profile by TMP. The results of the study suggest that TMP can improve the symptoms of AD.

AB  - Excessive corticosterone (CORT), resulting from a dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, is associated with cognitive impairment and behavioral changes, including depression. In Korean oriental medicine, Pedicularis resupinata is used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, the antidepressant properties of P. resupinata have not been well characterized. Here, the antidepressant-like effects of P. resupinata extract (PRE) were evaluated in terms of CORT-induced depression using in vivo models. HPLC confirmed that acteoside, a phenylethanoid glycoside, was the main compound from PRE. Male ICR mice (8 weeks old) were injected with CORT (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and orally administered PRE daily (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg) for 21 consecutive days. Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated using the open-field test, sucrose preference test, passive avoidance test, tail suspension test, and forced swim test. Treatment with a high dose of PRE significantly alleviated CORT-induced, depressive-like behaviors in mice. Additionally, repeated CORT injection markedly reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, whereas total glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and GR phosphorylation at serine 211 were significantly increased in the mice hippocampus but improved by PRE treatment. Thus, our findings suggest that PRE has potential antidepressant-like effects in CORT-induced, depressive-like behavior in mice.

AB  - Background: There is an increase in cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) stemming from a globally ageing population demographic. Although substantial research efforts were performed for the scope of prophylaxis and therapeutic measure development against AD, based on its pathogenesis, most were unsuccessful. BushenHuatan-Yizhi formula (BSHTYZ) is extensively implemented to manage dementia. However, few studies have been carried out to understand how BSHTYZ enhances recovery of spatial learning and memory and how it modulates relevant molecular interplays in order to achieve this.
   Purpose: To investigate neuroprotective function, ameliorating learning/memory capacity of BSHTYZ via GSK-3 beta / CREB signaling pathway in rat AD models influenced through A beta(1-42). Methods: A total of 60 male SD rats (3 months old) were randomized into six groups and treated with 2.6 mu g/mu l A beta(1- 42) (5 mu l) into the lateral ventricle, though the control group (Con) was administered an equivalent volume of vehicle. Consequently, the rat cohorts were administered either BSHTYZ or donepezil hydrochloride or normal saline, by intragastric administration, for four weeks. Spatial learning / memory were detected through the Morris water maze, and possible mechanisms detected by histomorphological examination and Western blot in the rat AD models induced by A beta(1-42).
   Results: Spatial learning/memory issues were monitored after A beta(1-42) infusion in rats. Simultaneously, neuron loss in cornuammonis1 (CA1) / dentate gyrus (DG) within hippocampus region were identified, together with enhanced black granule staining within the hippocampus and hyperphosphorylated tau within Ser202 and Ser396 sites. It was also elucidated that A beta(1-42) had the capacity to up-regulate glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) and down-regulate cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). BSHTYZ was found to reverse such molecular interplays.
   Conclusion: The study suggested BSHTYZ could possibly provide neuroprotective role against learning / memory impairment, which provided a potential therapeutic tool delaying the progression of AD molecular interplays that includes the GSK-3 beta / CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - Salmon calcitonin is a good model for studying amyloid behavior and neurotoxicity. Its slow aggregation rate allows the purification of low molecular weight prefibrillar oligomers, which are the most toxic species. It has been proposed that these species may cause amyloid pore formation in neuronal membranes through contact with negatively charged sialic acid residues of the ganglioside GM1. In particular, it has been proposed that an electrostatic interaction may be responsible for the initial contact between prefibrillar oligomers and GM1 contained in lipid rafts. Based on this evidence, the aim of our work was to investigate whether the neurotoxic action induced by calcitonin prefibrillar oligomers could be counteracted by treatment with neuraminidase, an enzyme that removes sialic acid residues from gangliosides. Therefore, we studied cell viability in HT22 cell lines and evaluated the effects on synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation by in vitro extracellular recordings in mouse hippocampal slices. Our results showed that treatment with neuraminidase alters the surface charges of lipid rafts, preventing interaction between the calcitonin prefibrillar oligomers and GM1, and suggesting that the enzyme, depending on the concentration used, may have a partial or total protective action in terms of cell survival and modulation of synaptic transmission.

AB  - Experimental evidence indicates that the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors plays an important role in neurological disorders' models such as epilepsy, cerebral ischemia and trauma. The glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid (KA) induces seizures and excitotoxic cell death in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Thymoquinone (TQ) is the most important component of the essential oil obtained from black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) seeds. It has many pharmacological actions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. TQ was used in an in vitro experimental model of primary cultures where excitotoxicity was induced. Briefly, rat organotypic hippocampal slices were exposed to 5 mu M KA for 24 h. Cell death in the CA3 subregions of slices was quantified by measuring propidium iodide fluorescence. The cross-talk between TQ, ER stress and apoptotic pathways was investigated by Western blot. In untreated slices TQ (10 mu M) induced a significant increase on the PSD95 levels and it decreased the excitotoxic injury induced by KA. Additionally, TQ was able to ameliorate the KA-induced increase in unfolded proteins GRP78 and GRP94 expression. Finally, TQ was able to partially rescue the reduction of the KA-induced apoptotic pathway activation. Our results suggest that TQ modulates the processes leading to post-kainate neuronal death in the CA3 hippocampal area.

AB  - New stem cell and extracellular-vesicle-based therapies have the potential to improve outcomes for the increasing number of patients with heart failure. Since neonates have a significantly enhanced regenerative ability, we hypothesized that extracellular vesicles isolated from Islet-1+ expressing neonatal human cardiovascular progenitors (CPCs) will induce transcriptomic changes associated with improved regenerative capability when co-cultured with CPCs derived from adult humans. In order to test this hypothesis, we isolated extracellular vesicles from human neonatal Islet-1+ CPCs, analyzed the extracellular vesicle content using RNAseq, and treated adult CPCs with extracellular vesicles derived from neonatal CPCs to assess their functional effect. AKT, ERBB, and YAP1 transcripts were elevated in adult CPCs treated with neonatal CPC-derived extracellular vesicles. YAP1 is lost after the neonatal period but can stimulate cardiac regeneration. Our results demonstrate that YAP1 and additional transcripts associated with improved cardiovascular regeneration, as well as the activation of the cell cycle, can be achieved by the treatment of adult CPCs with neonatal CPC-derived extracellular vesicles. Progenitor cells derived from neonates secrete extracellular vesicles with the potential to stimulate and potentially improve functional effects in adult CPCs used for cardiovascular repair.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Olax subscorpioidea oliv. is a shrub plant of the Olacaceae family with reported usage in ethnomedicine as a nootropic agent for the management of Alzheimer's-like dementia. Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the nootropic potential of methanol extract of Olax subscorpioidea (MEOS) in scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's-like dementia. Materials and methods: Thirty male mice, assigned into six groups (n = 8), were used for this study. Group, I received distilled water, group II received scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.), groups iii-v received 25, 50, and 100 mg/ kg, p.o. of MEOS and scopolamine (1 mg/kg/i.p.), and group vi received donepezil 5 mg/kg, p.o.and scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.). The animals were pre-treated with MEOS and Donepezil for 14 days, and scopolamine from the 8th to 14th day. Followed by cognitive, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and histology assessments. Results: 100 mg/kg MEOS significantly reduced transfer latency and increased discrimination index in the elevated plus maze and novel object recognition test cognitive assessments. 100 mg/kg MEOS, significantly reduced oxidative stress, protect endogenous antioxidants, suppressed neuroinflammation, and acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) activity. The histomorphometry study of the hippocampus revealed that MEOS prevented extensive pyknosis, karyolysis, chromatolysis, and loss of hippocampal neurons that accompanied scopolamine treatment. Conclusion: MEOS protected against Alzheimer's-like dementia via the suppression of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress associated with scopolamine-induced amnesic behavior.

AB  - The leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant are used to produce many different types of teas, and green tea is particularly noted for its health promoting properties which are attributed to high concentrations of phenolic compounds known as catechins. Green tea is available in forms such as bagged, gunpowder (rolled leaf), and matcha, a fine powder. This study evaluated the phenolic content, catechin composition, caffeine concentration, and antioxidant properties of fifteen commercially-available green teas with an emphasis on identifying differences between ceremonial and culinary matcha. Gunpowder and bagged green teas had higher total phenolic contents and greater CUPRAC (cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity) and ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) antioxidant capacities than matcha teas. Among matcha samples, less expensive culinary teas had greater total phenolic contents and higher antioxidant capacities than ceremonial products. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to determine similarities and differences in catechin composition and revealed that bagged and gunpowder green teas had the highest levels of the stereoisomers epi/catechin gallate, which correlated with their strong antioxidant properties. Bagged and gunpowder teas were the lowest cost products in this study, indicating that they are an economical choice for consumers who want a green tea beverage with high catechin content, although they generally had lower caffeine levels than matcha.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dry mature fruits of Hippophae rhamnoides L. (HRL), Elaeagnaceae, have traditional functions of invigorating spleen and improving spleen insufficiency. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinics have been proved that HRL is in favor of diabetes treatment. Modern pharmacological studies demonstrated that total flavones of Hippophae rhamnoides (TFH) are the main substance for HRL to develop anti-inflammation and anti-diabetes functions. However, chemical features, active ingredients and anti-diabetes pharmacological mechanism of HRL still remain unclear.
   Aim of the study: Key targets and metabolites in anti-type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) of TFH have been explored based on AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications. The anti-T2DM mechanism of TFH has been elaborated from comprehensive perspectives, including target prediction, metabolites, potential metabolic pathways, and so on.
   Materials and methods: In this study, a qualitative test of chemical composition of HRL was carried out based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The anti-T2DM targets and pathways of HRL were predicted through network pharmacological approach. The T2DM rat model was induced by high-fat and high-glucose diet combined with streptozotocin (STZ). The T2DM model was evaluated through fasting blood glucose level, body weight, serum biochemical indicators, insulin levels and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. The key metabolic pathways were screened through the correlation between metabolites and key targets. Finally, the quantitative analysis of key targets and metabolites was verified through experiments.
   Results: After TFH intervention, the fasting blood-glucose level of T2DM rats induced by high-fat and high-glucose diet combined with streptozotocin (STZ) was downregulated significantly, while body weight, serum liquid level, insulin levels and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were improved. According to ELISA, Western blotting (WB) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), TFH significantly downregulates expression levels of diglyceride (DAG)-activated protein kinase C (PRKCA), mitogen activated protein kinase 10 (MAPK10), human nuclear factor.B subunit p65 (NF-kappa B p65) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in pancreas of STZ-induced rats.
   Conclusions: TFH downregulates expressions of PRKCA, MAPK10 and p65 TNF-alpha as well as level of the key metabolite DA in the DAG/PRKCA/MAPK10/TNF-a/p65 pathways, improves lipid metabolism disorder, inhibits inflammatory response and thereby relieves symptoms of T2DM.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dan'e fukang decoction (DFD) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula. DFD obtains 10 herbs, including Salvia yunnanensis C.H.Wright (Zidanshen), Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe (Ezhu), Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Danggui), Cyperus rotundus L. (Xiangfuzi), Corydalis yanhusuo (Y.H.Chou & Chun C. Hsu) W.T.Wang ex Z.Y.Su & C.Y.Wu, Bupleurum marginatum Wall. ex DC. (Yanhusuo), Sparganium stoloniferum (Buch.-Ham. ex Graebn.) Buch.-Ham. ex Juz. (Sanleng), Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.H.Chen (Sanqi), Paeonia lactiflora Pall. (Shaoyao) and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Gancao). DFD is now clinically used for the treatment of menstrual irregularities, dysmenorrhea and menstrual discomfort caused by blood stasis and easing of endometriosis. Based on this, it is reasonable to presume that DFD may be effective in treating incomplete abortion and reducing postpartum bleeding, but no specific studies have been reported so far. Aim of the study: To investigate the efficacy of Dan'e fukang decoction (DFD) in reducing prolonged vaginal bleeding followed by mifepristone induced incomplete abortion and explore the mechanisms of action of DFD in treating incomplete abortion. Methods: An incomplete abortion model of rat was established by single intragastrically administered 8.5 mg/kg mifepristone on the 7th day of pregnancy. From the 8th day of pregnancy, the abortive rats were administered solvent, a positive control drug, or different doses of DFD, respectively for seven consecutive days. The efficacy of DFD was assessed by measuring the vaginal bleeding volume of the rats. Four coagulation parameters and platelet counts were measured. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed to evaluate pathological changes in the uterine embryos. Serum levels of progesterone and estrogen were measured using ELISA. Network pharmacology and transcriptomics were used to predict potential targets and pathways for DFD to reduce hemorrhage. The levels of mRNA related to cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) were detected by RT-qPCR. The levels of progesterone and estrogen receptors and the proteins associated with CAMs pathway in uterine tissues were detected by Western Blot. Results: DFD significantly reduced the volume of vaginal bleeding of the abortive rats and significantly downgraded the pathological scores of uterine embryos. DFD significantly increased serum levels of E2, and had no impact on serum levels of P4 and the protein expression of ER and PR in the uteri of the abortive rats. Pathways in cancer, lipid, focal adhesion and immune-related signaling were predicted to be influenced by DFD via the analysis of network pharmacology. The CAMs signaling was found the most critical pathway regulated by both mifepristone and DFD via RNA-seq assay, followed by axon guidance, basal cell carcinoma, hippo signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Combining the two analytical methods, ICAM-1 was predicted likely the key targeted gene by DFD. Finally, DFD was validated to decrease the protein expression of ICAM-1, ITGB2, ITGB7 and RASSF5 in the uterine tissues, which correlated to suppress the CAMs signaling pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Da Chuanxiong Formula (DCX) is a traditional herbal compound composed of Gastrodia elata Bl. and Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort, which could significantly enhance blood circulation and neuroprotection, showing promise in treating Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI). Aim of study: This study aims to elucidate the potential of DCX in treating VCI and its underlying mechanism. Materials and methods: Firstly, the cognitive behavior level, blood flow changes, and brain pathology changes were evaluated through techniques such as the Morris water maze, step-down, laser speckle, coagulation analysis, and pathological staining to appraise the DCX efficacy. Then, the DCX targeting pathways were decoded by merging metabolomics with transcriptomics. Finally, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Fe2+, and lipid peroxidation related to the targeting signaling pathways of DCX were detected by kit, and the expression levels of mRNAs or proteins related to ferroptosis were determined by qPCR or Western blot assays respectively. Results: DCX improved cognitive abilities and cerebral perfusion significantly, and mitigated pathological damage in the hippocampal region of VCI model rats. Metabolomics revealed that DCX was able to call back 33 metabolites in plasma and 32 metabolites in brain samples, and the majority of the differential metabolites are phospholipid metabolites. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that DCX regulated a total of 3081 genes, with the ferroptosis pathway exhibiting the greatest impact. DCX inhibited ferroptosis of VCI rates by decreasing the levels of ferrous iron, ROS, and malondialdehyde (MDA) while increasing the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in VCI rats. Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of ACSL4, LPCAT3, ALOX15, and GPX4, which are related to lipid metabolism in ferroptosis, were also regulated by DCX. Conclusion: Our research findings indicated that DCX could inhibit ferroptosis through the ACSL4/GPX4 signaling pathway, thereby exerting its therapeutic benefits on VCI.

AB  - Background: The Zhimu-Huangbai herb-pair (ZB) is commonly used to treat depression. Previous research has verified that ZB is effective as an antidepressant. Nevertheless, its active components and potential mechanism still require further elucidation. Purpose: This study aims to analyze the compounds of ZB penetrating into the brain using UPLC-MS and investigate the potential mechanisms of ZB in the treatment of depression through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Methods: The compounds of ZB that penetrate into the brain were identified using the UPLC-MS method. Network pharmacology analysis was employed to predict the therapeutic targets and mechanisms of the compounds of ZB in the brain for the treatment of depression. Subsequently, the molecular docking method was used to analyze the binding between active compounds and target proteins. Rat depression models induced by CUMS were used to investigate the impact of ZB on depression. Finally, the mechanism of ZB treatment for depression was investigated using the LPS-induced BV2 cell inflammation model. Results: A total of 17 compounds were identified in ZB that crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The network pharmacological analysis showed that the anti-depressant mechanism of ZB is closely related to inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-6. Furthermore, KEGG and PPI analyses demonstrated that ZB regulates the microglia M1/M2 phenotypic polarization by modulating inflammation-related pathways. ZB was found to improve depression-like behavior in vivo. The molecular docking indicated that the compounds in ZB that penetrate into the brain have a strong binding ability to RELA and PPAR-gamma. ZB inhibited the expression of p-p65 and increased the expression of PPAR-gamma in the mPFC. By rebalancing the ratio of pro-inflammatory/antiinflammatory cytokines, ZB was able to reduce neuroinflammation in the mPFC and hippocampus regions. The immunofluorescence results showed that ZB-containing serum reduced M1 polarization induced by LPS in BV2 cells. Conclusion: This study reveals that ZB effectively alleviates depression by regulating the M1/M2 phenotypic polarization of microglial cells. The mechanism may be that the active compounds of ZB reduce M1 phenotypic polarization by inhibiting P65 and increase M2 phenotypic polarization by promoting PPAR gamma.

AB  - Development of the hippocampus is critical for its normal maturation. However, there is no systematic study on the effects of low-dose (& LE;2 Gy) neonatal X-ray exposure on different cells at different developmental stages of the mouse hippocampus. The present study demonstrated that irradiation with 2 Gy at postnatal day (PD) 3 in mice induced anxiety and impairment of spatial learning and memory in adult mice. Neuroinflammatory cells were observed in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 areas of the hippocampus at PD3 + 1. X-ray irradiation impaired neuronal complexity and neurogenesis. However, the number of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus was increased the first day after irradiation, and then decreased 21 days later. The protein expression levels of NF-kappa B, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and gamma H(2)A histone family member X (gamma H(2)AX) increased from 7 to 21 days after irradiation, or till 90 days after irradiation for IL-1 beta, whereas those of hippocampal sirtuin1 (SIRT1) decreased after 21 days of irradiation at PD3. These results suggest that neonatal X-ray irradiation-induced neuroinflammation impaired neuroplasticity and neurogenesis in the hippocampus, leading to the anxiety and spatial memory disorder during adulthood. The mechanisms involved in the induction of developmental neurotoxicity following low-dose irradiation may involve the inflammation-mediated signaling pathway IL-1 beta/ SIRT1/CHOP.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Alpinia officinarum Hance is a perennial natural medicine herbivorous plant, has been used in the management of treat stomach pain and diabetes, it is abundantly cultivated in Qiongzhong, Baisha and other places. P. cablin (Blanco) Benth, one of the most important traditional Chinese plants, which plays functions in antioxidant and gastrointestinal regulation, has been extensively planted in Hainan, Guangdong and other regions. Aim of the study: In this study, we investigated the role and underlying molecular mechanism of AP on diabetic gastroparesis (DGP) in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods: In this study, using ultra -high performance liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry/ mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to identify active compounds in A. officinarum Hance-P. cablin (Blanco) Benth drug pair (AP). Molecular docking were utilized to explore the potential mechanism of AP treatment of DGP. In in vitro assays, gastric smooth muscle cells (GSMCs) were treated with 35 mM glucose to promote apoptosis and construct the DGP model, which was treated with different concentrations of AP. Furthermore, transfection technology was used to overexpress RAGE in GSMCs and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of alleviation of DGP by AP. Results: Using UPLC-MS/MS analysis, nine components of AP were identified. We found that AP effectively blocked the increase in apoptosis, oxidative stress, and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. For in vivo experiments, mice were fed with a high -fat irregular diet to construct DGP model, and AP was co -administered via oral gavage daily to prevent the development of DGP. Compared with DGP mice, AP significantly decreased fasting blood glucose levels and increased gastric emptying levels. Consistent with in vitro experiments, AP also considerably decreased the increase in oxidative stress in DGP mice. Mechanistically, AP alleviates apoptosis and DGP by decreasing oxidative stress and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations via the inhibition of the AGE/RAGE axis. Conclusions: Collectively, this study has established that AP can improve DGP, and the mechanism may be related to the inhibition the AGE/RAGE axis to mitigate apoptosis and DGP. To summarize, this study provides a novel supplementary strategy for DGP treatment.

AB  - Green tea extract derived from the leaves of Camellia sinensis L. (CS), is a representative beverage with antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-viral properties. CS extract is also used in cosmetics. Colloidal gold is generally a sol or colloidal suspension of gold nanoparticles in water. Colloidal gold green tea (CGCS), cultivated as a fertilizer using this colloidal gold solution, contains gold minerals and possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-tumor properties. However, the skin bioactivity of CGCS has not yet been investigated. In this study, we investigated the effect of the CGCS extract on skin whitening. CGCS extract contained high levels of phenols and flavonoids and displayed 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity in a concentration-dependent manner. CGCS extract inhibited melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity in B16F10 cells more effectively than the CS extract. Moreover, the CGCS extract decreased the expression levels of the melanogenesis-related proteins, tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related proteins (TRPs), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). In conclusion, our study showed that the CGCS extract inhibits the expression of tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2 via the downregulation of MITF, thereby inhibiting melanin synthesis. Therefore, CGCS can potentially be used as a skin-whitening ingredient in the cosmetic industry.

AB  - Melatonin (MEL) is a pleiotropic indolamine that reaches multiple intracellular targets. Among these, MEL binds to calmodulin (CaM) with high affinity. In presence of Ca2+, CaM binds to CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). The Ca2+-CaM/CaMKII pathway regulates a myriad of brain functions in different cellular compartments. Evidence showing the regulation of this cellular pathway by MEL is scarce. Thus, our main objective was to study the interaction of MEL with CaM and its effects on CaMKII activity in two microenvironments (aqueous and lipidic) naturally occurring within the cell. In addition, colocalization of MEL with CaM in vivo was explored in mice brain hippocampus. In vitro CaM-MEL interaction and the structural conformations of CaM in the presence of this indoleamine were assessed through electrophoretic mobility and isoelectric point. The functional consequence of this interaction was evaluated by measuring CaMKII activity. Ca2+-CaM-MEL increased the activity of CaMKII in aqueous buffer but reduced the kinase activity in lipid buffer. Importantly, MEL colocalizes in vivo with Ca2+-CaM in the hippocampus. Our evidence suggests that MEL regulates the key cellular Ca2+-CaM/CaMKII pathway and might explain why physiological MEL concentrations reduce CaMKII activity in some experimental conditions, while in others it drives biological processes through activation of this kinase.

AB  - The ergonomic design study of artificial intelligence lower limb-assisted brace for the elderly is a new design standard of lower limb-assisted brace for the elderly with mobility problems. Based on human factors engineering, this study tested and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of human lower limb motion mechanics, human gait motion law, and existing lower limb assisted brace design cases at home and abroad and concluded that the common external assisted method is less man-machine efficient than the internal assisted method. Therefore, a new brace joint rotation curvature, component parameters, and other key information were designed based on the structure of the medial assistance method. With the help of the engineering and scientific analysis methods in human factors engineering, the designed machines and systems are made more adaptable to the physiological and psychological characteristics of human beings. This study explores the interaction between humans and machines and the rationality of their mutual integration, which can effectively avoid repetitive strain injuries and other muscle diseases over time for users in the process of assistance and achieve efficiency, health, and safety. Subsequently, Rhino software was used for digital modeling, physical prototyping, experimental testing, and analysis of the design solution and continuous optimization of the design. At the same time, the perceptual engineering design method was utilized to meet the humanized aesthetic design requirements. The prototype of the design study was finally completed, which is more in line with the evaluation criteria of "human-machine-environment system" than the existing market design in terms of functional rationality, human-machine performance, and human experience. This demonstrates the validity of the design method and is an important reference for the design standard of the lower limb support for the elderly.

AB  - One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation and spread of toxic aggregates of tau protein. The progression of AD tau pathology is thought to be highly stereotyped, which is in part due to the fact that tau can spread between regions via the white matter tracts that connect them. Mathematically, this phenomenon has been described using models of 'network diffusion,' where the rate of spread of tau between brain regions is proportional to its concentration gradient and the amount of white matter between them. Although these models can robustly predict the progression of pathology in a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, an underexplored aspect of tau spreading is that it is governed not only by diffusion but also by active transport along axonal microtubules. Spread can therefore take on a directional bias, resulting in distinct patterns of deposition, but current models struggle to capture this phenomenon. Recently, we have developed a mathematical model of the axonal transport of toxic tau proteins that takes into account the effects tau exerts on the molecular motors. Here we describe and implement a macroscopic version of this model, which we call the Network Transport Model (NTM). A key feature of this model is that, while it predicts tau dynamics at a regional level, it is parameterized in terms of only microscopic processes such as aggregation and transport rates, i.e., differences in brain-wide tau progression can be explained by its microscopic properties. We provide numerical evidence that, as with the two-neuron model that the NTM extends, there are distinct and rich dynamics with respect to the overall rate of spread and the staging of pathology when we simulated the NTM on the hippocampal subnetwork. The theoretical insights provided by the NTM have broad implications for understanding AD pathophysiology more generally.

AB  - More research is required to understand how melatonin protects neurons. The study aimed to find out if and how long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) contributes to melatonin's ability to defend the hippocampus from H2O2-induced oxidative injury. LncRNAs related to oxidative injury were predicted by bioinformatics methods. Mouse hippocampus-derived neuronal HT22 cells were treated with H2O2 with or without melatonin. Viability and apoptosis were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 and Hoechst33258. RNA and protein levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Bioinformatics predicted that 38 lncRNAs were associated with oxidative injury in mouse neurons. LncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) was related to H2O2-induced oxidative injury and up-regulated by melatonin in HT22 cells. The knockdown of NEAT1 exacerbated H2O2-induced oxidative injury, weakened the moderating effect of melatonin, and abolished the increasing effect of melatonin on the mRNA and protein level of Slc38a2. Taken together, melatonin attenuates H2O2-induced oxidative injury by upregulating lncRNA NEAT1, which is essential for melatonin stabilizing the mRNA and protein level of Slc38a2 for the survival of HT22 cells. The research may assist in the treatment of oxidative injury-induced hippocampal degeneration associated with aging using melatonin and its target lncRNA NEAT1.

AB  - (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the chief dietary constituent in green tea (Camellia sinensis), is relatively unstable under oxidative conditions. This study evaluated the use of non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma to improve the anti-digestive enzyme capacities of EGCG oxidation products. Pure EGCG was dissolved in an aqueous solution and irradiated with DBD plasma for 20, 40, and 60 min. The reactant, irradiated for 60 min, exhibited improved inhibitory properties against alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase compared with the parent EGCG. The chemical structures of these oxidation products 1-3 from the EGCG, irradiated with the plasma for 60 min, were characterized using spectroscopic methods. Among the oxidation products, EGCG quinone dimer A (1) showed the most potent inhibitory effects toward alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase with IC50 values of 15.9 +/- 0.3 and 18.7 +/- 0.3 mu M, respectively. These values were significantly higher than that of the positive control, acarbose. Compound 1, which was the most active, was the most abundant in the plasma-irradiated reactant for 60 min according to quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. These results suggest that the increased biological capacity of EGCG can be attributed to the structural changes to EGCG in H2O, induced by cold plasma irradiation.

AB  - Recent experimental observations have shown that the reactivation of hippocampal place cells (PC) during sleep or wakeful immobility depicts trajectories that can go around barriers and can flexibly adapt to a changing maze layout. However, existing computational models of replay fall short of generating such layout-conforming replay, restricting their usage to simple environments, like linear tracks or open fields. In this paper, we propose a computational model that generates layout-conforming replay and explains how such replay drives the learning of flexible navigation in a maze. First, we propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the inter-PC synaptic strength during exploration. Then we use a continuous attractor network (CAN) with feedback inhibition to model the interaction among place cells and hippocampal interneurons. The activity bump of place cells drifts along paths in the maze, which models layout-conforming replay. During replay in sleep, the synaptic strengths from place cells to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned by a novel dopamine-modulated three-factor rule to store place-reward associations. During goal-directed navigation, the CAN periodically generates replay trajectories from the animal's location for path planning, and the trajectory leading to a maximal MSN activity is followed by the animal. We have implemented our model into a high-fidelity virtual rat in the MuJoCo physics simulator. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that its superior flexibility during navigation in a maze is due to a continuous re-learning of inter-PC and PC-MSN synaptic strength.

AB  - The wide disparity in outcomes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment from preclinical to clinical studies suggests an urgent need for more effective therapeutic targets and approaches to treat AD. CaMKII is a potential target for AD therapy; however, conflicting reports on the relationship between CaMKII and AD suggest a lack of deeper understanding of the interaction between CaMKII and AD. In addition to the lack of effective therapeutic targets, pharmacokinetic limitations of neuroprotective drugs, such as low lipophilicity to cross blood brain barrier, need to be urgently addressed in the practice of AD therapy. In this study, we prepared a carbon-based nanoparticle, Nano C60, and demonstrated that Nano C60 treatment promoted the translocation of phosphorylated CaMKII alpha from the cytoplasm to the synapse in A beta 42 oligomers-treated cells and APP/PS1 mice. As a result, Nano C60 administration significantly improved spatial learning and memory in APP/PS1 mice. Our study suggests that synaptic-activated CaMKII may be more important than total CaMKII in AD treatment and provides a new strategy for AD therapy.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social deficits, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Although aripiprazole and risperidone are FDA-approved for ASD, they primarily target comorbid symptoms and are associated with significant side effects. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 6-bromoindirubin-3 '-oxime (6BIO), a glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) inhibitor, in a VPA model of ASD. Pregnant Wistar rat dams received a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of VPA (600 mg/kg) or an equal volume of saline on GD 12.5. Offspring prenatally exposed to VPA showed impairments in early age observations, such as nervous reflex, motor coordination, sensory function, and developmental milestones. On postnatal day (PND), 23 male and female offspring were separated and randomly assigned to receive either risperidone (2.5 mg/kg, po) or 6BIO (15 or 30 mu g/kg, ip) daily until PND 82. Systemic postnatal administration of 6BIO dose-dependently ameliorated anxiety-like behavior, exploratory, social deficit, repetitive behavior, spatial cognition, recognition memory, motor coordination, gastrointestinal motility, brain edema, and blood-brain barrier functions. Furthermore, chronic 6BIO postnatal treatment significantly attenuated VPA-induced neuronal damage in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. 6BIO also significantly suppressed the upregulated cytosolic GSK3 beta phosphorylation, as determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Additionally, 6BIO modulated mRNA expression levels of Wnt, CHD8, SHANK3, GAD65, and 67, and transcriptional factors such as beta-catenin and NLGN3 were altered by prenatal VPA exposure. In conclusion, these findings suggest that 6BIO may exert neuroprotective effects via GSK3 beta inhibition, indicating its potential as a candidate compound for therapeutic intervention in ASD.

AB  - An important aspect of the neuromodulatory and neuroprotective actions exerted by neuroactive steroids is that they are sex -specific, as determined by the sexually dimorphic levels of these molecules in plasma and the nervous tissue. Thus, the identification of the factors that generate the sex -dimorphic levels of neuroactive steroids may be crucial from a neuroprotectant perspective. The main driver for sex determination in mammals is the SRY gene and the subsequent presence of a specific gonad: testes for males and ovaries for females, thus producing hormonal compounds, primarily androgens and estrogens, respectively. Nowadays, it is well established that despite the relevance of gonads, other factors control sexual features, and, among them, sex chromosome complement is highly relevant. In this study, neuroactive steroids were evaluated by liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry in the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and plasma of the four core genotype mouse model, to determine the relative contribution of sex chromosome complement and gonads in determining their sex dimorphic levels. The data obtained reveal that although gonads are the main contributing factor for sex differences in neuroactive steroid levels, the levels of some neuroactive steroids, including testosterone, are also influenced in brain and plasma by tissue -specific actions of sex chromosomes. The data presented here adds a new piece to the puzzle of steroid level regulation, which may be useful in designing sex -specific neuroprotective approaches to pathological conditions affecting the nervous system.

AB  - The microtubule-associated protein tau plays a central role in tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The exact molecular mechanisms underlying tau toxicity are unclear, but aging is irrefutably the biggest risk factor. This raises the question of how cellular senescence affects the function of tau as a microtubule regulator. Here we report that the proportion of tau that is proteolytically cleaved at the caspase-3 site (TauC3) doubles in the hippocampus of senescent mice. TauC3 is also elevated in AD patients. Through quantitative live-cell imaging, we show that TauC3 has a drastically reduced dynamics of its microtubule interaction. Single-molecule tracking of tau confirmed that TauC3 has a longer residence time on axonal microtubules. The reduced dynamics of the TauC3-microtubule interaction correlated with a decreased transport of mitochondria, a reduced processivity of APP-vesicle transport and an induction of region-specific dendritic atrophy in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus. The microtubule-targeting drug Epothilone D normalized the interaction of TauC3 with microtubules and modulated the transport of APP-vesicles dependent on the presence of overexpressed human tau. The results indicate a novel toxic gain of function, in which a post-translational modification of tau changes the dynamics of the tau-microtubule interaction and thus leads to axonal transport defects and neuronal degeneration. The data also introduce microtubule-targeting drugs as pharmacological modifiers of the tau-microtubule interaction with the potential to restore the physiological interaction of pathologically altered tau with microtubules.

AB  - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a leading kidney disease, clinically associated with proteinuria and progressive renal failure. The occurrence of this disease is partly related to gene mutations. We describe a single affected family member who presented with FSGS. We used high-throughput sequencing, sanger sequencing to identify the pathogenic mutations, and a systems genetics analysis in the BXD mice was conducted to explore the genetic regulatory mechanisms of pathogenic genes in the development of FSGS. We identified high urinary protein (++++) and creatinine levels (149 mu mol/L) in a 29-year-old male diagnosed with a 5-year history of grade 2 hypertension. Histopathology of the kidney biopsy showed stromal hyperplasia at the glomerular segmental sclerosis and endothelial cell vacuolation degeneration. Whole-exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (c.643C > T) in exon 2 of TRPC6, leading to the substitution of arginine with tryptophan at position 215 (p.Arg215Trp). Systems genetics analysis of the 53 BXD mice kidney transcriptomes identified Pygm as the upstream regulator of Trpc6. Those two genes are jointly involved in the regulation of FSGS mainly via Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways. We present a novel variant in the TRPC6 gene that causes FSGS. Moreover, our data suggested TRPC6 works with PYGM, as well as Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways to regulate renal function, which could guide future clinical prevention and targeted treatment for FSGS outcomes.

TI  - Sialylated human milk oligosaccharides program cognitive development through a non-genomic transmission mode
T2  - MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
LA  - English
AB  - Breastmilk contains bioactive molecules essential for brain and cognitive development. While sialylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been implicated in phenotypic programming, their selective role and underlying mechanisms remained elusive. Here, we investigated the long-term consequences of a selective lactational deprivation of a specific sialylated HMO in mice. We capitalized on a knock-out (KO) mouse model (B6.129-St6gal1(tm2Jxm)/J) lacking the gene responsible for the synthesis of sialyl(alpha2,6)lactose (6 ' SL), one of the two sources of sialic acid (Neu5Ac) to the lactating offspring. Neu5Ac is involved in the formation of brain structures sustaining cognition. To deprive lactating offspring of 6 ' SL, we cross-fostered newborn wild-type (WT) pups to KO dams, which provide 6 ' SL-deficient milk. To test whether lactational 6 ' SL deprivation affects cognitive capabilities in adulthood, we assessed attention, perseveration, and memory. To detail the associated endophenotypes, we investigated hippocampal electrophysiology, plasma metabolomics, and gut microbiota composition. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we assessed gene expression (at eye-opening and in adulthood) in two brain regions mediating executive functions and memory (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, PFC). Compared to control mice, WT offspring deprived of 6 ' SL during lactation exhibited consistent alterations in all cognitive functions addressed, hippocampal electrophysiology, and in pathways regulating the serotonergic system (identified through gut microbiota and plasma metabolomics). These were associated with a site- (PFC) and time-specific (eye-opening) reduced expression of genes involved in central nervous system development. Our data suggest that 6 ' SL in maternal milk adjusts cognitive development through a short-term upregulation of genes modulating neuronal patterning in the PFC.

AB  - Far-infrared (FIR) ray, an invisible electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 3-1000 mu m, elicits various biological effects. Excessive proliferation of human upper airway epithelial cells (HUAEpCs) contributes to the development and exacerbation of nasal narrowing diseases, including nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms through which FIR irradiation inhibits the proliferation of HUAEpCs. FIR irradiation significantly inhibited the proliferation of NCI-H292 cells without alteration in cell viability. The anti-proliferative effect of FIR radiation was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389 (p-p70S6K-Thr389), without changes in the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Overexpression of p70S6K-T389E mutant gene, not dominant negative-AMPK alpha 1 gene, significantly reversed FIR irradiation-inhibited p-p70S6K-Thr389 and cell proliferation. Cotreatment with okadaic acid or knockdown of protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) gene expression significantly reversed FIR irradiation-decreased p-p70S6K-Thr389 and cell proliferation. FIR irradiation remarkably promoted the physical association of p70S6K and PP2Ac without change in total PP2Ac expression. Hyperthermal stimulus (39 degrees C) did not alter p-p70S6K-Thr389 and cell proliferation. In line with NCI-H292 cell results, FIR irradiation, not hyperthermal stimulus, significantly decreased p-p70S6K-Thr389 and cell proliferation in primary human nasal turbinate and polyp epithelial cells. These results demonstrated that FIR irradiation decreased the proliferation of HUAEpCs through PP2A-mediated inhibition of p70S6K phosphorylation, independent of its hyperthermal effect. Our data suggest that FIR therapy can be used to treat upper airway narrowing epithelial hyperplastic diseases, including nasal polyposis and CRSwNP.

AB  - We studied cell proliferation in the postnatal mouse brain between the ages of 2 and 30 months and identified four compartments with different densities of proliferating cells. The first identified compartment corresponds to the postnatal pallial neurogenic (PPN) zone in the telencephalon; the second to the subpallial postnatal neurogenic (SPPN) zone in the telencephalon; the third to the white matter bundles in the telencephalon; and the fourth to all brain parts outside of the other three compartments. We estimated that about 3.4 million new cells, including 0.8 million in the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampus, are produced in the PPN zone. About 21 million new cells, including 10 million in the subependymal zone (SEZ) in the lateral walls of the lateral ventricle and 2.7 million in the rostral migratory stream (RMS), are produced in the SPPN zone. The third and fourth compartments together produced about 31 million new cells. The analysis of cell proliferation in neurogenic zones shows that postnatal neurogenesis is the direct continuation of developmental neurogenesis in the telencephalon and that adult neurogenesis has characteristics of the late developmental process. As a developmental process, adult neurogenesis supports only compensatory regeneration, which is very inefficient.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, is the most prevalent form of dementia. The pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of (3-amyloid (A(3) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, leading to oxidative stress, neuronal death, and brain atrophy. Bromelain, a proteolytic enzyme extracted from pineapple (Ananas comosus), exhibits potent antioxidant properties. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of bromelain on AD pathogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms using 5x familial AD (5xFAD) mice that carry five AD-linked mutations. Beginning at 10 weeks of age, mice were administered bromelain (20 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for 6 weeks. Bromelain treatment significantly improved motor function, spatial learning, and memory in 5xFAD mice. Analysis of brain tissues revealed reduced levels of A(3 precursor protein and A(3 protein in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of bromelain-treated mice, potentially mediated through downregulation of ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 5 and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 9 transporters and upregulation of apolipoprotein A1. Furthermore, bromelain demonstrated neuroprotective effects by attenuating oxidative stress and suppressing apoptotic pathways. These findings suggest that bromelain may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for AD and related dementia disorders.

AB  - Implantable neural microelectrodesare recognized as a bridge forinformation exchange between inner organisms and outer devices. Combinedwith novel modulation technologies such as optogenetics, it offersa highly precise methodology for the dissection of brain functions.However, achieving chronically effective and stable microelectrodesto explore the electrophysiological characteristics of specific neuronsin free-behaving animals continually poses great challenges. To resolvethis, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate)/poly(vinylalcohol) (PEDOT/PSS/PVA) interpenetrating conducting polymer networks(ICPN) are fabricated via a hydrogel scaffold precoating and electrochemicalpolymerization process to improve the performance of neural microelectrodes.The ICPN films exhibit robust interfacial adhesion, a significantlylower electrochemical impedance, superior mechanical properties, andimproved electrochemical stability compared to the pure poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT/PSS)films, which may be attributed to the three-dimensional (3D) porousmicrostructure of the ICPN. Hippocampal neurons and rat pheochromocytomacells (PC12 cells) adhesion on ICPN and neurite outgrowth are observed,indicating enhanced biocompatibility. Furthermore, alleviated tissueresponse at the electrode-neural tissue interface and improvedrecording signal quality are confirmed by histological and electrophysiologicalstudies, respectively. Owing to these merits, optogenetic modulationsand electrophysiological recordings are performed in vivo, and an anxiolytic effect of hippocampal glutamatergic neurons onbehavior is shown. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and advantagesof ICPN-modified neural implants for in vivo applications.

AB  - Mutations in the IQSEC2 gene are associated with drug-resistant, multifocal infantile and childhood epilepsy; autism; and severe intellectual disability (ID). We used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to obtain hippocampal neurons to investigate the neuropathology of IQSEC2-mediated disease. The neurons were characterized at three-time points during differentiation to assess developmental progression. We showed that immature IQSEC2 mutant dentate gyrus (DG) granule neurons were extremely hyperexcitable, exhibiting increased sodium and potassium currents compared to those of CRISPR-Cas9-corrected isogenic controls, and displayed dysregulation of genes involved in differentiation and development. Immature IQSEC2 mutant cultured neurons exhibited a marked reduction in the number of inhibitory neurons, which contributed further to hyperexcitability. As the mutant neurons aged, they became hypoexcitable, exhibiting reduced sodium and potassium currents and a reduction in the rate of synaptic and network activity, and showed dysregulation of genes involved in synaptic transmission and neuronal differentiation. Mature IQSEC2 mutant neurons were less viable than wild-type mature neurons and had reduced expression of surface AMPA receptors. Our studies provide mechanistic insights into severe infantile epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delay associated with this mutation and present a human model for studying IQSEC2 mutations in vitro.

AB  - Camellia oil, rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, squalene, tocopherols, and polyphenols, is highly valued for its nutritional benefits. However, its high market value and regional variations have led to frequent adulteration, highlighting the need for rapid, non-destructive methods for authentication, geographical traceability, and quality assessment. This study employed portable Raman spectroscopy combined with Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) to differentiate camellia oil from other edible oils and evaluate its thermal and photo-oxidative stability. PLS-DA, based on VIP-selected spectral variables, effectively distinguished camellia oil, with Raman bands near 1250 cm-1 and 1650 cm-1 contributing significantly. A unique peak at 1525 cm-1, observed in samples from Gongcheng, Guangxi, was associated with carotenoids and served as a potential marker for geographical traceability. MCR-ALS modeling revealed significant reductions in the 1650 cm-1 and 1525 cm-1 peaks when temperatures exceeded 150 degrees C, indicating degradation of unsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. Under UV exposure, the 1525 cm-1 peak declined sharply and nearly disappeared after 24 h, suggesting rapid carotenoid degradation via photooxidation. Extended UV treatment also affected the 1650 cm-1 peak and led to oxidative product accumulation. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating Raman spectroscopy with chemometric analysis for efficient oil classification, traceability, and stability monitoring, offering a valuable tool for food quality control and market supervision.

AB  - In this multi-omics study, the authors identified C1q-dependent synapse elimination by both astrocytes and microglia in Alzheimer's mouse models. While astrocytes preferentially removed excitatory synapses, microglia preferred inhibitory synapses.
   Microglia and complement can mediate neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). By integrative multi-omics analysis, here we show that astrocytic and microglial proteins are increased in Tau(P301S) synapse fractions with age and in a C1q-dependent manner. In addition to microglia, we identified that astrocytes contribute substantially to synapse elimination in Tau(P301S) hippocampi. Notably, we found relatively more excitatory synapse marker proteins in astrocytic lysosomes, whereas microglial lysosomes contained more inhibitory synapse material. C1q deletion reduced astrocyte-synapse association and decreased astrocytic and microglial synapses engulfment in Tau(P301S) mice and rescued synapse density. Finally, in an AD mouse model that combines beta-amyloid and Tau pathologies, deletion of the AD risk gene Trem2 impaired microglial phagocytosis of synapses, whereas astrocytes engulfed more inhibitory synapses around plaques. Together, our data reveal that astrocytes contact and eliminate synapses in a C1q-dependent manner and thereby contribute to pathological synapse loss and that astrocytic phagocytosis can compensate for microglial dysfunction.

AB  - Phlorizin is the main active ingredient of apple peel and has potential utilization value. Some recent studies have suggested that phlorizin may have antioxidant capacity and protect the liver. The injection of a low dose of d-galactose can cause some changes that resemble accelerated aging in mice. This study explored the protective effects of phlorizin on d-galactose-induced mice and PC12 cells. In this study, ICR mice were divided into a normal group (NOR), a d-galactose model group (d-gal) and phlorizin treatment groups (100 mg kg(-1), 200 mg kg(-1) and 400 mg kg(-1)). In addition to the NOR group, four other groups were injected with d-galactose (120 mg kg(-1)) for 12 weeks. The results showed that phlorizin reduced the decline of strength, coordination and spatial memory caused by aging, increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and reduced the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). On the other hand, phlorizin increased the levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and acetylcholine (ACh), reduced the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and decreased the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain, improved the expression of antioxidant genes related to the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, and reduced the occurrence of morphological lesions in the hippocampus and liver. In addition, phlorizin improved cell viability and reduced the cytotoxicity of d-galactose-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells. Meanwhile, the protective effect of phlorizin was abolished in Nrf2 gene knockdown PC12 cells. Furthermore, molecular docking showed that phlorizin could bind Keap1 protein, which can interact with Nrf2 protein. Therefore, these results suggest that phlorizin may delay senescence and enhance antioxidant capacity through the Nrf2 pathway.

AB  - Women should be aware of prenancy related health issues. A user-friendly model is developed in which the patients can use as well as clinicians to determine the risks associated with foetal development inside the womb, birth weight, whose effects are typically linked to the mother through biological relationships. Recent advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence offer new techniques for automated evaluation of medical images across a variety of fields, including ultrasound (US) images. Enhancing the detection of the estimated foetal weight (EFW) and mother-foetal disease computations can aid obstetricians in making decisions and reduce perinatal issues. This study aims to build a birth weight classification and prediction of relevant parameters during delivery. In this data analysis suite, exploratory data analysis is performed as part of the data preprocessing to investigate the fundamental information and transformational properties. For feature extracting model, the Advanced Dynamic based Feature Selection (ADFS) algorithm has been used which is optimized using the enriched elephant herding optimization algorithm (EEHOA). The multiple feature estimation is classified using augmented recurrent neural network classifier (AURNN). The findings of analyses with graphical representations have been interpreted through the application of visual analytical techniques.

AB  - The brain has high energy demand making it sensitive to changes in energy fuel supply. Aging shrinks brain volume, decreases glucose uptake availability of the brain, and finally, causes cognitive dysfunction. Folic acid supplementation delayed cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. However, whether folic acid affects brain energy metabolism and structural changes is unclear. The study aimed to determine if long-term dietary folic acid supplementation could alleviate age-related cognitive decline by attenuating hippocampus atrophy and promoting brain glucose uptake in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. According to folic acid levels in diet, 3-months old male SD rats were randomly divided into four intervention groups for 22 months in equal numbers: folic acid -deficient diet (FA-D) group, folic acid-normal diet (FA-N) group, low folic acid-supplemented diet (FA-L) group, and high folic acid-supplemented diet (FA-H) group. The results showed that serum folate concentrations decreased and serum homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations increased with age, and dietary folic acid supplementation increased serum folate concentrations and decreased Hcy concentrations at 11, 18, and 22 months of intervention. Dietary folic acid supplementation attenuated aging-induced hippocampus atrophy, which was showed by higher fractional anisotropy and lower mean diffusivity in the hippocampus, increased brain 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake, then stimulated neuronal survival, and alleviated age-related cognitive decline in SD rats. In conclusion, long-term dietary folic acid supplementation alleviated age-related cognitive decline by attenuating hippocampus atrophy and promoting brain glucose uptake in SD rats.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of death in the world, which accounts for almost 12% of the total deaths worldwide. Despite decades of research, the available and effective pharmacotherapy is limited. Some evidence underlines the beneficial properties of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donors, such as NaSH, in an animal model of brain ischemia and in in vitro research; however, these data are ambiguous. This study was undertaken to verify the neuroprotective activity of AP39, a slow-releasing mitochondria-targeted H2S delivery molecule. We administered AP39 for 7 days prior to ischemia onset, and the potential to induce brain tolerance to ischemia was verified. To do this, we used the rat model of 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and used LC-MS/MS, RT-PCR, Luminex(TM) assays, Western blot and immunofluorescent double-staining to determine the absolute H2S levels, inflammatory markers, neurotrophic factor signaling pathways and apoptosis marker in the ipsilateral frontal cortex, hippocampus and in the dorsal striatum 24 h after ischemia onset. AP39 (50 nmol/kg) reduced the infarct volume, neurological deficit and reduced the microglia marker (Iba1) expression. AP39 also exerted prominent anti-inflammatory activity in reducing the release of Il-1 beta, Il-6 and TNF alpha in brain areas particularly affected by ischemia. Furthermore, AP39 enhanced the pro-survival pathways of neurotrophic factors BDNF-TrkB and NGF-TrkA and reduced the proapoptotic proNGF-p75(NTR)-sortilin pathway activity. These changes corresponded with reduced levels of cleaved caspase 3. Altogether, AP39 treatment induced adaptative changes within the brain and, by that, developed brain tolerance to ischemia.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain insult is a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. To assess the underlying pathological mechanisms, we mapped the spatiotemporal changes in polyamine, amino acid, and neurotransmitter levels, following HI insult (by the Rice-Vannucci method) in the brains of seven-day-old rat pups. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging of chemically modified small-molecule metabolites by 4-(anthracen-9-yl)-2-fluoro-1-methylpyridin-1-ium iodide revealed critical HI-related metabolomic changes of 22 metabolites in 14 rat brain subregions,Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain insult is a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity.

Specifically, putrescine, cadaverine, and 3-aminopropanal increased significantly as early as 12 h postinsult, mainly in motor and somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, and midbrain, followed by an increase in norepinephrine 24 h postinsult, which was predominant in the caudate putamen, the region most vulnerable to HI. The decrease of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the continuous dysregulation of the GABAergic system together with low taurine levels up to 36 h sustained progressive neurodegenerative cellular processes.

AB  - The purpose of our investigation is to identify the potential effects and key molecular targets of Baihe extracts in depression treatment. Network meta-analysis was applied for the synthesis of efficacy outcomes of fluoxetine and three traditional Chinese medicine Baihe prescriptions in depression. Depression-related target genes were screened using "GeneCards" database and "Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)". The major active components and targets of Baihe were screened using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. The identified depression-related genes and the target genes of Baihe were intersected, an interaction network was constructed using the "String" database, and key target genes were determined based on their degree value. Functional enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) profiles was performed using the "ClusterProfiler" R package. A mouse model with depression-like behaviors was constructed to verify the putative roles of the in silico identified key genes. Microglia were isolated from the mouse hippocampus, and the effects of Baihe extract-containing serum on microglia activation and apoptosis by targeting the key genes were examined in vitro. The meta-analysis results revealed no obvious differences in depression treatment efficacy between fluoxetine and the three Baihe prescriptions, suggesting Baihe extracts as a safe and effective alternative treatment for depression. Using network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis, Baihe extracts were found to modulate depression by regulating 15 key genes, with MYC as the key gene. Subsequent animal experiments demonstrated that Baihe extracts reduced depression-related behavior, microglial activation, and inflammatory mediator release in mice by inhibiting MYC. Serum containing Baihe extracts could inhibit the activation of microglia and the release of inflammatory mediators by downregulating MYC. In summary, Baihe extracts were found to diminish MYC expression to reduce microglial activation and inflammatory factor release, thereby exerting antidepressant effects.

AB  - In this study, microencapsulated green tea (GT) extracts, as prospective nutraceuticals, were obtained using spray drying with pectin in different pectin-to-extract (P:E) ratios. Pectin was selected as wall material based on its previously reported superiority to encapsulate phenols, low cost/sustainability of production and intrinsic hypoglycemic and antioxidant potential. A significant degradation (13.74 %) of epigallocatechin was observed in powder without pectin, in contrast to pectin-loaded samples, suggesting its role in chemical stability enhancement of stated compound. FTIR and DSC indicated GT extract bioactives to remain stable during drying. Addition of pectin significantly increased encapsulation efficiency (EE) of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (up to 8.94 %), epicatechin-3-gallate (up to 7.68%) and caffeine (up to 12.39%) compared to pectin-free sample. Significant EE enhancement for epigallocatechin-3-gallate was observed until the P:E ratio of 1:1 compared to pectin-free sample, while further increase of pectin share did not lead to a comparative increase in EE. Similar trend was observed for powder flowability, probably due to excess of pectin in the highest P:E ratio (2:1), preventing proper droplets formation, which was also confirmed by SEM. Sample with P:E ratio of 1:1 revealed the slowest release of bioactives, which may be important for facilitating potential GT therapeutic usage. Stated microencapsulate further revealed satisfactory antioxidant (IC50 of 23.70 mu g/ml vs. 4.45 mu g/ml for ascorbic acid) and hypoglycemic activities (IC50 of 39.48 mu g/ml vs. 156.64 mu g/ml for acarbose). These findings represent the basis for further experiments regarding usage of the developed GT microencapsulate as nutraceutical applicable in diabetesrelated impairments.

AB  - Estrus is crucial for cow fertility in modern dairy farms, but almost 50% of cows do not show the behavioral signs of estrus due to silent estrus and lack of suitable and high-accuracy methods to detect estrus. MiRNA and exosomes play essential roles in reproductive function and may be developed as novel biomarkers in estrus detection. Thus, we analyzed the miRNA expression patterns in milk exosomes during estrus and the effect of milk exosomes on hormone secretion in cultured bovine granulosa cells in vitro. We found that the number of exosomes and the exosome protein concentration in estrous cow milk were significantly lower than in non-estrous cow milk. Moreover, 133 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs were identified in estrous cow milk vs. non-estrous cow milk. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that exosomal miRNAs were involved in reproduction and hormone-synthesis-related pathways, such as cholesterol metabolism, FoxO signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, steroid hormone biosynthesis, Wnt signaling pathway and GnRH signaling pathway. Consistent with the enrichment signaling pathways, exosomes derived from estrous and non-estrous cow milk both could promote the secretion of estradiol and progesterone in cultured bovine granulosa cells. Furthermore, genes related to hormonal synthesis (CYP19A1, CYP11A1, HSD3B1 and RUNX2) were up-regulated after exosome treatment, while exosomes inhibited the expression of StAR. Moreover, estrous and non-estrous cow-milk-derived exosomes both could increase the expression of bcl2 and decrease the expression of p53, and did not influence the expression of caspase-3. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate exosomal miRNA expression patterns during dairy cow estrus and the role of exosomes in hormone secretion by bovine granulosa cells. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for further investigating milk-derived exosomes and exosomal miRNA effects on ovary function and reproduction. Moreover, bovine milk exosomes may have effects on the ovaries of human consumers of pasteurized cow milk. These differential miRNAs might provide candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of dairy cow estrus and will assist in developing new therapeutic targets for cow infertility.

AB  - For a better translation from treatment designs of schizophrenia to clinical efficiency, there is a crucial need to refine preclinical animal models. In order to consider the multifactorial nature of the disorder, a new mouse model associating three factors (genetic susceptibility-partial deletion of the MAP6 gene, early-life stress-maternal separation, and pharmacological treatment-chronic Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol during adolescence) has recently been described. While this model depicts a schizophrenia-like phenotype, the neurobiological correlates remain unknown. Synaptic transmission and functional plasticity of the CA1 hippocampal region of male and female 3-hit mice were therefore investigated using electrophysiological recordings on the hippocampus slice. While basal excitatory transmission remained unaffected, NMDA receptor (NMDAr)-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP) triggered by theta-burst (TBS) but not by high-frequency (HFS) stimulation was impaired in 3-hit mice. Isolated NMDAr activation was not affected or even increased in female 3-hit mice, revealing a sexual dimorphism. Considering that the regulation of LTP is more prone to inhibitory tone if triggered by TBS than by HFS, the weaker potentiation in 3-hit mice suggests a deficiency of intrinsic GABA regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, NMDAr activation was increased by GABA(A) receptor blockade in wild-type but not in 3-hit mice. This electrophysiological study highlights dysregulations of functional properties and plasticity in hippocampal networks of 3-hit mice, one of the mechanisms suspected to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. It also shows differences between males and females, supporting the sexual dimorphism observed in the disorder. Combined with the previously reported study, the present data reinforce the face validity of the 3-hit model that will help to consider new therapeutic strategies for psychosis.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% and is one of the most common diseases worldwide. Although many pathogenetic mechanisms of MDD have been proposed, molecular details and a unifying hypothesis of the pathogenesis of MDD remain to be defined. Here, we investigated whether tyrosine nitrosylation, which is caused by reaction of the C-atom 3 of the tyrosine phenol ring with peroxynitrate (ONOO-), plays a role in experimental MDD, because tyrosine nitrosylation may affect many cell functions altered in MDD. To this end, we induced stress through glucocorticoid application or chronic environmental unpredictable stress and determined tyrosine nitrosylation in the hippocampus through immuno-staining and ELISA. The role of catalases and peroxidases for tyrosine nitrosylation was measured using enzyme assays. We show that glucocorticoid- and chronic unpredictable environmental stress induced tyrosine nitrosylation in the hippocampus. Long-term treatment of stressed mice with the classical antidepressants amitriptyline or fluoxetine prevented tyrosine nitrosylation. Tyrosine nitrosylation was also prevented through i.v. application of anti-ceramide antibodies or recombinant ceramidase to neutralize or degrade, respectively, blood plasma ceramide that has been recently shown to induce experimental MDD. Finally, the application of phosphatidic acid, previously shown to be reduced in the hippocampus upon stress, also reverted stress-induced tyrosine nitrosylation. The inhibition of tyrosine nitrosylation by interfering with the formation of NO radicals at least partly restored normal behavior in stressed mice. These data suggest that tyrosine nitrosylation might contribute to the pathogenesis of MDD and targeting this process might contribute to the treatment of MDD.

AB  - Geniposide (GE), an iridoid glycoside from Gardenia jasminoides J.Ellis, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidepressant, and neuroprotective properties. The excessive presence of corticosterone (CORT) can lead to neurotoxicity and inflict harm upon nerve cells. This study aimed to examine GE's neuroprotective effects on CORT-induced damage in PC12 cells. Cells were pre-treated with GE for 3 h, then exposed to CORT for 24 h. Cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage were measured, apoptosis was assessed via flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence was used to detect MAP2 and PSD95 expression. The detection of glutamate (Glu) receptor, BDNF pathway, synaptic plasticity-related protein, and apoptosis pathway were performed using Western blot. The findings indicated that GE effectively prevented the reduction in cell viability, apoptosis, and LDH release caused by CORT. In PC12 cells, the expression of MAP2 and PSD95 were significantly enhanced by GE. Furthermore, GE reduced NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and Bax levels, increased EAAT2/3, Bcl-2, and proteins linked to BDNF and synaptic plasticity, and inhibited Caspase-3 and Caspase-9. GE shows neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic properties against CORT-induced cellular damage through BDNF pathway activation and Bax/Bcl-2 pathway suppression.

AB  - Unaccustomed and/or strenuous eccentric contractions are known to cause delayed-onset muscle soreness. In spite of this fact, their exact cause and mechanism have been unknown for more than 120 years. The exploration of the diverse functionality of the Piezo2 ion channel, as the principal proprioceptive component, and its autonomously acquired channelopathy may bring light to this apparently simple but mysterious pain condition. Correspondingly, the neurocentric non-contact acute compression axonopathy theory of delayed-onset muscle soreness suggests two damage phases affecting two muscle compartments, including the intrafusal (within the muscle spindle) and the extrafusal (outside the muscle spindle) ones. The secondary damage phase in the extrafusal muscle space is relatively well explored. However, the suggested primary damage phase within the muscle spindle is far from being entirely known. The current manuscript describes how the proposed autonomously acquired Piezo2 channelopathy-induced primary damage could be the initiating transient neural switch in the unfolding of delayed-onset muscle soreness. This primary damage results in a transient proprioceptive neural switch and in a switch from quantum mechanical free energy-stimulated ultrafast proton-coupled signaling to rapid glutamate-based signaling along the muscle-brain axis. In addition, it induces a transient metabolic switch or, even more importantly, an energy generation switch in Type Ia proprioceptive terminals that eventually leads to a transient glutaminolysis deficit and mitochondrial deficiency, not to mention a force generation switch. In summary, the primary damage or switch is likely an inward unidirectional proton pathway reversal between Piezo2 and its auxiliary ligands, leading to acquired Piezo2 channelopathy.

AB  - Background: To investigate the predictive value of specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE), interleukin-6 (IL -6) and regulatory T cells (Treg) on the risk of postoperative recurrence in patients with eosinophilic Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (EcRswNP). Methods: A total of 198 patients with EcRswNP collected to our Hospital from January 2019 to December 2021 were selected as the research subjects. All patients underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery. The patients were selected to recurrence group (RG, n = 48) and nonrecurrence group (NRG, n = 150) on the basis of the recurrence after 1 year of follow-up. The related factors of postoperative recurrence of EcRswNP were analyzed. The ROC was used to analyze the dangerous of sIgE, IL -6 and Treg in predicting postoperative recurrence of EcRswNP patients. Results: The proportion of asthma patients, nasal congestion VAS score, and peripheral blood Eos% content in the RG exceeded that in the NRG, and the Organization Neu % and peripheral blood Neu% levels were less than those in the NRGp (P all < 0.05). The serum sIgE and serum IL6 in the RG were higher than those in the NRG, while the level of peripheral blood Treg was lower than that in the NRG (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that high levels of serum sIgE, serum IL -6 and low Treg levels were risk factors for postoperative recurrence (P < 0.05). ROC showed that the AUC of peripheral blood sIgE level, IL -6 and Treg levels alone in predicting the dangerous of postoperative recurrence in patients with EcRswNP were 0.786, 0.707 and 0.636, respectively (all P < 0.05); The AUC of combined prediction of peripheral blood sIgE, IL -6 and Treg levels for postoperative recurrence dangerous in patients with EcRswNP was 0.973, indicating that the efficacy of jointed prediction was exceed than that of single prediction (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The high levels of sIgE, IL6 and low Treg levels in patients with EcRswNP before operation will increase the risk of postoperative recurrence, which is a risk factor affecting postoperative recurrence, and the three indicators have good predictive value for predicting postoperative recurrence in patients with EcRswNP, and the combination of the three indicators has better value in predicting postoperative recurrence.

AB  - Abnormal tau modifications are one of the main contributors to neurodegenerative processes present during Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, truncated tau by caspase-3, a pathological tau form, affects mitochondrial function and antioxidant regulation, contributing to synaptic and cognitive impairment in AD mouse models. We previously showed that the presence of caspase-3 cleaved tau promotes mitochondrial impairment in neuronal cells, where Cyclophilin-D (CypD) protein could be a crucial element. CypD is considered the master regulator of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, and its ablation prevents neurodegenerative and cognitive damage induced by R-amyloid in mouse models of AD. However, the possible role of CypD in the neurodegenerative processes mediated by caspase-3-cleaved tau has not been explored. Here, we use tau (-/-) and CypD (-/-) knock-out mice that were subjected to right-side hippocampal stereotaxic injection to induce GFP (AAV-Syn-GFP), full-length (AAV-Syn-GFP-T4) or caspase-3-cleaved (AAV-Syn-GFP-T4C3) tau expression. Then, cognitive performance, synaptic architecture, and hippocampal mitochondrial function were evaluated two months later. We observed that caspase-3 cleaved tau expression inducing cognitive decline, vesicle and synaptic protein deregulation, and mitochondrial impairment generated by the mPTP opening. More interestingly, when caspase-3 cleaved tau was expressed in the hippocampus of CypD (-/-) mice, cognitive decline, synaptic impairment, and mitochondrial damage mediated by mPTP were prevented, demonstrating a novel role of CypD in neurodegenerative changes induced by truncated tau in AD.

AB  - In this study, sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) pomace resulting from juice extraction was dried and ground in order to obtain a powder that was further used in bread making. Sea buckthorn pomace, an invaluable by-product of the industry, contains bioactive compounds and dietary fibers that promote health. Dried by-products of sea buckthorn are rich sources of nutritional and bioactive compounds, offering great potential for use as nutraceuticals in animal feed, ingredients in functional food, and the pharmaceutical industry. The utilization of sea buckthorn by-products promotes a circular and sustainable economy by implementing innovative methods and strategic approaches to recover high-value products and minimize waste in multiple ways. For this purpose, three organic sea buckthorn varieties were used, namely Mara (M), Clara (C), and Sorana (S). Further, 6%, 8%, and 10% pomace powder were added to wheat flour to prepare functional bread, and its effects on structural, nutritional, and sensorial characteristics were investigated. The volume, porosity, and elasticity of the obtained bread samples were slightly lower compared to the control sample (white bread). The nutritional characteristics revealed that the developed bread presented higher antioxidant activity, polyphenolic content, and crude fiber compared to the control sample. The acceptability test showed that consumer preferences were directed toward the bread samples containing 8% sea buckthorn powder, regardless of the variety, while the addition of 10% pomace powder led to major sensorial changes. The results of this study showed that sea buckthorn pomace powder can be successfully incorporated into bread in order to obtain a food product with enhanced properties.

AB  - To investigate how dysregulated transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPCs) are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we challenged primary neurons with amyloid-beta (A beta). Both the naturally secreted or synthetic A beta oligomers (A beta Os) induced long-lasting increased TRPC3 and downregulated the TRPC6 expression in mature excitatory neurons (CaMKII alpha-high) via a Ca2+-dependent calcineurin-coupled NFAT transcriptionally and calpain-mediated protein degradation, respectively. The TRPC3 expression was also found to be upregulated in pyramidal neurons of human AD brains. The selective downregulation of the Trpc6 gene induced synaptotoxicity, while no significant effect was observed from the Trpc3-targeting siRNA, suggesting potentially differential roles of TRPC3 and 6 in modulating the synaptic morphology and functions. Electrophysiological recordings of mouse hippocampal slices overexpressing TRPC3 revealed increased neuronal hyperactivity upon the TRPC3 channel activation by its agonist. Furthermore, the A beta O-mediated synaptotoxicity appeared to be positively correlated with the degrees of the induced dendritic Ca2+ flux in neurons, which was completely prevented by the co-treatment with two pyrazole-based TRPC3-selective antagonists Pyr3 or Pyr10. Taken together, our findings suggest that the aberrantly upregulated TRPC3 is another ion channel critically contributing to the process of A beta O-induced Ca2+ overload, neuronal hyperexcitation, and synaptotoxicity, thus representing a potential therapeutic target of AD.

AB  - How to efficiently regenerate jawbone defects caused by trauma, jaw osteomyelitis, tumors, or intrinsic genetic diseases is still challenging. Ectoderm-derived jawbone defect has been reported to be regenerated by selectively recruiting cells from its embryonic origin. Therefore, it is important to explore the strategy for promoting ectoderm-derived jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (JBMMSCs) on the repair of homoblastic jaw bone. Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is an important growth factor and is essential in the process of proliferation, migration and differentiation of nerve cells. However, whether GDNF promoting the function of JBMMSCs and the relative mechanism are not clear. Our results showed that activated astrocytes and GDNF were induced in the hippocampus after mandibular jaw defect. In addition, the expression of GDNF in the bone tissue around the injured area was also significantly increased after injury. Data from in vitro experiments demon-strated that GDNF could effectively promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of JBMMSCs. Furthermore, when implanted in the defected jaw bone, JBMMSCs pretreated with GDNF exhibited enhanced repair effect compared with JBMMSCs without treatment. Mechanical studies found that GDNF induced the expression of Nr4a1 in JBMMSCs, activated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and then enhanced the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation capacities of JBMMSCs.

AB  - titania (titanium dioxide, TiO2) is known to induce neurotoxicity and CNS dysfunctions. Numerous studies have explored the neuroprotective effects of melatonin against neurotoxicity. This study evaluates the potential of melatonin to protect against titania-induced neurotoxicity and the role of the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. One group of animals were treated with Titania (0.045 and 0.075 g/rat) alone while the other with added melatonin (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg) and behavioral alterations were assessed using OFT (open field test). Neurochemical and histopathological changes were also studied in the hippocampus by analyzing kelch ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and antioxidant response element (ARE). It was seen that the animals with added Melatonin had improved behavioral scores in the OFT, like anxiety and motor dysfunction triggered by TiO2. Melatonin also reduced lipid peroxidation, ROS, GSSG, IL1 beta, TNF alpha, Bax, and Keap1 levels, but boosted GSH, GPx, GR, SOD,IL10,IL4, Bcl2, Nrf2, and ARE levels and improved quadruple mitochondrial enzyme complex activity in titania-treated animals. Histopathological examination showed melatonin induced cytoprotection against vacuolization and necrosis in granular cells of DG and pyramidal cells of CA1 area of the hippocampus. In our study, pretreatment with melatonin reduced titania-induced neurotoxicity in the hippocampus through a mechanism potentially mediated by the Keap-1/Nrf2/ARE pathway.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is not only a common symptom of major depressive disorder, but also a more common residual symptom after antidepressant treatment and a risk factor for chronic and recurrent disease. The disruption of hypocretin regulation is known to be associated with depression, however, their exact correlation is remains to be elucidated. Hypocretin-1 levels are increased in the plasma and hypothalamus from chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model mice. Excessive hypocretin-1 conducted with hypocretin receptor 1 (HCRTR1) reduced lactate production and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), thus impairing adult hippocampal neuroplasticity, and cognitive impairment in CUMS model. Subsequently, it is found that HCRTR1 antagonists can reverse these changes. The direct effect of hypocretin-1 on hippocampal lactate production and cognitive behavior is further confirmed by intraventricular injection of hypocretin-1 and microPET-CT in rats. In addition, these mechanisms are further validated in astrocytes and neurons in vitro. Moreover, these phenotypes and changes in molecules of lactate transport pathway can be duplicated by specifically knockdown of HCRTR1 in hippocampal astrocytes. In summary, the results provide molecular and functional insights for involvement of hypocretin-1-HCRTR1 in altered cognitive function in depression.
   This diagram illustrates the mechanism by which hypocretin-1 contributes to cognitive impairment in depression. The study's findings demonstrate that elevated hypocretin-1 suppress HIF-1a expression in hippocampal astrocytes, resulting in decreased lactate production and release from astrocytes. This ultimately impairs neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, thereby contributing to depressive-like behavior and cognitive deficits. image

AB  - Trypanosomiasis (Surra) is a parasitic and zoonotic disease caused by Trypanosoama evansi, transmitted by insect vectors Tabanus and Stomoxys mechanically. The aim of the present study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of various trypanosidal drugs against trypanosomiasis in Thoroughbred horses. Horses having clinical signs of trypanosomiasis were diagnosed through blood smear through a microscope were selected for this study. The infected horses were divided into three experimental groups for therapeutic trials Animals in group A were treated with a single dose of quinapyramine sulphate @ 3000mg/ml per 50 /kg body weight; group B was treated with a single dose of isometamedium chloride Hydrochloride@ 0.5 mg/2.5 ml of 1% solution per 50/kg body weight; group C was treated with a single dose of diminazene aceturate@ 2360 mg/15 ml per 100/kg. Results revealed that significant (P<0.0001) decline in the values of erythrocyte counts (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), platelets (PLT) and a significant (P<0.0001) increase in white blood cells (WBC), granulocytes, and monocytes in infected horses as compared to healthy ones. Therapeutic trials indicated that quinapyramine sulphate that showed 100% efficacy at 21th days had significantly higher than isometamedium chloride and diminazene aceturate (95.83 and 75% efficacy, respectively). The hematological parameters of recovered horses were significantly restored to normal values on day 21 after treatment. It is concluded that quinapyramine sulphate is the drug of choice against trypanosomiasis in Thoroughbred horses.

AB  - Precise neuromodulation is critical for interrogating cellular communication and treating neurological diseases. Nanoscale transducers have emerged as effective interfaces to exert photothermal effects and modulate neural activities with a high spatiotemporal resolution. Ideal materials for this application should possess strong light absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and great biocompatibility for clinical translation. Here, we show that the structurally designed 3D Au superparticles with a highly branched morphology can be promising candidates for nongenetic and remote neuromodulation. The structure-induced blackbody-like absorption endows Au superparticles with photothermal conversion efficiency over 90%, much higher than that of conventional Au nanorods. With the biocompatible polydopamine ligands, Au superparticles can be readily interfaced with primary mouse hippocampal neurons and other cells and can photostimulate or inhibit their activities in both cell networks or with a single-cell resolution. These findings highlight the importance of structural designs as powerful tools to promote the performance of plasmonic materials in neuromodulation and related research of neuroscience and neuroengineering.

AB  - Cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent, can be used to treat cervical cancer (CC), but cisplatin resistance is increased during the cisplatin treatment. Long non-coding RNA PGM5-AS1 reportedly participates in CC tumorigenesis; however, its role in CC patients with cisplatin resistance has not been revealed. The present aimed to examine the role of PGM5-AS1 in modulating cisplatin resistance in CC. The PGM5-AS1 expression in CC tissues from 29 patients was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The cisplatin-resistant CC cells were constructed by using increasing cisplatin concentrations. The effects of cisplatin resistance interacting with PGM5-AS1 on CC cell malignancy were confirmed by performing Cell Counting Kit 8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays. The key proteins of the Hippo and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways were evaluated by Western blotting. PGM5-AS1 with low expression in CC tissues was correlated to higher International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and cisplatin resistance. PGM5-AS1 overexpression suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of cisplatin-resistant CC cells. Additionally, PGM5-AS1 overexpression in cisplatin-resistant CC cells could induce the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway and the inactivation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. PGM5-AS1 enhanced the CC cell's sensitivity to cisplatin by activating the Hippo signaling pathway and inactivating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Our study data may provide a novel therapeutic biomarker to overcome cisplatin resistance in CC treatment.

AB  - Excessive stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of mood disorders such as depression. Fermented natural products have recently attracted attention because of their health benefits. We evaluated the antidepressant-like efficacy of fermented Perilla frutescens (FPF), and its underlying mechanisms, in sleep deprivation (SD)-induced stress mice. SD-stressed mice revealed a remarkable increase in the immobility time in both forced swimming test and tail suspension test; this increase was ameliorated by treatment with FPF at doses of 100 and 150 mg/kg. FPF treatment also reduced the level of stress hormones such as corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Additionally, FPF increased the levels of serotonin and dopamine which were significantly decreased in the brain tissues of SD-stressed mice. The increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL1 beta, and the decreased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the stressed mice were significantly reversed by FPF treatment. Furthermore, FPF also increased phosphorylation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Among the six components isolated from FPF, protocatechuic acid and luteolin-7-O-glucuronide exhibited significant antidepressant-like effects, suggesting that they are major active components. These findings suggest that FPF has therapeutic potential for SD-induced stress, by correcting dysfunction of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and modulating the BDNF/TrkB/ERK/CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - Cholesterol is stored as cholesteryl esters by the enzymes acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases/sterol O:acyltransferases (ACATs/SOATs). ACAT1 blockade (A1B) ameliorates the pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and cholesterol loading. However, the mediators involved in transmitting the effects of A1B in immune cells is unknown. Microglial Acat1/Soat1 expression is elevated in many neurodegenerative diseases and in acute neuroinflammation. We evaluated LPS-induced neuroinflammation experiments in control vs. myeloid-specific Acat1/Soat1 knockout mice. We also evaluated LPS-induced neuroinflammation in microglial N9 cells with and without pre-treatment with K-604, a selective ACAT1 inhibitor. Biochemical and microscopy assays were used to monitor the fate of Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), the receptor at the plasma membrane and the endosomal membrane that mediates pro-inflammatory signaling cascades. In the hippocampus and cortex, results revealed that Acat1/Soat1 inactivation in myeloid cell lineage markedly attenuated LPS-induced activation of pro-inflammatory response genes. Studies in microglial N9 cells showed that pre-incubation with K-604 significantly reduced the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses. Further studies showed that K-604 decreased the total TLR4 protein content by increasing TLR4 endocytosis, thus enhancing the trafficking of TLR4 to the lysosomes for degradation. We concluded that A1B alters the intracellular fate of TLR4 and suppresses its pro-inflammatory signaling cascade in response to LPS.

AB  - Sex-specific differences in behavior have been observed in anxiety and learning in children exposed to prenatal inflammation; however, whether these behaviors manifest differently by age is unknown. This study assesses possible behavioral changes due to in utero inflammation as a function of age in neonatal, juvenile, and adult animals and presents potential molecular targets for observed differences. CD-1 timed pregnant dams were injected in utero with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 mu g/animal) or saline at embryonic day 15. No differences in stress responses were measured by neonatal ultrasonic vocalizations between LPS- and saline-exposed groups of either sex. By contrast, prenatal inflammation caused a male-specific increase in anxiety in mature but not juvenile animals. Juvenile LPS-exposed females had decreased movement in open field testing that was not present in adult animals. We additionally observed improved memory retrieval after in utero LPS in the juvenile animals of both sexes, which in males may be related to a perseverative phenotype. However, there was an impairment of long-term memory in only adult LPS-exposed females. Finally, gene expression analyses revealed that LPS induced sex-specific changes in genes involved in hippocampal neurogenesis. In conclusion, intrauterine inflammation has age- and sex-specific effects on anxiety and learning that may correlate to sex-specific disruption of gene expression associated with neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

TI  - Hippo pathway and NLRP3-driven NETosis in macrophages: Mechanisms of viral pneumoniaaggravation
T2  - CELL DEATH DISCOVERY
LA  - English
AB  - Severe viral infections can precipitate acute lung injury, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. While NETosis serves as an important defense mechanism against pathogens and viruses, its excessive or dysregulated activation may contribute to pulmonary damage. In this study, elevated levels of NETosis were detected in the peripheral blood of patients with viral pneumonia. To further investigate the relationship between NETosis and virus-induced acute lung injury, a murine model was established using intratracheal administration of poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA that mimics viral infection. NETosis biomarkers were assessed in both patients and poly(I:C)-stimulated mice. In addition, we examined the role of the Hippo signaling pathway and its downstream mediators, including inflammatory factors and chemokines. Enhanced NETosis and activation of the Hippo pathway were observed in the lungs of poly(I:C)-treated mice, along with elevated levels of IL-1 beta in isolated macrophages. These effects were mitigated by Hippo pathway inhibitors. Co-culture experiments confirmed that IL-1 beta promotes NETosis, while NLRP3, acting downstream of the Hippo pathway, was responsible for IL-1 beta secretion. Patients with viral pneumonia showed increased NLRP3 and IL-1 beta expression in monocyte-derived macrophages compared to healthy controls. Overall, our findings indicate that activation of the Hippo pathway in macrophages during poly(I:C) exposure upregulates NLRP3 and IL-1 beta expression, thereby promoting NETosis and exacerbating virus-induced lung injury. This study highlights a potential therapeutic target to reduce lung damage caused by viral infections.

AB  - A proper reference gene (RG) is required to reliably measure mRNA levels in biological samples via quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Various experimental paradigms require specific and stable RGs. In studies using rodent models of brain ischaemia, a variety of genes, such as beta-actin (Actb), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (Hprt1), peptidyl-propyl isomerase A (Ppia) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), are used as RGs. However, most of these genes have not been validated in specific experimental settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time- and brain region-dependent expression of RG candidates in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). The following genes were selected: Actb, Hprt1, Ppia, Gapdh, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta (Ywhaz) and beta-2 microglobulin (B2m). Focal cerebral ischaemia was induced by 90 min of tMCAO in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Expression was investigated at four time points (12 and 24 h; 3 and 7 days) and in three brain areas (the frontal cortex, hippocampus and dorsal striatum) within the ischaemic brain hemisphere. The RT-qPCR results were analysed using variance analysis and the Delta Ct, GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper methods. Data from these algorithms were ranked using the geometric mean of ranks of each analysis. Ppia, Hprt1 and Ywhaz were the most stable genes across the analysed brain areas and time points. B2m and Actb exhibited the greatest fluctuations, and the results for Gapdh were ambiguous.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the gold-standard treatment for patients with depressive episodes, but the underlying mechanisms for antidepressant response and procedure-induced cognitive side effects have yet to be elucidated. Such mechanisms may be complex and involve certain ECT parameters and brain regions. Regarding parameters, the electrode placement (right unilateral or bitemporal) determines the geometric shape of the electric field (E-field), and amplitude determines the E-field magnitude in select brain regions (e.g., hippocampus). Here, we aim to determine the relationships between hippocampal E-field strength, hippocampal neuroplasticity, and antidepressant and cognitive outcomes. We used hippocampal E-fields and volumes generated from a randomized clinical trial that compared right unilateral electrode placement with different pulse amplitudes (600, 700, and 800 mA). Hippocampal E-field strength was variable but increased with each amplitude arm. We demonstrated a linear relationship between right hippocampal E-field and right hippocampal neuroplasticity. Right hippocampal neuroplasticity mediated right hippocampal E-field and antidepressant outcomes. In contrast, right hippocampal E-field was directly related to cognitive outcomes as measured by phonemic fluency. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to determine that the maximal right hippocampal E-field associated with cognitive safety was 112.5 V/m. Right hippocampal E-field strength was related to the whole-brain ratio of E-field strength per unit of stimulation current, but this whole-brain ratio was unrelated to antidepressant or cognitive outcomes. We discuss the implications of optimal hippocampal E-field dosing to maximize antidepressant outcomes and cognitive safety with individualized amplitudes.

AB  - The onset and exacerbation of dementia have been observed in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of aging on the cognitive function in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Pathogen-free KK-Ay/TaJcl mice were used in this study. The cognitive abilities and memory declined in the mice and worsened in the 50-week-olds. The levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), receptor for AGE (RAGE), and Iba1 in the hippocampus were increased in the mice compared to those in the control mice. Hippocampal levels of CC-chemokine receptor 7 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, which are from M1-type macrophages that shift from microglia, were higher in KK-Ay/TaJcl mice than in control mice. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and nitric oxide (NO) levels secreted by M1-type macrophages were similarly elevated in the mice and were even higher at the age of 50 weeks. NO levels were markedly elevated in the 50-week-old mice. In contrast, differentiation of CD163 and arginase-1 did not change in both mouse types. Memory and learning declined with age in diabetic mice, and the AGEs/RAGE/M1-type macrophage/NO and TNF-a pathways played an important role in exacerbating memory and learning in those mice.

AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR), which comprises three branches: PERK, ATF6 & alpha;, and IRE1, is a major mechanism for maintaining cellular proteostasis. Many studies show that the UPR is a major player in regulating neuron viability and function in various neurodegenerative diseases; however, its role in neurodegeneration is highly controversial. Moreover, while evidence suggests activation of the UPR in neurons under normal conditions, deficiency of individual branches of the UPR has no major effect on brain neurons in animals. It remains unclear whether or how the UPR participates in regulating neuronal proteostasis under normal and disease conditions. To determine the physiological role of the UPR in neurons, we generated mice with double deletion of PERK and ATF6 & alpha; in neurons. We found that inactivation of PERK and ATF6 & alpha; in neurons caused lysosomal dysfunction (as evidenced by decreased expression of the V0a1 subunit of v-ATPase and decreased activation of cathepsin D), impairment of autophagic flux (as evidenced by increased ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and increased p62 level), and accumulation of p-tau and A & beta;42 in the hippocampus, and led to impairment of spatial memory, impairment of hippocampal LTP, and hippocampal degeneration in adult mice. These results suggest that the UPR is required for maintaining neuronal proteostasis (particularly tau and A & beta; homeostasis) and the viability and function of neurons in the hippocampus of adult mice.

AB  - Organotypic slice culture models surpass conventional in vitro methods in many aspects. They retain all tissue-resident cell types and tissue hierarchy. For studying multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases such as tauopathies, it is crucial to maintain cellular crosstalk in an accessible model system. Organotypic slice cultures from postnatal tissue are an established research tool, but adult tissue-originating systems are missing, yet necessary, as young tissue-originating systems cannot fully model adult or senescent brains. To establish an adult-originating slice culture system for tauopathy studies, we made hippocampal slice cultures from transgenic 5-month-old hTau.P301S mice. In addition to the comprehensive characterization, we set out to test a novel antibody for hyperphosphorylated TAU (pTAU, B6), with and without a nanomaterial conjugate. Adult hippocampal slices retained intact hippocampal layers, astrocytes, and functional microglia during culturing. The P301S-slice neurons expressed pTAU throughout the granular cell layer and secreted pTAU to the culture medium, whereas the wildtype slices did not. Additionally, cytotoxicity and inflammation-related determinants were increased in the P301S slices. Using fluorescence microscopy, we showed target engagement of the B6 antibody to pTAU-expressing neurons and a subtle but consistent decrease in intracellular pTAU with the B6 treatment. Collectively, this tauopathy slice culture model enables measuring the extracellular and intracellular effects of different mechanistic or therapeutic manipulations on TAU pathology in adult tissue without the hindrance of the blood-brain barrier.

AB  - Inflammation is considered a possible cause of cognitive decline during aging. This study investigates the influence of physical activity and social isolation in old mice on their cognitive functions and inflammation. The Barnes maze task was performed to assess spatial learning and memory in 3, 9, 15, 24, and 28 months old male C57BL/6 mice as well as following voluntary wheel running (VWR) and social isolation (SI) in 20 months old mice. Inflammatory gene expression was analyzed in hippocampal and colonic samples by qPCR. Cognitive decline occurs in mice between 15 and 24 months of age. VWR improved cognitive functions while SI had negative effects. Expression of inflammatory markers changed during aging in the hippocampus (Il1a/Il6/S100b/Iba1/Adgre1/Cd68/Itgam) and colon (Tnf/Il6/Il1ra/P2rx7). VWR attenuates inflammaging specifically in the colon (Ifng/Il10/Ccl2/S100b/Iba1), while SI regulates intestinal Il1b and Gfap. Inflammatory markers in the hippocampus were not altered following VWR and SI. The main finding of our study is that both the hippocampus and colon exhibit an increase in inflammatory markers during aging, and that voluntary wheel running in old age exclusively attenuates intestinal inflammation. Based on the existence of the gut-brain axis, our results extend therapeutic approaches preserving cognitive functions in the elderly to the colon.

TI  - Sex and region-specific disruption of autophagy and mitophagy in Alzheimer's disease: linking cellular dysfunction to cognitive decline
T2  - CELL DEATH DISCOVERY
LA  - English
KW  - AMYLOID-BETA
KW  - BNIP3
AB  - Macroautophagy and mitophagy are critical processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet their links to behavioral outcomes, particularly sex-specific differences, are not fully understood. This study investigates autophagic (LC3B-II, SQSTM1) and mitophagic (BNIP3L, BNIP3, BCL2L13) markers in the cortex and hippocampus of male and female 3xTg-AD mice, using western blotting, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and behavioral tests (novel object recognition and novel object placement). Significant sex-specific differences emerged: female 3xTg-AD mice exhibited autophagosome accumulation due to impaired degradation in the cortex, while males showed fewer autophagosomes, especially in the hippocampus, without significant degradation changes. TEM analyses demonstrated variations in mitochondrial and mitophagosome numbers correlated with memory outcomes. Females had enhanced mitophagy, with higher BNIP3L and BCL2L13 levels, whereas males showed elevated BNIP3 dimers. Cognitive deficits in females correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction in the cortex, while in males, higher LC3B-II levels associated positively with cognitive performance, suggesting protective autophagy effects. Using machine learning, we predicted mitophagosome and mitochondrial numbers based on behavioral data, pioneering a predictive approach to cellular outcomes in AD. These findings underscore the importance of sex-specific regulation of autophagy and mitophagy in AD and support personalized therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways. Integrating machine learning emphasizes its potential to advance neurodegenerative research.Sex-specific differences in autophagy and mitophagy regulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are highlighted. Female 3xTg-AD mice show autophagosome accumulation and cognitive deficits, while males exhibit variations in mitophagy markers and behavior.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is known to be an essential target in protecting against ischaemic brain injury. In this study, using a vascular dementia (VaD) animal model induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO), we evaluated the effect and mechanism of 17 beta-oestradiol (E2) against VaD by inhibiting ERS at the early stage (14 d, 21 d, 28 d) and late stage (3 m) after BCCAO in the hippocampal CA1 region of ovariectomized rats. The results showed that the activation of the PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-CHOP axis, a typical ERS pathway, was significantly increased at the early and late stages after BCCAO. JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)cJun, a pro-death pathway, also displayed the same pattern as the ERS axis. E2 treatment profoundly suppressed the impairments caused by BCCAO. Further mechanistic studies revealed that cerebral blood flow (CBF) was sharply decreased at 14 d and returned to the normal level at 21 d after BCCAO. E2 could not change CBF, while it unexpectedly enhanced the ability to carry oxygen. This is evidenced by the fact that the protein expression of haemoglobin alpha/beta (H alpha/beta), an oxygen carrier, robustly increased at BCCAO 21 d and 3 m after E2 treatment. The oxygen carrier increased strongly after 21 d and 3 m of BCCAO treated with E2. Moreover, E2 correspondingly enhanced the protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF 1 alpha) in both the early and late stage after BCCAO in the hippocampal CA1 region. Finally, E2 administration markedly decreased the activities of caspase-8, caspase-3, and caspase-12 and increased the number of NeuN-positive cells. These findings suggest that E2 serves as a neuroprotectant to alleviate VaD by suppressing ERS injury involving the haemoglobin/HIF 1 alpha signalling pathway.

AB  - Accurately segmenting the hippocampus from magnetic resonance (MR) brain images is a crucial step in studying brain disorders. However, this task is challenging due to the low signal contrast of hippocampal images, the irregular shape, and small structural size of the hippocampi. In recent years, several deep convolutional networks have been proposed for hippocampus segmentation, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance. These methods typically use large image patches for training the network, as larger patches are beneficial for capturing long- range contextual information. However, this approach increases the computational burden and overlooks the significance of the boundary region. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method for hippocampus segmentation with boundary region refinement. Our method involves two main steps. First, we propose a convolutional network that takes large image patches as input for initial segmentation. Then, we extract small image patches around the hippocampal boundary for training the second convolutional neural network, which refines the segmentation in the boundary regions. We validate our proposed method on a publicly available dataset and demonstrate that it significantly improves the performance of convolutional neural networks that use single-size image patches as input. In conclusion, our study proposes a novel method for hippocampus segmentation, which improves upon the current state-of-the-art methods. By incorporating a boundary refinement step, our approach achieves higher accuracy in hippocampus segmentation and may facilitate research on brain disorders.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a multifactorial inflammatory disease characterized by high prevalence and morbidity.Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP).Since Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) signaling has been shown to regulate the EMT process in other diseases.In this study, we investigated the effect of NTSR1 on the EMT process in CRS, and explored whether these regulations could serve as potential drug targets.Our results demonstrated that NTS and NTSR1 expression was significantly elevated in CRS mice who were accompanied with mucosal thickening, goblet cell hyperplasia, glandular hyperplasia, and dense infiltration of inflammatory cells.Treatment with NTSR1 inhibitor SR48692 significantly improved the nasal symptoms and pathological conditions of sinus mucosa tissues in CRS mice.In addition, SR48692 treatment significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) and IL-17. Moreover, we observed that treatment with SR48692 significantly reduced the expression of a-SMA and vimentin, while increased that of E-cadherin, suggesting inhibition of EMT.Mechanistically, we further found that SR48692 could downregulate Wnt3a and beta-catenin mRNA and protein levels impairing the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.Our results indicate that NTSR1 signaling promotes progression of EMT in mice with CRS may through Wnt3a/beta-catenin pathway, underlining the promise of NTSR1 as a potential target for CRS therapy.

AB  - The development of antiepileptic drugs is still a long process. In this study, heparin-modified superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (UFH-SPIONs) were prepared, and their antiepileptic effect and underlying mechanism were investigated. UFH-SPIONs are stable, homogeneous nanosystems with antioxidant enzyme activity that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enriched in hippocampal epileptogenic foci. The pretreatment with UFH-SPIONs effectively prolonged the onset of seizures and reduced seizure severity after lithium/pilocarpine (LP)-induced seizures in rats. The pretreatment with UFH-SPIONs significantly decreased the expression of inflammatory factors in hippocampal tissues, including IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. LP-induced oxidative stress in hippocampal tissues was in turn reduced upon pretreatment with UFH-SPIONs, as evidenced by an increase in the levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and a decrease in the level of lipid peroxidation (MDA). Moreover, the LP-induced upregulation of apoptotic cells was decreased upon pretreatment with UFH-SPIONs. Together, these observations suggest that the pretreatment with UFH-SPIONs ameliorates LP-induced seizures and downregulates the inflammatory response and oxidative stress, which exerts neuronal protection during epilepsy.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex disorder caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. Mounting evidence suggests the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathology of SZ. Accordingly, the current study set out to investigate the possible implication of the miR-182/183 cluster, as well as its associated mechanism in the progression of SZ. Firstly, rat models of SZ were established by intraperitoneal injection of MK-801. Moreover, rat primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to MK-801 to simulate injury of hippocampal neurons. The expression of miR-182/183 or its putative target gene DCC was manipulated to examine their effects on SZ in vitro and in vivo. It was found that miR-182 and miR-183 were both highly expressed in peripheral blood of SZ patients and hippocampal tissues of SZ rats. In addition, the miR-182/183 cluster could target DDC and downregulate the expression of DDC. On the other hand, inhibition of the miR-182/183 cluster ameliorated SZ, as evidenced by elevated serum levels of NGF and BDNF, along with reductions in spontaneous activity, serum GFAP levels, and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, DCC was found to activate the axon guiding pathway and influence synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons. Collectively, our findings highlighted that inhibition of the miR-182/183 cluster could potentially attenuate SZ through DCC-dependent activation of the axon guidance pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of the miR-182/183 cluster may represent a potential target for the SZ treatment.

AB  - Neuroinflammation and intestinal microbiota cause pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. This study investigates the effects of wheat embryo globulin nutrient (WEGN) on depression, neuroinflammation, and intestinal microbial disorder caused by AD and its protective mechanism on cognitive impairment. Results demonstrated that rats in the WEGN group have lower feed intake but higher body weight than those in the control group. Notably, rats in the WEGN group have a higher number of cross grids and uprights and a smaller amount of fecal particles than those in the control group. Biochemical examinations revealed that rats in the WEGN group had lower expression of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in hippocampus tissue and the expression of genes and proteins related to the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in AD rats was down-regulated compared to those in the control group. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results demonstrated that WEGN treatment inhibits the increase of Erysipelotrichaceae, Erysipelatoclostridium, Erysipelotrichaceae, Corynebacterium, and Frisingicoccus, and the reduction of Lactobacillus in AD rats. WEGN has potential value as a practical food in alleviating neuroinflammation-related diseases such as AD.

AB  - Impaired olfactory function may be associated with the development of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety; however, knowledge on the mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders is incomplete. A reversible model of olfactory dysfunction, zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) nasal-treated mice, exhibit depression-like behavior accompanying olfactory dysfunction. Therefore, we investigated olfactory function and depression-like behaviors in ZnSO4-treated mice using the buried food finding test and tail suspension test, respectively; investigated the changes in the hippocampal microglial activity and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by immunohistochemistry; and evaluated the inflammation and microglial polarity related-proteins in the hippocampus using western blot study. On day 14 after treatment, ZnSO4-treated mice showed depression-like behavior in the tail suspension test and recovery of the olfactory function in the buried food finding test. In the hippocampus of ZnSO4-treated mice, expression levels of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), cluster of differentiation 40, inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cleaved caspase-3, as well as the number of Iba1-positive cells and cell body size increased, and arginase-1 expression and neurogenesis decreased. Except for the increased IL-6, these changes were prevented by a microglia activation inhibitor, minocycline. The findings suggest that neuroinflammation due to polarization of M1-type hippocampal microglia is involved in depression accompanied with olfactory dysfunction.

AB  - The psychoactive effects of new synthetic cannabinoids (SCs), MDMB-4en-PINACA, are being marketed as a blend of herbs and spices. This study aims to determine the behavioral, neurochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical alterations associated with the acute toxicity of MDMB-4en-PINACA compounds. Methods: Adult male albino rats were administered various toxic doses of the drug (1.5, 3, and 6 mg/kg), and behavioral studies were conducted 2 and 24 h later; animals were then sacrificed. Histopathological and neurochemical examinations were performed. Two hours after intraperitoneal. Results: Intraperitoneal injection of MDMB-4en-PINACA, horizontal movement, the number of stops, and mobility ratio were significantly impaired, along with coordination and balance. In addition, it led to a decline in spatial learning and memory, and neurotransmitter concentrations decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Further examination of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus histopathology revealed pathological degeneration of small pyramidal cells. Conclusion: Thus, these findings revealed that MDMB-4en-PINACA interferes with hippocampal function and impairs cognitive performance, highlighting the cognitive risk associated with SC abuse.

AB  - Introduction: The complement response activates upon reperfusion in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and contributes to excessive neuroinflammation and worse outcomes. C5a is a powerful anaphylatoxin central to each of the complement pathways, and its engagement with C5aR1 is directly tied to brain injury and neuronal death. Reasoning C5aR1 antagonism can decrease excessive neuroinflammation and thereby improve neurological and functional outcomes, we tested this hypothesis in a rat model of HIE with PMX205, a small molecule that inhibits C5a-C5aR1 interaction. Methods: Term-equivalent pups (P10-12) were subjected to mild-moderate HIE by Vannucci's method and treated with PMX205. We compared motor and cognitive outcomes with two behavioral tests each (food handling and accelerod; novel object recognition [NOR] and open field) to improve the accuracy of our conclusions. Results: Improvements were observed in fine motor function, balance, and exploratory behaviors, but little to no improvement in recognition memory and gross motor function. Lesion area and histological assessments showed robust cortical neuroprotection from treatment but persistent injury to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Better structural and functional outcomes were seen within 1 day of treatment, suggesting C5aR1 antagonism beyond the latent injury phase may impair recovery. In a dose-response experiment, cerebral area loss from injury was improved only in female rats, suggesting underlying sexual dimorphisms in the complement response. Conclusion: These results demonstrate proof-of-concept for targeting C5aR1 signaling in neonatal HIE with PMX205 and underscore the role of sex in hypoxic-ischemic injury.
   In this study, we tested a new treatment for a disease in babies called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE is caused by restricted oxygen and blood flow around the time of birth, and most damage is caused when blood flow is restored. One reason for this is excess inflammation, which happens because a large amount of specific proteins and chemicals are released. Some inflammation is protective, but excessive inflammation injures healthy tissue, and in HIE this contributes to lifelong physical and mental disabilities, even death. The only treatment for HIE is cooling therapy, but even with this treatment many infants still do not survive or live with permanent disability. We mimicked the disease in rats and then gave them a drug that prevents excess inflammation by binding and disabling specific proteins. We measured improvement by comparing physical and mental abilities and brain damage in the treated rats to untreated and normal rats. Overall, the drug improved many but not all skills and parts of the brain harmed by the disease. More testing needs to be done to determine the optimal dose and if there is additional benefit when the drug is combined with cooling therapy. In closing, our results show this treatment warrants further development and could help infants grow up with less hardship and lead better, healthier lives.

AB  - Background Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a central nervous system (CNS) complication and occurs quite frequently after anesthesia, especially in elderly patients. DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3-like (DNMT3L) is an enzymatically inactive regulatory factor that can modulate gene expression via methylation. Few studies specifically focused on the role of DNMT3L in sevoflurane-induced POCD. Objective The cognitive dysfunction was determined by Morris water maze assay. Hippocampal neuron apoptosis was measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Neuron proliferation and apoptosis were measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assay. The expression levels of DNMT3L and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot. Results The sevoflurane-induced POCD aging rat model was established for in vivo study. Suppression of DNA methylation by 5-Aza-2 '-deoxycytidine (5-AZA; a widely used methylation inhibitor) reversed sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction and hippocampal neuron apoptosis in rats. Moreover, sevoflurane enhanced DNMT3L expression and induced methylation of PSD95 promoter in vivo. In vitro, sevoflurane induced neuronal apoptosis and DNMT3L expression to promote PSD95 methylation. Finally, rescue experiments indicated that sevoflurane induced neuron apoptosis by increasing DNMT3L expression and promoting methylation of PDS95 in POCD. Conclusion Sevoflurane induced neuronal apoptosis by increasing DNMT3L expression and promoting methylation of PDS95 in vivo and in vitro, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for POCD.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is the mild cognitive impairment associated with surgery and anesthesia. It is a common surgical complication in the elderly. An important mechanism of PND is the surgically induced neuroinflammation. The interaction between the neuronal surface protein CD200 and its receptor in microglia, CD200R1, is an important regulatory pathway to control neuroinflammation. However, the potential role of the CD200-CD200R1 pathway in the acute period of PND has not been fully investigated. In this study, in a PND mouse model, we first measured the protein expression level of CD200, CD200R1, and the related pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. Then, we investigated cognitive function, neuroinflammation and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) expression after the injection of CD200-Fc (agonist), CD200R1-Fc (antagonist) or IgG1-Fc (vehicle) into lateral ventricle in PND models. Compared with the control group, the expression of CD200 was up-regulated at day 1 after surgery in PND models. The injection of the CD200-Fc into the lateral ventricle could mitigate primed neuroinflammation and cognitive decline, increase the expression of PSD-95 at day 1 after surgery in PND models. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that CD200-CD200R1 signaling was involved in the acute inflammatory process of PND, and activating CD200R1 can inhibit neuroinflammation and attenuate PND. Thus, the CD200-CD200R1 axis is a potential novel target for PND prevention and treatment.

AB  - Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu decoction (HGWD) has been demonstrated to ameliorate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in clinical application. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of HGWD have not been conclusively elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the potential role and mechanism of HGWD on neurological deficits in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Our results showed that HGWD significantly alleviated neurological deficits in MCAO rats, evidenced by high mNSS score, reduced cerebral infarction area, and improved brain pathological injury. Besides, HGWD reduced the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, SOD, MDA and GSH in the brain tissue. Further study suggested that HGWD promoted microglia polarization towards M2 by inhibiting M1 activation (Iba1+/CD16+, iNOS) and enhancing M2 activation (Iba1+/CD206+, Arg-1). Additionally, HGWD increased dendritic spine density and enhanced levels of synapse marker proteins (PSD95, Synapsin I). HGWD also up-regulated Sirt1 expression while inhibited p-NF-kappa B, NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved caspase-1 level in the hippocampus of MCAO rats. Sirt1 specific inhibitor EX527 notably weakened the neuroprotective efficacy of HGWD against cerebral ischemia, and significantly abolished its modulation on microglia polarization and synaptic plasticity in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggested that HGWD ameliorated neuronal injury in ischemic stroke by modulating M2 microglia polarization and synaptic plasticity, at least partially, via regulating Sirt1/NF-kappa B/NLRP3 pathway, further supporting HGWD as a potential therapy for neuroprotection after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Three chondroitin sulfate (CS) analogues with predominant subtypes (A, C, and E) were prepared from engineered Escherichia coli K4 combined with regioselective sulfation. CS with the designed sulfates as the main components was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, elementary analysis, and disaccharide analysis. CS prepared from the native or degraded capsular polysaccharide had molecular weights of 1.55 x 104-1.90 x 104 and 5.6 x 103-7.4 x 103, respectively. We found that CS with dual sulfates promoted the outgrowth and survival of hippocampal neurons, whereas CS with monosulfate had an inhibitory effect. CS interacted with the nerve growth factor (NGF) and tyrosine kinase (TrkA), which activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway to modulate the outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. This work clarified the multiple effects of CS on neurite outgrowth based on nonanimal-sourced glycosaminoglycans, which would benefit efforts in discovering their novel functions and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and threatens the health of the aged population worldwide. In the present study, we investigated cognitive improvement by aloe emodin in aluminum-induced AD rats. We orally administered aluminum chloride (150 mg/kg) to Sprague-Dawley rats for 8 weeks to induce AD. In the 5th to the 8th week, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with AE (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg). Behavioral, histopathological, and biochemical assessments were performed. The results showed that AE alleviated cognitive impairment in aluminum-induced AD rats and inhibited aluminum-induced hippocampal neuronal damage. Furthermore, aloe emodin relieved the aluminum burden in the brain of aluminum-induced AD rats, attenuated the aluminum-induced increase in A beta 42 level and acetylcholinesterase activity, and reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. These effects suggest that the mechanism by which AE alleviates AD-related cognitive impairment is by removal of excess aluminum, decreasing A beta 42 deposition, regulating the cholinergic system, and reducing neuroinflammation.

AB  - Exposure to maternal stress irreversibly impairs neurogenesis of offspring by inducing life-long effects on interaction between neurons and glia under raging differentiation process, culminating in cognitive and neuropsychiatric abnormalities in adulthood. We identified that prenatal exposure to stress-responsive hormone glucocorticoid impaired neurogenesis and induced abnormal behaviors in ICR mice. Then, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural stem cell (NSC) to investigate how neurogenesis deficits occur. Following glucocorticoid treatment, NSC-derived astrocytes were found to be A1-like neurotoxic astrocytes. Moreover, cortisol-treated astrocytic conditioned media (ACM) then specifically downregulated AMPA receptor-mediated glutamatergic synaptic formation and transmission in differentiating neurons, by inhibiting localization of ionotropic glutamate receptor (GluR)1/2 into synapses. We then revealed that downregulated astrocytic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and nuclear fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) of neurons are key pathogenic factors for reducing glutamatergic synaptogenesis. We further confirmed that cortisol-treated ACM specifically decreased the binding of neuronal FGFR1 to the synaptogenic NLGN1 promoter, but this was reversed by FGFR1 restoration. Upregulation of neuroligin 1, which is important in scaffolding GluR1/2 into the postsynaptic compartment, eventually normalized glutamatergic synaptogenesis and subsequent neurogenesis. Moreover, pretreatment of FGF2 elevated neuroligin 1 expression and trafficking of GluR1/2 into the postsynaptic compartment of mice exposed to prenatal corticosterone, improving spatial memory and depression/anxiety-like behaviors. In conclusion, we identified neuroligin 1 restoration by astrocytic FGF2 and its downstream neuronal nuclear FGFR1 as a critical target for preventing prenatal stress-induced dysfunction in glutamatergic synaptogenesis, which recovered both neurogenesis and hippocampal-related behaviors.

AB  - Ischemic cerebrovascular diseases pose significant challenges due to their high mortality, disability rates, and recurrence risk, imposing substantial societal and healthcare burdens. Current treatment modalities, including medication and surgical interventions, have limitations. This study explores the therapeutic potential of anisodine hydrobromide, a neuroprotective compound, with a focus on its interaction with muscarinic receptors (M1-M5) in cerebral ischemic diseases, employing a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model, and microglial HM cells and astrocytes SVG12 as models. Immunohistochemistry comprehensively assessed M1-M5 receptor expression in cerebral arteries, hippocampus, and parenchymal tissues in MCAO rats before and after anisodine hydrobromide administration. Additionally, a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model validated our findings using SVG12 and HM cells. M receptor mechanisms under hypoxia, including calcium ion influx, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and aspartate expression were explored. Anisodine hydrobromide effectively reduced exacerbated M1, M2, M4, and M5 receptor expression in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-treated brain tissues and M2 receptors in H/R-treated cells. Concentration-dependent inhibition of calcium ion influx and ROS levels was observed, elucidating its neuroprotective mechanisms. Under H/R conditions, HM cells exhibited decreased aspartate levels by anisodine hydrobromide, Atropine, and M2 inhibitor treatments. These findings shed light on the modulation of muscarinic receptors, particularly the M2 subtype, by anisodine hydrobromide in cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotective effects observed in this study highlight the promising clinical prospects of anisodine hydrobromide as a potential therapeutic agent for ischemic brain diseases, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms of action.Copyright: (c) 2023 by the C.M.B.

AB  - Synapsin I (SynI) is a synaptic vesicle (SV)-associated phosphoprotein that modulates neurotransmission by controlling SV trafficking. The SynI C-domain contains a highly conserved ATP binding site mediating SynI oligomerization and SV clustering and an adjacent main Ca2+ binding site, whose physiological role is unexplored. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the E373K point mutation irreversibly deletes Ca2+ binding to SynI, still allowing ATP binding, but inducing a destabilization of the SynI oligomerization interface. Here, we analyzed the effects of this mutation on neurotransmitter release and short-term plasticity in excitatory and inhibitory synapses from primary hippocampal neurons. Patch-clamp recordings showed an increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that was totally occluded by exogenous Ca2+ chelators and associated with a constitutive increase in resting terminal Ca2+ concentrations. Evoked EPSC amplitude was also reduced, due to a decreased readily releasable pool (RRP) size. Moreover, in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, we observed a marked impaired recovery from synaptic depression, associated with impaired RRP refilling and depletion of the recycling pool of SVs. Our study identifies SynI as a novel Ca2+ buffer in excitatory terminals. Blocking Ca2+ binding to SynI results in higher constitutive Ca2+ levels that increase the probability of spontaneous release and disperse SVs. This causes a decreased size of the RRP and an impaired recovery from depression due to the failure of SV reclustering after sustained high-frequency stimulation. The results indicate a physiological role of Ca2+ binding to SynI in the regulation of SV clustering and trafficking in nerve terminals.

AB  - This study was to explore the application value of chromosome ten (PTEN) - phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) - protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in the treatment of Bupivacaine toxicity to neuronal cells under the regulation of fat emulsion. Neurons in the hippocampus of newborn rats were treated with Bupivacaine and fat emulsion and divided into five groups. The activity and action potential of neurons in each group were measured and Nissl's staining was performed. The results showed that the neuron activity of Bupivacaine group (42.36 +/- 5.48%), Bupivacaine + fat emulsion group (70.23 +/- 3.66%), and Bupivacaine + fat emulsion + PTEN/PI3K/AKT inhibitor group (79.28 +/- 5.14%) was lower than that of the blank group (99.95 +/- 3.42%). The duration of action potential in Bupivacaine group was increased (5.19 +/- 0.48ms) and the frequency of action potential was decreased (13.87 +/- 1.95) compared with the blank group (2.44 +/- 0.37ms, 19.59 +/- 2.14). The duration of the fat emulsion group (2.39 +/- 0.39ms, 19.76 +/- 2.05), Bupivacaine + fat emulsion group (2.88 +/- 0.52ms, 18.53 +/- 1.66), and Bupivacaine + fat emulsion + PTEN/PI3K/AKT inhibitor group (3.43 +/- 0.69ms, 17.57 +/- 1.58) was decreased, but the number of times increased (P < 0.05). In short, the fat emulsion can reverse the toxic effects of Bupivacaine on rat hippocampal neurons by regulating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This study provided a reference for the clinical treatment of the neurotoxicity of Bupivacaine.

AB  - Increased adipogenic differentiation and decreased osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) along with slow self-renewal are pivotal causes for decreased bone formation in senile osteoporosis. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, and are closely related to osteoporosis. Whether circRNAs orchestrate the adipo-osteogenic balance and the proliferation of BMSCs in osteoporosis remains unclear. We found in this study that circSTX12 was abnormally upregulated in bone sections from osteoporosis patients and in BMSCs from aged mice, as well as in later-generation human BMSCs in culture. Knockdown of circSTX12 in BMSCs resulted in enhanced osteogenesis, decreased adipogenesis, and increased proliferation capacity; circSTX12 overexpression had the opposite effect. RNA pull-down and mass spectrometry revealed the interactions between circSTX12 with CBL and LMO7. At the molecular level, circSTX12 regulated cell fate in BMSCs by competitively binding to CBL, reducing the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of MST1 and thereby activating the Hippo pathway, a key regulator of adipo-osteogenic balance. Knockdown of circSTX12 promoted the nuclear localization of YAP. In addition, our findings suggest that LMO7 mediates circSTX12-induced BMSCs proliferation by regulating the transcription of CCNA2, CCNH, and CCND1. In vivo, injection of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to knockdown circSTX12 promoted bone formation in aged mice. Our results provide evidence for circSTX12 as a regulator of adipo-osteogenic differentiation and proliferation of BMSCs through binding to CBL and LMO7, respectively. Targeting circSTX12 may be a novel approach for osteoporosis treatment.

AB  - Iron accumulation in the brain causes oxidative stress, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, and neurodegeneration. We examined the preventive effects of acetylated oligopeptides (AOP) from whey protein on iron-induced hippocampal damage compared to N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). This 5-week study used 40 male albino rats. At the start, all rats received 150 mg/kg/day of oral NAC for a week. The 40 animals were then randomly divided into four groups: Group I (control) received a normal diet; Group II (iron overload) received 60 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal iron dextran 5 days a week for 4 weeks; Group III (NAC group) received 150 mg/kg/day NAC and iron dextran; and Group IV (AOP group) received 150 mg/kg/day AOP and iron dextran. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, spectrophotometry, and qRT-PCR were used to measure MMP-9, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), MDA, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene expression. Histopathological and immunohistochemical detection of nestin, claudin, caspase, and GFAP was also done. MMP-9, TIMP-1, MDA, caspase, and GFAP rose in the iron overload group, while GSH, Nrf2, HO-1, nestin, and claudin decreased. The NAC and AOP administrations improved iron overload-induced biochemical and histological alterations. We found that AOP and NAC can protect the brain hippocampus from iron overload, improve BBB disruption, and provide neuroprotection with mostly no significant difference from healthy controls.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability due to injury worldwide. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is known to significantly contribute to TBI pathophysiology. Glycosaminoglycans, which are long-chain, variably sulfated polysaccharides abundant within the ECM, have previously been shown to be substantially altered after TBI. In this study, we sought to delineate the dynamics of glycosaminoglycan alterations after TBI and discover the precise biologic processes responsible for observed glycosaminoglycan changes after injury. We performed state-of-the art mass spectrometry on brain tissues isolated from mice after TBI or craniotomy-alone. We observed dynamic changes in glycosaminoglycans at Day 1 and 7 post-TBI, with heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronan remaining significantly increased after a week vis-`a-vis craniotomy-alone tissues. We did not observe appreciable changes in circulating glycosaminoglycans in mice after experimental TBI compared to craniotomy-alone nor in patients with TBI and severe polytrauma compared to control patients with mild injuries, suggesting increases in injury site glycosaminoglycans are driven by local synthesis. We subsequently performed an unbiased whole genome transcriptomics analysis on mouse brain tissues 7 days post-TBI and discovered a significant induction of hyaluronan synthase 2, glypican-3, and decorin. The functional role of decorin after injury was further examined through multimodal behavioral testing comparing wild-type and Dcn-/-mice. We discovered that genetic ablation of Dcn led to an overall negative effect of TBI on function, exacerbating motor impairments after TBI. Collectively, our results provide a spatiotemporal characterization of post-TBI glycosaminoglycan alterations in the brain ECM and support an important adaptive role for decorin upregulation after TBI.

KW  - DISEASE
AB  - Delirium is a common psychiatric complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The relief of delirium is considered one of the beneficial ways to treat COPD. However, there are currently no specific drugs that alleviate delirium in COPD patients. Our research aimed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying delirium in COPD mice, while also seeking more effective therapeutic targets. In our study, bioinformatics analysis and qRT PCR were used to identify key factors in the development of delirium in COPD animal models. Open field and elevated plus maze tests were used to detect delirium in mice. Tunel staining and HE staining were used to analyze the apoptosis of mouse hippocampus cells. EdU and CCK-8 experiments were used to analyze PC -12 cells vitality and proliferation. JASPAR online database, dual luciferase reporting experiments, ChIP experiments, and IF staining were used to analyze the interaction between RXRA and PLA2G2A. RXRA is highly expressed in the brain tissue of COPD mice with delirium symptoms. The downregulation of RXRA inhibits the delirium state in COPD mice. This is mainly due to the reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of RXRA. In addition, we also confirmed that RXRA is a transcription factor of PLA2G2A. RXRA has an inhibitory effect on the expression of PLA2G2A. In vitro experiments have confirmed that inhibition of the RXRA/PLA2G2A axis reduces cell apoptosis, thereby alleviating the occurrence and development of delirium in COPD mice. Inhibition of the RXRA/PLA2G2A axis reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell apoptosis. This process alleviates the development of delirium in COPD mice.

AB  - Increasing evidence implicates astrocytic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive cognitive loss. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques is a histopathological hallmark of AD and associated with increased astrocyte reactivity. In APP/PS1 mice modelling established AD (9 months), we now show an altered astrocytic morphology and enhanced activity of astrocytic hemichannels, mainly composed by connexin 43 (Cx43). Hemichannel activity in hippocampal astrocytes is also increased in two models of early AD: (1) mice with intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of A beta(1-42), and (2) hippocampal slices superfused with A beta(1-42) peptides. In hippocampal gliosomes of APP/PS1 mice, Cx43 levels were increased, whereas mice administered icv with A beta(1-42) only displayed increased Cx43 phosphorylation levels. This suggests that hemichannel activity might be differentially modulated throughout AD progression. Additionally, we tested if adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) blockade reversed alterations of astrocytic hemichannel activity and found that the pharmacological blockade or genetic silencing (global and astrocytic) of A(2A)R prevented A beta-induced hemichannel dysregulation in hippocampal slices, although A(2A)R genetic silencing increased the activity of astroglial hemichannels in control conditions. In primary cultures of astrocytes, A(2A)R-related protective effect was shown to occur through a protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Our results indicate that the dysfunction of hemichannel activity in hippocampal astrocytes is an early event in AD, which is modulated by A(2A)R.

AB  - At present, there is not enough research about the application of liraglutide nano preparations in perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction. Therefore, the purpose of this study is the mechanism of the effect of liraglutide nano preparations on perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction in aged mice. In this study, 140 male SD rats aged 6-8 weeks were used as the research object, and were divided into 4 groups (n=24) according to the random number table method, which were group C (control group), group S (model group), and treatment. Group (low-dose liraglutide pretreated control group) and DS2 group (high-dose liraglutide pretreated control group) were treated with liraglutide anesthesia to establish a cognitive dysfunction model. Morris water maze experiment was conducted 4 days after anesthesia to compare the escape latency and the number of crossings of the original platform in each group; after 4 days of anesthesia, 18 old mice were randomly selected from each group for fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Real Time PCR) and protein Western blotting (Western Blot) was used to determine the mRNA and protein levels of Caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 in the hippocampus; the remaining 6 old mice in each group were taken to observe the pathological changes of the hippocampus neurons by transmission electron microscopy . Compared with saline-treated group, the levels of NF-KB, TNF-a and IL-1 beta protein in mice treated with liraglutide decreased and IkB increased significantly (p < 0.05). Liraglutide intervention may alleviate non-alcoholic fatty liver in diabetic mice by reducing the expression of inflammatory genes in liver tissue, thereby improving neurocognitive dysfunction in mice.

AB  - Via the GSDMD knockout (KO) mice as model, we aimed to determine the roles of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and its crosstalk with apoptosis in regulating high fat high cholesterol (HFHC) diet associated cognitive dysfunction. Wild type (WT) and GSDMD KO mice were divided into 4 groups, i.e. WT control (WTCON), WT fed with HFHC (WTHFHC), GSDMD KO control (KOCON), GSDMD KO HFHC (KOHFHC). Compared to the KOCON group, mice from the KOHFHC group demonstrated the worst learning and memory disabilities. In the hippocampus, p-Tau ser404, RIPK1/RIP, cleaved caspase-3 and apoptosis rate were increased, while BDNF and p-CREB were reduced from the KOHFHC group. In the cortex, p-Tau ser404, p-Tau ser396, RIPK1/RIP, cleaved caspase-8 and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly increased, while BDNF, synaptophysin were reduced from KOHFHC group. RNA sequencing analysis showed that 2 pathways closely related to apoptosis were significantly upregulated from KOHFHC group compared to KOCON group, including apoptosis and positive regulation of execution phase of apoptosis. The combination of palmitic acid with LDC7559 further increased the number of apoptotic cells and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression compared to vehicle in BV2 cells and HT22 cells. In conclusion, knocking out GSDMD gene in mice had no notable effects on learning and memory abilities under normal diet, but notably led to cognitive dysfunction when stimulated by a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet. The inhibition of pyroptosis may unexpectedly compensate for the activation of exogenous apoptotic pathways, this might be associated with worsening of tau phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation.

AB  - To investigate the effect of the AGEs-RAGE-PP2A axis on cognitive impairment (CI) after chronic heart failure (CHF). Mice were divided into six groups: Sham, TAC, Sham+RAGE(-/-), TAC+RAGE(-/-), AG, and FTY720 group. AG mice and FTY720 mice were treated with AGEs inhibitor (aminoguanidine, AG) and PP2A activator (FTY720) respectively after TAC surgery. The cardiac function of AG and TAC+RAGE-/- mice was significantly better than that of TAC mice (P<0.05). However, the heart function of FTY720 mice were just improved a part of that. To behavioral function, the escape latency period of the TAC(+)RAGE(-/-), AG and FTY720 mice were significantly shorter (P<0.05), and the times of platform crossings and residence time of them were significantly improved (P<0.05). HE staining and silver staining show the structure of TAC(+)RAGE(-/-), AG and FTY720 mice were more complete. Also, in these three groups, the expression of A ss and p-tau protein in the brain can be significantly down-regulated (P<0.05) and the PP2A protein expression level was up-regulated (P<0.05). And the expression of hippocampal Bax, Cyt-C, and Caspase-3 of that were all down-regulated (P<0.05), and Bcl-2 was up-regulated (P<0.05). Deficient of AGEs, RAGE and activating PP2A can significantly attenuate the cognitive impairment in CHF mice, and protect the brain structure. This mechanism seems via reducing the expression of A ss, p-tau, and apoptotic protein.

AB  - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widespread throughout the central nervous system. Signaling through nAChRs contributes to numerous higher-order functions, including memory and cognition, as well as abnormalities such as nicotine addiction and neurodegenerative disorders. Although recent studies indicate that the PDZ-containing proteins comprising PSD-95 family co-localize with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and mediate downstream signaling in the neurons, the mechanisms by which alpha 7AChRs are regulated remain unclear. Here, we show that the PDZ-LIM domain family protein PDLIM5 binds to alpha 7AChRs and plays a role in nicotine-induced alpha 7AChRs upregulation and surface expression. We find that chronic exposure to 1 mu M nicotine upregulated oa, beta 2-contained nAChRs and PDLIM5 in cultured hippocampal neurons, and the upregulation of alpha 7AChRs and PDLIM5 is increased more on the cell membrane than the cytoplasm. Interestingly, in primary hippocampal neurons, alpha 7AChRs and beta 2nAChRs display distinct patterns of expression, with alpha 7AChRs colocalized more with PDLIM5. Furthermore, PDLIM5 interacts with alpha 7AChRs, but not beta 2nAChRs in native brain neurons. Knocking down of PDLIM5 in SH-SY5Y abolishes nicotine-induced upregulation of alpha 7AChRs. In primary hippocampal neurons, using shRNA against PDLIM5 decreased both surface clustering of alpha 7AChRs and alpha 7AChRs-mediated currents. Proteomics analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) results show that PDLIM5 interacts with alpha 7AChRs through the PDZ domain, and the interaction between PDLIM5 and alpha 7AChRs can be promoted by nicotine. Collectively, our data suggest a novel cellular role of PDLIM5 in the regulation of alpha 7AChRs, which may be relevant to plastic changes in the nervous system.

AB  - In this study, nanocrystalline-Hydroxyapatite (n-HA) was composed with Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement-Elastin (ELN). After the addition of different weight percentages of ELN to produce four bone cement for orthopedic application such as vertebroplasty and bone filler. Evaluation of biological property using simulated body fluid (SBF) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is performed to investigate adaptability, weight loss, and examined the pH change during a specific time. The morphology of the sample was investigated using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) to examine the morphology and microchemical analysis of bone cement materials. The mechanical properties of the samples such as tensile test and Charpy impact test are measured. The observation indicates that the pH is decreased after 24 h and ultimately the pH concentration changes remained constant about 6.2-6.7. The samples had highly low water absorption and porosity by the addition of elastin polymer. The tensile test and Charpy impact test show proper mechanical performance such as elastic modulus and impact strength about 2.31 GPa and 15.71 kJ. m  2 for the sample containing 10 wt% ELN. On the other hand, this cement can be hopeful for bone application such as rhinoplasty, tooth fillers, and orthopedics.

AB  - Aqueous propylene glycol extracts from medicinal plants are commonly used as active ingredients in production of medicine and beauty products for external application. In the scientific literature, however, there are almost no data on the extraction effectiveness of water-propylene glycol mixtures and the chemical composition of aqueous propylene glycol extracts from plant raw material, while in product specifications manufacturers indicate parameters of the product that are absolutely unrelated to its biological activity. By the example of German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L. flowers), using high-performance tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), we show that its aqueous propylene glycol and aqueous ethanol extracts have similar composition in terms of phenolic compounds, with apigenin and its glucosides (apigenin-7-glucoside, apigenin-7-O-6-O-malonyl-D-glycoside, apigenin-7-acetylglycoside, and acetyl-malonyl-apigenin-7-O-glycoside) being the major constituents of the aqueous propylene glycol extracts. The other detected compounds are 5,4'-dioxy-3,6,7,3'-tetramethoxyflavone, cis and trans forms of 2-O-glucopyranoside of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamic acid, and 7-methoxycumarin. Analytical spectral characteristics of aqueous propylene glycol extracts from a series of medicinal plants that are in high demand in the beauty industry are studied in the UV-visible range. Extracts that display the best protective behavior in the UVA and UVB ranges (Salvia officinalis L. leaves, Matricaria chamomilla L. flowers, and Achillea millefolium L. herb) and antiradical ability (Camellia sinensis L. leaves and Hypericum perforatum L. herb) are identified along with extracts that have the highest flavonoid content (Camellia sinensis L. leaves and Hypericum perforatum L. herb). In extraction from plant raw material of the same batch, the absorbance at 270 nm is related to extraction parameters of flavonoids, antioxidants, and the dry substance by a functional relationship which is very advantageous in rapid analysis for quality control during production processes in order to obtain a product with reproducible characteristics. The formulas for calculation of antioxidant content (as rutin or gallic acid equivalents) from DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assays are derived, and the data for extracts from different plant raw materials are interpreted in comparison with results of other analytical methods. The spectral profiles for German chamomile flower extracts are highly reproducible, regardless of the source of plant raw material, which, in combination with specific features of the spectra profiles for extracts from raw material of different plant species, can be used as a criterion in identification testing. The UV spectrophotometry method proposed here is used to investigate the dynamics of extraction from German chamomile flowers under different extraction conditions (temperature and the ratio between propylene glycol and water in the extraction agent). Optimal extraction from plant material is achieved using aqueous 50% propylene glycol at a temperature of 50 degrees C and for an extraction duration of 4 h.

KW  - EQUIVALENCE
AB  - Gelatins from camel, bovine, and fish bones were successfully extracted by using chemical pretreatment and heating methods. The bones were demineralized for 3 days at ambient temperature using hydrochloric acid solutions (0.5-1 M), and the collagen was partially hydrolyzed by preheating in distilled water at 75-80 degrees C for 3 h, followed by extraction temperature at 90 degrees C for 1 h. Free-standing films of gelatin entrained with silver nanoparticles (Gel/AgNPs) at low concentrations (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mM) were synthesized as radiation dosimeters. A high-energy ultrasonic homogenizer was used to dissolve the gelatin in distilled water and to disperse the AgNPs in the gelatin. The nanocomposites' morphology and crystallinity were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical absorption, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies. Dose enhancement was assessed using X-ray irradiations with beam energies below and above silver K-edge. The beam was configured by setting the X-ray generator at 15, 25.5, and 35 kV potential and a beam current of 1 mA. An X-ray detector is used to detect the number of electrons after passing through Gel/AgNPs samples. The use of AgNPs embedded in gelatin caused the enhancement of X-ray radiation absorption, and the highest percentage of linearity for the dosimeter was found to be 90% in the optical range of 395 nm to 425 nm. The preliminary results demonstrated that Gel/AgNPs material may be used in radiation dosimetry for low-energy radiotherapy sources.

AB  - Miniaturization and minimization of mechanical mismatch in neural probes have been two well-proven directions in suppressing immune response and improving spatial resolution for neuronal stimulations and recordings. While the high impedance brought by the miniaturization of electrodes has been addressed by using conductive polymers coatings in multiple reports, the stiffness of such coatings remains orders of magnitude higher than that of the brain tissue. Here, a flat neural probe based on a highly flexible microelectrode array with electrodeposited hydrogel coatings poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) and conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT/PSS), with a cross-section area at only 300 mu m x 2.5 mu m is presented. The PEDOT/PSS coating provides a low interfacial impedance, and the pHEMA deposition bridges the mechanical mismatch between the probe and the brain tissues. The two layers of polymers modification enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and allow the microelectrodes array to be engineered for both recording and stimulation purposes. Besides, in vivo testing of microelectrode arrays implanted in rat hippocampus confirms a high senstivity in neural signal recording and excellent charge injection capacity which can induce long-term potentiation in neural activities in the hippocampus. The probes provide a robust and low-cost solution to the brain interfaces problem.

AB  - Background: To explore the therapeutic role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its possible mechanisms in autism.Methods: Mid-trimester pregnant rats treated with valproate on embryonic day 12.5 and their offspring were selected as autism model. The autism rats were randomly assigned to autism group and AVP treatment group that given AVP by inhalation per day from postnatal days 21 to 42. The changes in social behavior and the hippocampus transcriptome were compared, and the hub genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Mendelian randomization (MR).Results: 403 genes were found to be differentially expressed in the autism model, with the majority of these genes being involved in oligodendrocyte development and myelination. Only 11 genes associated with myelination exhibited statistically significant alterations following AVP treatment when compared to the autism group. Gene set enrichment, expression patterns, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis consistently indicated that the biological processes of oligodendrocyte development and myelination were markedly enriched in the autism group and exhibited improvement following treatment. The variation trend of various nerve cells demonstrated a notable increase in the proportion of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the autism group, which subsequently exhibited a significant decline following treatment. Five hub genes (MBP, PLIP, CNP, GFAP, and TAOK1) were verified by qPCR. Finally, MR studies have confirmed a causal relationship between hippocampal myelination-related gene expression and the risk of autism.Conclusions: AVP could markedly enhance social interaction abilities in the autism rat model, possibly due to the significantly improved hippocampus oligodendrocytes development and myelination.

AB  - Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are used in the treatment of epilepsy, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by recurrent and untriggered seizures that aim to prevent seizures as a symptomatic treatment. However, they still have significant side effects as well as drug resistance. In recent years, especially 1,3,4-thiadiazoles and 1,2,4-triazoles have attracted attention in preclinical and clinical studies as important drug candidates owing to their anticonvulsant properties. Therefore, in this study, which was conducted to discover AED candidate molecules with reduced side effects at low doses, a series of chiral 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-thiadiazoles (4a-d) and 4,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-triazole-3 thiones (5a-d) were designed and synthesized starting from L-phenylalanine ethyl ester hydrochloride. The anticonvulsant activities of the new chiral compounds were assessed in several animal seizure models in mice and rats for initial (phase I) screening after their chemical structures including the configuration of the chiral center were elucidated using spectroscopic methods and elemental analysis. First, all chiral compounds were pre-screened using acute seizure tests induced electrically (maximal electroshock test, 6 Hz psychomotor seizure model) and induced chemically (subcutaneous metrazol seizure model) in mice and also their neurotoxicity (TOX) was determined in the rotorad assay. Two of the tested compounds were used for quantitative testing, and (S)-(+)5-[1-(4-fluorobenzamido)-2-phenylethyl]-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4triazole-3-thione (5b) and (S)-(+)-(5-[1-(4-fluorobenzamido)-2-phenylethyl]-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,4-dihydro3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione (5c) emerged as the most promising anticonvulsant drug candidates and also showed low neurotoxicity. The antiepileptogenic potential of these compounds was determined using a chronic seizure induced electrically corneal kindled mouse model. Furthermore, all chiral compounds were tested for their neuroprotective effect against excitotoxic kainic acid (KA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) induced in vitro neuroprotection assay using an organotypic hippocampal slice culture. The KA-induced neuroprotection assay results revealed that compounds 5b and 5c, which are the leading compounds for anticonvulsant activity, also had the strongest neuroprotective effects with IC50 values of 103.30 +/- 1.14 and 113.40 +/- 1.20 mu M respectively. Molecular docking studies conducted to investigate the molecular binding mechanism of the tested compounds on the GABAA receptor showed that compound 5b exhibits a strong affinity to the benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site on GABA. It also revealed that the NaV1.3 binding interactions were consistent with the experimental data and the reported binding mode of the ICA121431 inhibitor. This suggests that compound 5b has a high affinity for these specific binding sites, indicating its potential as a ligand for modulating GABAA and NaV1.3 receptor activity. Furthermore, the ADME properties displayed that all the physicochemical and pharmacological parameters of the compounds stayed within the specified limits and revealed a high bioavailability profile.

AB  - The paper is devoted to comprehensive studies of the physicochemical properties of emulsion drilling fluids (DFs) based on technical vegetable oil with an oil/water ratio of 70/30. The resulting solutions were compared with hydrocarbon-based solutions created according to the same recipe. Technical oils of plants growing in northern latitudes, such as rapeseed (Br & aacute;ssica n & aacute;pus), linseed (L & iacute;num), and false flax (Camelina) were considered as a disperse medium. Using these oils as drilling fluid components is considered for the first time. Conventional drilling fluid components, such as low-viscosity synthetic oil and diesel fuel were also considered for comparison with vegetable oils. The rheological, filtration, antifriction and inhibitory properties of the resulting solutions were studied. The hazard class of drilling fluids was determined through biotesting. It has been shown that drilling fluids based on vegetable oils are not inferior in their properties, and in some parameters even superior to oil-based drilling fluids. This opens up a broad prospect for the use of vegetable oils as a replacement for the existing hydrocarbon-based drilling fluids, which will significantly reduce the environmental load when drilling with such process fluids, and will also solve the problem of cleaning and disposal of sludge waste.

AB  - Complex biological photocatalytic heteronanostructures were produced by the integration of different multicomponent Au-Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) into the blue-colored photonic nanoarchitectures occurring in the wings of male Polyommatus icarus butterflies. Both bare wings and wings conformally coated by 15-nm ZnO by atomic layer deposition were used as substrates. The NPs were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, focus stacking optical microscopy, and electron microscopy. After the deposition of the different NPs, the photocatalytic performance of the samples under visible light illumination was tested by the photodegradation of methyl orange in aqueous solution monitored continuously by an immersion probe. It was found that the components of the biological hetero-nanoarchitecture: ZnO-coated wings and wings without ZnO with deposited NPs exhibited poor catalytic performance. But the combined system: ZnO-coated wings with NPs deposited onto them exhibited sixfold to eightfold increase in their catalytic performance. This increase is attributed to the extension of the ZnO absorption into the visible range and to the formation of the heterojunction between the n-type ZnO and the p-type Cu2O NPs which resulted in the charge transfer of the photogenerated carriers. As the samples exhibited good stability under the continuous magnetic stirring, they can be used in flow-through systems suitable for wastewater remediation. The biological templates for the hetero-nanoarchitectures were produced by the controlled breeding of herbivorous insects, which does not raise any environmental concerns.

AB  - In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the excitonic, optical, electronic, and structural stability properties of the 1T' CrS2 monolayer. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms its dynamically stability, suggesting feasibility for experimental synthesis. Our findings reveals that 1T' CrS2 is a narrow-gap semiconductor with a direct band gap of 85 meV and an anisotropic band structure, characterized by a camel-back shape in the lowest conduction band. Unlike 1T' MoS2, the 1T' CrS2 monolayer does not exhibit excitonic insulator behavior; for instance, its exciton binding energy is 7 meV, which was smaller than the typical range for two-dimensional materials. This absence of an excitonic insulator phase underscores its unique electronic and optical properties. The distinct features of 1T' CrS2, including its high optical anisotropy, position it as a promising candidate for advanced technological applications such as optoelectronic devices, quantum computing components, and photonic systems. Furthermore, its strong anisotropic optical response highlights potential for direction-dependent physical technologies, paving the way for future research opportunities.

AB  - Existing tissue adhesives and sealants are far from satisfactory when applied on wet and dynamic tissues. Herein, we report a strategy for designing a biodegradable, super-strong aqueous glue (B-Seal) for surgical uses, inspired by an English ivy adhesion strategy and a cement particle packing theory. B-Seal is a fast-gelling, super strong, and elastic adhesive sealant composed of injectable waterborne biodegradable polyurethane (WPU) nanodispersions with mismatched particle sizes and counterions in its A-B formulation. B-Seal showed 24-fold greater burst pressure than DuraSeal, 138-fold greater T-pull adhesive strength than fibrin glue, and 16 fold greater lap shear strength than fibrin glue. In vivo evaluation on a rat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea model and a porcine craniotomy model validated the safety and efficacy of B-Seal for effective CSF leak prevention and dura repair. The plant-inspired adhesion strategy combined with particle packing theory represents a new direction for designing the next-generation wet tissue adhesives for surgeries.

AB  - Excessive prenatal exposure to ethanol leads to a condition called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The neurotoxicity of alcohol causes changes in the hippocampus of animals during this time, resulting in impaired hippocampus-related functions, including memory/learning and cognition.The liver and kidneys produce erythropoietin (EPO). The synthesis of EPO by immature neurons also plays a decisive role in the embryonic stage. Also, exogenous EPO exerts its neurocognitive effects in the developing brain under pathophysiological conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of EPO administration after ethanol-induced increased neurodevelopmental toxicity. Male Wistar rat pups were intubated with a dose of 5/27 g/kg/day ethanol from postnatal day 2-10, similar to the last trimester of gestation in humans. Immediately thereafter, EPO (1000 /2000 U/kg, s.c.) were injected. Spatial memory was tested with the Morris water maze (days 36-40) and non-spatial recognition memory with the novel object task (days 39-40). Concentrations of antioxidant enzymes and TNF-alpha (ELISA) and caspase-3 (immunohistochemical staining) was then performed. The current study shows that EPO administration significantly attenuates spatial and nonspatial memory impairment (P < 0.001). EPO dramatically decreased the amount of caspase 3 positive cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus (P < 0.01). EPO increased total superoxide dismutase activity (P < 0.05), glutathione concentrations (P < 0.05) and catalase levels (P < 0.001). EPO also attenuated the production of TNF-alpha and malondialdehyde (P < 0.05). Given EPO's protective effect against ethanol-induced increased neurotoxicity, it is a viable treatment option for FASD, although more research is needed.

AB  - Nanoparticles have attracted considerable attention of researchers due to their diverse properties in the fields of catalysis, energy devices, wound healing and drug delivery systems . Synthesis of nanoparticles using plants and microbial extract is a green approach due to easy handling, rapidity and cost-effectiveness. This article reported a simple and green method of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) synthesis using Camellia sinensis leaves extract as reducing agent. State-of-the-art techniques were utilized for the characterization and measure the potential applications of ZnO-NPs. FTIR and SEM analysis were performed to confirm the nature of bonding and morphology of NPs. XRD analysis confirmed the hexagonal wurtzite structure and crystallite size (34 nm) of ZnONPs. EDX analysis was performed to check the purity of NPs. Energy band gap of valence band and conduction band was found 3.278 eV using UV/Visible spectrophotometry. Purified ZnO-NPs were utilized to determine the photocatalytic potential for degradation of hazardous dye (methylene blue) at lambda max of 668 nm under irradiation of sunlight. The results indicated similar to 92% photodecomposition of dye after 110 min of sunlight irradiation. Moreover, ZnO-NPs also revealed the antibacterial potential, having better inhibition power against gram-negative bacterial strains.

AB  - Nongenetic optical control of neurons is a powerful technique to study and manipulate the function of the nervous system. This research has benchmarked the performance of organic electrolytic photocapacitor (OEPC) optoelectronic stimulators at the level of single mammalian cells: human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells with heterologously expressed voltage-gated K+ channels and hippocampal primary neurons. OEPCs act as extracellular stimulation electrodes driven by deep red light. The electrophysiological recordings show that millisecond light stimulation of OEPC shifts conductance-voltage plots of voltage-gated K+ channels by approximate to 30 mV. Models are described both for understanding the experimental findings at the level of K+ channel kinetics in HEK cells, as well as elucidating interpretation of membrane electrophysiology obtained during stimulation with an electrically floating extracellular photoelectrode. A time-dependent increase in voltage-gated channel conductivity in response to OEPC stimulation is demonstrated. These findings are then carried on to cultured primary hippocampal neurons. It is found that millisecond time-scale optical stimuli trigger repetitive action potentials in these neurons. The findings demonstrate that OEPC devices enable the manipulation of neuronal signaling activities with millisecond precision. OEPCs can therefore be integrated into novel in vitro electrophysiology protocols, and the findings can inspire in vivo applications.

AB  - Embryo production in donkeys is inefficient compared with that in other livestock. Obtaining a sufficient number of MII oocytes is the first step to solving this problem. In this study, the number, morphology and maturation rates of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) obtained from abattoir-derived ovaries or live jennies were compared. The diameter of follicles from abattoir-derived ovaries was measured and divided into group 1 (2-6 mm), group 2 (6-10 mm), group 3 (10-20 mm), group 4 (20-28 mm) and group 5 (>28 mm). The results showed that the number of follicles per ovary in group 2 (3.6 +/- 0.28) and 3 (4.2 +/- 0.90) was higher than that in the other groups (p < .05). The recovery rate in group 3 was higher than group 1 (48.8% vs. 26.8%, p = .00), but lower than group 5 (48.8% vs. 76.5%, p = .025). The percentage of grade A COCs in group 3 was higher than group 2 (59.3% vs. 39.5%, p = .00) and group 1 (59.3% vs. 26.7%, p = .00). Moreover, the percentage of grade A COCs in group 4 (55.0%, p = .710) and group 5 (46.2%, p = .351) was reduced compared with that in group 3. From the above results, the developing follicles (group ovum pick-up [OPU], 10-20 mm) and preovulation follicles (group OPU-Preov, >35 mm) were aspirated from live jennies using OPU. Although there was no difference in the recovery rates of COCs between group 3 and OPU (48.8% vs. 43.0%, p = .184), the percentage of grades A COCs in group OPU was higher than group 3 (72.5% vs. 59.3%, p = .036). There was no difference in the maturation rate between group 3 and OPU (60.3% vs. 69.3%, p = .171) after the COCs matured in vitro. The rates of recovery (72.2%) and maturation (92.3%) in group OPU-Preov were higher than those in other groups (p < .05). Moreover, the effects of maturation time and serum type on maturation rates were evaluated in groups B44 (44 h, FBS), B36 (36 h, FBS) and D44 (44 h, foetal donkey serum, FDS). These results indicated that the maturation rate in group B36 was lower than group B44 (13.1% vs. 47.0%, p = .00) and group D44 (13.1% vs. 53.3%, p = .00). In conclusion, the quality of donkey COCs from OPU was higher than that from abattoir-derived ovaries, the suitable time of donkey in vitro maturation (IVM) was 44 h, and FBS could be replaced with FDS in donkey IVM medium.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of on-farm practices on milk production, chemical and microbiological quality and on Somatic Cell Count (SCC) as well as the evolution of milk quality along the camel dairy value chain in southern Tunisia. A survey of 12 periurban dairy camel farms showed that the use of machine milking is limited (16.7%). The milking hygiene practices need to be improved with only 25% of farmers practiced teat dipping and washed the material with hot water and detergents. In addition, 75% of farmers milked their animals in bedding area. Conservation and marketing conditions for raw camel milk were mediocre. Analysis of on-farm milk quality showed that use of machine milking was related to increased milk production but also caused an increase in the microbial load. Quality assessment at different stages of the production chain showed that the chemical composition of milk was conserved, whereas the physical and microbiological quality was altered. At production, the load in Mesophilic Total Aerobic Flores (MTAF) was low with 17.4 x 104 cfu/mL, compared to bulk and point of sale milk, which had a significantly higher load (21.2 x 105 cfu/mL and 61.2 x 105 cfu/mL, respectively). The acceptability threshold of Acidity, MTAF, Total Coliforms and S. aureus prevalence were exceeded in all samples purchased from points of sale. Therefore, improvements in milking hygiene, milk storage, and transport conditions are essential in order to guarantee the quality of camel's milk to meet the needs of the consumer.

AB  - Mice feed with coffee polyphenols (CPP, chlorogenic acid) and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) has increased survival rates and helps retain long-term memory. In the cerebral cortex of aged mice, CPP intake decreased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, and lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B. The suppression of inflammation in the brain during aging was thought to result in the suppression of the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and prevention of brain aging. In contrast, CPP increased the expression of REST, cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the young hippocampus. The increased expression of these factors may contribute to the induction of neuronal differentiation and the suppression of memory decline with aging. Taken together, these results suggest that CPP increases CREB in the young hippocampus and suppresses inflammation in the old brain, resulting in a preventive effect on brain aging. The endotoxin levels were not elevated in the serum of aged mice. Although the mechanism of action of MFGM has not yet been elucidated, the increase in survival rate with both CPP and MFGM intake suggests that adding milk to coffee may improve not only the taste, but also the function.

AB  - Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent focal seizures originating in the temporal lobe. Despite the variety of antiseizure drugs currently available to treat TLE, about 30% of cases continue to have seizures. The etiology of TLE is complex and multifactorial. Increasing evidence indicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and drug-resistant TLE present common pathological features that may induce hyperexcitability, especially aberrant hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Genetic polymorphic variants located in genes of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3B) have been associated with the risk of developing AD. The APOE epsilon 4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for AD. Likewise, a gene-dose-dependent effect of epsilon 4 seems to influence TLE. The present study aimed to investigate whether the APOE epsilon 4 allele and genetic variants located in the MAPT and GSK3B genes are associated with the risk of developing AD and drug-resistant TLE in a cohort of the Mexican population. A significant association with the APOE epsilon 4 allele was observed in patients with AD and TLE. Additional genetic interactions were identified between this allele and variants of the MAPT and GSK3B genes.

AB  - Currently, the efficacy of drug therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD leaves much to be desired, making nutraceutical support a promising avenue for treatment. Recent research has identified the protective effects of resveratrol in PTSD. Here, we tested the behavioral and neurobiological effects of combining cheese consumption with resveratrol supplements in an experimental PTSD model. Using the elevated plus maze test, we observed that cheese intake resulted in a shift from anxiety-like behavior to depressive behavior, evident in increased freezing acts. However, no significant changes in the anxiety index value were observed. Interestingly, supplementation with cheese and resveratrol only led to the elimination of freezing behavior in half of the PTSD rats. We further segregated the rats into two groups based on freezing behavior: Freezing+ and Freezing0 phenotypes. Resveratrol ameliorated the abnormalities in Monoamine Oxidize -A and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor gene expression in the hippocampus, but only in the Freezing0 rats. Moreover, a negative correlation was found between the number of freezing acts and the levels of Monoamine Oxidize-A and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor mRNAs in the hippocampus. The study results show promise for resveratrol supplementation in PTSD treatment. Further research is warranted to better understand the underlying mechanisms and optimize the potential benefits of resveratrol supplementation for PTSD.

TI  - Pregnenolone-methyl-ether enhances CLIP170 and microtubule functions improving spine maturation and hippocampal deficits related to CDKL5 deficiency

AB  - Mutations in the X-linked cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by severe infantile seizures and intellectual disability. The absence of CDKL5 in mice causes defective spine maturation that can at least partially explain the cognitive impairment in CDKL5 patients and CDD mouse models. The molecular basis for such defect may depend on the capacity of CDKL5 to regulate microtubule (MT) dynamics through its association with the MT-plus end tracking protein CLIP170 (cytoplasmic linker protein 170). Indeed, we here demonstrate that the absence of CDKL5 causes CLIP170 to be mainly in a closed inactive conformation that impedes its binding to MTs. Previously, the synthetic pregnenolone analogue, pregnenolone-methyl-ether (PME), was found to have a positive effect on CDKL5-related cellular and neuronal defects in vitro. Here, we show that PME induces the open active conformation of CLIP170 and promotes the entry of MTs into dendritic spines in vitro. Furthermore, the administration of PME to symptomatic Cdkl5-knock-out mice improved hippocampal-dependent behavior and restored spine maturation and the localization of MT-related proteins in the synaptic compartment. The positive effect on cognitive deficits persisted for 1 week after treatment withdrawal. Altogether, our results suggest that CDKL5 regulates spine maturation and cognitive processes through its control of CLIP170 and MT dynamics, which may represent a novel target for the development of disease-modifying therapies.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a common neurodegenerative disease, which characterized by amyloid A(3 deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. Astragalin (AST), a natural flavonoid, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and other pharmacological effects. Astrocytes can phagocytize and degrade A(3 in their vicinity. In this study, we used the AD mice model established by injecting the mixture of A(31-42 and A(325-35 into the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and C8D1A cells injured by A(31-42 to explore the neuroprotective effects of AST. Our findings showed that AST enhances learning and cognitive ability of AD mice, reduces A(3 deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, and improves the structural morphology of hippocampal nerve cells. Furthermore, AST promoted autophagy and suppressed apoptosis of astrocytes in the AD model. Additionally, AST inhibited the expression of proteins associated with the Fas/Fasl-VDAC1 signaling pathway, while autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) or apoptosis agonist phenoxodiol reversed above change. Interestingly, consistent with the action of pathway Fas inhibitor KR-33493, AST could activate autophagy of A(31-42 injured C8D1A cells while inhibit their apoptosis. In conclusion, AST activated autophagy and inhibited apoptosis of hippocampal astrocytes in AD mice, ameliorating animal cognitive deficits by down-regulating Fas/Fasl-VDAC1 signaling pathway. Thus, this study provided a new perspective and experimental foundation for developing AD treatment drugs.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is a serious global health issue and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at higher risk. Palm oil tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) exhibits neuroprotective properties; however, its effect on VaD is not reported. Hence, we evaluated TRF effectiveness in T2DM-induced VaD rats. Rats were given a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide (NA) to develop T2DM. Seven days later, diabetic rats were given TRF doses of 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg orally for 21 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed for memory assessment. Biochemical parameters such as blood glucose, plasma homocysteine (HCY) level, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) level, and histopathological changes in brain hippocampus and immunohistochemistry for platelet-derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C) expression were evaluated. VaD rats had significantly reduced memory, higher plasma HCY, increased AChE activity, and decreased GSH and SOD levels. However, treatment with TRF significantly attenuated the biochemical parameters and prevented memory loss. Moreover, histopathological changes were attenuated and there was increased PDGF-C expression in the hippocampus of VaD rats treated with TRF, indicating neuroprotective action. In conclusion, this research paves the way for future studies and benefits in understanding the potential effects of TRF in VaD rats.

AB  - Approximately one-third of epileptic patients do not respond adequately to drug therapy, leading to the development of drug-resistant epilepsy. Given the established role of dysregulated expression of two cation-chloride cotransporter proteins, NKCC1 and KCC2, in susceptibility to convulsion generation and epilepsy development, the present study evaluates the anticonvulsant potential of bumetanide (BUM, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and probenecid (PROB, 50 mg/kg, i.p.), the potential of adenosine receptor activation (NECA, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) to modify the anticonvulsant efficacy of BUM, and the changes in NKCC1 and KCC2 protein expression levels in carbamazepine (CBZ)-resistant animals. In the window-pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model, male Wistar rats that undergo full kindling develop CBZ-resistance. The combination of BUM + PROB appears to have an anticonvulsant effect on CBZ-resistant convulsions, while alterations in the protein levels of the NKCC1 and KCC2 cotransporters are observed in CBZ-resistant animals. Despite the absence of therapeutic efficacy in managing convulsions through adenosine receptor activation (BUM + NECA), the activation of adenosine receptors exhibits the capacity to modulate the levels of the NKCC1 protein in the hippocampus of CBZ-resistant animals. This effect provides the initial evidence for a new therapeutic role of adenosine receptors in regulating the pathological levels of NKCC1 in drug-resistant epilepsy.

AB  - Prenatal stress (PNS), which alters the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in the offspring, predisposes to insulin resistance (IR) in later life and is associated with numerous disorders, including cognitive and memory impairments. At present, our main goal is to assess the effects of chronic piromelatine (Pir) administration, a melatonin analogue, on PNS-provoked IR in the periphery and the hippocampus in male and female offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to chronic stress (one short-term stressor on a daily basis and one long-term stressor on a nightly basis) from the first gestation week until birth. Vehicle or Pir 20 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally for 21 days. Plasma glucose, serum insulin levels, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined as markers of peripheral IR. For the hippocampal IR assessment, insulin receptors (IRs) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) were examined. Prenatally stressed offspring of both sexes indicated enhanced plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations, increased HOMA-IR, and decreased hippocampal GLUT4 only in male rats. The PNS-induced changes were corrected by chronic treatment with Pir. The present results suggest that the melatoninergic compound Pir exerts beneficial effects on altered glucose/insulin homeostasis in PNS-exposed offspring.

AB  - Endothelial cells (ECs) derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) provide great resource for vascular disease modeling and cell-based regeneration therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms of EC differentiation are not completely understood. In this study, we checked transcriptional profile by microarray and found Hippo pathway is changed and the activity of YAP decreased during mesoderm-mediated EC differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Knockdown of YAP in hESCs promoted both mesoderm and EC differentiation indicating by mesodermal-or EC-specific marker gene expression increased both in mRNA and protein level. In contrast, overexpression of YAP inhibited mesoderm and EC differentiation. Microarray data showed that several key transcription factors of EC differentiation, such as FLI1, ERG, SOX17 are upregulated. Interestingly, knockdown YAP enhanced the expression of these master transcription factors. Bioinformation analysis revealed that TEAD, a YAP binds transcription factors, might regulate the expression of EC master TFs, including FLI1. Luciferase assay confirmed that YAP binds to TEAD1, which would inhibit FLI1 expression. Finally, FLI1 over expression rescued the effects of YAP overexpression-mediated inhibition of EC differentiation. In conclusion, we revealed the inhibitory effects of YAP on EC differentiation from PSCs, and YAP inhibition might promote expression of master TFs FLI1 for EC commitment through interacting with TEAD1, which might provide an idea for EC differentiation and vascular regeneration via manipulating YAP signaling.

AB  - Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which it has been shown that the presence of oxidative stress (OS) is implicated in epileptogenesis. The literature has shown that some antiseizure drugs (ASD) have neuroprotective properties. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a drug commonly used as an ASD, and in some studies, it has been found to possess antioxidant properties. Because the antioxidant effects of LEV have not been demonstrated in the chronic phase of epilepsy, the objective of this study was to evaluate, for the first time, the effects of LEV on the oxidant-antioxidant status in the hippocampus of rats with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The in vitro scavenging capacity of LEV was evaluated. LEV administration in rats with TLE significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, increased catalase (CAT) activity, but did not change glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and significantly decreased glutathione reductase (GR) activity in comparison with epileptic rats. LEV administration in rats with TLE significantly reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels but did not change lipoperoxidation and carbonylated protein levels in comparison with epileptic rats. In addition, LEV showed in vitro scavenging activity against hydroxyl radical (HO center dot). LEV showed significant antioxidant effects in relation to restoring the redox balance in the hippocampus of rats with TLE. In vitro, LEV demonstrated direct antioxidant activity against HO center dot.

AB  - Dexamethasone (DEXA) is a commonly used steroid drug with immunosuppressive and analgesic properties. Unfortunately, long-term exposure to DEXA severely impairs brain function. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin D-3 supplementation during chronic DEXA treatment on neurogenesis, mitochondrial energy metabolism, protein levels involved in the BDNF-mediated Akt activity, and specific receptors in the hippocampus. We found reduced serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3(25(OH)D-3), downregulated proBDNF and pAkt, dysregulated glucocorticosteroid and mineralocorticoid receptors, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, and dysfunctional mitochondria energy metabolism in the DEXA-treated group. In contrast, supplementation with vitamin D-3 restored the 25(OH)D-3 concentration to a value close to that of the control group. There was an elevation in neurotrophic factor protein level, along with augmented activity of pAkt and increased citrate synthase activity in the hippocampus after vitamin D-3 administration in long-term DEXA-treated rats. Our findings demonstrate that vitamin D-3 supplementation plays a protective role in the hippocampus and partially mitigates the deleterious effects of long-term DEXA administration. The association between serum 25(OH)D-3 concentration and BDNF level in the hippocampus indicates the importance of applying vitamin D-3 supplementation to prevent and treat pathological conditions.

AB  - Mitochondrial membrane potential regulation through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is reportedly involved in the ischemic postconditioning (PostC) phenomenon. Melatonin is an endogenous hormone that regulates circadian rhythms. Its neuroprotective effects via mitochondrial melatonin receptors (MTs) have recently attracted attention. However, details of the neuroprotective mechanisms associated with PostC have not been clarified. Using hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells from C57BL mice, we studied the involvement of MTs and the mPTP in melatonin-induced PostC mechanisms similar to those of ischemic PostC. We measured changes in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), intracellular calcium concentration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) currents after ischemic challenge, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Melatonin significantly suppressed increases in sEPSCs and intracellular calcium concentrations. The NMDAR currents were significantly suppressed by melatonin and the MT agonist, ramelteon. However, this suppressive effect was abolished by the mPTP inhibitor, cyclosporine A, and the MT antagonist, luzindole. Furthermore, both melatonin and ramelteon potentiated depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potentials, and luzindole suppressed depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potentials. This study suggests that melatonin-induced PostC via MTs suppressed the NMDAR that was induced by partial depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential by opening the mPTP, reducing excessive release of glutamate and inducing neuroprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury.

AB  - Background: Asian sand dust (ASD) and Aspergillus fumigatus are known risk factors for airway mucosal inflammatory diseases. Bacterial and fungal biofilms commonly coexist in chronic rhinosinusitis and fungus balls. We evaluated the effects of ASD on the development of A. fumigatus biofilm formation on nasal epithelial cells. Methods: Primary nasal epithelial cells were cultured with A. fumigatus conidia with or without ASD for 72 h. The production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 from nasal epithelial cells was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of ASD on A. fumigatus biofilm formation were determined using crystal violet, concanavalin A, safranin staining, and confocal scanning laser microscopy. Results: ASD and A. fumigatus significantly enhanced the production of IL-6 and IL-8 from nasal epithelial cells. By coculturing A. fumigatus with ASD, the dry weight and safranin staining of the fungal biofilms significantly increased in a time-dependent manner. However, the increased level of crystal violet and concanavalin A stain decreased after 72 h of incubation. Conclusions: ASD and A. fumigatus induced the production of inflammatory chemical mediators from nasal epithelial cells. The exposure of A. fumigatus to ASD enhanced the formation of biofilms. The coexistence of ASD and A. fumigatus may increase the development of fungal biofilms and fungal inflammatory diseases in the sinonasal mucosa.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with memory impairment and other central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. Two myrtenal-adamantane conjugates (MACs) showed excellent CNS potential against Alzheimer's models. Adamantane is a common pharmacophore for drug design, and myrtenal (M) demonstrated neuroprotective effects in our previous studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the MACs' neuroprotective properties in dementia. Methods: Scopolamine (Scop) was applied intraperitoneally in Wistar rats for 11 days, simultaneously with MACs or M as a referent, respectively. Brain acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, noradrenaline and serotonin levels, and oxidative brain status determination followed behavioral tests on memory abilities. Molecular descriptors and docking analyses for AChE activity center affinity were performed. Results: M derivatives have favorable physicochemical parameters to enter the CNS. Both MACs restored memory damaged by Scop, showing significant AChE-inhibitory activity in the cortex, in contrast to M, supported by the modeling analysis. Moderate antioxidant properties were manifested by glutathione elevation and catalase activity modulation. MACs also altered noradrenaline and serotonin content in the hippocampus. Conclusion: For the first time, neuroprotective properties of two MACs in a rat dementia model were observed. They were stronger than the natural M effects, which makes the substances promising candidates for AD treatment.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic disease characterized by an ongoing predisposition to seizures. Although inflammation has emerged as a crucial factor in the etiology of epilepsy, no approaches to anti-inflammatory treatment have been clinically proven to date. Betamethasone (a corticosteroid drug used in the clinic for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects) has never been evaluated in attenuating the intensity of seizures in a kindling animal model of seizures. Using a kindling model in male wistar rats, this study evaluated the effect of betamethasone on the severity of seizures and levels of pro-inflammatory interleukins. Seizures were induced by pentylenetetrazole (30 mg/kg) on alternate days for 15 days. The animals were divided into four groups: a control group treated with saline, another control group treated with diazepam (2 mg/kg), and two groups treated with betamethasone (0.125 and 0.250 mg/kg, respectively). Open field test was conducted. Betamethasone treatments were effective in reducing the intensity of epileptic seizures. There were lower levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta in the cortex, compared to the saline group, on the other hand, levels in the hippocampus remained similar to the control groups. There was no change in the levels of interleukin-6 in the evaluated structures. Serum inflammatory mediators remained similar. Lower quantities of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system may have been the key to the reduced severity of seizures on the Racine scale.

AB  - Discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis has led to proposed microbe-based therapeutic strategies in mental health, including the use of mood-altering bacterial species, termed psychobiotics. However, we still have limited understanding of the key signaling pathways engaged by specific organisms in modulating brain function, and evidence suggests that bacteria with broadly similar neuroactive and immunomodulatory actions can drive different behavioral outcomes. We sought to identify pathways distinguishing two psychoactive bacterial strains that seemingly engage similar gut-brain signaling pathways but have distinct effects on behaviour. We used RNAseq to identify mRNAs differentially expressed in the blood and hippocampus of mice following Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus JB-1, and Limosilactobacillus reuteri 6475 treatment and performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify enrichment in pathway activity. L. rhamnosus, but not L. reuteri treatment altered several pathways in the blood and hippocampus, and the rhamnosus could be clearly distinguished based on mRNA profile. In particular, L. rhamnosus treatment modulated the activity of interferon signaling, JAK/STAT, and TNF-alpha via NF-KB pathways. Our results highlight that psychobiotics can induce complex changes in host gene expression, andin understanding these changes, we may help fine-tune selection of psychobiotics for treating mood disorders.

AB  - Impaired cerebral glucose metabolism is an early event that contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Importantly, restoring glucose availability by pharmacological agents or genetic manipulation has been shown to protect against A beta toxicity, ameliorate AD pathology, and increase lifespan. Lithium, a therapeutic agent widely used as a treatment for mood disorders, has been shown to attenuate AD pathology and promote glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle. However, despite its widespread use in neuropsychiatric disorders, lithium's effects on the brain have been poorly characterized. Here we evaluated the effect of lithium on glucose metabolism in hippocampal neurons from wild-type (WT) and APPSwe/PS1 Delta E9 (APP/PS1) mice. Our results showed that lithium significantly stimulates glucose uptake and replenishes ATP levels by preferential oxidation of glucose through glycolysis in neurons from WT mice. This increase was also accompanied by a strong increase in glucose transporter 3 (Glut3), the major carrier responsible for glucose uptake in neurons. Similarly, using hippocampal slices from APP-PS1 mice, we demonstrate that lithium increases glucose uptake, glycolytic rate, and the ATP:ADP ratio in a process that also involves the activation of AMPK. Together, our findings indicate that lithium stimulates glucose metabolism and can act as a potential therapeutic agent in AD.

AB  - Based on oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC), several hemostyptic materials, such as Tabotamp(R), Equicel(R) and Equitamp(R), have been developed to approach challenging hemostasis in neurosurgery. The present study compares ORC that differ in terms of compositions and properties, regarding their structure, solubility, pH values and effects on neuronal tissue. Cytotoxicity was detected via DNA-binding fluorescence dye in Schwann cells, astrocytes, and neuronal cells. Additionally, organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC) were analyzed, using propidium iodide, hematoxylin-eosin, and isolectin B-4 staining to investigate the cellular damage, cytoarchitecture, and microglia activation. Whereas Equicel(R) led to a neutral pH, Tabotamp(R) (pH 2.8) and Equitamp(R) (pH 4.8) caused a significant reduction of pH (p < 0.001). Equicel(R) and Tabotamp(R) increased cytotoxicity significantly in several cell lines (p < 0.01). On OHSC, Tabotamp(R) and Equicel(R) led to a stronger and deeper damage to the neuronal tissue than Equitamp(R) or gauze (p < 0.01). Equicel(R) increased strongly the number of microglia cells after 24 h (p < 0.001). Microglia cells were not detectable after Tabotamp(R) treatment, presumably due to an artifact caused by strong pH reduction. In summary, our data imply the use of Equicel(R), Tabotamp(R) or Equitamp(R) for specific applications in distinct clinical settings depending on their localization or tissue properties.

AB  - Camellia oleifera oil (CO oil) extracted from C. oleifera seeds has a 2300-year consumption history in China. However, there is relatively little research regarding its non-edible uses. This study determined the physicochemical properties of CO oil extracted via direct pressing, identified its main components using GC-MS, and evaluated its antioxidant, moisturizing, and anti-inflammatory activities. The results revealed that CO oil's acid, peroxide, iodine, and saponification values were 1.06 +/- 0.031 mg/g, 0.24 +/- 0.01 g/100 g, 65.14 +/- 8.22 g/100 g, and 180.41 +/- 5.60 mg/g, respectively. CO oil's tocopherol, polyphenol, and squalene contents were 82.21 +/- 9.07 mg/kg, 181.37 +/- 3.76 mg/kg, and 53.39 +/- 6.58 mg/kg, respectively; its unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content was 87.44%, and its saturated fatty acid (SFA) content was 12.56%. CO oil also demonstrated excellent moisture retention properties, anti-inflammatory effects, and certain free radical scavenging. A highly stable CO oil emulsion with competent microbiological detection was developed using formulation optimization. Using CO oil in the emulsion significantly improved the formulation's antioxidant and moisturizing properties compared with those of the emulsion formulation that did not include CO oil. The prepared emulsion was not cytotoxic to cells and could reduce cells' NO content; therefore, it may have potential nutritional value in medicine and cosmetics.

AB  - The secondary neurotoxicity induced by severe organophosphorus (OP) poisoning, including paraoxon (POX), is associated with cognitive impairments in survivors, who, despite receiving appropriate emergency treatments, may still experience lasting neurological deficits. Thus, the present study provides a survival mouse model of acute and severe POX poisoning to examine secondary neurotoxicity. Swiss CD-1 male mice were injected with POX (4 mg/kg, s.c.) followed by atropine (4 mg/kg, i.p.), pralidoxime (2-PAM; Pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride) (25 mg/kg, i.p., twice, 1 h apart) and diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.), resulting in a survival rate >90% and Racine score of 5-6. Our results demonstrated that the model showed increased lipid peroxidation, downregulation of antioxidant enzymes and astrogliosis in the mouse hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), brain areas involved in cognitive functions. Moreover, dopamine (DA) levels were reduced in the hp, but increased in the PFC. Furthermore, the survival mouse model of acute POX intoxication did not exhibit phenotypic manifestations of depression, anxiety or motor incoordination. However, our results demonstrated long-term recognition memory impairments, which are in accordance with the molecular and neurochemical effects observed. In conclusion, this mouse model can aid in researching POX exposure's effects on memory and developing potential countermeasures against the secondary neurotoxicity induced by severe OP poisoning.

AB  - Glial reactivity may contribute to sex/gender differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Here, we investigated the differential effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glial markers on AD pathology and neurodegeneration by sex/gender among cognitively unimpaired older adults at increased risk of developing AD. We included 397 participants from the ALFA+ cohort with CSF A beta 42/40, p-tau181, sTREM2, YKL40, and GFAP, magnetic resonance imaging-based hippocampal volume (n = 299), and amyloid burden (centiloids) measured with [18F] flutemetamol positron emission tomography (n = 341). We ran multiple linear regression models to assess the association between glial markers, AD pathology and hippocampal volumes and their interaction with sex/gender, using False Discovery Rate to correct for multiple comparisons. Glial markers significantly contributed to explain amyloid burden, tau pathology, and hippocampal volumes, beyond age and/or primary AD pathology in a sex/gender-specific manner. Compared to men, women showed increased amyloid burden (centiloids) and CSF p-tau181 with increasing levels of sTREM2 and YKL40, and YKL40 and GFAP, respectively. Compared to women, men with greater tau burden showed lower hippocampal volumes as CSF YKL40 levels increased. Overall, our findings suggest that glial reactivity may contribute to sex/gender differences in AD progression, mostly, downstream amyloid. Further research identifying sex/gender-specific temporal dynamics in AD development is warranted to inform clinical trials.

AB  - The major proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau. We demonstrate that APP1 (390-412) and Tau1 (19-34), linked together with either a flexible or a rigid peptide bridge, are able to inhibit, in vitro, the interaction between APP and Tau proteins. Furthermore, nasal administration of biotin-labelled Flex peptide for two weeks indicated the localization of the peptide around and close to plaques in the hippocampus area. In vivo studies in 5xFAD transgenic (Tg) mice, which exhibit plaque load and mild cognitive decline at four months of age, show that nasal administration of the flexible linked peptide reduced amyloid plaque burden. Additionally, nasal treatment with either flexible or rigid linked peptides prevented cognitive function deterioration. A significant treatment effect was achieved when either treatment was initiated at the age of three months, before severe cognitive deficiency is evident, or at five months, when such deficiency is already observed. The nasally treated mice demonstrated a cognitive ability not significantly different from the non-Tg littermate controls. Testing the effect of the flexible peptide by gavage feeding on the cognitive function of 5xFAD Tg mice demonstrated that feeding as well as nasal treatment significantly improves the cognitive ability of Tg mice compared to control PBS-treated mice.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, with high mortality and poor prognosis. WBDC-1 is a novel highly oxidized germacranolide from the Elephantopus tomentosus in our previous work, which has excellent anti-HCC activity, but the detailed mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we found that WBDC-1 was able to inhibit the proliferation and colony formation of Hep3B and HepG2 cells, as well as the cell migration ability and EMT. In addition, WBDC-1 showed no obvious toxicity to normal liver epithelial cells L-02. The potential targets of WBDC-1 were predicted by network pharmacology, and the following verified experiments showed that WBDC-1 exerted anti-HCC effect by targeting EGFR. Mechanismly, subsequent biological analysis showed that WBDC-1 can inhibit EGFR and its downstream RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Overexpression of EGFR reversed the anticancer properties of WBDC-1. Consistent with in vitro experiments, WBDC-1 was able to inhibit tumor growth and was non-toxic in xenograft tumor models. In summary, this study revealed a potential tumor suppressive mechanism of WBDC-1 and provided a novel strategy for HCC treatment. It also laid a foundation for further research on the anti-tumor effect of highly oxidized germacranolides.

AB  - Background: Doxorubicin (Dox) is one of the most frequently prescribed anti-cancer drugs. However, clinical application with Dox is limited due to its potentially fatal cumulative cardiotoxicity. N-p-coumaroyl-4-aminobutan-1-ol (alk-A), an organic amide alkaloid and hippophamide (alk-B), a rare pyridoindole alkaloid were successfully obtained by purification and separation of seabuckthorn seed residue in our previous research. This study was undertaken to investigate the protective effect of alk-A and alk-B against Dox-induced embryonic rat cardiac cells (H9c2 cells) apoptosis. Methods: H9c2 cells were treated with Dox (2.5 mu M) in the presence of alk-A and alk-B (10, 20, and 40 mu M) and incubated for 24 h. Results: It was shown that pretreatment of the H9c2 cells with alk-A and alk-B significantly reduced Dox-induced apoptosis. Alk-A and alk-B both inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and suppressed cleaved-caspase-3 protein expression and the activation of JNK (Jun N-terminal kinases), as well as increasing ATP levels, favoring mitochondrial mitofusin protein expression, and relieving damage to mitochondrial DNA. Conclusions: These results suggest that alk-A and alk-B can inhibit Dox-induced apoptosis in H9C2 cardiac muscle cells via inhibition of cell apoptosis and improvement of mitochondrial function, while alk-B showed more protection. Alk-B could be a potential candidate agent for protecting against cardiotoxicity in Dox-exposed patients.

AB  - Since Alzheimer disease is one of the most prevalent types of dementia with a high mortality and disability rate, so development of multi-target drugs becomes the major strategy for battling AD. This study shows the development of a series of quinazolinone based derivatives as novel, multifunctional anti-AD drugs that exhibit both cholinesterase inhibitory and anti-inflammatory properties. The preliminary results of the in vitro AChE inhibition activity showed that compounds 4b, 5a, 6f, 6h and 7b were better represented for further evaluation. Furthermore, in-vivo AChE inhibition activity and behavior Morris water maze test against donepezil as reference drug were evaluated. Additionally, hippocampal inflammatory markers; TNF-alpha, NF kappa B, IL-1 beta and IL-6 and antioxidant markers; SOD and MDA were assessed to evaluate the efficacy of quinazolinone derivatives against AD hallmarks. The results showed that 6f, 6h and 7b have promising anti-acetylcholinesterase, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities thus, have a significant effect in treatment of AD. Moreover, Histopathological examination revealed that 6f, 6h and 7b derivatives have neuroprotective effect against neuronal damage caused by induced scopolamine model in mice. Finally, the binding ability of the synthesized derivatives to the target, AChE was investigated through molecular docking which reflected significant interactions to the target based on their docking binding scores. Hence, the newly designed quinazolinone derivatives possess promising antiacetylcholinesterase activity and challenging for the management of AD in the future.

AB  - Most patients that resuscitate successfully from cardiac arrest (CA) suffer from poor neurological prognosis. DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) is known to have neuroprotective effects via multiple mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate whether NBP can decrease neurological impairment after CA. We studied the protective role of NBP in the hippocampus of a rat model of cardiac arrest induced by asphyxia. Thirty-nine rats were divided randomly into sham, control, and NBP groups. Rats in control and NBP groups underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 6 min after asphyxia. NBP or vehicle (saline) was administered intravenously 10 min after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons was observed under transmission electron microscope. NBP treatment improved neurological function up to 72 h after CA. The ultrastructural lesion in mitochondria recovered in the NBP-treated CA model. In conclusion, our study demonstrated multiple therapeutic benefits of NBP after CA.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the principal cause of dementia, and its incidence increases with age. Altered antioxidant systems and inflammation have an important role in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Hericium erinaceus, a nutritional mushroom with important antioxidant effects, in a rat model of AD. Animals were injected with 70 mg/Kg of AlCl3 daily for 6 weeks, and Hericium erinaceus was administered daily by gavage. Before the experiment's end date, behavioral test training was performed. At the end of the study, behavioral changes were assessed, and the animals were euthanized. Brain tissues were harvested for further analysis. AlCl3 mainly accumulates in the hippocampus, the principal region of the brain involved in memory functions and learning. Hericium erinaceus administration reduced behavioral changes and hippocampal neuronal degeneration. Additionally, it reduced phosphorylated Tau levels, aberrant APP overexpression, and beta-amyloid accumulation. Moreover, Hericium erinaceus decreased the pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory hippocampal alterations induced by AD. In particular, it reduced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome components, usually activated by increased oxidative stress during AD. Collectively, our results showed that Hericium erinaceus has protective effects on behavioral alteration and histological modification associated with AD due to the modulation of the oxidative and inflammatory pathways, as well as regulating cellular brain stress.

AB  - Appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AA) is unique from other gastrointestinal malignancies in that it almost exclusively metastasizes to the peritoneal cavity. However, few studies have investigated the molecular interaction of the peritoneal microenvironment and AA. Here, we use a multi-omics approach with orthotopic and flank-implanted patient-derived xenografts (PDX) to study the effect of the peritoneal microenvironment on AA. AA tumors implanted in the peritoneal microenvironment tended to grow faster and displayed greater nuclear expression of Ki-67 relative to the same tumors implanted in the flank. Comparing the tumor-specific transcriptome (excluding stromal transcription), the peritoneal microenvironment relatively upregulated genes related to proliferation, including MKI67 and EXO1. Peritoneal tumors were also enriched for proliferative gene sets, including E2F and Myc Targets. Proteomic studies found a 2.5-fold increased ratio of active-to-inactive phosphoforms of the YAP oncoprotein in peritoneal tumors, indicating downregulation of Hippo signaling.Implications: The peritoneal microenvironment promotes growth of appendiceal tumors and expression of proliferative pathways in PDXs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized with senile plaques formed by A beta deposition, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which ultimately lead to cognitive impairment. Despite the heavy economic and life burdens faced by the patients with AD, effective treatments are still lacking. Previous studies have reported the neuroprotective effects of FGF10 in CNS diseases, but its role in AD remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that FGF10 levels were reduced in the serum of AD patients, as well as in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice and APPswe-transfected HT22 cells, suggesting a close relationship between FGF10 and AD. Further investigations revealed that intranasal delivery of FGF10 improved cognitive functions in 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally, FGF10 treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis, thereby mitigating neuronal cell damage and synaptic deficits in the cortex and hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice, as well as APPswe-transfected HT22 cells. Furthermore, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of FGF10 gene delivery for treating AD symptoms and pathologies. Tail vein delivery of the FGF10 gene using AAV9 improved cognitive and neuronal functions in 3xTg-AD mice. Similarly, endogenous FGF10 overexpression ameliorated tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis in the cortex and hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, we confirmed that the FGFR2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was activated following intranasal FGF10 delivery and AAV9-mediated FGF10 gene delivery in 3xTg-AD mice and APPswe-transfected HT22 cells. Knockdown of FGFR2 attenuated the protective effect of FGF10. Collectively, these findings suggest that intranasal delivery of FGF10 and AAV9-mediated FGF10 gene delivery could be a promising disease-modifying therapy for AD.

AB  - Glial cells have been implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy in humans and in its models. Astrocytes are lost in several brain regions after acute seizures induced by pilocarpine and may suffer hyperplasia at subsequent time points. This study investigated the effect of N-methyl-(2S,4R)-trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (NMP) on astrocytes exposed to cytotoxic concentrations of pilocarpine. Astrocytes were incubated with pilocarpine (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)=31.86 mM) for 24 h. Afterwards, they were treated with NMP at concentrations ranging from 3.12 to 100 mg/mL for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta Psi m) were analyzed by flow cytometry using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and rhodamine-123 (Rho123), respectively. Expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1) were measured by western blot. Pilocarpine significantly decreased cell viability and mitochondrial potential and increased ROS concentration significantly by 6.7 times compared to the control. NMP concentrations >= 25 mu g/mL protected astrocytes against pilocarpine-induced injury in a concentration-dependent manner. Concomitantly, NMP reduced cytoplasmic ROS accumulation to 27.3, 24.8, and 12.3% in the groups treated with 25, 50, and 100 mu g/mL NMP, respectively. NMP also protected mitochondria from pilocarpine-induced depolarization. These effects were associated with improvement of pilocarpine-induced GFAP and VDAC-1 overexpression, which are important biomarkers of astrocyte dysfunction. In conclusion, the improvement of ROS accumulation, VDAC-1 overexpression, and mitochondrial depolarization are possible mechanisms of the NMP protective action on reactive astrocytes.

AB  - Replacement involving estrogens has proven efficacy at treating a wide range of disorders that develop with menopause or after surgical removal of the ovaries. Here, we tested whether an estradiol (E2) replacement paradigm that recapitulates physiological E2 levels in the circulation also recapitulates physiological E2 levels within the hippocampus. E2 was delivered continuously to old ovariectomized (OVX) rhesus macaques, maintained on a high-fat, high-sugar Western-style diet (WSD) for-30 months, via subcutaneous implants; this resulted in physiological concentrations of both estrone (E1) and E2 in the circulation (determined by LC-MS/ MS). Surprisingly, however, hippocampal concentrations of E2 were markedly (P < 0.01) higher than in ovary-intact animals maintained on a regular chow diet. The data suggest that E2 replacement paradigms that appear to recapitulate physiological E2 concentrations in the circulation may produce hyper-physiological E2 levels within some brain areas, especially when individuals are maintained on a WSD.

AB  - While moderately activated microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are pivotal in clearing amyloid beta (A beta), hyperactivated microglia perpetuate neuroinflammation. Prior investigations reported that the elimination of similar to 80% of microglia through inhibition of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) during the advanced stage of neuroinflammation in 5xFamilial AD (5xFAD) mice mitigates synapse loss and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, prolonged CSF1R inhibition diminished the development of parenchymal plaques. Nonetheless, the effects of short-term CSF1R inhibition during the early stages of neuroinflammation on residual microglia are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 10-day CSF1R inhibition using PLX5622 in three-month-old female 5xFAD mice, a stage characterized by the onset of neuroinflammation and minimal A beta plaques. We observed similar to 65% microglia depletion in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The leftover microglia displayed a noninflammatory phenotype with reduced NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome complexes. Moreover, plaque-associated microglia were reduced with diminished Clec7a expression. Additionally, phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein and the protein sequestosome 1 analysis suggested reduced mechanistic targets of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and autophagy in microglia and neurons within the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Biochemical assays validated the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, decreased mTOR signaling in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and enhanced autophagy in the hippocampus. However, short-term CSF1R inhibition did not influence A beta plaques, soluble A beta-42 levels, astrocyte hypertrophy, or hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, short-term CSF1R inhibition during the early stages of neuroinflammation in 5xFAD mice promotes the retention of homeostatic microglia with diminished inflammasome activation and mTOR signaling, alongside increased autophagy.

AB  - The main pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, include senile plaque (deposited by amyloid beta), neurofibrillary tangle (formed by paired helical filaments composed of hyperphosphorylated tau), and massive loss of neurons. Currently there is a lack of ideal drugs to halt AD progression. Gypenosides (GPs), a kind of natural product, possesses potential therapeutic effects for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. However, the specific role and mechanism of GPs for AD remain unclear. In the current study, we used staurosporine (STP), an inducer of apoptosis and causing tau hyperphosphorylation, to mimic AD models, and explored the role and mechanism of Gypenoside IX (one of the extracts of Gynostemma, GP for short name in our experiments) in STP treated primary hippocampal neurons and rats. We found STP not only increased apoptosis and tau hyperphosphorylation, but also significantly increased A beta production, resulting in synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in mimic AD models by STP. GP was found to rescue apoptosis and cognitive impairments caused by STP treatment. Moreover, GP recovered the decreased synaptic proteins PSD95, Synaptophysin and GluR2, and blocked dendritic spine loss. Interestingly, GP decreased the STP induced tau hyperphosphorylation at different sites including S-199, S-202, T-205, T-231, S-262, S-396, and S-404, and at the same time decreased A beta production through down-regulation of BACE1 and PS1. These effects in STP treated primary hippocampal neurons and rats were accompanied with a restoration of AKT/GSK-3 beta signaling axis with GP treatment, supporting that dysregulation of AKT/GSK-3 beta pathway might be involved in STP related AD pathogenesis. The results from our research proved that GP might be a potential candidate compound to reduce neuronal damage and prevent the cognitive decline in AD.

AB  - The nucleoside guanosine is an endogenous neuromodulator associated with neuroprotection. The roles of guanosine during aging are still not fully elucidated. Guanosine modulates SUMOylation in neurons and astrocytes in vitro, but it is not known whether guanosine can modulate SUMOylation in vivo and improve cognitive functions during aging. SUMOylation is a post-translational protein modification with potential neuroprotective roles. In this follow-up study, we investigated whether guanosine could modulate SUMOylation in vivo and behavior in young and aged mice. Young (3-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) C57BL/6 mice were treated with guanosine (8 mg/kg intraperitoneal) daily for 14 days. Starting on day 8 of treatment, the following behavioral tests were performed: open field, novel object location, Y-maze, sucrose splash test, and tail suspension test. Treatment with guanosine did not change the locomotor activity of young or aged mice in the open-field test. Treatment with guanosine improved short-term memory only for young mice but did not change the working memory of either young or aged mice, as evaluated using object recognition and the Y-maze tests, respectively. Depressive-like behaviors, such as impaired grooming evaluated through the splash test, did not change in either young or aged mice. However, young mice treated with guanosine increased their immobility time in the tail suspension test, suggesting an effect on behavioral coping strategies. Global SUMO1-ylation was significantly increased in the hippocampus of young and aged mice after 14 days of treatment with guanosine, whereas no changes were detected in the cerebral cortex of either young or aged mice. Our findings demonstrate that guanosine also targets hippocampal SUMOylation in vivo, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of its mechanisms of action. This highlights the involvement of SUMOylation in guanosine's modulatory and neuroprotective effects.

AB  - Social defeat stress (SDS) due to changes in biochemical functions has been implicated in the pathogenesis of affective and cognitive disorders. Employing pharmacological approach with adaptogens in the management and treatment of psychosocial stress is increasingly receiving scientific attention. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of rutin, a bioflavonoid with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory functions on neurobehavioral and neuro-biochemical changes in mice exposed to SDS. Groups of mice named the intruder mice received normal saline (10 mL/kg), rutin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, i.p.), and ginseng (50 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 14 days, and then followed by 10 min daily SDS (physical/psychological) exposures to aggressor mice from days 7-14. Investigations consisting of neurobehavioral (locomotion, memory, anxiety, and depression) phenotypes, neuro-biochemical (oxidative, nitrergic, cholinergic, and pro-inflammatory cytokines) levels in discrete brain regions, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis consisting adrenal weight, corticosterone, and glucose concentrations were assessed. Rutin restored the neurobehavioral deficits and reduced the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the brains. Adrenal hypertrophy, increased serum glucose and corticosterone levels were significantly attenuated by rutin. SDS-induced release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus were also suppressed by rutin in a brain-region-dependent manner. Moreover, SDS-induced oxidative stress characterized by low antioxidants (glutathione, superoxide-dismutase, catalase) and lipid peroxidation and nitrergic stress were reversed by rutin in discrete brain regions. Collectively, our data suggest that rutin possesses an adoptogenic potential in mice exposed to SDS via normalization of HPA, oxidative/nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory inhibitions. Thus, may be adopted in the management of neuropsychiatric syndrome due to psychosocial stress.

AB  - Eprosartan (EPRO), an angiotensin receptor type-1 (AT-1) blocker, exhibited neuroprotective activities in ischemic stroke resulting from focal cerebral ischemia in rats. The current study aimed to clarify the neuroprotective role of EPRO in middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemic stroke in rats. Fifty-six male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 14 per group): sham-operated group, sham receiving EPRO (60 mg/kg/day, po) group, ischemia-reperfusion (IR) group, and IR receiving EPRO (60 mg/kg/day, po) group. MCAO led to a remarkable impairment in motor function together with stimulation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways in the hippocampus of rats. After MCAO, the AT1 receptor in the brain was stimulated, resulting in activation of Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 signaling generating more neuroinflammatory milieu and destructive actions on the hippocampus. Augmentation of caspase-3 level by MCAO enhanced neuronal apoptosis synchronized with neurodegenerative effects of oxidative stress biomarkers. Pretreatment with EPRO opposed motor impairment and decreased oxidative and apoptotic mediators in the hippocampus of rats. The anti-inflammatory activity of EPRO was revealed by downregulation of nuclear factor-kappa B and tumor necrosis factor-beta levels and (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Moreover, the study confirmed the role of EPRO against a unique pathway of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and its subsequent inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, upregulation of caveolin-1 mRNA level was also observed along with decreased oxidative stress marker levels and brain edema. Therefore, EPRO showed neuroprotective effects in MCAO-induced cerebral ischemia in rats via attenuation of oxidative, apoptotic, and inflammatory pathways.

AB  - The neural basis of anxiety is unclear, which hinders the treatment of anxiety disorders. Here, we found that alpha CaMKII+ neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC alpha CaMKII+) responded to stressors with increased activity both under physiological conditions and after repeated restraint stress (RRS) in mice. Chemogenetic activation of mPFC alpha CaMKII+ neurons ameliorated stress-induced anxiety. A delayed increase in the expression of growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a), the receptor of the peripheral metabolic hormone ghrelin, in mPFC alpha CaMKII+ neurons coincided with reduced excitatory synaptic transmission and the development of RRS-induced enhancement of anxiety-related behavior. Virus-mediated GHS-R1a upregulation in mPFC alpha CaMKII+ neurons exaggerated the excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance and promoted anxiety-related behavior, whereas GHS-R1a knockdown had the opposite effect. We conclude that GHS-R1a signaling contributes to the development of stress-induced anxiety by shaping synaptic activity of mPFC alpha CaMKII+ neurons. GHS-R1a may be a new therapeutic target for treating anxiety disorders.

AB  - Hypoxic postconditioning (HPC) was reported to stabilize nuclear beta-catenin by inhibiting lysine (K)-specific demethylase 2 A (KDM2A) in hippocampal CA1 against transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI). Herein we investigate how HPC inhibits the K48-linked poly-ubiquitination (K48-Ub)-related degradation of nuclear beta-catenin in CA1 after tGCI. We confirmed that SCFKDM2A complex targets nuclear beta-catenin for degradation via ubiquitin proteasome pathway in vitro. HPC reduced SCFKDM2A complex and the K48-Ub of beta-catenin, and increased ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) in nucleus after tGCI. Furthermore, KDM2A knockdown decreased the K48-Ub of nuclear beta-catenin and nuclear beta-catenin-SCFKDM2A complex interaction after tGCI. Moreover, beta-catenin knockdown suppressed nuclear survivin expression and attenuated neuroprotection induced by HPC. In contrast, the overexpression of USP22 promoted nuclear beta-catenin deubiquitination and enhanced the neuroprotective effects offered by HPC. Taken together, this study supports that HPC downregulated the K48-Ub of nuclear beta-catenin through suppressing SCFKDM2A and increasing USP22, thereby inducing cerebral ischemic tolerance.

AB  - The central nervous system continuously detects circulating concentrations of lipids such as fatty acids and troglycerides. Once information has been detected, the central nervous system can in turn participate in the control of energy balance and blood sugar levels and in particular regulate the secretion and action of insulin. Neurons capable of detecting circulating lipid variations are located in the hypothalamus and in other regions such as the nucleus accumbens, the striatum or the hippocampus. An excess lipids will have deleterious effects and may induce central lipotoxicity, in particular following local production of ceramides and the appearance of neuroinflammation which may lead to metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Thetranscription factor KAISO is important for proper development of animal embryos. In the cell, KAISO regulates cell division and apoptosis. KAISO is abundant in the central nervous system. Here we describe the effects of Zbtb33 gene knockout on the transcription of several genes that regulate the development of the central nervous system, including Fgf9, Fgfr3, Sox9, Sox2, c-Myc, NeuroDl and FoxG1. These genes are related to the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which is closely connected to KAISO. Hippocampal, frontal cortical, and striatal tissue from C57BL/6j mice with a knockout in the Zbtb33 gene encoding KAISO (ZBTB33+) and wild-type mice (ZBTB33 +) were collected and profiled at different stages of development. Age-dependent and region-specific differences in the mRNA levels of the Fgf9, Fgfr3, c-Myc, FoxG1 genes in the developing brain of ZBTB33- and ZBTB33+ mice were described and discussed.

AB  - Catalpol is an iridoid glycoside with rich content, rich nutrition, and numerous biological activities in Rehmanniae Radix contained in classic antidepressant prescriptions in Chinese clinical medicine. Catalpol has been confirmed previously its exact antidepressant-like effect involved heme oxygenase (HO)-1, but its antidepressant molecular targets and mechanism are still unclear. Here, catalpol's antidepressant-like molecular target was diagnosed and confirmed by ZnPP intervention [the antagonist of HO-1, (10 mu g/rat), intracerebroventricular] for the first time, and its molecule mechanism network was determined through HO-1 related pathway and molecules in the hippocampus. Results showed that ZnPP significantly abolished catalpol's (10 mg/kg) reversal on depressive-like behaviors of chronic unpredictable mild stress rats, abolished catalpol's up-regulation on the phosphorylation level of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)'s receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), the nuclear expression level of nuclear factor E 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the levels of anti-oxidant factors (such as HO-1, SOD, GPX, GST, GSH) and BDNF, and abolished catalpol's down-regulation on the levels of peroxide and neuroinflammation factors [cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), induced nitrogen monoxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO)]. Thus, HO-1 could serve as an important potential molecular target for catalpol's antidepressant-like process, and the antidepressant-like mechanism of catalpol could at least involve the activation of HO-1 triggering the up-regulation of the ERK1/2/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway-related factors to enhance the anti-oxidant defense, triggering the down-regulation of the COX-2/iNOS/NO pathway-related factors to inhibit neuroinflammation, and triggering the up-regulation of the BDNF/TrkB pathway to enhance neurotrophy.

AB  - Geraniol (GE), an important ingredient in several essential oils, displayed pleiotropic biological activities through targeting multiple signaling cascades. In the current study, we aimed to examine the protective effect of GE on D-galactose (D-gal) induced cognitive impairment and explore the underlying mechanisms. Forty male Wistar rats (8 weeks old) were randomly categorized into 4 groups; Group I (saline + vehicle [edible oil]), group II (saline + geraniol) (100 mg/kg/day orally), group III (D-galactose) (100 mg/kg/day subcutaneously injected), and group IV (D-galactose + geraniol). Behavioral impairments were evaluated. Brain levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activities were estimated. The levels of inflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-k beta)], endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors [inositol requiring protein 1(IRE1) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)], brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway were measured by ELISA. Also, hippocampal histopathological assessment and immunohistochemical analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and caspase-3 were performed. Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA expression and protein levels were assessed. GE effectively ameliorated aging-related memory impairment through increasing GSH, BDNF, Ach levels, and SOD activity. Additionally, GE treatment caused a decrease in the levels of MDA, inflammatory mediators, and ER stress sensors as well as the AchE activity together with concomitant down-regulation of GRP78 and CHOP mRNA expression. Moreover, GE improved neuronal architecture and rat's spatial memory; this is evidenced by the shortened escape latency and increased platform crossing number. Therefore, GE offers a unique pharmacological approach for aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Our study aimed to explore the function and mechanism of action of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) SRY-Box 21 antisense RNA 1 (SOX21-AS1) in amyloid beta(25-35) (A beta(25-35))-induced neuronal damage. To induce neuronal damage, neuronal cells and differentiated IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells were challenged by A beta(25-35). SOX21-AS1 and miR-132 quantities were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cell damage was evaluated by detecting the changes of cell viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Cell viability was measured using cell counting kit-8. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity. The oxidative stress was analyzed by reactive oxygen species level. The expression of proteins associated with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway was examined by western blot. SOX21-AS1 abundance was up-regulated in A beta(25-35)-challenged neuronal cells. Silencing of SOX21-AS1 attenuated A beta(25-35)-induced viability reduction and promotion of apoptosis and oxidative stress, suggesting that silencing of SOX21-AS1 repressed A beta(25-35)-induced neuronal damage. miR-132 quantity was reduced in A beta(25-35)-challenged neuronal cells, and negatively controlled by SOX21-AS1. miR-132 knockdown abolished the effect of SOX21-AS1 silencing on A beta(25-35)-induced neuronal damage, indicating that SOX21-AS1 controls A beta(25-35)-induced neuronal damage via regulating miR-132. The PI3K/AKT signaling was repressed in A beta(25-35)-challenged cells, but this effect was counteracted upon overexpression of miR-132. In conclusion, SOX21-AS1 knockdown mitigated A beta(25-35)-dependent neuronal cell damage by promoting miR-132/PI3K/AKT pathway.

AB  - Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have a high capacity to differentiate into the neuronal cell lineage. Meanwhile, both Hippo signaling and melatonin are key regulators in neuronal differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells. Recently emerging evidences suggest the possible interaction between melatonin and Hippo signaling in different cell lines. But underlying mechanisms involved in the initiation or progression of neurogenic differentiation in DPSCs through this connection need to be explored. Therefore, the scope of this study is to investigate the effect of melatonin on Hippo signaling pathway through the expression of its downstream effector (YAP/p-YAPY357) after the neuronal differentiation of DPSCs. In regard with this, DPSCs were incubated with growth and dopaminergic neuronal differentiation medium with or without melatonin (10 mu M) for 21 days. The morphological changes were followed by phase contrast microscopy and differentiation of DPSCs was evaluated by immunofluorescence labelling with NeuN, GFAP, and tyrosine hydroxylase. Furthermore, we evaluated the presence of neural progenitor cells by nestin immunoreactivity. Hippo signaling pathway was investigated by evaluating the immunoreactivity of YAP and p-YAPY357. Our results were also supported by western-blot analysis and SOX2, PCNA and caspase-3 were also evaluated. The positive immunoreactivity for NeuN, tyrosine hydroxylase and negative immunoreactivity for GFAP showed the successful differentiation of DPSCs to neurons, not glial cells. Melatonin addition to dopaminergic media induced tyrosine hydroxylase and decreased significantly nestin expression. The expressions of PCNA and caspase-3 were also decreased significantly with melatonin addition into growth media. Melatonin treatment induced phosphorylation of YAPY357 and reduced YAP expression. In conclusion, melatonin has potential to induce neuronal differentiation and reduce the proliferation of DPSCs by increasing phosphorylation of YAPY357 and eliminating the activity of YAP, which indicates the active state of Hippo signaling pathway.

AB  - Epileptic activity leads to rapid insertion of calcium-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (CP-AMPARs) into the synapses of cortical and hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, which generally do not express them. The physiological significance of this process is not yet fully understood; however, it is usually assumed to be a pathological process that augments epileptic activity. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat entorhinal cortex slices, we demonstrate that the timing of epileptiform discharges, induced by 4-aminopyridine and gabazine, is determined by the shunting effect of Ca2+-dependent slow conductance, mediated predominantly by K+-channels. The blockade of CP-AMPARs by IEM-1460 eliminates this extra conductance and consequently increases the rate of discharge generation. The blockade of NMDARs reduced the additional conductance to a lesser extent than the blockade of CP-AMPARs, indicating that CP-AMPARs are a more significant source of intracellular Ca2+. The study's main findings were implemented in a mathematical model, which reproduces the shunting effect of activity-dependent conductance on the generation of discharges. The obtained results suggest that the expression of CP-AMPARs in principal neurons reduces the discharge generation rate and may be considered as a protective mechanism.

AB  - The development of neuropathy and of mood alterations is frequent after chemotherapy. These complications, independent from the antitumoral mechanism, are interconnected due to an overlapping in their processing pathways and a common neuroinflammatory condition. This study aims to verify whether in mice the treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ), at a protocol capable of inducing painful neuropathy, is associated with anxiety, depression and supraspinal neuroinflammation. We also verify if the therapeutic treatment with the antagonist of the prokineticin (PK) system PC1, which is known to contrast pain and neuroinflammation, can prevent mood alterations. Mice were treated with BTZ (0.4 mg/kg three times/week for 4 weeks); mechanical allodynia and locomotor activity were evaluated over time while anxiety (dark light and marble burying test), depression (sucrose preference and swimming test) and supraspinal neuroinflammation were checked at the end of the protocol. BTZ treated neuropathic mice develop anxiety and depression. The presence of mood alterations is related to the presence of neuroinflammation and PK system activation in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus with high levels of PK2 and PKR2 receptor, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, TLR4 and an upregulation of glial markers. PC1 treatment, counteracting pain, prevented the development of supraspinal inflammation and depression-like behavior in BTZ mice.

AB  - Avocado (Persea americana) contains a variety of physiological active substances such as polyphenol, which has excellent antioxidant properties. This study investigated the radioprotective effect of avocado peel extract on congenital malformations and on the behavior of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Experimental animals were randomly classified into four groups: NC Group, normal control; PA Group, oral administration with avocado peel extract (200 mg/kg/day); IR Group, irradiation; and PA+IR Group, irradiation after orally administered with avocado peel extract. For irradiation, 2 Gy of 6 MV X-ray was used once for the whole body. After that, congenital malformations, histopathological evaluation of the brain, and behavioral evaluation were performed in the obtained offspring. Although the body weight of the offspring was decreased by radiation exposure, it was confirmed that the decrease in weight was smaller when treated with PA. As the congenital malformations, hydrocephalus, loss of eyes, and abnormal rat tail occurred, and the result for the PA+IR Group was significantly lower than that of IR Group. Histopathologically, the length of the cerebral cortex of the PA+IR Group was similar to that of the non-radiation group. It was confirmed that emotional and behavioral disorders such as anxiety and depression were improved in the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test. And proved that working memory and cognitive ability were enhanced in the novel object recognition (NOR) test and spontaneous alternation Y-maze (SAY) test. Therefore, it was concluded that avocado peel extract can reduce the incidence of congenital malformations and improve growth disorders, memory and cognitive abilities. In the future, based on these results, we will conduct research on the hippocampus and amygdala, which are major regions of the brain, and additional research on cell biology.

AB  - The transport of mRNAs to distal subcellular compartments is an important component of spatial gene expression control in neurons. However, the mechanisms that control mRNA localization in neurons are not completely understood. Here, we identify the abundant base modification, m(6)A, as a novel regulator of this process. Transcriptome-wide analysis following genetic loss of m(6)A reveals hundreds of transcripts that exhibit altered subcellular localization in hippocampal neurons. Additionally, using a reporter system, we show that mutation of specific m(6)A sites in select neuronal transcripts diminishes their localization to neurites. Single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments further confirm our findings and identify the m(6)A reader proteins YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 as mediators of this effect. Our findings reveal a novel function for m(6)A in controlling mRNA localization in neurons and enable a better understanding of the mechanisms through which m(6)A influences gene expression in the brain.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis are implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Here we examine the effects of valproic acid (VA) plus 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) on abnormal electrical brain activity, ER stress and apoptosis in acute seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Forty male rats were randomly divided into five groups, each consisting of 8 rats as follows: Sham, PTZ, VA+PTZ, 4-PBA+PTZ, and VA plus 4-PBA+PTZ. The treated groups received VA, 4-PBA and VA plus 4-PBA by intraperitoneal application for 7 days prior to PTZ-induced seizure. On the 8th day, acute epileptic seizures were induced by PTZ (50 mg/kg, i.p.) injection, except for the sham group. Then, the seizure stage was observed and ECoG activities were recorded during the 30 min. At 24th post seizures, the hippocampus and blood samples were collected for biochemical and histopathological examinations. Administration of VA plus 4-PBA prior to PTZ-induced seizures significantly decreased seizure stage, the duration of generalized tonic-clonic seizure and the total number of spikes as increased the latency to the first myoclonic jerk when compared to the PTZ group. 4-PBA suppressed the increased levels of ER stress markers GRP78 and CHOP in the hippocampus. VA plus 4-PBA treatment before seizures significantly inhibited PTZ-induced elevations of apoptosis-related indicators caspase-3 and caspase-12, and significantly reduced the number of histopathological lesions of the hippocampus region at 24th post seizures. These findings suggest that administration of VA plus 4-PBA prior to PTZ-induced seizures may be involved in the neuroprotective potential of these agents for seizures.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of treadmill maternal exercise on alterations induced by prenatal stress in neonatal mice. Female and male Balb/c mice were divided into five groups: control (CON), prenatal restraint stress (PNS), prenatal restraint stress and physical exercise before pregnancy (PNS + EX1), prenatal restraint stress and physical exercise during pregnancy (PNS + EX2), and prenatal restraint stress and physical exercise before and during pregnancy (PNS + EX3). Exercise was performed using a treadmill, at a speed of 10 m/min, for 60 min, 5 days a week. Maternal behavior was assessed on days 3, 4 and 5 postpartum (PPD). Placental gene expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), 11-13-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (1113-HSD2), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (5HT1AR), and corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) were analyzed. In neonatal mice, the gene expression of GR, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), CRHR1, 5HTr1, oxytocin Receptor 1 (OXTr1), tropomyosin related kinase B (TR kappa B), brain-derived neurotrophic factor exon I (BDNF I), and BDNF IV was analyzed in the brain (PND0) and hippocampus (PND10). Maternal exercise improved (p < 0.05) maternal care. In the placenta, maternal exercise prevented (p < 0.01) the increase in GR expression caused by PNS. In the brain from PND0, exercise before pregnancy prevented (p = 0.002) the decreased CRHR1 expression promoted by PNS. In the hippocampus of PND10 males, PNS decreased (p = 0.0005) GR expression, and exercise before pregnancy prevented (p = 0.003) this effect. In PND10 females, maternal exercise prevented (p < 0.05) the PNS-induced increase in MR expression. PNS + EX2 males showed increased (p < 0.01) BDNF I gene expression and PNS + EX1 females demonstrated increased (p = 0.03) BDNF IV expression. In conclusion, maternal physical exercise may play a role in modulating maternal-fetal health and may contribute to preventing neurodevelopmental changes induced by prenatal stress.

AB  - Asparagus racemosus Willd. (Family Liliaceae), also known as female reproductive tonic, is traditionally used across the Sub-Himalayan region in Uttarakhand, India for treatment of epilepsy and disorders of female reproductive system. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the anticonvulsant effect of A. racemosus in a mouse model of catamenial epilepsy. We artificially increased progesterone and neurosteroid levels (a state of pseudo-pregnancy) in adult Swiss albino female mice by injecting pregnant mares' serum gonadotropin (PMSG) (5 IU s.c.), followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (5 IU s.c.) after 46 h. In the following 10 days, A. racemosus treatment was given along with measurement of progesterone, estradiol, and corticosterone levels in the blood. Neurosteroid withdrawal was induced by finasteride (50 mg/kg, i.p.) on treatment day 9. Twenty-four hours after finasteride administration (day 10 of treatment), seizure susceptibility was evaluated with the sub-convulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) dose (40 mg/kg i.p.). Four hours after PTZ, animals were assessed for depression like phenotypes followed by euthanasia and separation of brain parts (cortex and hippocampus). The results showed that PMSG and HCG treatment elevated progesterone and estradiol levels. Treatment with finasteride increased seizure susceptibility and depression due to decreased progesterone and elevated estrogen levels coupled with decreased monoamine and elevated corticosterone levels. A. racemosus treatment, on the other hand, significantly decreased seizure susceptibility and depression like behaviors, possibly because of increased progesterone, restored estradiol, corticosterone, and monoamine levels. We concluded that herbal formulations using A. racemosus root extracts may be used as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy along with available AEDs for the better and safe management of catamenial epilepsy as well as comorbid depression.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) refers to a widespread psychiatric disorder. Astrocytes play a pivotal role in regulating inflammation which is a well-acknowledged key component in depression pathogenesis. However, the effects of the neuroinflammation-inducing A1-like astrocytes on MDD are still unknown. TWIK-related K+ channel 1 (TREK-1) has been demonstrated to regulate the action of antidepressants. Nevertheless, its mechanisms and effects on A1-like astrocyte stimulation in MDD are not clear. Therefore, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments using TREK-1 specific inhibitor spadin. In vivo, rats were subjected to a 6-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) followed by spadin treatment. Behavioral tests were employed to surveil depressive-like behaviors. Hippocampal proteomic analysis was carried out with the purpose of identifying differentially expressed proteins after CUMS and spadin treatments. In vitro, astrocyte-conditioned medium and spadin were used to treat rat astrocyte cell line. The activated microglia, inflammatory factors, A1 astrocyte markers, and activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway were later analyzed using immunofluorescence, western blot, and RT-qPCR. Our findings indicated that blockage of TREK-1 reduced CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior in rats, inhibited the microglial stimulation, reduced inflammatory factor levels, and suppressed the activation of A1-like reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus. We also verified that the suppression of A1-like astrocytes by spadin necessitated the NF-kappa B pathway. According to the findings, blocking TREK-1 inhibited the activation of A1-like reactive astrocytes via the NF-kappa B signaling pathway in MDD. Our study preliminarily identifies a novel antidepressant mechanism of TREK-1 action and provides a therapeutic path for MDD.

AB  - Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening neurological emergency characterized by persistent seizures, leading to brain damage that increases the risk of recurrent seizures due to abnormal electrical impulses produced by damaged neurons. However, the molecular mechanism by which convulsive SE leads to neuronal damage is not completely understood. Cathepsin S (Ctss), a lysosomal cysteine protease, has been implicated in secondary injury after traumatic brain injury. This study sought to explore whether Ctss is also involved in SE-induced neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were utilized to detect the expression of Ctss in the hippocampal subregions of male C57BL/6J mice at various times following kainic acid (KA)-induced SE. The reactivity of microglia was assessed using immunohistochemistry, and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining was employed to identify damaged neurons. We found that the mature form of Ctss is barely observed in na & iuml;ve adult (12-week-old) mouse hippocampus, but its expression is significantly evident at 50 weeks of age. In adult mice, the expression of both pro-and mature forms of Ctss in the hippocampal CA3 region was increased as early as 16 h following KA-induced SE. The increased Ctss immunoreactivity was mainly found in microglia following KA-induced SE. The damaged neurons visualized by FJC staining were prominent in the CA3 region at 16 h following KA-induced SE. Ctss knockdown did not affect KA-induced behavioral seizures but significantly reduced SE-induced microglia activation and neuronal damage. An increase in chemokine CX3C motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1) immunoreactivity on microglia was observed following KA-induced SE, and CX3C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) antagonist AZD8797 treatment significantly attenuated SE-induced microglia activation and neuronal damage. Altogether, these results indicate a crucial role of Ctss in SE-induced neuronal damage, possibly through CXC3L1-mediated microglial activation, and provide a new perspective for preventing SE-induced neuronal damage.image

AB  - The construction industry is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, driving the need for sustainable solutions. Ultra-lightweight structures have emerged as an effective approach to reducing material usage and energy consumption. This study explores the potential of ultra-lightweight architectural systems through a learning-by-doing methodology, integrating innovative composite materials, PolRe, and knitting techniques to enhance tensegrity structures for sustainable, deployable, and efficient structural designs. Combining physical modeling, inspired by Frei Otto and Heinz Isler, with digital simulations using Kangaroo 2 and Python, this research employs form-finding and finite element analysis to validate structural performance. A 1:5 scale prototype was constructed using a manual knitting machine adapted from traditional knitting techniques.

AB  - Deep-frying oil (DFO) contains high amounts of free radicals, and consuming foods prepared with this method causes damage to nervous tissue due to oxidative stress (OS). Since moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training (AT) reduces OS, the current search investigated the effects of AT on OS, apoptosis, and neurogenesis markers in the hippocampal tissue of DFO-fed rats. Eighteen Wistar male rats (200-280 gr) were randomly allocated to a control group fed with normal food (Con-ND), a control group receiving DFO (Con-DFO), and a group receiving DFO-aerobic exercise (EX-DFO) (n = 6 in each). DFO was gavaged for four weeks, five days a week, with a dose of 2 ml. AT included running on a treadmill for four weeks and five sessions per week (40 min per session). The expression of genes B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), Protein X associated with Bcl-2 (BAX), Caspase-3 (Casp-3), and Caspase-9 (Casp-9) was measured by PCR method. The ELISA method was used to calculate levels of Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). Also, the expression of the proteins Cannabinoid receptor type 1(CB1), Cannabinoid receptor type2 (CB2), Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Neuronal nuclei (NeuN), and DNA fragmentation was evaluated by Immunohistochemical and TUNEL staining. DFO feeding led to a significant increase in apoptotic markers, such as BAX, Casp-3, and Casp-9 gene expression, and DNA fragmentation (p <= 0.05) while decreasing BDNF concentration SOD activity (p <= 0.05). AT significantly reduced the BAX, Casp-3, Casp-9, MDA, CB1, GFAP, and DNA fragmentation (p <= 0.05). In conclusion, AT can reduce the harmful effects of feeding with DFO on the hippocampal tissue.

AB  - Adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)R) are widely expressed in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and their presynaptic terminals. It is well known that endogenous adenosine regulates hippocampal function through the activation of A(1)R in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and has been reported that blockade of A(1)R induces stronger potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission in CA2 pyramidal neurons than in CA1 pyramidal neurons. This strong potentiation of CA2 neurons is thought to be caused by the specific modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission through postsynaptic A(1)R. However, the direct effects of A(1)R on postsynaptic AMPA channels remain unknown because of the technical difficulties of patch-clamp recording from mature hippocampal CA2 neurons. We recorded synaptic currents from pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA2 and analyzed the effects of an A(1)R antagonist on stimulation-evoked synaptic transmission and local application-induced postsynaptic AMPA currents. The antagonist increased the amplitude of evoked synaptic transmission in neurons in both CA1 and CA2. This facilitation was larger in pyramidal neurons in CA2 than in CA1. The antagonist also increased postsynaptic AMPA currents in neurons in CA2 but not in CA1. This facilitation of CA2 AMPA currents was occluded by the intracellular application of a G-protein blocker. Even with the blockade of postsynaptic G-protein signaling, the A(1)R antagonist increased evoked synaptic transmission in neurons in CA2. These results suggest that synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons in CA2 is regulated by both presynaptic and postsynaptic A(1)R. Moreover, A(1)R regulate excitatory synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons in CA2 through the characteristic postsynaptic modulation of AMPA currents.

AB  - Explore the mechanism by which the antioxidant effect of hydrogen-rich water alleviates radiation-induced cognitive impairment based on the PI3K/AKT/Caspase-9 signaling pathway. Male SD rats were randomly divided into control group (Control group), simple irradiation (IR) group, high-dose hydrogen-rich water intervention (IR + HHRW) group, and low-dose hydrogen-rich water intervention (IR + LHRW) group. The irradiation dose was 20 Gy, and the whole brain was irradiated. The control group and IR group were given pure water (20 mL<middle dot>kg(-1)), and the IR + HHRW group and IR + LHRW group were given hydrogen-rich water (20 mL<middle dot>kg(-1), 10 mL<middle dot>kg(-1)) for 30 days. Within 30 days after irradiation, the irradiated rats all had hair loss on the head, and the IR group showed the most obvious hair loss, and the IR + HHRW group had the mildest degree of hair loss. In the second week after irradiation, the irradiated rats showed a decrease in food intake and weight loss. During this period, the food intake and body weight loss of the rats in the IR + HHRW group were lower than those in the IR and IR + LHRW groups. At the third week after irradiation, the food intake and body weight of the rats in each group began to gradually recover, and the rats in the IR + HHRW group fastest recovered. Hematological tests showed that after irradiation, the BRC and HGB of the rats in the IR group decreased, and the levels of RBC and HGB in the IR + HHRW group tended to increase compared with the IR group. The results of the novel object recognition (NOR) experiment showed that compared with the IR group, the rats in the IR + HHRW group had a significantly higher preference index for new objects. The results of the Morris water maze test showed that compared with the IR group, the escape latency of the rats in the IR + LHRW group and the IR + HHRW group was shortened, among which, on the 5th day, the IR + HHRW group had a significant difference; on the 6th day, compared with the Control group, the time for the rats in the IR group to reach the platform for the first time was significantly longer, and the time for the rats in the IR + HHRW group to reach the original platform for the first time was significantly shorter than that of the IR group, and the times of crossing the platform and the time of staying in the quadrant of the original platform were both prolonged (p < 0.05). HE staining and TUNEL staining showed that the number of apoptotic hippocampal neurons in the IR group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and the number of apoptotic hippocampal neurons in the IR + HHRW group was less than that in the IR group. The detection of oxidative stress indicators in brain tissue showed that compared with the IR group, the levels of ROS, MDA and IL-6 in the IR + HHRW group were significantly lower; SOD and GSH were significantly higher. PCR results: Compared with the IR group, the expression levels of genes PI3K and AKT in the IR + HHRW group were significantly increased, and the expression levels of apoptosis factors Caspase-9 and Cytc were significantly decreased. Western-Blot results: Compared with IR group, IR + HHRW histone PI3K, pAKT expression was significantly increased, apoptosis factor Caspase-9 and Cytc protein expression was significantly decreased.
   Hydrogen-rich water can improve the radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats induced by ionizing radiation through anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, and regulation of PI3K/AKT/Caspase-9 pathway, and there is a certain dose-effect relationship.

AB  - Background Depression is often linked to inflammation in the brain. Researchers have been exploring ways to reduce this inflammation to improve depression symptoms. One potential target is a protein called RIPK1, which is known to contribute to brain inflammation. However, it's unclear how RIPK1 influences depression. Our study aims to determine whether RIPK1 inhibition could alleviate neuroinflammation-associated depression and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Methods To investigate our research objectives, we established a neuroinflammation mouse model by administering LPS. Behavioral and biochemical assessments were conducted on these mice. The findings were subsequently validated through in vitro experiments. Results Using LPS-induced depression models, we investigated RIPK1's role, observing depressive-like behaviors accompanied by elevated cytokines, IBA-1, GFAP levels, and increased inflammatory signaling molecules and NO/H2O2. Remarkably, Necrostatin (Nec-1 S), a RIPK1 inhibitor, mitigated these changes. We further found altered expression and phosphorylation of eIF4E, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and synaptic proteins in hippocampal tissues, BV2, and N2a cells post-LPS treatment, which Nec-1 S also ameliorated. Importantly, eIF4E inhibition reversed some of the beneficial effects of Nec-1 S, suggesting a complex interaction between RIPK1 and eIF4E in LPS-induced neuroinflammation. Moreover, citronellol, a RIPK1 agonist, significantly altered eIF4E phosphorylation, indicating RIPK1's potential upstream regulatory role in eIF4E and its contribution to neuroinflammation-associated depression. Conclusion These findings propose RIPK1 as a pivotal mediator in regulating neuroinflammation and neural plasticity, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target for depression.

AB  - The peanut de-oiling industry currently lacks efficient processing technologies for de-oiling at low or room temperatures. A novel method, micro-aqueous extraction (MAE), offers over 93 % de-oiling efficiency at room temperature and is also effective for other oilseeds like sesame, camellia, and rapeseed. Despite its effectiveness, the exact mechanism behind oleosomes destabilization at a critical hydration level or oil volume fraction (phi similar to 0.75) is not fully understood. This study investigates how MAE affects peanut oleosome size, paste stability, and the interfacial properties of surfactant proteins. Results showed that micro-aqueous hydration and agitation caused small droplets (85.6 vol% < 10 mu m) to coalesce into larger droplets (90.0 vol% > 30 mu m) due to press- induced rupture of the liquid film. Simultaneously, agitation decreased water mobility and protein intrinsic fluorescence, while increasing paste viscosity, leading to protein aggregation. This aggregation further promoted oleosome coalescence. Additionally, hydration and agitation weakened the ability of membrane proteins to stabilize oleosomes by increasing interfacial tension and decreasing dilatational storage modulus. The insights into the peanut oleosome destabilization mechanism for MAE provide a foundation for scaling up the process, with the potential to replace current hot and cold pressing techniques.

AB  - Neonatal brain injury remains a significant issue with limited treatment options. This study investigates the potential of the endogenous neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester (DHEAS) as neuroprotective agents, building on evidence of their mechanisms in adult brain injury models. The primary objective was to evaluate their neuroprotective and anti-oxidative properties in a mouse model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Using the modified Rice-Vannucci model, brain injury was induced in 7-day-old mouse pups, followed by treatment with various concentrations of DHEA and DHEAS (0.1, 1, and 10 mu g/g body weight) via intraperitoneal injection after a 2 h recovery period. Mice were sacrificed after 24 hours for analysis of somatometry, brain injury, apoptosis, microglial activation, and oxidative stress markers (NOX2, 4-HNE, 8-OHdG), along with the anti-oxidant marker SOD1. While no statistically significant effects of DHEA or DHEAS were observed at the tested doses and time points, the absence of toxic or adverse effects highlights their safety profile. These findings provide a foundation for further research into optimizing dosing strategies, timing, and delivery methods. Future studies should refine these variables to maximize neuroprotective efficacy, investigate DHEA(S)' exact mechanisms of action, and explore their potential for clinical application in neonatal care.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) implicates neuronal loss, plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, and disturbed neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis, which leads to severe dementia, memory loss, as well as thinking and behavioral perturbations that could ultimately lead to death. Calcium dysregulation and low acetylcholine levels are two main mechanisms implicated in Alzheimer's disease progression. Simultaneous inhibition of calcium oscillations (store overload-induced Ca2+ release [SOICR]) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by a single molecule may bring a new breath of hope for AD treatment. Here, we described some dantrolene derivatives as dual inhibitors of the ryanodine receptor and AChE. Two series of acylhydrazone/sulfonylhydrazone derivatives with aromatic group were designed and synthesized. In this study, the target compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit SOICR and AChE in vitro, using dantrolene and donepezil as positive controls. Compound 22a exhibited excellent and balanced inhibitory potency against SOICR (inhibition (%) = 90.1, IC50 = 0.162 mu M) and AChE (inhibition (%) = 93.5, IC50 = 0.372 mu M). Docking simulations showed that several preferred compounds could bind to the active sites of both the proteins, further validating the rationality of the design strategy. Potential therapeutic effects in AD were evaluated using the Barnes maze and Morris water maze tests, which demonstrated that compound 22a significantly improved memory and cognitive behavior in AD model mice. Moreover, it was also found that compound 22a could enhance synaptic strength by measuring hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices. These results suggested that the introduction of a sulfonyl-hydrazone scaffold and aromatic substitution to dantrolene derivatives provided a useful template for the development of potential chemical entities against AD.

AB  - Neuropathic pain is well known to occur after damage to the somatosensory system. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has neuroprotective effects when the central nervous system is subjected to internal and external stimulations. However, the exact mechanism by which AhR regulates neuropathic pain is poorly understood. Nerve explant culture and the chronic constrictive nerve injury (CCI) model in wild or AhR-knockout mice were used in this study. In the nerve explant culture, the ovoid number increased in the AhR-/- condition and was decreased by omeprazole (AhR agonist) in a dose-dependent manner. Increased nerve degeneration and the associated inflammation response appeared in the AhR-/- condition, and these changes were attenuated by omeprazole. High expression of AhR in the injured nerve was noted after CCI. Deletion of AhR aggravated nerve damages and this was restored by omeprazole. Deletion of AhR increased NGF expression and reduced axon number in the paw skin, but this was attenuated by omeprazole. A highly expressed inflammation reaction over the dorsal spinal cord, somatosensory cortex, and hippocampus was noted in the AhR-deleted animals. Administration of omeprazole attenuated not only the inflammatory response, but also the amplitude of somatosensory evoked potential. Deletion of AhR further aggravated the neurobehavior compared with the wild type, but such behavior was attenuated by omeprazole. Chronic constrictive nerve injury augmented AhR expression of the injured nerve, and AhR deletion worsened the damage, while AhR agonist omeprazole counteracted such changes. AhR agonists could be potential candidates for neuropathic pain treatment.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasing global healthcare crisis with few effective treatments. The accumulation of amyloid plaques and hyper-phosphorylated tau are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of AD. However, current studies have recognized a prominent role of cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD. We recently reported that SNPs in soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) are linked to AD in human genetic studies and that long-term administration of an sEH inhibitor attenuated cerebral vascular and cognitive dysfunction in a rat model of AD. However, the mechanisms linking changes in cerebral vascular function and neuroprotective actions of sEH inhibitors in AD remain to be determined. This study investigated the effects of administration of an sEH inhibitor, 1-(1-Propanoylpiperidin-4-yl)-3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]urea (TPPU), on neurovascular coupling, blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, neuroinflammation, and cognitive dysfunction in an hAPP/PS1 TgF344-AD rat model of AD. We observed predominant beta-amyloid accumulation in the brains of 9-10-month-old AD rats and that TPPU treatment for three months reduced amyloid burden. The functional hyperemic response to whisker stimulation was attenuated in AD rats, and TPPU normalized the response. The sEH inhibitor, TPPU, mitigated capillary rarefaction, BBB leakage, and activation of astrocytes and microglia in AD rats. TPPU increased the expression of pre- and post-synaptic proteins and reduced loss of hippocampal neurons and cognitive impairments in the AD rats, which was confirmed in a transcriptome and GO analysis. These results suggest that sEH inhibitors could be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.

AB  - Emotional stress is one of the health risk factors in the modern human lifestyle. Stress exposure can provoke the manifestation of various pathological conditions, one of which is a sharp increase in the blood pressure level. In the present study, we analyzed changes in the transcriptome profiles of the hypothalamus of hypertensive ISIAH and normotensive WAG rats exposed to a single short-term restraint stress (the rat was placed in a tight wire-mesh cage for 2 h). This type of stress can be considered emotional stress. The functional annotation of differentially expressed genes allowed us to identify the most significantly altered biological processes in the hypothalamus of hypertensive and normotensive rats. The study made it possible to identify a group of genes that describe a general response to stress, independent of the rat genotype, as well as a hypothalamic response to stress specific to each strain. The alternatively changing expression of the Npas4 (neuronal PAS domain protein 4) gene, which is downregulated in the hypothalamus of the control WAG rats and induced in the hypothalamus of hypertensive ISIAH rats, is suggested to be the key event for understanding inter-strain differences in the hypothalamic response to stress. The stress-dependent ISIAH strain-specific induction of Fos and Jun gene transcription may play a crucial role in neuronal activation in this rat strain. The data obtained can be potentially useful in the selection of molecular targets for the development of pharmacological approaches to the correction of stress-induced pathologies related to neuronal excitability, taking into account the hypertensive status of the patients.

AB  - Patients receiving cranial radiotherapy for primary and metastatic brain tumors may experience radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI). Thus far, there has been a lack of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for RIBI. Due to its complicated underlying pathogenic mechanisms, it is rather difficult to develop a single approach to target them simultaneously. We have recently reported that Reprimo (RPRM), a tumor suppressor gene, is a critical player in DNA damage repair, and RPRM deletion significantly confers radioresistance to mice. Herein, by using an RPRM knockout (KO) mouse model established in our laboratory, we found that RPRM deletion alleviated RIBI in mice via targeting its multiple underlying mechanisms. Specifically, RPRM knockout significantly reduced hippocampal DNA damage and apoptosis shortly after mice were exposed to whole-brain irradiation (WBI). For the late-delayed effect of WBI, RPRM knockout obviously ameliorated a radiation-induced decline in neurocognitive function and dramatically diminished WBI-induced neurogenesis inhibition. Moreover, RPRM KO mice exhibited a significantly lower level of acute and chronic inflammation response and microglial activation than wild-type (WT) mice post-WBI. Finally, we uncovered that RPRM knockout not only protected microglia against radiation-induced damage, thus preventing microglial activation, but also protected neurons and decreased the induction of CCL2 in neurons after irradiation, in turn attenuating the activation of microglial cells nearby through paracrine CCL2. Taken together, our results indicate that RPRM plays a crucial role in the occurrence of RIBI, suggesting that RPRM may serve as a novel potential target for the prevention and treatment of RIBI.

AB  - Stress susceptibility could play a role in developing premenstrual anxiety due to abnormalities in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and impairments in the GABAA receptors' benzodiazepine (BDZ) site. Hence, we studied the stress-vulnerable Wistar Kyoto rat strain (WKY) to evaluate progesterone withdrawal (PW) effects on anxiety, HPA axis response, and to explore indicators of GABAA functionality in the BDZ site. For five days, ovariectomized WKY rats were administered 2.0 mg/kg of progesterone. Twenty-four hours after the last administration, rats were tested in the anxiety-like burying behavior test (BBT) or elevated plus maze test (EPM), and corticosterone was determined. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding autoradiography served as the BDZ binding site index of the GABAA receptor in amygdala nuclei and hippocampus's dentate gyrus (DG). Finally, different doses of diazepam in PW-WKY rats were tested in the BBT. PW induced anxiety-like behaviors in both BBT and EPM compared with No-PW rats. PW increased corticosterone, but was blunted when combined with PW and BBT. PW increased [3H]Flunitrazepam binding in the DG and central amygdala compared with No-PW rats. Diazepam at a low dose induced an anxiogenic-like response in PW rats, suggesting a paradoxical response to benzodiazepines. Overall, PW induced anxiety-like behavior, a blunted HPA axis response, and higher GABAAR/BZD binding site sensitivity in a stress-vulnerable rat strain. These findings demonstrate the role of stress-susceptibility in GABAAR functionality in a preclinical approximation of PMDD.

AB  - Stem-cell-based therapy is very promising for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet has not become a reality. A critical challenge is the transplantation microenvironment, which impacts the therapeutic effect of stem cells. In AD brains, amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides and inflammatory cytokines continuously poison the tissue microenvironment, leading to low survival of grafted cells and restricted efficacy. It is necessary to create a growth-supporting microenvironment for transplanted cells. Recent advances in AD studies suggest that the asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) is a potential intervention target for modifying pathological changes. We here chose APP/PS1 mice as an AD model and employed pharmacological inhibition of the AEP for one month to improve the brain microenvironment. Thereafter, we transplanted neural stem cells (NSCs) into the hippocampus and maintained therapy for one more month. We found that inhibition of AEPs resulted in a significant decrease of A beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta in their brains. In AD mice receiving NSC transplantation alone, the survival of NSCs was at a low level, while in combination with AEP inhibition pre-treatment the survival rate of engrafted cells was doubled. Within the 2-month treatment period, implantation of NSCs plus pre-inhibition of the AEP significantly enhanced neural plasticity of the hippocampus and rescued cognitive impairment. Neither NSC transplantation alone nor AEP inhibition alone achieved significant efficacy. In conclusion, pharmacological inhibition of the AEP ameliorated brain microenvironment of AD mice, and thus improved the survival and therapeutic efficacy of transplanted stem cells.

AB  - Psychosis in disorders like schizophrenia is commonly associated with aberrant salience and elevated striatal dopamine. However, the underlying cause(s) of this hyper-dopaminergic state remain elusive. Various lines of evidence point to glutamatergic dysfunction and impairments in synaptic plasticity in the etiology of schizophrenia, including deficits associated with the GluA1 AMPAR subunit. GluA1 knockout (Gria1(-/-)) mice provide a model of impaired synaptic plasticity in schizophrenia and exhibit a selective deficit in a form of short-term memory which underlies short-term habituation. As such, these mice are unable to reduce attention to recently presented stimuli. In this study we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure phasic dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens of Gria1(-/-) mice to determine whether this behavioral phenotype might be a key driver of a hyper-dopaminergic state. There was no effect of GluA1 deletion on electrically-evoked dopamine responses in anaesthetized mice, demonstrating normal endogenous release properties of dopamine neurons in Gria1(-/-) mice. Furthermore, dopamine signals were initially similar in Gria1(-/-) mice compared to controls in response to both sucrose rewards and neutral light stimuli. They were also equally sensitive to changes in the magnitude of delivered rewards. In contrast, however, these stimulus-evoked dopamine signals failed to habituate with repeated presentations in Gria1(-/-) mice, resulting in a task-relevant, hyper-dopaminergic phenotype. Thus, here we show that GluA1 dysfunction, resulting in impaired short-term habituation, is a key driver of enhanced striatal dopamine responses, which may be an important contributor to aberrant salience and psychosis in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia.

AB  - Platycarpha glomerata (Thunb.) Less. has recently become a plant species of interest to researchers due to its biological activities and less toxic effects. Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate the in vitro anticancer potential and phytochemical constituents of P. glomerata plant extracts. Phytochemical screening and FTIR were carried out using standard methods. The antioxidant activity was accessed by determining its ability to scavenge the DPPH radical and nitric oxide radical, whereas the anticancer activity against prostate (DU-145 and PC-3), human T-lymphocyte (SKU-T), gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS), and human prostatic epithelial (PNTA1) cell line was evaluated using the MTT assay. The phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, terpenoids, and cardiac glycosides. The FTIR spectrum for the aqueous extract displayed characteristic peaks for O-H, C=O, C=C, and =C-H stretch. The aqueous ethanol and methanol extracts showed significant dose-dependent DPPH radical scavenging capacity. The aqueous, ethanol, and methanol extracts showed minimum NO scavenging activity of 4.3%, 9.6%, and 11.7% at 2500 mu g/mL. The water extract demonstrated good activity against S. aureus, E. coli, and B. pumilus with an MIC of 0.195 mg/mL. The ethanol and methanol extracts significantly reduced the percentage proliferation of DU-145, PC-3, and SKU-T cells at 100 mu g/mL. These extracts demonstrated strong dose-dependent DPPH and NO scavenging and antibacterial and cell proliferation inhibition activities. The strong bioactivity of P. glomerata makes it a good candidate for the isolation and identification of active compounds for anticancer and related illnesses.

AB  - In search of novel potential drug candidates that could be used as treatments or prophylactics for memory impairment, an aporphine alkaloid magnoflorine (MAG) isolated from the root of Berberis vulgaris was proven to exhibit beneficial anti-amnestic properties. Its effects on immunoreactivity to parvalbumin in the mouse hippocampus were assessed together with a study on its safety and concentration in the brain and plasma. For this purpose, four experimental groups were created: the MAG10 group-treated with 10 mg MAG/kg b.w. i.p., the MAG20 group-treated with 20 mg MAG/kg b.w. i.p., the MAG50 group-treated with 50 mg MAG/kg b.w. i.p., and a control group-injected with saline i.p. at a volume corresponding to their weight. Our results indicated that the hippocampal fields CA1-CA3 were characterized by an elevated number of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons (PV-IR) and nerve fibers in mice at the doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg b.w. (i.p.). No significant changes to the levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6 or TNF-alpha were observed for the above two doses; however, the administration of 50 mg/kg b.w. i.p. caused a statistically significant elevation of IL-6, IL-1beta plasma levels and an insignificant raise in the TNF-alpha value. The HPLC-MS analysis showed that the alkaloid's content in the brain structures in the group treated with 50 mg/kg b.w. did not increase proportionally with the administered dose. The obtained results show that MAG is able to influence the immunoreactivity to PV-IR in hippocampal neurons and might act as a neuroprotective compound.

AB  - Mercury is a highly toxic metal that causes a variety of neurological disorders through oxidative stress. Allium sativum, a cooking spice in diverse cultures around the world, has a long history of medicinal use due to its rich antioxidant constituents. This study was designed to evaluate the protective activity of aqueous Allium sativum bulb extract (ASBE) on mercuric chloride (HgCl2)-induced neurotoxicity. Forty Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups namely I (control), II (HgCl2; 4 mg/kg), III (250 mg/kg of ASBE and 4 mg/kg of HgCl2), IV (500 mg/kg of ASBE and 4 mg/kg of HgCl2) and V (500 mg/kg of Vitamin E and 4 mg/kg of HgCl2). At the end of the administration, neurobehavioural, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation and apoptotic activities as well as the histology of the cerebrum, cerebellum and hippocampus were assessed. Body and brain weights, locomotion, exploration, cognition, memory and antioxidant enzymes were significantly impaired (p < 0.05) in HgCl2-exposed rats following comparison to control. Lipid peroxidation, mercury concentration and caspase-3 activity were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05) in HgCl2-exposed rats following comparison to control. In addition, significant alterations to the histology of the cerebrum, cerebellum and hippocampus were observed in the HgCl2-exposed rats. Conversely, the adverse effects induced by HgCl2 were significantly attenuated (p < 0.05) following ASBE and Vitamin E pretreatment. Taken together, these results suggest that ABSE exerts its neuroprotective activity through its potent antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties.

AB  - Chronic pain often leads to cognitive impairment. Resveratrol (Res), a natural polyphenol existing in Polygonum cuspidatum, has been widely investigated for its antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Our aim was to explore the ameliorating effects of resveratrol on pain-related behaviors and learning and memory deficits induced by cobra venom-induced trigeminal neuralgia (TN). The TN model of rats was established by injecting cobra venom solution beneath the epineurium of the infraorbital nerve. Resveratrol was intragastrically administered at a dose of 40 mg/kg twice daily beginning on postoperative day 15. CREB inhibitor 666-15 was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg from POD 35-42 after morning resveratrol treatment. Mechanical allodynia was measured via von Frey filaments. Rat free movement was videotaped and analyzed. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated via the Morris water maze test. Ultrastructures of the hippocampal DG region and infraorbital nerve were observed by transmission electron microscopy. We found that resveratrol alleviated TN-induced allodynia, ameliorated learning and memory deficits, restored the ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons and synapses, repaired the damaged myelin sheath of the infraorbital nerve, and activated the CREB/BDNF pathway in the hippocampus of TN rats. CREB inhibitor administration suppressed the resveratrol-rescued abnormal hippocampal ultrastructural changes and aggravated spatial learning and memory impairment by inhibiting CREB/BDNF pathway activation in the hippocampus. Our findings indicated that resveratrol alleviated pain and improved cognitive deficits, probably by regulating neural ultrastructure remodelling and the CREB/BDNF pathway.

AB  - Several ligands have been proposed for the GPR39 receptor, including the element zinc. The relationship between GPR39 and magnesium homeostasis has not yet been examined, nor has such a relationship in the context of seizures/epilepsy. We used samples from mice that were treated with an agonist of the GPR39 receptor (TC-G 1008) and underwent acute seizures (maximal electroshock (MES)- or 6-hertz-induced seizures) or a chronic, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling model of epilepsy. MES seizures and PTZ kindling, unlike 6 Hz seizures, increased serum magnesium concentration. In turn, Gpr39-KO mice that underwent PTZ kindling displayed decreased concentrations of this element in serum, compared to WT mice subjected to this procedure. However, the levels of expression of TRPM7 and SlC41A1 proteins-which are responsible for magnesium transport into and out of cells, respectively-did not differ in the hippocampus between Gpr39-KO and WT mice. Furthermore, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry applied to hippocampal slices did not reveal differences in magnesium levels between the groups. These data show the relationship between magnesium homeostasis and certain types of acute or chronic seizures (MES seizures or PTZ kindling, respectively), but do not explicitly support the role of GPR39 in mediating magnesium balance in the hippocampus in the latter model. However, decreased expression of TRPM7 and increased expression of SLC41A1-which were observed in the hippocampi of Gpr39-KO mice treated with TC-G 1008, in comparison to WT mice that received the same treatment-implicitly support the link between GPR39 and hippocampal magnesium homeostasis.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is associated with the pathophysiology of depression. The molecular mechanism of depressive-like behavior caused by sepsis-associated encephalopathy ( SAE) is incompletely understood. J147 (an analog of curcumin) has been reported to improve memory and has neuroprotective activity, but its biological function in the depressivelike behavior observed in SAE is not known. We investigated the effects of J147 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammatory, depressive-like behaviors, and the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/ nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B) signal pathway in the mouse hippocampus and microglia (BV2 cells). The forced-swimming test (FST) and tail- suspension test (TST) were undertaken for assessment of depressive-like behaviors. Expression of the proinflammatory genes interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured using RT-qPCR and ELISA. Microglia activation was detected using immunofluorescence staining. The TLR4/NF-alpha B signaling pathway was studied using western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. J147 pretreatment markedly downregulated expression of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha, and the mean fluorescence intensity of ionized calcium-binding adapter protein-1 in microglia. J147 restrained LPS-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (I.B) degradation, and TLR4 activation in microglia. J147 administration inhibited bodyweight loss, mortality, microglia activation, and depressive-like behaviors in LPS-treated mice. In conclusion, J147 ameliorated the sepsis-induced depressive-like behaviors induced by neuroinflammation through attenuating the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in microglia.

AB  - The Hippo/YAP signaling pathway is closely related to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases. However, it's still unclear whether this pathway plays a certain role in hypertension. In this study, aortic morphology and function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were comprehensively evaluated using Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) as controls. Results indicated that the aorta of SHRs have distinct changes in pathological structure. Furthermore, the proliferative activity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was enhanced, with vascular fibrosis being aggravated. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SHRs exhibited high expression of Yes-Associated Protein (YAP). Western Blot analysis showed that cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ expression decreased in hypertensive rats, indicating that YAP/TAZ nuclear transfer increased and Hippo/YAP signaling pathway had been activated. The cell function experiments of VSMCs extracted from rat aorta showed that the cell viability and proliferation ability of VSMCs in SHRs were enhanced, the expression of Fibronectin and collagen I was increased, and vascular fibrosis was aggravated. siRNA-YAP (si-YAP) can reverse the above phenomenon in VSMCs. Knockdown of YAP can inhibit Foxm1 expression. As an inhibitor of large tumor suppressor kinases LAST1/2, GA-107 can inhibit the phosphorylation level of YAP, increase blood pressure, aggravate aortic pathomorphological changes, promote VSMCs proliferation and vascular fibrosis, and thus aggravate hypertension symptoms in SHRs. However, these effects of GA-107 can be antagonized by inhibiting Foxm1 with thiosulfathiazole (Thio). Conclusively, Hippo/YAP signaling pathway promotes vascular remodeling through the regulation of Foxm1 and causes hypertension.

AB  - Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV1) causes a persistent infection in the mammalian brain. Peroxisomes and mitochondria play essential roles in the cellular antiviral immune response, but the effect of BoDV1 infection on peroxisomal and mitochondrial dynamics and their respective antioxidant capacities is still not clear. Using different mouse lines-i.e., tumor necrosis factor-alpha transgenic (TNFTg; to pro-inflammatory status), TNF receptor-1 knockout (TNFR1ko), and TNFR2ko mice in comparison to wild-type (Wt) mice-we analyzed the abundances of both organelles and their main antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), in neurons of the hippocampal, cerebral, and cerebellar cortices. In TNFTg mice, a strong increase in mitochondrial (6.9-fold) and SOD2 (12.1-fold) abundances was detected; meanwhile, peroxisomal abundance increased slightly (1.5-fold), but that of catalase decreased (2.9-fold). After BoDV1 infection, a strong decrease in mitochondrial (2.1-6.5-fold), SOD2 (2.7-9.1-fold), and catalase (2.7-10.3-fold) abundances, but a slight increase in peroxisomes (1.3-1.6-fold), were detected in Wt and TNFR2ko mice, whereas no changes occurred in TNFR1ko mice. Our data suggest that the TNF system plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of both subcellular organelles. Moreover, TNFR1 signaling mediated the changes in peroxisomal and mitochondrial dynamics after BoDV1 infection, highlighting new mechanisms by which BoDV1 may achieve immune evasion and viral persistence.

AB  - Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) demonstrate deficits in social functioning that contribute to early withdrawal from school and delinquency, as well as the development of anxiety and depression. Dopamine is involved in reward, motivation, and social behavior. Thus, we evaluated whether neonatal ethanol exposure (in an animal model of FASDs) has an impact on social recognition memory using the three-chamber social novelty discrimination test during early and middle adolescence in male and female rats, and whether the modafinil analog, the novel atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor CE-123, can modify this effect. Our study shows that male and female rats neonatally exposed to ethanol exhibited sex- and age-dependent deficits in social novelty discrimination in early (male) and middle (female) adolescence. These deficits were specific to the social domain and not simply due to more general deficits in learning and memory because these animals did not exhibit changes in short-term recognition memory in the novel object recognition task. Furthermore, early-adolescent male rats that were neonatally exposed to ethanol did not show changes in the anxiety index but demonstrated an increase in locomotor activity. Chronic treatment with CE-123, however, prevented the appearance of these social deficits. In the hippocampus of adolescent rats, CE-123 increased BDNF and decreased its signal transduction TrkB receptor expression level in ethanol-exposed animals during development, suggesting an increase in neuroplasticity. Thus, selective dopamine reuptake inhibitors, such as CE-123, represent interesting drug candidates for the treatment of deficits in social behavior in adolescent individuals with FASDs.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) activation is crucial for tumor formation and development, and its stability is regulated by ubiquitination. ISGylation is a type of ubiquitination like post-translational modification, whereas whether YAP is ISGylated and how ISGylation influences YAP ubiquitination-related function remains uncovered. In addition, YAP can activate glucose metabolism by activating the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and glycolysis, and generate a large number of intermediates to promote tumor proliferation. However, whether YAP stimulates the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), another tumor-promoting glucose metabolism pathway, and the relationship between this stimulation and ISGylation needs further investigation. Here, we found that YAP was ISGylated and this ISGylation inhibited YAP ubiquitination, proteasome degradation, interaction with-beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (beta TrCP) to promote YAP stability. However, ISGylation-induced pro-YAP effects were abolished by YAP K497R (K, lysine; R, arginine) mutation, suggesting K497 could be the major YAP ISGylation site. In addition, YAP ISGylation promoted cell viability, cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor formation. YAP ISGylation also increased downstream genes transcription, including one of the key enzymes of PPP, 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL). Mechanistically, YAP promoted 6PGL transcription by simultaneously recruiting SMAD family member 2 (SMAD2) and TEA domain transcription factor 4 (TEAD4) binding to the 6PGL promoter to activate PPP. In clinical lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) specimens, we found that YAP ISGylation degree was positively associated with 6PGL mRNA level, especially in high glucose LUAD tissues compared to low glucose LUAD tissues. Collectively, this study suggested that YAP ISGylation is critical for maintaining its stability and further activation of PPP. Targeting ISGylated YAP might be a new choice for hyperglycemia cancer treatment.

AB  - Genomic studies focusing on the contribution of common and rare genetic variants of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder support the view that substantial risk is conferred through molecular pathways involved in synaptic plasticity in the neurons of cortical and subcortical brain regions, including the hippocampus. Synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) is central to associative learning and memory and depends on a pattern of gene expression in response to neuronal stimulation. Genes related to the induction of LTP have been associated with psychiatric genetic risk, but the specific cell types and timepoints responsible for the association are unknown. Using published genomic and transcriptomic datasets, we studied the relationship between temporally defined gene expression in hippocampal pyramidal neurons following LTP and enrichment for common genetic risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and for copy number variants (CNVs) and de novo coding variants associated with schizophrenia. We observed that upregulated genes in hippocampal pyramidal neurons at 60 and 120 min following LTP induction were enriched for common variant association with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder subtype I. At 60 min, LTP-induced genes were enriched in duplications from patients with schizophrenia, but this association was not specific to pyramidal neurons, perhaps reflecting the combined effects of CNVs in excitatory and inhibitory neuron subtypes. Gene expression following LTP was not related to enrichment for de novo coding variants from schizophrenia cases. Our findings refine our understanding of the role LTP-related gene sets play in conferring risk to conditions causing psychosis and provide a focus for future studies looking to dissect the molecular mechanisms associated with this risk.

AB  - Delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR) is a major complication after anesthesia and surgery in older adults. Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn; encoded by the gene, SNCA) has recently been shown to play an important role in hippocampus-dependent working memory. Aggregated forms of alpha-syn are associated with multiple neurotoxic mechanisms, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. In this study, we found that blocking alpha-syn improved both mitochondrial function and mitochondria-dependent neuronal apoptosis in a mouse model of dNCR. Various forms of alpha-syn (including total alpha-syn, phosphorylated-Ser129-alpha-syn, and oligomers) were upregulated in hippocampal tissue and extracted mitochondria after surgical challenge. Clenbuterol is a novel transcription modulator of Scna. Clenbuterol significantly attenuated surgery-induced progressive accumulation of various toxic alpha-syn forms in the hippocampus, as well as mitochondrial damage and memory deficits in aged mice following surgery. We also observed excessive mitochondrial alpha-syn accumulation and increased mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in vitro using nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons exposed to lipopolysaccharide. To further validate the neuroprotective effect of alpha-syn inhibition, we used a lentiviral Snca-shRNA (Lv-shSnca) to knockdown Snca. Of note, Lv-shSnca transfection significantly inhibited neuronal apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in neurons exposed to lipopolysaccharide. This alpha-syn inhibition improved the disruption to mitochondrial morphology and function, as well as decreased levels of apoptosis. Our results suggest that targeting pathological alpha-syn may achieve neuroprotection through regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis and suppression of apoptosis in the aged hippocampus, further strengthening the therapeutic potential of targeting alpha-syn for dNCR.

AB  - The improvement of in vitro embryo development is a gateway to enhance the output of assisted reproductive technologies. The Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways are crucial for the early development of bovine embryos. This study investigated the development of bovine embryos under the influence of a Hippo signaling agonist (LPA) and a Wnt signaling inhibitor (DKK1). In this current study, embryos produced in vitro were cultured in media supplemented with LPA and DKK1. We comprehensively analyzed the impact of LPA and DKK1 on various developmental parameters of the bovine embryo, such as blastocyst formation, differential cell counts, YAP fluorescence intensity and apoptosis rate. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to elucidate the in vitro embryonic development. Our results revealed that LPA and DKK1 improved the blastocyst developmental potential, total cells, trophectoderm (TE) cells and YAP fluorescence intensity and decreased the apoptosis rate of bovine embryos. A total of 1203 genes exhibited differential expression between the control and LPA/DKK1-treated (LD) groups, with 577 genes upregulated and 626 genes downregulated. KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with TGF-beta signaling, Wnt signaling, apoptosis, Hippo signaling and other critical developmental pathways. Our study shows the role of LPA and DKK1 in embryonic differentiation and embryo establishment of pregnancy. These findings should be helpful for further unraveling the precise contributions of the Hippo and Wnt pathways in bovine trophoblast formation, thus advancing our comprehension of early bovine embryo development.

AB  - Transient ischemia in the brain causes blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and dysfunction, which is related to ischemia-induced neuronal damage. Leakage of plasma proteins following transient ischemia is one of the indicators that is used to determine the extent of BBB dysfunction. In this study, neuronal damage/death, leakage of albumin and IgG, microgliosis, and inflammatory cytokine expression were examined in the hippocampal CA1 region, which is vulnerable to transient ischemia, following 5-min (mild) and 15-min (severe) ischemia in gerbils induced by transient common carotid arteries occlusion (tCCAo). tCCAo-induced neuronal damage/death occurred earlier and was more severe after 15-min tCCAo vs. after 5-min tCCAo. Significant albumin and IgG leakage (albumin and IgG immunoreactivity) took 1 or 2 days to begin, and immunoreactivity was markedly increased 5 days after 5-min tCCAo. While, albumin and IgG leakage began to increase 6 h after 15-min tCCAo and remained significantly higher over time than that seen in 5-min tCCAo. IgG immunoreactivity was observed in degenerating neurons and activated microglia after tCCAo, and microglia were activated to a greater extent after 15-min tCCAo than 5-min tCCAo. In addition, following 15-min tCCAo, pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta)] immunoreactivity was significantly higher than that seen following 5-min tCCAo, whereas immunoreactivity of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) was lower in 15-min than 5-min tCCAo. These results indicate that duration of tCCAo differentially affects the timing and degree of neuronal damage or loss, albumin and IgG leakage and inflammatory cytokine expression in brain tissue. In addition, more severe BBB leakage is closely related to acceleration of neuronal damage through increased microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the ischemic hippocampal CA1 region.

AB  - Due to their potent antibacterial properties, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in industry and medicine. However, they can cross the brain-blood barrier, posing a risk to the brain and its functions. In our previous study, we demonstrated that oral administration of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated AgNPs caused an impairment in spatial memory in a dose-independent manner. In this study, we evaluated the effects of AgNPs coating material on cognition, spatial memory functioning, and neurotransmitter levels in rat hippocampus. AgNPs coated with BSA (AgNPs(BSA)), polyethylene glycol (AgNPs(PEG)), or citrate (AgNPs(Cit)) or silver ions (Ag+) were orally administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg b.w. to male Wistar rats for a period of 28 days, while the control (Ctrl) rats received 0.2 mL of water. The acquisition and maintenance of spatial memory related to place avoidance were assessed using the active allothetic place avoidance task, in which rats from AgNPs(BSA), AgNPs(PEG), and Ag+ groups performed worse than the Ctrl rats. In the retrieval test assessing long-term memory, only rats from AgNPs(Cit) and Ctrl groups showed memory maintenance. The analysis of neurotransmitter levels indicated that the ratio between serotonin and dopamine concentration was disturbed in the AgNPs(BSA) rats. Furthermore, treatment with AgNPs or Ag+ resulted in the induction of peripheral inflammation, which was reflected by the alterations in the levels of serum inflammatory mediators. In conclusion, depending on the coating material used for their stabilization, AgNPs induced changes in memory functioning and concentration of neurotransmitters.

TI  - Exposure Assessment of Fluoride Intake Through Commercially Available Black Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) from Areas with High Incidences of Chronic Kidney Disease with Undetermined Origin (CKDu) in Sri Lanka

AB  - Fluoride is a beneficial trace element for human health as its deficiency and excess levels can cause detrimental health effects. In Sri Lanka, dry zone regions can have excessive levels of fluoride in drinking water and can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis. In addition to drinking water, traditional habits of tea consumption can cause an additional intake of fluoride in the population. A total number of 39 locally blended black tea samples were collected from a village where chronic kidney disease with undetermined origin (CKDu) is prevalent. In addition, unblended tea samples were obtained from tea-producing factories. The fluoride contents in infusions of 2% weight per volume (w/v) were measured using calibrated ion-selective fluoride electrodes. The mean fluoride content was 2.68 +/- 1.03 mg/L in loose tea, 1.87 +/- 0.57mg/L in packed tea samples, and 1.14 +/- 0.55 mg/L in unblended tea. Repeated brewing of the same tea leaves showed that over 50% of fluoride leached into the solution in the first infusion. An estimate of the daily total average fluoride intake via tea consumption per person is 2.68 mg per day. With groundwater in many dry zone regions in Sri Lanka showing high fluoride levels that exceed 0.5 mg/L, the additional daily intake can rapidly exceed recommended thresholds of 2 mg/day. This can add to adverse health impacts that might also relate to CKDu.

AB  - Glomerular mesangial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation contribute to the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). As a conserved stress-inducible protein, sestrin2 (Sesn2) plays critical role in the regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy, metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In this study, we investigated the role of Sesn2 on renal damage in diabetic kidney using transgenic mice overexpressing Sesn2 and the effect of Sesn2 on mesangial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation in diabetic conditions and the possible molecular mechanisms involved. Sesn2 overexpression improved renal function and decreased glomerular hypertrophy, albuminuria, mesangial expansion, extracellular matrix accumulation, and TGF-beta 1 expression, as well as oxidative stress in diabetic mice. In vitro experiments, using human mesangial cells (HMCs), revealed that Sesn2 overexpression inhibited high glucose (HG)-induced proliferation, fibronectin and collagen IV production, and ROS generation. Meanwhile, Sesn2 overexpression restored phosphorylation levels of Lats1 and YAP and inhibited TEAD1 expression. Inhibition of Lats1 accelerated HG-induced proliferation and expression of fibronectin and collagen IV. Verteporfin, an inhibitor of YAP, suppressed HG-induced proliferation and expression of fibronectin and collagen IV. However, Sesn2 overexpression reversed Lats1 deficiency-induced Lats1 and YAP phosphorylation, nuclear expression levels of YAP and TEAD1, and proliferation and fibronectin and collagen IV expressions in HMCs exposed to HG. In addition, antioxidant NAC or tempol treatment promoted phosphorylation of Lats1 and YAP and inhibited TEAD1 expression, proliferation, and fibronectin and collagen IV accumulation in HG-treated HMCs. Taken together, Sesn2 overexpression inhibited mesangial cell proliferation and fibrosis via regulating Hippo pathway in diabetic nephropathy. Induction of Sesn2 may be a potential therapeutic target in diabetic nephropathy.

AB  - Leaf color variations in tea plants were widely considered due to their attractive phenotypes and characteristic flavors. The molecular mechanism of color formation was extensively investigated. But few studies focused on the transformation process of leaf color change. In this study, four strains of 'Baijiguan' F1 half-sib generation with similar genetic backgrounds but different colors were used as materials, including Green (G), Yellow-Green (Y-G), Yellow (Y), and Yellow-Red (Y-R). The results of broadly targeted metabolomics showed that 47 metabolites were differentially accumulated in etiolated leaves (Y-G, Y, and Y-R) as compared with G. Among them, lipids were the main downregulated primary metabolites in etiolated leaves, which were closely linked with the thylakoid membrane and chloroplast structure. Flavones and flavonols were the dominant upregulated secondary metabolites in etiolated leaves, which might be a repair strategy for reducing the negative effects of dysfunctional chloroplasts. Further integrated analysis with the transcriptome indicated different variation mechanisms of leaf phenotype in Y-G, Y, and Y-R. The leaf color formation of Y-G and Y was largely determined by the increased content of eriodictyol-7-O-neohesperidoside and the enhanced activities of its modification process, while the color formation of Y-R depended on the increased contents of apigenin derivates and the vigorous processes of their transportation and transcription factor regulation. The key candidate genes, including UDPG, HCT, CsGSTF1, AN1/CsMYB75, and bHLH62, might play important roles in the flavonoid pathway.

AB  - Activation of microglial cells by intrinsic or extrinsic insult causes neuroinflammation, a common phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases. Prevention of neuroinflammation may ameliorate many neurodegenerative disease progressions. Dioscorea nipponica Makino (DN) extract can alleviate muscular atrophy and inflammatory diseases; however, the efficacy and mechanism of action in microglial cells remain unknown. The current study investigates the possible anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of Dioscorea nipponica Makino ethanol extract and its steroidal saponin dioscin. Our in vitro study shows that Dioscorea nipponica rhizome ethanol extract (DNRE) and dioscin protect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated inflammatory responses in BV-2 microglial cells by inhibiting phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B), resulting in the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. Consistent with our previous report of dioscin-mediated enhancement of neurotrophic factors in dopaminergic cells, here we found that dioscin upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation (pCREB) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus regions of the mouse brain. Scopolamine treatment increased pro-inflammatory enzyme levels and reduced the expression of BDNF and pCREB in the hippocampus and cortex regions, which led to impaired learning and referencing memory in mice. Pre-treatment of dioscin for 7 days substantially enhanced mice performances in maze studies, indicating amelioration in cognitive deficits. In conclusion, DNRE and its active compound dioscin protect against neurotoxicity most likely by suppressing NF-kappa B phosphorylation and upregulating neurotrophic factor BDNF.

AB  - The reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as lamivudine (3TC) play important roles in anti-ageing, but their effects on neurodegenerative diseases caused by ageing are not clear, especially on the functions of the nervous system such as cognition. In this study, we administered 3TC to senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice by gastric perfusion (100 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Our results showed that 3TC significantly improved the ageing status of SAMP8 mice, especially the decline of cognitive ability evaluated by the Morris water maze test. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of improving the ageing status of SAMP8 mice by 3TC, the qPCR and tissue staining methods were used to study the brain tissues (i.e., hippocampus and cortex) of mice, while the network pharmacology analysis was applied to investigate the potential targets of 3TC. The results showed that the mRNA levels of genes related to long interspersed element-1, type 1 interferon response, the senescence-associated secretion phenotype and the Alzheimer's disease in the hippocampus and cortex of SAMP8 mice were increased due to senescence, but this trend was reversed partially by 3TC. Results of histological studies showed that 3TC reduced the death of hippocampal neurons, while the results of network pharmacology analysis indicated that 3TC may exert its influence through multiple pathways, including the oestrogen signalling and the PI3K/Akt and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signalling pathways, which we have verified through in vitro experiments. These findings provide evidence for the therapeutic potential of 3TC in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders show high co-morbidity, including co-morbid expressions of subclinical psychopathology across multiple disease spectra. Given the limitations of classical case-control designs in elucidating this overlap, new approaches are needed to identify biological underpinnings of spectra and their interaction. We assessed autistic-like traits (using the Autism Quotient, AQ) and schizotypy - as models of subclinical expressions of disease phenotypes and examined their association with volumes and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of anterior, mid- and posterior hippocampus segments from structural MRI scans in 318 and arterial spin labelling (ASL) in 346 nonclinical subjects, which overlapped with the structural imaging sample (N = 298). We demonstrate significant interactive effects of positive schizotypy and AQ social skills as well as of positive schizotypy and AQ imagination on hippocampal subfield volume variation. Moreover, we show that AQ attention switching modulated hippocampal head rCBF, while positive schizotypy by AQ attention to detail interactions modulated hippocampal tail rCBF. In addition, we show significant correlation of hippocampal volume and rCBF in both region-of-interest and voxel-wise analyses, which were robust after removal of variance related to schizotypy and autistic traits. These findings provide empirical evidence for both the modulation of hippocampal subfield structure and function through subclinical traits, and in particular how only the interaction of phenotype facets leads to significant reductions or variations in these parameters. This makes a case for considering the synergistic impact of different (subclinical) disease spectra on transdiagnostic biological parameters in psychiatry.

AB  - Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death associated with glutathione depletion and excess lipid peroxidation, can be induced in cultured cells by chemicals (e.g., erastin and RSL3). It has been shown that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a mediator of chemically-induced ferroptosis and also a crucial target for ferroptosis protection. The present study reports that bazedoxifene (BAZ), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is an inhibitor of PDI and can strongly rescue neuronal cells from chemically-induced oxidative ferroptosis. We find that BAZ can directly bind to PDI and inhibit its catalytic activity. Computational modeling analysis reveals that BAZ forms a hydrogen bond with PDI's His256 residue. Inhibition of PDI by BAZ markedly reduces iNOS and nNOS dimerization (i.e., catalytic activation) and NO accumulation, and these effects of BAZ are associated with reductions in cellular ROS and lipid-ROS and protection against chemically-induced ferroptosis. In addition, the direct antioxidant activity of BAZ may also partially contribute to its protection against chemically-induced ferroptosis. In vivo animal experiments show that mice treated with BAZ are strongly protected against kainic acid-induced oxidative hippocampal neuronal injury and memory deficits. Together, these results reveal that BAZ is a potent inhibitor of PDI and can strongly protect against chemically-induced ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons both in vitro and in vivo. This work provides evidence for an estrogen receptor-independent, PDI-mediated novel mechanism of neuroprotection by BAZ.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder with a complex pathophysiology. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a strong risk factor for AD that shares similar abnormal features including metabolic dysregulation and brain pathology such as amyloid and/or Tau deposits. Emerging evidence suggests that circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with T2D. While excess BCAAs are shown to be harmful to neurons, its connection to AD is poorly understood. Here we show that individuals with AD have elevated circulating BCAAs and their metabolites compared to healthy individuals, and that a BCAA metabolite is correlated with the severity of dementia. APP(Swe) mouse model of AD also displayed higher plasma BCAAs compared to controls. In pursuit of understanding a potential causality, BCAA supplementation to HT-22 neurons was found to reduce genes critical for neuronal health while increasing phosphorylated Tau. Moreover, restricting BCAAs from diet delayed cognitive decline and lowered AD-related pathology in the cortex and hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice. BCAA restriction for two months was sufficient to correct glycemic control and increased/restored dopamine that were severely reduced in APP/PS1 controls. Treating 5xFAD mice that show early brain pathology with a BCAA-lowering compound recapitulated the beneficial effects of BCAA restriction on brain pathology and neurotransmitters including norepinephrine and serotonin. Collectively, this study reveals a positive association between circulating BCAAs and AD. Our findings suggest that BCAAs impair neuronal functions whereas BCAA-lowering alleviates AD-related pathology and cognitive decline, thus establishing a potential causal link between BCAAs and AD progression.

AB  - Stroke is the most frequent cause of disability in developed countries. A common phenomenon of stroke, cerebral ischemia, is threatening many lives worldwide. In addition, ozone treatment was previously reported to exert functions in relieving brain injury. In the current study, the therapeutic effects of ozone on cerebral ischemia are investigated. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established. The brain water content was calculated by weighing brain tissues, and the 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was performed to measure brain infarction volume in rats. A colorimetric assay was conducted to examine expression levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione in the rat hippocampus. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase-chain reaction and Western blot analyses were employed to evaluate expression levels of Beclin1, LC3B, p62, and critical factors implicated in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. We found that ozone significantly improved the survival rate of MCAO model rats, reduced the cerebral water content, and decreased the neurological scores of ischemic rats. Ozone markedly reduced cerebral ischemia-induced infarction in ischemic rats. Ozone decreased MDA levels and increased SOD, catalase, and GSH levels in the hippocampus of rats. Ozone significantly inhibited autophagy by decreasing Beclin1 and LC3B expression and increasing p62 expression. The ozone inactivated the NF-kappa B signaling pathway by decreasing the protein levels of TLR4, p-IKK beta, p-IKB alpha, and p-p65. We conclude that ozone treatment alleviates the brain injury in ischemic rats by suppressing autophagy and inactivating the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) is a non-selective blocker of voltage-dependent K+ channels used to improve walking in multiple sclerosis patients, and it may be useful in the treatment of cerebellar diseases. In animal models, 4-AP is used as a convulsant agent. When administered intrahippocampally, 4-AP induces acute local glucose hypermetabolism and significant brain damage, while i.p. administration causes less neuronal damage. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a single i.p. administration of 4-AP on acute brain glucose metabolism as well as on neuronal viability and signs of neuroinflammation 3 days after the insult. Brain glucose metabolism was evaluated by [F-18]FDG PET neuroimaging. [F-18]FDG uptake was analyzed based on volumes of interest (VOIs) as well as by voxel-based (SPM) analyses. The results showed that independently of the type of data analysis used (VOIs or SPM), 4-AP induced acute generalized brain glucose hypometabolism, except in the cerebellum. Furthermore, the SPM analysis normalized by the whole brain uptake revealed a significant cerebellar hypermetabolism. The neurohistochemical assays showed that 4-AP induced hippocampal astrocyte reactivity 3 days after the insult, without inducing changes in neuronal integrity or microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Thus, acute brain glucose metabolic and neuroinflammatory profiles in response to i.p. 4-AP clearly differed from that reported for intrahippocampal administration. Finally, the results suggest that the cerebellum might be more resilient to the 4-AP-induced hypometabolism.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be involved in the initiation and progression of human tumors including cervical cancer (CC). However, the mechanisms underlying of their actions in CC remain to be fully elucidated. Herein, the differentially expressed miRNAs that were screened based on GSE55940 microarray data retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and miR-103a-3p was significantly upregulated in CC tissues which was selected as the target miRNA for further research. We also found that high expression of miR-103a-3p was closely associated with histological grades, FIGO stage and distant metastasis as well as reflected poor overall survival. Moreover, miR-103a-3p inhibition decreased the growth capacity of SiHa and HeLa cells by inducing cell apoptosis. And F-box and WD repeat-domain containing protein 7 (FBXW7), a well-known tumor suppressor in many cancer types, was identified as a direct target of miR-103a-3p. It was further found that FBXW7 was significantly downregulated in CC tissues, and it was inversely correlated with miR-103a-3p expression levels. Further investigation demonstrated that FBXW7 upregulation could simulate the roles of miR-103a-3p knockdown in cell viability and apoptosis. Moreover, FBXW7 knockdown efficiently abrogated the influences of CC cells proliferation caused by miR-103a-3p inhibition. Notably, miR-103a-3p could block FBXW7 mediated the downstream transcription factor pathways. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-103a-3p functions as an oncogene in CC by targeting FBXW7.

AB  - With the ongoing advancement and utilization of rare earth elements, human and environmental exposure to these materials has risen substantially. Samarium oxide (Sm2O3), a rare earth element, has been shown to induce pulmonary fibrosis, but the mechanisms are not clear. This study aimed to investigate the primary mechanisms by which rare earth Sm2O3 contributes to pulmonary fibrosis in relation to the Hippo signaling pathway and to assess the interventional effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE). A mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis was established through intratracheal administration of a Sm2O3 suspension, while human embryonic lung fibroblasts were also treated for intervention studies. The results indicated that compared with the control group, the expression of SAV1, LATS1/2, MST1, YAP1, and TEAD1 genes was significantly up-regulated in the Sm2O3 group, while the expression of TAZ gene was down-regulated. Additionally, the levels of p-LATS1, LATS1, YAP, and p-YAP were elevated, suggesting that Sm2O3 promotes pulmonary fibrosis through an imbalance and abnormal regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Furthermore, human embryonic lung fibroblasts stained with Sm2O3 were treated with different dose gradients of GBE, and the expression level of p-LATS1, LATS1, YAP, and p-YAP was decreased as the dose of Sm2O3 increased, whereas treatment with GBE increased the expression of these proteins. GBE can mitigate the fibrotic response induced by Sm2O3 exposure. These findings demonstrate that Sm2O3 induces pulmonary fibrosis, at least in part, by inactivating the Hippo signaling pathway. Further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the protective mechanisms of GBE and its therapeutic potential in this context.

AB  - As aging progresses, beta-amyloid (A beta) deposition and the resulting oxidative damage are key causes of aging diseases such as senior osteoporosis (SOP). Humulus lupulus L. (hops) is an important medicinal plant widely used in the food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries due to its strong antioxidant ability. In this study, APP/PS1 mutated transgenic mice and A beta-injured osteoblasts were used to evaluate the protective effects of hops extracts (HLE) on SOP. Mice learning and memory levels were assessed by the Morris water maze. Mice femurs were prepared for bone micro-structures and immunohistochemistry experiments. The deposition of A beta in the hippocampus, cortex and femurs were determined by Congo red staining. Moreover, protein expressions related to antioxidant pathways were evaluated by Western blotting. It was found that HLE markedly improved learning abilities and ameliorated memory impairment of APP/PS1 mice, as well as regulated antioxidant enzymes and bone metabolism proteins in mice serum. Micro-CT tests indicated that HLE enhanced BMD and improved micro-architectural parameters of mice femur. More importantly, it was discovered that HLE significantly reduced A beta deposition both in the brain and femur. Further in vitro results showed HLE increased the bone mineralization nodule and reduced the ROS level of A beta-injured osteoblasts. Additionally, HLE increased the expression of antioxidant related proteins Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, FoxO1 and SOD-2. These results indicated that Humulus lupulus L. extract could protect against senior osteoporosis through inhibiting A beta deposition and oxidative stress, which provides a reference for the clinical application of hops in the prevention and treatment of SOP.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a significant clinical issue. Its neuropathogenesis has not been clearly identified and effective interventions for clinical use to reduce POCD have not been established. This study was designed to determine whether environmental enrichment (EE) or cognitive enrichment (CE) reduces POCD and whether sex-determining region Y-box-2 regulated by sirtuin 1, plays a role in the effect. Eighteen-month-old male mice were subjected to right-common-carotid-artery exposure under sevoflurane anesthesia. Some of them stayed in cages with EE or CE after the surgery. Learning and memory of mice were tested by a Barnes maze and fear conditioning, starting 2 weeks after the surgery. Sex-determining region Y-box-2 (Sox2) in the brain was silenced by small hairpin RNA (shRNA). Immunofluorescent staining was used to quantify Sox2-positive cells. Surgery reduced Sox2-positive cells in the hippocampus (64 +/- 9 cells vs. 91 +/- 9 cells in control group, n = 6, p < 0.001) and impaired learning and memory (time to identify target box one day after training sessions in the Barnes maze test: 132 +/- 53 s vs. 79 +/- 53 s in control group, n = 10, p = 0.040). EE or CE applied after surgery attenuated this reduction of Sox2 cells and POCD. Surgery reduced sirtuin 1 activity and CE attenuated this reduction. Resveratrol, a sirtuin 1 activator, attenuated POCD and surgery-induced decrease of Sox2-positive cells. Silencing shRNA reduced the Sox2-positive cells in the hippocampus and impaired learning and memory in mice without surgery. These results suggest a role of Sox2 in learning, memory, and POCD. EE and CE attenuated POCD via maintaining Sox2-positive cells in the hippocampus.

AB  - Prenatal opioid exposures lead to extensive cognitive and emotion-regulation problems in children, persisting at least through school-age. Methadone, an opioid typically used for the treatment of opioid use disorder, has been approved for use in pregnant women for several decades. Importantly, however, the impacts of prenatal methadone exposure (PME), particularly on offspring as they progress into adulthood, has not been extensively examined. In recent years, children and young animal models have shown cognitive deficits related to PME, including evidence of hippocampal dysfunction. The present work aims to examine the persistent nature of these deficits, as well as determine how they may differ by sex. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats either received subcutaneous methadone or water injections twice daily from gestational days 3-20 or were left undisturbed. Following postnatal day 70, male and female offspring were behaviourally tested for impairments in recognition memory using the Novel Object Recognition task and working spatial memory through Spontaneous Alternation. Additionally, using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, hippocampal dentate granule cell function was examined in adult offspring. Results indicate that methadone-exposed females showed decreased excitability and increased inhibition of dentate granule cells compared to naive controls, while males did not. These findings were accompanied by impairments in female working spatial memory and altered behaviour in the Object Recognition task. Overall, this work supports the continued investigation of the long-term effects of PME on adult male and female learning and memory, as well as promotes further exploration of adult hippocampal function as a neural mechanism impacted by this exposure.

AB  - Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients develop ascending aortic (AAo) dilation. The pathogenesis of BAV aortopathy (genetic vs. haemodynamic) remains unclear. This study aims to identify regional changes around the AAo wall in BAV patients with aortopathy, integrating molecular data and clinical imaging. BAV patients with aortopathy (n = 15) were prospectively recruited to surgically collect aortic tissue and measure molecular markers across the AAo circumference. Dilated (anterior/right) vs. non-dilated (posterior/left) circumferential segments were profiled for whole-genomic microRNAs (next-generation RNA sequencing, miRCURY LNA PCR), protein content (tandem mass spectrometry), and elastin fragmentation and degeneration (histomorphometric analysis). Integrated bioinformatic analyses of RNA sequencing and proteomic datasets identified five microRNAs (miR-128-3p, miR-210-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-199b-5p, and miR-21-5p) differentially expressed across the AAo circumference. Among them, three miRNAs (miR-128-3p, miR-150-5p, and miR-199b-5p) were predicted to have an effect on eight common target genes, whose expression was dysregulated, according to proteomic analyses, and involved in the vascular-endothelial growth-factor signalling, Hippo signalling, and arachidonic acid pathways. Decreased elastic fibre levels and elastic layer thickness were observed in the dilated segments. Additionally, in a subset of patients n = 6/15, a four-dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scan was performed. Interestingly, an increase in wall shear stress (WSS) was observed at the anterior/right wall segments, concomitantly with the differentially expressed miRNAs and decreased elastic fibres. This study identified new miRNAs involved in the BAV aortic wall and revealed the concomitant expressional dysregulation of miRNAs, proteins, and elastic fibres on the anterior/right wall in dilated BAV patients, corresponding to regions of elevated WSS.

AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the molecular mechanisms involved in the neurodegeneration are still incompletely defined, though this aspect is crucial for a better understanding of the malady and for devising effective therapies. Mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered Ca2+ signaling have long been implicated in AD, though it is debated whether these events occur early in the course of the pathology, or whether they develop at late stages of the disease and represent consequences of different alterations. Mitochondria are central to many aspects of cellular metabolism providing energy, lipids, reactive oxygen species, signaling molecules for cellular quality control, and actively shaping intracellular Ca2+ signaling, modulating the intensity and duration of the signal itself. Abnormalities in the ability of mitochondria to take up and subsequently release Ca2+ could lead to changes in the metabolism of the organelle, and of the cell as a whole, that eventually result in cell death. We sought to investigate the role of mitochondria and Ca2+ signaling in a model of Familial Alzheimer's disease and found early alterations in mitochondria physiology under stressful condition, namely, reduced maximal respiration, decreased ability to sustain membrane potential, and a slower return to basal matrix Ca2+ levels after a mild excitotoxic stimulus. Treatment with an inhibitor of the permeability transition pore attenuated some of these mitochondrial disfunctions and may represent a promising tool to ameliorate mitochondria and cellular functioning in AD and prevent or slow down cell loss in the disease.

AB  - Rotenone (ROT) is a naturally derived pesticide and a well-known environmental neurotoxin associated with induction of Parkinson's disease (PD). Limonene (LMN), a naturally occurring monoterpene, is found ubiquitously in citrus fruits and peels. There is enormous interest in finding novel therapeutic agents that can cure or halt the progressive degeneration in PD; therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of LMN employing a rodent model of PD measuring parameters of oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, and apoptosis to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. PD in experimental rats was induced by intraperitoneal injection of ROT (2.5 mg/kg) five days a week for a total of 28 days. The rats were treated with LMN (50 mg/kg, orally) along with intraperitoneal injection of ROT (2.5 mg/kg) for the same duration as in ROT-administered rats. ROT injections induced a significant loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and DA striatal fibers following activation of glial cells (astrocytes and microglia). ROT treatment enhanced oxidative stress, altered NF-kappa B/MAPK signaling and motor dysfunction, and enhanced the levels/expressions of inflammatory mediators and proinflammatory cytokines in the brain. There was a concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction followed by the activation of the Hippo signaling and intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as well as altered mTOR signaling in the brain of ROT-injected rats. Oral treatment with LMN corrected the majority of the biochemical, pathological, and molecular parameters altered following ROT injections. Our study findings demonstrate the efficacy of LMN in providing protection against ROT-induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - Impaired ability to generate new cells in the adult brain has been linked to deficits in multiple emotional and cognitive behavioral domains. However, the mechanisms by which abrogation of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) impacts on brain function remains controversial. We used a transgenic rat line, the GFAP-Tk, to selectively eliminate NSCs and assess repercussions on different behavioral domains. To assess the functional importance of newborn cells in specific developmental stages, two parallel experimental timeframes were adopted: a short- and a long-term timeline, 1 and 4 weeks after the abrogation protocol, respectively. We conducted in vivo electrophysiology to assess the effects of cytogenesis abrogation on the functional properties of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and on their intercommunication. Adult brain cytogenesis abrogation promoted a time-specific installation of behavioral deficits. While the lack of newborn immature hippocampal neuronal and glial cells elicited a behavioral phenotype restricted to hyperanxiety and cognitive rigidity, specific abrogation of mature new neuronal and glial cells promoted the long-term manifestation of a more complex behavioral profile encompassing alterations in anxiety and hedonic behaviors, along with deficits in multiple cognitive modalities. More so, abrogation of 4 to 7-week-old cells resulted in impaired electrophysiological synchrony of neural theta oscillations between the dorsal hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex, which are likely to contribute to the described long-term cognitive alterations. Hence, this work provides insight on how newborn neurons and astrocytes display different functional roles throughout different maturation stages, and establishes common ground to reconcile contrasting results that have marked this field.

AB  - To investigate the differences in the ovaries and hepatopancreas of mated and unmated female Portunus trituberculatus during late ovarian development. This study constructed a cDNA library of the P. trituberculatus. The 113,858 sequences were obtained from the cDNA library and the NCBI database, and a total of 109,533 probes were designed for the cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis was performed on ovaries and hepatopancreas of mated and unmated crabs after six months of aquaculture. A total of 2072 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the ovaries, and 1897 DEGs were identified in the hepatopancreas. Enrichment analysis revealed two differential pathways in the ovary, including Hippo signaling pathway and endocytosis, and fourteen differential pathways in the hepatopancreas, including insect hormone biosynthesis and glycolysis. The findings suggest that during late ovarian development, the ovaries focus on efficient energy use, with enhanced foreign substance recognition and a decrease in Vitellogenin (Vn) synthesis/absorption. In the hepatopancreas, there is an emphasis on nerve signal conduction, hormonal regulation, and energy metabolism. The immune and antioxidant capacities of both tissues showed fluctuations. In conclusion, the primary purpose of the P. trituberculatus during this stage is not to promote rapid ovarian development but to regulate energy intake, utilization, and maintain overall physiological stability. This study could provide valuable insights for the optimized breeding of female P. trituberculatus during late ovarian development.

AB  - We previously demonstrated that fatty acid-binding protein 3 null (FABP3(-/-)) mice exhibit resistance to nicotine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Here, we confirm that the FABP3 inhibitor, MF1 ((4-(2-(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)phenoxy) butanoic acid), successfully reduces nicotine-induced CPP scores in mice. MF1 (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) was orally administered 30 min before nicotine, and CPP scores were assessed in the conditioning, withdrawal, and relapse phases. MF1 treatment decreased CPP scores in a dose-dependent manner. Failure of CPP induction by MF1 (1.0 mg/kg, p.o.) was associated with the inhibition of both CaMKII and ERK activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and hippocampal CA1 regions. MF1 treatment reduced nicotine-induced increases in phosphorylated CaMKII and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-positive cells. Importantly, the increase in dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) levels following chronic nicotine exposure was inhibited by MF1 treatment. Moreover, the quinpirole (QNP)-induced increase in the level of CaMKII and ERK phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by MF1 treatment of cultured NAc slices from wild type (WT) mice; however, QNP treatment had no effect on CaMKII and ERK phosphorylation levels in the NAc of D2R null mice. Taken together, these results show that MF1 treatment suppressed D2R/FABP3 signaling, thereby preventing nicotine-induced CPP induction. Hence, MF1 can be used as a novel drug to block addiction to nicotine and other drugs by inhibiting the dopaminergic system.

AB  - This study was aimed at investigating the neuroprotective potential of a co-extract obtained by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of turmeric powder and dried coconut shreds against aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) in male Wistar rats. Fifty animals were allocated to five groups, which received saline (vehicle control, group 1), a combination of saline and aluminium chloride (AlCl3) (disease control, group 2), coconut oil (COO) (SFE extracted, treatment group 3), turmeric oleoresin (Cur) (SFE extracted, treatment group 4) and SFE co-extract of turmeric powder and coconut shreds (CurCOO) (treatment group 5). Animals were subjected to behavioural evaluation. In addition, the hippocampal section of the brain from all groups was subjected to biochemical, molecular and histopathological evaluations. The results showed CurCOO adminis-tered intranasally improved cognitive abilities, reversed histological alterations in the brain, reduced hippo -campus inflammation studied through proinflammatory cytokine markers like TNF-alpha and IL-6 as compared to the disease control group. The impact of CurCOO on preventive neurodegeneration was also observed through a reduction in protein transcription factor NF-kB in the treated group 5 as compared to a disease control group. The effect of intranasal delivery of CurCOO on the neurons responsible for memory consolidation was evident from low acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity in the treated groups with respect to AlCl3 induced group. Summarily, the results demonstrated intranasal delivery of CurCOO to show better efficacy than Cur and COO in preventing neurodegeneration associated with AlCl3 induced Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Background Both IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Hippo pathways are crucial for breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). However, their interplay remains unclear.
   Methods Four triple negative breast cancer cell lines derived from CSC of two patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), AS-B145, AS-B145-1R, AS-B244, and AS-B244-1R, were used to elucidate the role of YAP in BCSCs. YAP silenced BCSCs were analyzed by cell proliferation, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, mammosphere formation, and tumorigenesis. The effects of modulating IGF-1R and IGF-1 on YAP expression and localization were evaluated. The clinical correlation of YAP and IGF-1R signaling with the overall survival (OS) of 7830 breast cancer patients was analyzed by KM plotter.
   Results Knockdown of YAP abates the viability and stemness of BCSCs in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Depletion of IGF-1R by shRNA or specific inhibitor decreases YAP expression. In contrast, IGF-1 addition upregulates YAP and enhances its nuclear localization. YAP overexpression increased the mRNA level of IGF-1, but not IGF-1R. Data mining of clinical breast cancer specimens revealed that basal-like breast cancer patients with higher level of IGF-1 and YAP exhibit significantly shorter OS.
   Conclusions YAP contributes to stemness features of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. The expression and localization of YAP was regulated by IGF-1R and YAP expression in turns upregulates IGF-1, but not IGF-1R. Clinically, higher level of YAP and IGF-1 significantly correlated with shorter OS in basal-like breast cancer. Taken together, these findings suggest the clinical relevance of interplay between YAP and IGF-1/IGF-1R pathway in sustaining the properties of BCSCs. Video Abstract

AB  - To systematically evaluate the effect of simulated long-term spaceflight composite stress (LSCS) in hippocampus and gain more insights into the transcriptomic landscape and molecular mechanism, we performed wholetranscriptome sequencing based on the control group (Ctrl) and the simulated long-term spaceflight composite stress group (LSCS) from six hippocampus of rats. Subsequently, differential expression analysis was performed on the Ctrl and LSCS groups, followed by enrichment analysis and functional interaction prediction analysis to investigate gene-regulatory circuits in LSCS. In addition, competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed to gain insights into genetic interaction. The result showed that 276 differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs), 139 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs), 103 differentially expressed circular RNAs (DEcircRNAs), and 52 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were found in LSCS samples compared with the controls, which were then subjected to enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways to find potential functions. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway may play fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of LSCS. A ceRNA network was constructed with the predicted 340 DE pairs, which revealed the interaction roles of 220 DEmiRNA-DEmRNA pairs, 76 DEmiRNA-DElncRNA pairs, and 44 DEmiRNA-DEcircRNA pairs. Further, Thrombospondins2 was found to be a key target among those ceRNAs. Overall, we conducted for the first time a full transcriptomic analysis of the response of hippocampus to the LSCS that involved a potential ceRNA network, thus providing a basis to study the underlying mechanism of the LSCS.

AB  - Bauhinia ungulata is an antioxidant medicinal plant that has been manipuled in Brazil to lower glycemic index as well is for alternative treatment for diabetes. Therefore, the present hearch has aimed to investigates the antioxidant effects of the essential oil of Bauhinia ungulata L. (EOBU) collected in Amazon region better specified in Boa Vista, Roraima, Brazil, located in the Amazon region. Gas chromatography had been used to characterize the components, and antioxidant assays such as DPPH, TAC, reducing power, Fe2+ chelation, and total phenols had also been performed. The major constituents had molecularly anchored with the human catalase (CAT) enzyme, and maltol has showed as a positive control. Among the 25 revealed components, the main ones have been alpha-bisabolol (27.2 %), beta-Caryophyllene (12.5 %) and Epi-gamma-eudesmol (13.6 %). The EOBU has comproved a TAC value of 618.79 mg of ascorbic acid equivalent, free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) around 53.7 % and 65.27 %, Fe2+ chelation capacity of 161 +/- 6 and 126.7 +/- 39.6, for 0.1 mg.mL(-1) and 0.5 mg.mL(-1) , respectively. The power around the EOBU has appeared percentages equals to 28.66 %, 44.6 %, and 77.03 % in the concentrations tested. As well as, 96.5 % of total phenols. The compounds alpha-bisabolol (-5.7 +/- 0.4 Kcal.mol(-1) ) and beta-caryophyllene (-6.1 +/- 0.5 Kcal.mol(-1) ) have showed good interaction with CAT compared to Maltol (-4.4 +/- 0.4 Kcal.mol(-1) ). The present work has demonstrated that EOBU functions as a potent antioxidant, capable of scavenging free radicals and reducing oxidative stress damage.

AB  - Fatigue is accompanied by a decrease in physical activity or malaise, and might be reduced by acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) administration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the preventive effects of ALC on Poly I:C-induced sickness behavior in mice. For the experiment, male C3H/HeN mice were used and treated with ALC for 5 days before Poly I:C administration. ALC administration attenuated the decrease in wheel behavior activity of mice at 24 h after Poly I:C administration and ALC-treated mice quickly recovered from the sickness behavior. The gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cerebrum and hippocampus, which is associated with physical activity, was higher in the ALC-treated group. Translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO), which has cytoprotective effects, was up-regulated in the cerebrum and hippocampus, suggesting that ALC suppressed the decrease in activity induced by Poly I:C treatment through enhancement of cytoprotective effects in the brain.

AB  - In order to improve the controllability of spontaneous hypertension, it was necessary to study a new nanobody that can inhibit calcium flow and reduce hypertension by considering the specificity and long half-life of antibody. Firstly, the antibody epitope screening technology was adopted to select a short peptide (CN8) in the E3 region of the first domain of Ca(v)1.2 alpha(1c) subunit, the full-length complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cDNA) clone of which was undertaken as a template. The gene fragment in extracellular region of CN8 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the pET30a-CN8 recombinant plasmid was constructed. Ribose nucleic acids (RNAs) in peripheral lymphocytes of 5 camels were extracted, and the reverse transcribed cDNA was taken as a template to realize the amplification of VHH gene fragment. After the double enzyme digestion, the pMECS vector was connected and TG1 was transformed to form a natural VHH antibody library. The phage display library was screened by CN8 protein to obtain the new nanobody (VHH-CN8). Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to analyze the specific binding of antibody, and the calcium flux test was adopted to test the effect of antibody on calcium channels. A rat model of spontaneous hypertension and a mice model of spontaneous hypertension induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) were constructed to verify the antihypertensive effect of the prepared nanobody materials. In vitro, the VHH-CN8 antibody could realize specific binding to the Ca(v)1.2 channel, inhibit the transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, and prevent the increase in intracellular calcium concentration of arterial smooth muscle by adjusting the concentration and potential; in vivo, the VHH-CN8 antibody could reduce the blood pressure level of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and mice in Ang II model, which was 196 +/- 3/186 +/- 4 mmHg (P < 0.05) and 187 +/- 5/158 +/- 3 mmHg (P < 0.01), respectively. Thus, it proved that the prepared nanobody could reduce the blood pressure level of spontaneous hypertension.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is accompanied by some psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression. Sesamol has been reported to alleviate colitis symptoms and depression-like behaviors caused by chronic unpredictable mild stress, but its protective effect and underlying neurobiological mechanism on IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) accompanying depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors remains still unclear. Here, we found that a six-week sesamol treatment (100 mg per kg bodyweight per day) for DSS-induced mice predominantly prevented inflammatory response, epithelial barrier dysfunction and depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors via the gut-brain axis. Sesamol alleviated neuroinflammatory responses via suppressing the TLR-4/NF-kappa B pathway, protected against oxidative stress and upregulated the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway. Moreover, sesamol treatment improved brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by upregulating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway, restored synaptic impairments and enhanced norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) levels. Importantly, the correlation analysis showed that the gut barrier and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content in the serum were highly associated with behavioral performance and the biochemical indexes of the brain. In summary, the present study indicates that sesamol is a novel nutritional intervention strategy for preventing IBD and its symptoms of anxiety and depression.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effects of 8 weeks of an administration of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus plantarum combined with exercise training on neurotoxicity of A beta, spatial learning, acetylcholine (ACH), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in Alzheimer rats. Twenty-five Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 5 in each): (1) healthy control (control), (2) Alzheimer disease (AD), (3) AD with treadmill exercise (AD + Exe), (4) AD with probiotic (combined administration of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus plantarum) treatment (AD + Pro), and (5) AD with treadmill exercise and probiotic treatment (AD + Exe + Pro). AD was induced by intra-cerebroventricular injection of A beta 1-42 peptide. Then, the training groups exercised on treadmill for 8 weeks, 5 days per weeks. The rats were treated daily with probiotic supplements via gavage for 8 weeks. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was administered to measure spatial learning. Then, the animals were sacrificed and Vegf and ACH were analyzed using the qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods, respectively. Results showed that the beta-amyloid plaques were significantly increased in the brains of the AD group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). The combined use of probiotics and exercise training significantly increased the time spent in the target quadrant after removing the platform, compared with the AD group in the Morris water maze test (p < 0.001). Crystal violet analysis showed that sole (p < 0.01) and combined exercise training and probiotic supplementation (p < 0.001) significantly reduced the number of dead cells in the brains of rats compared with the AD group. AD significantly decreased Vegf mRNA and ACH in the CA1 area of the hippocampus (p < 0.001). However, mono and combined therapy (exercise and probiotics) significantly increased ACH in the rats' brain compared with the AD group. Overall, 8 weeks of an administration of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus plantarum combined with exercise training can improve spatial learning impairment in the AD rats. Exercise and probiotics seem to offer potential benefits to AD patients by upregulating ACH.

AB  - Alcoholism is a worldwide public health problem with high economic cost and which affects health and social behavior. It is estimated that alcoholism kills 3 million people globally, while in Chile it is responsible for around 9 thousand deaths per year. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels expressed in the central nervous system, and they were suggested to modulate the ethanol mechanism involved in abuse and dependence. Previous work demonstrated a short-term treatment with UFR2709, a nAChRs antagonist, which reduced ethanol intake using a two-bottle free-choice paradigm in University of Chile bibulous (UChB) rats. Here, we present evidence of the UFR2709 efficacy in reducing the acquisition and long-term ethanol consumption. Our results show that UFR2709 (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) reduces the seek behavior and ethanol intake, even when the drug administration was stopped, and induced a reduction in the overall ethanol intake by around 55%. Using naive UChB bibulous rats, we demonstrate that UFR2709 could delay and reduce the genetically adaptive impulse to seek and drink ethanol and prevent its excessive intake.

AB  - High-frequency rTMS has been widely used to improve working memory (WM) impairment; however, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are unclear. We evaluated the effect of high-frequency rTMS on behaviors relevant to WM as well as coupling between theta and gamma oscillations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats. Accordingly, Wistar rats received high-frequency rTMS daily for 14 days (5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 15 Hz stimulation; 600 pulses; n = 6 per group), whereas the control group received sham stimulation. Electrophysiological signals were recorded simultaneously to obtain the local field potential (LFP) from the PFC, while the rats performed T-maze tasks for the evaluation of WM. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was utilized to determine the effect of high-frequency rTMS on the theta-gamma coupling of LFPs. We observed that rats in the rTMS groups needed a smaller number of training days to complete the WM task as compared to the control group. High-frequency rTMS reinforced the coupling connection strength in the PFC of rats. Notably, the effect of rTMS at 15 Hz was the most effective among the three frequencies, i.e., 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 15 Hz. The results suggested that rTMS can improve WM impairment in rats by modulating the coupling of theta and gamma rhythms. Hence, the current study provides a scientific basis for the optimization of TMS models, which would be relevant for clinical application.

AB  - Sleep is critical for memory consolidation, although the exact mechanisms mediating this process are unknown. Combining reduced network models and analysis of in vivo recordings, we tested the hypothesis that neuromodulatory changes in acetylcholine (ACh) levels during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep mediate stabilization of network-wide firing patterns, with temporal order of neurons' firing dependent on their mean firing rate during wake. In both reduced models and in vivo recordings from mouse hippocampus, we find that the relative order of firing among neurons during NREM sleep reflects their relative firing rates during prior wake. Our modeling results show that this remapping of wake-associated, firing frequency-based representations is based on NREM-associated changes in neuronal excitability mediated by ACh-gated potassium current. We also show that learning-dependent reordering of sequential firing during NREM sleep, together with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), reconfigures neuronal firing rates across the network. This rescaling of firing rates has been reported in multiple brain circuits across periods of sleep. Our model and experimental data both suggest that this effect is amplified in neural circuits following learning. Together our data suggest that sleep may bias neural networks from firing rate-based towards phase-based information encoding to consolidate memories.

AB  - MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a common recreational drug of abuse which causes neurodegeneration. Nicotine and modafinil provide antioxidant and neuroprotective properties and may be beneficial in the management of MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to characterize how acute and chronic administration of nicotine and/or modafinil exert protective effects against the MDMA-induced impaired cognitive performance, oxidative stress, and neuronal loss. Adult male rats were divided into three groups, namely control, MDMA and treatment (modafinil and/or nicotine). MDMA (10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally during a three-week schedule (two times/day for two consecutive days/week). The treatedgroups were classified based on the acute or chronic status of treatment. In the groups which underwent acute treatments, nicotine (0.5 mg/kg) and/or modafinil (100 mg/kg) were injected just prior to the MDMA administration (acute nicotine (NA), acute modafinil (MA), and acute nicotine and modafinil (NMA)). In the rats which received chronic treatments, nicotine (0.5 mg/kg) and/or modafinil (100 mg/kg) were injected every day during the three week-schedule administration of MDMA (chronic nicotine (NC), chronic modafinil (MC), and chronic nicotine and modafinil (NMC)). Learning and memory performance, as well as avoidance response, were assessed by Morris water maze and Shuttle box, respectively. Our findings indicate enhanced learning and memory and avoidance response in the NMC group. By TUNEL test and Cresyl Violet staining we evaluated neuronal loss and apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 and found increased neuronal viability in the NMC group. On the other hand, chronic administration of modafinil and nicotine significantly down-regulated the caspase 3 and up-regulated both BDNF and TrkB levels in the MDMA-received rats. The serum levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were evaluated and we found that the alterations of serum levels of GPx and TAC were considerably prevented in the NMC group. The overall results indicate that nicotine and modafinil co-administration rescued brain from MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. We suggest that nicotine and modafinil combination therapy could be considered as a possible treatment to reduce the neurological disorders induced by MDMA.

AB  - The choice of plant species is crucial, as different plants provide unique biomolecules that influence nanoparticle characteristics. Biomolecules in plant extracts, such as proteins, amino acids, enzymes, polysaccharides, alkaloids, tannins, phenolics, saponins, terpenoids, and vitamins, act as stabilizing and reducing agents. This study explores the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using leaf extracts from collard greens (Brassica oleracea var. acephala), hazelnut (Corylus avellana var. avellana), and green tea (Camellia sinensis). NPs were synthesized using silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution at two different molarities (1 mM and 5 mM) and characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, and FTIR. The Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) peaks appeared rapidly for hazelnut and green tea extracts, within 30 and 15 min, respectively, while collard greens extract failed to produce a distinct SPR peak. X-Ray Diffraction confirmed the formation of face-centered cubic silver. TEM analysis revealed high polydispersity and agglomeration in all samples, with particle size generally decreasing at higher AgNO3 concentrations. However, hazelnut extract showed a slight increase in size at higher molarity. Among all samples, green tea-derived AgNPs synthesized with 5 mM AgNO3 were the smallest and least polydisperse, highlighting the significant role of plant type in optimizing nanoparticle synthesis.

AB  - Traditional monoclonal antibodies such as Trastuzumab encounter limitations when treating Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, particularly in cases that develop resistance. This study introduces plant-derived anti-HER2 variable fragments of camelid heavy chain domain (VHH) fragment crystallizable region (Fc) KEDL(K) antibody as a potent alternative for overcoming these limitations. A variety of biophysical techniques, in vitro assays, and in vivo experiments uncover the antibody's nanoscale binding dynamics with transmembrane HER2 on living cells. Single-molecule force spectroscopy reveals the rapid formation of two robust bonds, exhibiting approximately 50 pN force resistance and bond lifetimes in the second range. The antibody demonstrates a specific affinity for HER2-positive breast cancer cells, including those that are Trastuzumab-resistant. Moreover, in immune-deficient mice, the plant-derived anti-HER2 VHH-FcK antibody exhibits superior antitumor activity, especially against tumors that are resistant to Trastuzumab. These findings underscore the plant-derived antibody's potential as an impactful immunotherapeutic strategy for treating Trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by repetitive behaviors and impairments of sociability and communication. About 1% of ASD cases are caused by mutations of SHANK3, a major scaffolding protein of the postsynaptic density. We studied the role of SHANK3 in plastic changes of excitatory synapses within the central nervous system by employing mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in WT and Shank3 knockout mice. In WT mice, mTBI triggered ipsi- and contralateral loss of hippocampal dendritic spines and excitatory synapses with a partial recovery over time. In contrast, no significant synaptic alterations were detected in Shank3 increment 11-/- mice, which showed fewer dendritic spines and excitatory synapses at baseline. In line, mTBI induced the upregulation of synaptic plasticity-related proteins Arc and p-cofilin only in WT mice. Interestingly, microglia proliferation was observed in WT mice after mTBI but not in Shank3 increment 11-/- mice. Finally, we detected TBI-induced increased fear memory at the behavioral level, whereas in Shank3 increment 11-/- animals, the already-enhanced fear memory levels increased only slightly after mTBI. Our data show the lack of structural synaptic plasticity in Shank3 knockout mice that might explain at least in part the rigidity of behaviors, problems in adjusting to new situations and cognitive deficits seen in ASDs.

AB  - The current study was undertaken to unveil the protective effects of Luteolin, a natural flavonoid, against amyloid-beta (A beta(1)-(42))-induced neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, and synaptic dysfunction in mice. For the development of an AD mouse model, amyloid-beta (A beta(1)-(42), 5 mu L/5 min/mouse) oligomers were injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) into mice's brain by using a stereotaxic frame. After that, the mice were treated with Luteolin for two weeks at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day. To monitor the biochemical changes, we conducted western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. According to our findings, the infusion of amyloid-beta activated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (p-JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ionized calcium adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) in the cortex and hippocampus of the experimental mice; these changes were significantly inhibited in A beta(1)-(42) + Luteolin-treated mice. Likewise, we also checked the expression of inflammatory markers, such as p-nuclear factor-kB p65 (p-NF-kB p65 (Ser536), tissue necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and Interleukin1-beta (IL-1 beta), in A beta(1)-(42)-injected mice brain, which was attenuated in A beta(1)-(42) + Luteolin-treated mice brains. Further, we investigated the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic cell death markers such as Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and Cox-2, which was significantly reduced in A beta(1)-(42) + Lut-treated mice brains compared to the brains of the A beta-injected group. The results also indicated that with the administration of A beta(1)-(42), the expression levels of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE-1) and amyloid-beta (A beta(1)-(42)) were significantly enhanced, while they were reduced in A beta(1)-(42) + Luteolin-treated mice. We also checked the expression of synaptic markers such as PSD-95 and SNAP-25, which was significantly enhanced in A beta(1)-(42) + Lut-treated mice. To unveil the underlying factors responsible for the protective effects of Luteolin against AD, we used a specific JNK inhibitor, which suggested that Luteolin reduced A beta-associated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration via inhibition of JNK. Collectively, our results indicate that Luteolin could serve as a novel therapeutic agent against AD-like pathological changes in mice.

AB  - The therapeutic potential of treatmentsfor post-strokecognitiveimpairment (PSCI) is severely limited by the autonomic regenerationcapacity of the adult brain. Nattokinase (NK), a serine protease fromthe traditional food natto, has many beneficial effects on the cardiovascularsystem by modulating the blood system. While the role of blood factorsin neurogenesis and cognition is well-established, it remains unclearwhether NK can serve as an anti-PSCI agent through these factors.Our study demonstrates that NK protects against acute ischemic strokeand impressively promotes neurogenesis in rat models by increasingperipheral blood irisin, leading to improved cognitive functions.Our findings demonstrate NK to be a promising candidate for treatingPSCI, and we also highlight irisin as a novel target of NK, suggestingits potential role in the peripheral blood-to-brain axis.

AB  - In recent years, the potential neurotoxicity of inhaled anesthetics on the developing brain has increasingly garnered attention, yet its mechanism remains unclear. Parthanatos is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death dependent on PARP-1, and it is believed to be closely associated with cellular oxidative stress response. However, it is still to be proven whether isoflurane, a commonly used clinical anesthetic, can induce parthanatos in developing brain neurons and whether it activates the oxidative stress signaling pathway in neuronal cells. In this study, we treated SH-SY5Y cells and rat hippocampus neuron cells (RN-h) with isoflurane, measured cell viability using the MTT assay, examined the activation of the parthanatos-related PARP-1/AIF/PAR signaling pathway using western blot analysis, detected the accumulation of ROS using DCFH-DA, detected mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) by a JC-1 assay, and assessed the activation of the oxidative stress-related JNK signaling pathway using western blot. In vivo, we examined the damaging effects of inhaled isoflurane on neonatal rat hippocampal neurons using HE staining. The results showed that 2% and 4% concentrations of isoflurane significantly inhibited cell survival and upregulated the expression levels of PARP-1, AIF, and PAR in both types of neuronal cells. Moreover, isoflurane significantly enhanced ROS levels and decreased Delta psi m, and activated the JNK signaling pathway in both cell types. Importantly, we found that pretreatment with N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) could inhibit isoflurane-induced parthanatos and the accumulation of ROS in cells, as well as the activation of the JNK pathway. The experimental results in neonatal rats also demonstrated that isoflurane led to significant neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region. However, pretreatment with NAC significantly increased the survival rate of pyramidal neurons in this region. In summary, through our experiments, we confirmed that isoflurane can induce parthanatos in neuronal cells, and NAC can decrease ROS accumulation in neuronal cells and thus mitigate the damage isoflurane causes to neuronal cells.

AB  - The nascent field of computationally aided molecular design will be built around theability to make computation useful to synthetic chemists who draw on their empirically basedchemical intuition to synthesize new and useful molecules. This fact poses a dilemma, as muchof existing chemical intuition is framed in the language of chemical bonds, which are picturedas possessing physical properties. Unfortunately, it has been posited that calculating these bondproperties is impossible because chemical bonds do not exist. For much of the computationalchemistrycommunity, bonds are seen as mythical-the unicorns of the chemical world. Here, weshow that this is not the case. Using the same formalism and concepts that illuminated the atoms inmolecules, we shine light on the bonds that connect them. The real space analogue of the chemicalbond becomes the bond bundle in an extended quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM).We show that bond bundles possess all the properties typically associated with chemical bonds,including an energy and electron count. In addition, bond bundles are characterized by a number ofnontraditional attributes, including, significantly, a boundary. We show, with examples drawn fromsolid state and molecular chemistry, that the calculated properties of bond bundles are consistentwith those that nourish chemical intuition. We go further, however, and show that bond bundlesprovide new and quantifiable insights into the structure and properties of molecules and materials.

AB  - PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)-mediated mitophagy and caspase-1/gasdermin D canonical pyroptosis pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). However, gasdermin E (GSDME), another recently identified executioner of pyroptosis that can be specifically cleaved by caspase-3, is highly expressed in the brain and neurons. This study aimed to ascertain whether PINK1-dependent mitophagy governs postoperative cognitive capacity through caspase-3/GSDME. Twelve month old male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed SH-SY5Y cells were used to mimic postsurgical neuroinflammation. For the interventional study, rats were administered with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated silencing of Pink1 and/or caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Ac-DC). SH-SY5Y cells were treated with siPINK1 and/or Ac-DC. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Morris water maze test. The mitophagy-and pyroptosis-related parameters were determined in the hippocampus and SH-SY5Y cells. Anesthesia/surgery and LPS caused defective PINK1-mediated mitophagy and activation of caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis. AAV-9 mediated Pink1 overexpression mitigated cognitive impairment and caspase-3/ GSDME-dependent pyroptosis. Conversely, inhibition of PINK1 aggravates POCD and overactivates neuronal pyroptosis. These abnormalities were rescued by Ac-DC treatment. Collectively, PINK1-mediated mitophagy regulates anesthesia and surgery-induced cognitive impairment by negatively affecting the caspase-3/GSDME pyroptosis pathway, which provides a promising therapeutic target for POCD.

Defective synapse formation or refinement underlie cognitive and emotional abnormalities in various neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including schizophrenia (Sz) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Serine racemase (SR) is a neuronal enzyme that produces D-serine, a co-agonist required for full NMDAR activation. NMDAR hypofunction as a result of genetic SR elimination and reduced synaptic availability of D-serine reduces neuronal dendritic arborization and spine density. In adult mouse brain, the expression of SR parallels that of NMDARs across forebrain regions including the striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, there have yet to be studies providing a detailed characterization of the spatial and temporal expression of SR during early periods of synaptogenesis. Here, we examined the postnatal expression of SR in cortical and subcortical brain regions important for learning, memory and emotional regulation, during the first four weeks after birth. Using dual-antigen immunofluorescence, we demonstrate that the number of SR+ neurons steadily increases with postnatal age across the mPFC, amygdala, hippocampus and striatum. We also identified differences in the rate of SR protein induction both across and within brain regions. Analyzing existing human post-mortem brain in situ data, there was a similar developmental mRNA expression profile of SRR and GRIN1 (GluN1 subunit) from infancy through the first decade of life. Our findings further support a developmental role for D-serine mediated NMDAR activation regulating synaptogenesis and neural circuit refinement, which has important implications for the pathophysiology of Sz and other NDDs.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common complication of surgery and anesthesia, especially among older patients. Microglial activation plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of PND and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-& beta;1) can regulate microglial homeostasis. In the present study, abdominal surgery was performed on 12-14 months-old C57BL/6 mice to establish a PND model. The expression of TGF-& beta;1, TGF-& beta; receptor 1, TGF-& beta; receptor 2, and phosphor-smad2/smad3 (psmad2/smad3) was assessed after anesthesia and surgery. Additionally, we examined changes in microglial activation, morphology, and polarization, as well as neuroinflammation and dendritic spine density in the hippocampus. Behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze and open field tests, were used to examine cognitive function, exploratory locomotion, and emotions. We observed decreased TGF-& beta;1 expression after surgery and anesthesia. Intranasally administered exogenous TGF-& beta;1 increased psmad2/smad3 colocalization with microglia positive for ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1. TGF-& beta;1 treatment attenuated microglial activation, reduced microglial phagocytosis, and reduced surgery- and anesthesia-induced changes in microglial morphology. Compared with the surgery group, TGF-& beta;1 treatment decreased M1 microglial polarization and increased M2 microglial polarization. Additionally, surgery- and anesthesia-induced increase in interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels was ameliorated by TGF-& beta;1 treatment at postoperative day 3. TGF-& beta;1 also ameliorated cognitive function after surgery and anesthesia as well as rescue dendritic spine loss. In conclusion, surgery and anesthesia induced decrease in TGF-& beta;1 levels in older mice, which may contribute to PND development; however, TGF-& beta;1 ameliorated microglial activation and cognitive dysfunction in PND mice.

AB  - As the relationship among diet, brain aging and memory is complex, it provides ample opportunity for research in multiple directions including behaviour, epigenetics and neuroplasticity. Nutritional deficiencies together with genetic and environmental factors are the major cause of many age-associated pathologies including memory loss. A compromised vitamin B12-folate status in older people is highly prevalent worldwide. Researchers have established a close association between the adequate level of B12-folate and the maintenance of cognitive brain functions. One of the main reasons for age-associated memory loss is downregulation of neuronal immediate early genes (nIEGs). Therefore, we hypothesize here that vitamin B12-folic acid supplementation in old mice can improve memory by altering the expression status of nIEGs. To check this, 72-week-old male Swiss albino mice were orally administered with 2 mu g of vitamin B12 and 22 mu g of folic acid/mouse/day for eight weeks. Such supplementation improved recognition memory in old and altered the expression of nIEGs. The expression of nIEGs was further found to be regulated by changes in DNA methylation at their promoter regions and CREB phosphorylation (pCREB). In addition, Golgi-Cox staining showed significant improvement in dendritic length, number of branching points and spine density of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by B12-folic acid supplementation. Taken together, these findings suggest that vitamin B12-folic acid supplementation regulates nIEGs expression and improves dendritic arborization of hippocampal neurons and memory in old male mice.

AB  - To better comprehend the relationship between left/right (L/R) differences and hippocampus functions is necessary knowledge of lateral asymmetry and regional distribution. This research was design to examine hippocampal L/R asymmetry and regional distribution profile of the alpha7 and alpha4 subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the adult rat. 10-12-week-old twenty-four male wistar rats were randomly selected. After removing the brains, immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, and western blot methods were applied to distinguish the presence of the receptors in the hippocampus. Outcomes stated that the mentioned receptors expression profile was spatialdependent. As, the hippocampal dispersal of alpha7 and alpha4 subtypes in the left hippocampus (LH) was remarkably maximum compare with the right hippocampus (RH) (p = 0.001, p = 0.005 respectively). Furthermore, the alpha7 optical density (OD) was not significantly different in the diverse regions in hippocampus of adult rat (p = 0.057), while the maximum OD of the alpha4 was detected in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA3 regions of LH (p = 0.007, p = 0.009 respectively) and the minimum OD was in the CA1 of the RH (p = 0.019). In real time PCR evaluation, there is a significantly higher expression of alpha7 and alpha4 in LH compared to RH (p = 0.043, p = 0.049 respectively), also, for western blot (p = 0.042, p = 0.030 respectively). According to present data, the alpha7 and alpha4 nAChR subtypes expression profile demonstrated lateral asymmetry, the uniform regional dispersal for alpha7 and different regional dispersal for alpha4 in the adult rat hippocampus.

AB  - As a well-known traditional Chinese medicine and functional food, Schisandra chinensis (S. chinensis) has been proved to possess excellent neuroprotective effects, and particularly the role of the polysaccharide fraction in neuroprotection has been increasingly emphasized. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects and potential mechanism of action of the homogeneous polysaccharide SCP2, isolated and purified from S. chinensis polysaccharide (SCP), on Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats based on a holistic metabolomics approach in serum and urine. The results of the pharmacodynamics study showed that SCP2 significantly improved A beta(25-35)-induced cognitive dysfunction, improved oxidative damage and reduced A beta deposition in the hippocampus. The holistic metabolomics results of serum and urine showed that the intervention with SCP2 significantly reversed the metabolic profile disorder in AD rats. A total of 40 metabolites (21 serum metabolites and 19 urine metabolites) were identified, which were mainly involved in linoleic acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism. The results obtained in this study will provide new insights into the mechanisms of SCP2 in the treatment of AD and provide a basis for the subsequent structure-activity studies of SCP2.

AB  - Kidney cysts: Formation of signaling antennae The roles of two regulatory proteins in the kidneys have been further clarified and provide insights into cilia defects and cyst formation. Cilia are organelles that act as 'antennae' for cell signaling in many tissues. Recent studies have highlighted two proteins involved in kidney cilia formation, YAP and TAZ, but little is known about their roles. Jong Hoon Park and co-workers at Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul, South Korea, examined the role of TAZ in the regulation of kidney tubule cilia in mice. They explored the effects of silencing TAZ or YAP expression in different types of kidney tubule cells. TAZ deficiency but not YAP deficiency prevented correct cilia formation in the glomeruli, blood vessels that filter waste in the kidneys, and the resulting defects led to mild cyst generation.
   Renal primary cilia are antenna-like organelles that maintain cellular homeostasis via multiple receptors clustered along their membranes. Recent studies have revealed that YAP/TAZ, key paralogous effectors of the Hippo pathway, are involved in ciliogenesis; however, their independent roles need to be further investigated. Here, we analyzed the renal phenotypes of kidney-specific TAZ knockout mice and observed ciliary defects only in glomeruli where mild cysts were formed. This finding prompted us to verify the role of TAZ specifically in renal tubule ciliary regulation. Therefore, we investigated the effects of TAZ silencing and compared them to those of YAP knockdown using three different types of renal tubular cells. We found that the absence of TAZ prevented proper cilia formation in glomerular cells, whereas it had a negligible effect in collecting duct and proximal tubule cells. IFT and NPHP protein levels were altered because of TAZ deficiency, accompanied by ciliary defects in glomerular cells, and ciliary recovery was identified by regulating some NPHP proteins. Although our study focused on TAZ, ciliogenesis, and other ciliary genes, the results suggest the very distinct roles of YAP and TAZ in kidneys, specifically in terms of ciliary regulation.

AB  - Depression is a global health problem, and there is a pressing need for a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Semaphorin 3B (Sema 3B) is an important axon guidance molecule that is primarily expressed in neurons and contributes to synaptic plasticity. Our previous studies using a high-throughput microarray assay suggested that Sema 3B expression was tremendously decreased during the development of depression, but the specific role and mechanisms of Sema 3B in depression are still unknown. Herein, we report that levels of Sema 3B protein are decreased in the hippocampus and serum of chronic mild stress (CMS)-treated mice. Increasing the levels of Sema 3B, either by injecting AAV-Sema 3B into the hippocampus or by injecting recombinant Sema 3B protein into the lateral ventricles, alleviated CMS-induced depression-like behaviours and enhanced the resistance to acute stress by increasing dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons. In contrast, interfering with the function of Sema 3B by injecting anti-Sema 3B antibody into the lateral ventricles decreased the resistance to acute stress. In vitro, corticosterone (CORT) treatment decreased the survival rate and protein levels of Sema 3B and synapse-associated proteins in HT22 cells. Overexpression of Sema 3B improved the decreased survival rate caused by CORT by inhibiting apoptosis and increasing levels of synaptic-associated proteins, and knockdown of Sema 3B reduces the cellular resistance to CORT and the levels of synapse-associated proteins. These findings represent the first evidence for the neuroprotective mechanism of Sema 3B against stresses, suggesting that Sema 3B could be a promising novel target for the prevention and treatment of depression.

AB  - The calcium dysregulation hypothesis of brain aging posits that an age-related increase in neuronal calcium concentration is responsible for alterations in a variety of cellular processes that ultimately result in learning and memory deficits in aged individuals. We previously generated a novel transgenic mouse line, in which expression of the L-type voltage-gated calcium, Ca(V)1.3, is increased by similar to 50% over wild-type littermates. Here, we show that, in young mice, this increase is sufficient to drive changes in neuronal physiology and cognitive function similar to those observed in aged animals. Specifically, there is an increase in the magnitude of the postburst afterhyperpolarization, a deficit in spatial learning and memory (assessed by the Morris water maze), a deficit in recognition memory (assessed in novel object recognition), and an overgeneralization of fear to novel contexts (assessed by contextual fear conditioning). While overexpression of Ca(V)1.3 recapitulated these key aspects of brain aging, it did not produce alterations in action potential firing rates, basal synaptic communication, or spine number/density. Taken together, these results suggest that increased expression of Ca(V)1.3 in the aged brain is a crucial factor that acts in concert with age-related changes in other processes to produce the full complement of structural, functional, and behavioral outcomes that are characteristic of aged animals.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurobehavioral disorder, which affects more the 50 million individuals worldwide. It is characterized by neuron hyperexcitability mediated by repetitive convulsions. The current inves-tigation was planned to study the therapeutic properties of the xanthohumol against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions in mice by regulating inflammation and oxidative stress. Methods: The 70 mg/kg of PTZ was administered (i.p.) to the mice for stimulating the epileptic seizures and 20 mg/kg of xanthohumol was pre-treated by oral route before the 30 min of PTZ administration. The mice were observed closely for 30 min after the PTZ treatment to detect the onset and duration of clonic/tonic convulsions and mortality. The status of glutamate, GABA, dopamine, Na(+)K(+)ATPase, and Ca+ATPase were quantified using respective kits. The level of MDA, NO, GSH, and SOD were detected using standard methods. The levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as COX-2, TNF-?, NF-?B, TLR-4, and IL-1(3 in the brain tissues were inspected using kits. The histopatho-logical analysis was done on the brain tissues. Results: The xanthohumol significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the onset and duration of convulsions, mortality, and behavioral chnges in the epileptic mice. The levels of COX-2, IP: 203.8.109.20 On: Thu, 11 May 2023 08:15:42 TNF-?, NF-?B, TLR-4, and IL-1(3 were significantly (p < 0?05) decreased in the epileptic mice by 20 mg/kg Copyright: American Scientific Publishers xanthohumol treatment. The levels of MDA and NO was reduced and GSH and SOD were increased by the Delivered by Ingenta 20 mg/kg xanthohumol treatment. The 20 mg/kg xanthohumol significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the glutamate and improved the dopamine, GABA, Na(+)K(+)ATPase, and Ca(+)ATPase in the epileptic mice. The findings of histopathological studies revealed that 20 mg/kg xanthohumol decreased the inflammatory signs and pyknosis in the brain tissues. Conclusion: Pre-treatment with the 20 mg/kg xanthohumol ameliorates the PTZ-triggered seizures in a mice model through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials. Hence, xanthohumol can be a promising antiepileptic candidate in the future to treat epilepsy.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor driven by glioma stem cells (GSCs), which contribute to tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. This study investigates the effects of Gsk3 beta inhibition on GSC viability, focusing on the role of the canonical WNT signaling pathway. We found that Gsk3 beta inhibition activates the WNT pathway, leading to upregulation of Wwc1, which downregulates Yap via Lats1 phosphorylation. This reduces GSC proliferation, self-renewal, and enhances chemosensitivity. Analysis of clinical datasets revealed that WNT pathway activation correlates with improved prognosis in proneural gliomas, particularly in IDH1-mutated tumors. Our findings suggest that targeting the WNT-WWC1-YAP axis, particularly through Gsk3 beta inhibition, could induce synthetic lethality in GSCs and provide a promising therapeutic strategy for gliomas. These results highlight the potential of exploiting WNT-induced synthetic lethality as a novel approach for glioma treatment.

AB  - Background: A dietary supplement containing Pelargonium sidoides extract, propolis, zinc, and honey has been recently developed and proven to be an effective adjuvant in clinical practice for seasonal diseases and the treatment of respiratory tract disorders. Objective: This trial aims to verify the efficacy of the tested dietary supplement in a pediatric population with acute tonsillopharyngitis/rhinopharyngitis (ATR). Methods: The trial includes children aged between 3 and 10 years with ATR <= 48 h, a negative rapid test for beta -hemolytic streptococcus or culture identification of nasal and/or pharyngeal exudates, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The dietary supplement tested is an oral solution already on the market based on Pelagon P-70 (equivalent to Pelargonium sidoides d.e. 133.3 mg/100 ml), propolis, zinc, and honey. The product is administered at 5 ml 3 times a day for 6 days for children younger than 6 years and 10 ml 3 times a day for 6 days for children older than 6 years. The study design is open label, randomized, and controlled, with the tested dietary supplement plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone. Patients are enrolled from 3 sites in Romania. The change in Tonsillitis Severity Score and number of treatment failures (using ibuprofen or high -dose paracetamol as rescue medication) are the primary end points. Based on the Tonsillitis Severity Score and the 2 -sample comparison of the means formula with a 5% significance level, 80% power, and a minimally clinically important difference of 2 (SD 3.85) points, 120 patients are required. To account for potential screening failures and dropouts, we need to screen a population of approximately 150 children. Results: Patient enrollment began on June 3, 2021 (first patient's first visit), and ended on August 12, 2021 (last patient's last visit). The data collection period was from June 3, 2021, to September 16, 2021. The study was funded in February 2023. Data analysis is currently ongoing (April 2024). We expect the results to be published in a peer -reviewed clinical journal in the third quarter of 2024 and presented at scientific meetings in the last quarter of 2024. Conclusions: The data from this trial may help identify new adjuvant treatments for children with ATR when streptococcal infection is excluded by a negative rapid test, thereby avoiding unnecessary antibiotic administration.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its strongest risk factor is aging. A few studies have explored the relationship between aging and AD, while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We assembled data across multi-omics (i.e., epigenetics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, based on frozen tissues from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and neuropathological and clinical traits from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Aging was assessed using six DNA methylation clocks (including the Horvath clock, Hannum clock, Levine clock, HorvathSkin clock, Lin clock, and Cortical clock) that capture mortality risk in literature. After accounting for age, we first identified a gene module (including 263 genes) that was related to the integrated aging measure of six clocks, as well as three neuropathological traits of AD (i.e., beta-amyloid, Tau tangles, and tangle density). Interestingly, among 20 key genes with top intramodular connectivity of the module, PBXIP1 was the only one that was significantly associated with all three neuropathological traits of AD at the protein level after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, PBXIP1 was associated with the clinical diagnosis of AD in both ROSMAP and three independent datasets. Moreover, PBXIP1 may be related to AD through its role in astrocytes and hippocampal neurons, and the mTOR pathway. The results suggest the critical role of PBXIP1 in AD and support the potential and feasibility of using multi-omics data to investigate mechanisms of complex diseases. However, more validations in different populations and experiments in vitro and in vivo are required in the future.

AB  - New fabrication approaches for mechanically flexible implants hold the key to advancing the applications of neuroengineering in fundamental neuroscience and clinic. By combining the high precision of thin film microfabrication with the versatility of additive manufacturing, we demonstrate a straight-forward approach for the prototyping of intracranial implants with electrode arrays and microfluidic channels. We show that the implant can modulate neuronal activity in the hippocampus through localized drug delivery, while simultaneously recording brain activity by its electrodes. Moreover, good implant stability and minimal tissue response are seen one-week post-implantation. Our work shows the potential of hybrid fabrication combining different manufacturing techniques in neurotechnology and paves the way for a new approach to the development of multimodal implants.

AB  - A series of novel isobenzofuran-1(3H)-one derivatives were designed and synthesized as antidepressants. Firstly, the serotonin reuptake inhibition of these compounds was tested in vitro, and most of them exhibited activity. Particularly, compounds 9d , 10a, and 10c demonstrated superior inhibitory effects and possibly avoided addiction via the mu-opioid receptor and CCK-B receptor. Secondly, the antidepressant effect of compound 10a was evaluated using chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced mice. The results showed that compound 10a significantly improved CRS-induced depression-like behavior by increasing the neurotransmitters 5-HT in the cortex and THP2 expression in the hippocampus. Thirdly, compound 10a was further investigated and found to enhance CRS-induced hippocampal neuron damage recovery and elevate the expression of synaptic-associated proteins such as BDNF, TrkB, PSD95, and Spinophilin in CRS-induced mice. These findings suggested that novel isobenzofuran-1(3H)-one derivative showed efficacy in treating depression, with compound 10a emerging as a potential lead compound warranting further investigation.

AB  - The ongoing circulation of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in camels across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, along with its occasional transmission to humans, demonstrates a need for a MERS vaccine. Previously, we have reported a receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV fused with human Fc as a promising vaccine antigen (MERS-CoV RBD-Fc). We generated a stable recombinant CHO cell line expressing such a protein and developed a basic production process suitable for future technological transfer to pilot-scale manufacture. In this study, we employed various in-house analytical assays to examine the characteristics of purified RBD-Fc protein and evaluate its integrity and identity. We also performed buffer screening to assess the optimal formulation for protein stabilization. We discovered that the protein maintained its structure and functionality at a wide pH range from 3.5 to 9.5, but a neutral to basic environment was necessary to provide a more stabilizing condition that could reduce surface hydrophobicity and increase colloidal stability. Collectively, these data provide valuable insight into the product characteristics of our recombinant RBD-Fc protein, contributing to the advancement of MERS vaccine development.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of tannic acid (TA) in preventing memory deficits and neurochemical alterations observed in a model for Sporadic Dementia of Alzheimer's Type. Rats were treated with TA (30 mg/kg) daily for 21 days, and subsequently received intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). We observed that STZ induced learning and memory impairments; however, treatment with TA was able to prevent these effects. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus, STZ induced an increase in acetylcholinesterase activity, reduced Na+, K+-ATPase activity and induced oxidative stress increasing thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, nitrites and reactive oxygen species levels and reducing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Treatment with TA was able in prevent the major of these neurochemical alterations. In conclusion, TA prevented memory deficits, alterations in brain enzyme activities, and oxidative damage induced by STZ. Thus, TA can be an interesting strategy in the prevention of Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Background Epilepsy affects similar to 60 million people worldwide. Most antiseizure medications in the market act on voltage-gated sodium or calcium channels, indirectly modulating neurotransmitter GABA or glutamate levels or multiple targets. Earlier studies made significant efforts to directly deliver GABA into the brain with varied success. Herein, we have hypothesized to directly deliver exogenous GABA to the brain with epilepsy through extracellular vesicles (EVs) from human GABA-producing cells and their progenitors as EVs largely mimic their parent cell composition.Methods Human neural stem cells (NSCs), medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) cells, and GABAergic interneurons (INs) were generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and characterized. EVs were isolated from NSCs, MGE cells, and INs and characterized for size and distribution, morphological features, and molecular markers. Exogenous GABA was passively loaded to the isolated EVs as a zwitterion at physiological pH, and the encapsulated dose of GABA was quantified. Epilepsy was developed through status epilepticus induction in Fisher rats by administration of repeated low doses of kainic acid. The extent of the seizures was measured for 10 h/ day for 3-6 months by video recording and its evaluation for stage III, IV and V seizures as per Racine scale. EVs from INs, MGE cells, and NSCs encapsulated with exogenous GABA were sequentially tested in the 4th, 5th, and 6th months by intranasal administration in the rats with epilepsy for detailed seizure, behavioral and synapse analysis. In separate experiments, several controls including exogenic GABA alone and EVs from INs and MGE cells were evaluated for seizure-controlling ability.Results Exogenic GABA could enter the brain through EVs. Treatment with EVs from INs and MGE cells encapsulated with GABA significantly reduced total seizures, stage V seizures, and total time spent in seizure activity. EVs from NSCs encapsulated with GABA demonstrated limited seizure control. Exogenic GABA alone and EVs from INs and MGE cells individually failed to control seizures. Further, exogenic GABA with EVs from MGE cells improved depressive behavior while partially improving memory functions. Co-localization studies confirmed exogenous GABA with presynaptic vesicles in the hippocampus, indicating the interaction of exogenous GABA in the brain with epilepsy.Conclusion For the first time, the study demonstrated that exogenous GABA could be delivered to the brain through brain cell-derived EVs, which could regulate seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy. It is identified that the cellular origin of EVs plays a vital role in seizure control with exogenous GABA.

AB  - A standardized polyphenol-enriched fraction (IPHRFPPEF) was formulated into a phospholipid complex (IPHRFPPEF-PC) to enhance oral bioavailability and evaluate stability, toxicity, and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in Sprague Dawley rats. IPHRFPPEF was prepared from crude extract using XAD-HP7/Diaion-HP20 resin column chromatography and analyzed via HPLC and NMR. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were quantified, with IPHRFPPEF showing higher values than the crude fraction. The phospholipid complex was prepared via solvent evaporation and assessed for bioavailability, stability, and toxicity. Key results demonstrated a 1.99-fold, 2.03-fold, and 1.66-fold increase in plasma concentrations of isorhamnetin, kaempferol and quercetin respectively. Acute oral toxicity testing showed an LD50 of 5000 mg/kg (GHS Category 5), and repeated-dose studies confirmed safety. IPHRFPPEF-PC exhibited enhanced pharmacokinetics and potent in vivo anti-inflammatory effects. In conclusion, the development of IPHRFPPEF-PC from a standardized polyphenolenriched fraction offers a safe and effective therapeutic approach, with significant potential for future applications in treating inflammatory conditions.

AB  - Sea buckthorn, an ancient medicinal plant, is gaining attention because of its prodigious antioxidant activities. Microwave-assisted (MAE) and Soxhlet extraction techniques were attempted to obtain the extractives from sea buckthorn pomace and seed using low (n-hexane) and medium (ethanol) polar solvents aiming at higher extraction yield. The study's main purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidant activities (free radical scavenging activity) via electro paramagnetic resonance and oxidative stability through rancimat analysis for sea buckthorn seed and pomace extracts. The maximum extraction of 78.4 wt% and 59.9 wt% for pomace and seed, respectively, were obtained using a microwave reactor at temperature 80 degrees C and power 150 W with ethanol as solvent. A relative comparison of the MAE and conventional Soxhlet extraction yield revealed that MAE is effective in extracting more antioxidant compounds with higher yields. Further, ethanol extracted seed oil showed the highest (98%) 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical slaking at 5% (w/v) concentration. The oxidative stability of sea buckthorn pomace and seed extracts was found to be on par with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) synthetic antioxidants when the extracts (3000 ppm) were blended and tested with canola oil.

AB  - Camellia oil exhibits multiple beneficial effects on cardiovascular, glucose, and lipid metabolism. However, the impact of camellia oil and diacylglycerol (DAG), which is one of the active compounds of camellia oil, is uncertain in terms of hyperuricemia (HUA). It was found that the physicochemical characterization of camellia oil and DAG shows a rich content of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), particularly oleic acid and linoleic acid, thereby supporting their potential in treating HUA. In hyperuricemic mice, camellia oil and DAG dose-dependently reduced urine and serum uric acid (UA), serum creatinine, and xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity. High doses of camellia oil and DAG treatment dramatically reduced pro-inflammatory mediators in hyperuricemic mice's renal tissue, showing a dose-dependent reduction in hepatic XOD activity and inflammation. HUA may be treated by modulating gut flora with camellia oil and DAG. The alteration of Lactobacillus and Helicobacter abundance play key roles. PICRUSt2 functional prediction showed that phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolic pathways may be mediated by camellia oil and DAG in HUA mice.

AB  - The axon initial segment of principal cells of the cortex and hippocampus is contacted by GABAergic interneurons called chandelier cells. The anatomy, as well as alterations in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, suggest that chandelier cells exert an important inhibitory control on action potential initiation. However, their functional role remains unclear, including whether their effect is indeed inhibitory or excitatory. One reason is that there is a relative gap in electrophysiological theory about the electrical effect of axo-axonic synapses. This contribution uses resistive coupling theory, a simplification of cable theory based on the observation that the small initial segment is resistively coupled to the large cell body acting as a current sink, to fill this gap. The main theoretical finding is that a synaptic input at the proximal axon shifts the action potential threshold by an amount equal to the product of synaptic conductance, driving force at threshold, and axial axonal resistance between the soma and either the synapse or of the middle of the initial segment, whichever is closer. The theory produces quantitative estimates useful to interpret experimental observations, and supports the idea that axo-axonic cells can potentially exert powerful inhibitory control on action potential initiation.

AB  - This study systematically addresses the significance of polyphenol extraction and preservation from factory tea waste, aiming to unlock its untapped potential by emphasizing sustainability and resource efficiency. Tea, renowned for its rich content of polyphenols and their notable antioxidant properties, serves as a reservoir of valuable organic compounds. However, in the realm of tea processing, a substantial volume of waste is generated, often subject to environmentally detrimental disposal practices. Delving into the substantial waste generated in tea processing, the research optimizes polyphenol extraction parameters using water as a solvent, establishing optimal conditions at 80 degrees C, 60 min, and a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:30 (g/mL). At the optimized condition, the recorded polyphenol content was 2635.36 +/- 52.07 mg GAE/L, highlighting the efficacy of the established parameters. The study validates the predicted responses of the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) model, identifies major polyphenols through LC-MS, confirms antioxidant activity via DPPH assay, and evaluates the biocompatibility of the tea waste polyphenolic extract with HEK 293 cells through MTT assay. The study employed four distinct drying methods-freeze drying, hot air over-drying, vacuum drying, and microwave drying. To preserve the quality of the TPC in the powder, optimization of drying time and temperature was undertaken. Notably, among these methods, vacuum drying at 50 degrees C emerged as the most cost-efficient drying option, amounting to $1.77/g of TPC powder, while concurrently maintaining a TPC value of 163.63 +/- 5.43 mg GAE/g DW. This sustainable approach holds promise for diverse applications, including nutraceuticals, food preservation, cosmetics, and environmental remediation, aligning with global sustainability goals.

AB  - Depression is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by persistent pleasure loss and behavioral despair. However, the potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets for depression treatment remain unclear. Therefore, identifying the underlying pathogenesis of depression would promote the development of novel treatment and provide effective targets for antidepressant drugs. In this study, proteomics analysis showed that the expression level of phosphatase and actin regulator 4 (Phactr4) was significantly increased in the CA1 hippocampus of depressed rats. The upregulated Phactr4 might induce dysfunction of the synaptic structure via suppressing the pLIMK/p-Cofilin signaling pathway, and promote neuroinflammation via activating the NF-kappa B/NLRP3 pathway, which ultimately contributes to the pathogenesis of depression. In contrast, the downregulation of Phactr4 in hippocampal CA1 of depressed rats alleviated depression-like behaviors, along with reducing neuroinflammation and improving synaptic plasticity. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that Phactr4 plays an important role in regulating neuroinflammatory response and impairment of synaptic plasticity, effects seem to involve in the pathogenesis of depression, and Phactr4 may serve as a potential target for antidepressant treatment.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the production and consumption of tea (Camellia sinensis L.) processed from purple-leaved cultivar due to their high anthocyanin content and health benefits. However, how and why seasonal changes affect anthocyanin accumulation in young tea leaves still remains obscured. In this study, anthocyanin and abscisic acid (ABA) contents in young leaves of Zifuxing 1 (ZFX1), a cultivar with new shoots turning to purple in Wuyi Mountain, a key tea production region in China, were monitored over four seasons. Young leaves produced in September were highly purplish, which was accompanied with higher anthocyanin and ABA contents. Among the environmental factors, the light intensity in particular was closely correlated with anthocyanin and ABA contents. A shade experiment also indicated that anthocyanin content significantly decreased after 168 h growth under 75% shade, but ABA treatment under the shade conditions sustained anthocyanin content. To confirm the involvement of ABA in the modulation of anthocyanin accumulation, anthocyanin, carotenoids, chlorophyll, ABA, jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA) in the young leaves of four cultivars, including ZFX1, Zijuan (ZJ), wherein leaves are completely purple, Rougui (RG) and Fudingdabaicha (FDDB) wherein leaves are green, were analyzed, and antioxidant activities of the leaf extracts were tested. Results showed that ABA, not other tested hormones, was significantly correlated with anthocyanin accumulation in the purple-leaved cultivars. Cultivars with higher anthocyanin contents exhibited higher antioxidant activities. Subsequently, ZFX1 plants were grown under full sun and treated with ABA and fluridone (Flu), an ABA inhibitor. ABA treatment elevated anthocyanin level but decreased chlorophyll contents. The reverse was true to those treated with Flu. To pursue a better understanding of ABA involvement in anthocyanin accumulation, RNA-Seq was used to analyze transcript differences among ABA- or Flu-treated and untreated ZFX1 plants. Results indicated that the differentially expressed genes in ABA or Flu treatment were mainly ABA signal sensing and metabolism-related genes, anthocyanin accumulation-related genes, light-responsive genes, and key regulatory MYB transcription factors. Taking all the results into account, a model for anthocyanin accumulation in ZFX1 cultivar was proposed: high light intensity caused reactive oxygen stress, which triggered the biosynthesis of ABA; ABA interactions with transcription factors, such as MYB-enhanced anthocyanin biosynthesis limited chlorophyll and carotenoid accumulation; and transport of anthocyanin to vacuoles resulting in the young leaves of ZFX1 with purplish coloration. Further research is warranted to test this model.

AB  - Olanzapine (OLNZ) is used to treat psychotic disorders. To look into the neurological basis of this phenomenon, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of OLNZ in gerbils and SH-SY5Y cells. Gerbils were subjected to transient global cerebral ischemia (TGCI) by blocking both common carotid arteries, and OLNZ (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used to induce oxidative-stress-mediated damage in the SH-SY5Y cells. The results indicated that OLNZ administration markedly reduced neuron damage and glial cell triggering within CA1 zone of the hippocampus. We used RNA sequencing to assess the numbers of up-and downregulated genes involved in TGCI. We found that OLNZ treatment downregulated the expression of complement-component-related genes and the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the hippocampus. In cells, OLNZ co-treatment significantly improved cell viability and reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Expression of antioxidant superoxide dismutase-1,2 enzymes (SOD-1, SOD-2) was also intensely upregulated by OLNZ, while the expression of MAPKs and NF-kappa B were reduced. Co-incubation with OLNZ also regulated apoptosis-related proteins Bax/Bcl-2 expression. Finally, the results demonstrated that treatment with OLNZ showed neuroprotective effects and that the MAPK pathway could involve in the protective effects.

AB  - The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc is a fibrocartilaginous tissue located between the condyle of the mandible and glenoid fossa and articular eminence of the temporal bone. Damage or derangement of the TMJ disc can require surgical removal (discectomy) to restore function. Removal of the TMJ disc, however, leaves the joint space vulnerable to condylar remodeling and degradation, potentially leading to long-term complications. No consistently effective clinical option exists for repair or replacement of the disc following discectomy. This study investigates the use of an acellular scaffold composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from small intestinal submucosa (SIS) as a regenerative template for the TMJ disc in a porcine model. Acellular SIS ECM scaffolds were implanted following discectomy and allowed to remodel for 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks postimplantation. Remodeling of the implanted device was assessed by longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over the course of 6 months, as well as gross morphologic, histologic, biochemical, and biomechanical analysis (tension and compression) of explanted tissues (disc and condyle) at the time of sacrifice. When the scaffold remained in the joint space, longitudinal MRI demonstrated that the scaffolds promoted new tissue formation within the joint space throughout the study period. The scaffolds were rapidly populated with host-derived cells and remodeled with formation of new, dense, aligned fibrocartilage resembling native tissue as early as 1 month postimplantation. De-novo formation of peripheral muscular and tendinous attachments resembling those in native tissue was also observed. The remodeled scaffolds approached native disc biochemical composition and compressive modulus, and possessed 50% of the tensile modulus within 3 months postimplantation. No degradation of the condylar surface was observed. These results suggest that this acellular bioscaffold fills a medical need for which there is currently no effective treatment and may represent a clinically relevant "off-the-shelf" implant for reconstruction of the TMJ disc.
   Impact statementExtracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds remodeled into temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc-like tissue as early as 3 months postimplantation in a porcine model after disc removal. The properties of the new tissue remained stable up to 6 months postimplantation. These results show the efficacy of ECM scaffolds to replace the TMJ disc.

AB  - As the average age of the population increases, memory impairment has become an increasingly prevalent issue. This study investigates the effects of 14 days of oral birch sap administration on memory functions in healthy rats using the Morris water maze (MWM) test and explores the underlying mechanisms. A compositional analysis revealed that birch soap is rich in polysaccharides, specifically a low-molecular weight polysaccharide (MW 1.29 kDa), and exhibits no hepatotoxicity or renal toxicity at the tested dose. The results from the MWM test demonstrated that the time and distance required to reach the platform were significantly shorter in the birch sap-treated group compared to the control group, suggesting that birch sap supports memory preservation. Moreover, rats treated with birch sap showed improved cerebral blood flow compared to the control rats. Additionally, in hippocampal nerve terminals (synaptosomes), rats treated with birch sap exhibited a significant increase in evoked glutamate release, as well as elevated levels of presynaptic proteins, including vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1), synaptophysin, synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin, syntaxin, synapsin I, and the 25 kDa synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP-25). Transmission electron microscopy also revealed a notable increase in the number of synaptic vesicles in hippocampal synaptosomes of the birch-sap-treated rats. These findings suggest that birch sap enhances hippocampal presynaptic glutamatergic functions and cerebral blood flow, contributing to its memory-preserving effects in rats.

AB  - The intake of high-fat diets (HFDs) and obesity are linked to cognitive impairment. Here, we aimed to investigate whether an early metabolically obese, normal-weight (MONW) phenotype, induced with an HFD in young rats, also leads to cognitive dysfunction and to evaluate the potential cognitive benefits of neonatal intake of leptin. To achieve this, Wistar rats orally received physiological doses of leptin or its vehicle during lactation, followed by 11 weeks of pair-feeding with an HFD or control diet post-weaning. Working memory was assessed using a T-maze, and gene expression in the hippocampus and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed with real-time RT-qPCR to identify cognition biomarkers. Young MONW-like rats showed hippocampal gene expression changes and decreased working memory. Animals receiving leptin during lactation presented similar gene expression changes but preserved working memory despite HFD intake, partly due to improved insulin sensitivity. Notably, PBMC Syn1 expression appears as an accessible biomarker of cognitive health, reflecting both the detrimental effect of HFD intake at early ages despite the absence of obesity and the positive effects of neonatal leptin treatment on cognition. Thus, the MONW phenotype developed at a young age is linked to cognitive dysfunction, which is reflected at the transcriptomic level in PBMCs. Neonatal leptin intake can partly counteract this impaired cognition resulting from early HFD consumption.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment with amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Among these pathological features, microglial activation is hallmark of neuroinflammation. Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) extract has been traditionally used for its diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of INO10, an inotodiol-rich chaga extract, in murine BV2 microglial cells and a 3xTg-AD mouse model. In BV2 cells, INO10 significantly reduced LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha), indicating its potent anti-inflammatory effects. Oral administration of INO10 significantly improved spatial memory in 3xTg-AD mice, as evidenced by increased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test. Furthermore, INO10 treatment attenuated neuroinflammation, as indicated by reduced microglial activation and downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that INO10 exhibited favorable bioavailability, supporting its potential as a neuroprotective agent. Histological analysis further revealed a reduction in Ab accumulation and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus, accompanied by a marked decrease in neuroinflammatory markers. These findings suggest that INO10 effectively mitigates AD-related pathology by reducing A beta deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to cognitive enhancement. Given its multi-target neuroprotective properties, INO10 may serve as a promising natural compound for AD treatment. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate its precise mechanisms and clinical applicability.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD), and antidiabetic drugs, including the sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLTI), are being studied as possible sAD therapy. We have explored whether the SGLTI phloridzin may influence metabolic and cognitive parameters in a rat model of sAD. Adult male Wistar rats were randomized to a control (CTR), an sAD-model group induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ-icv; 3 mg/kg), a CTR+SGLTI, or an STZ-icv+SGLTI group. Two-month-long oral (gavage) SGLTI treatment (10 mg/kg) was initiated 1 month after STZ-icv and cognitive performance tested prior to sacrifice. SGLTI treatment significantly decreased plasma glucose levels only in the CTR group and failed to correct STZ-icv-induced cognitive deficit. In both the CTR and STZ-icv groups, SGLTI treatment diminished weight gain, decreased amyloid beta (A beta) 1-42 in duodenum, and decreased the plasma levels of total glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), while the levels of active GLP-1, as well as both total and active glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, remained unchanged, compared to their respective controls. The increment in GLP-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and its effect on A beta 1-42 in duodenum could be one of the molecular mechanisms by which SGLTIs indirectly induce pleiotropic beneficial effects.

AB  - Rosa webbiana L. (Rosaceae) is one of the least reported and most understudied members of this family. It is native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and Nepal. The anti-convulsant effect of n-hexane extract of fruit of Rosa webbiana was investigated in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced animal model of epilepsy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups (n = 7) including control, PTZ (40 mg/kg), diazepam (4 mg/kg) and n-hexane extract (at 50, 150 and 300 mg/kg). Convulsive behavior was observed and resultant seizures were scored, animals sacrificed and their brains preserved. Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using the ionic gelation method and characterized by UV-analysis, zeta potential and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The effects of all the treatments on the expression of phosphorylated cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (p-TNF-alpha) and phosphorylated transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-kappa B) expression in the cortex and hippocampus of the brains of treated rats were studied through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and morphological differences and surviving neuronal number were recorded through hematoxylene and eosin (H&E) staining. Significant changes in seizures score and survival rate of rats were observed. Downregulation of neuro-inflammation, p-TNF-alpha and p-NF-kappa B was evident. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of this fraction showed multiple constituents of interest, including esters, alkanes and amines.

AB  - Febrile seizures (FSs) are a relatively common early-life condition that can cause CNS developmental disorders, but the specific mechanisms of action of FS are poorly understood. In this work, we used hyperthermia-induced FS in 10-day-old rats. We demonstrated that the efficiency of glutamatergic synaptic transmission decreased rapidly after FS by recording local field potentials. This effect was transient, and after two days there were no differences between control and post-FS groups. During early ontogeny, the proportion of calcium-permeable (CP)-AMPA receptors in the synapses of the principal cortical and hippocampal neurons is high. Therefore, rapid internalization of CP-AMPA receptors may be one of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp method and the selective CP-AMPA receptor blocker IEM-1460, we tested whether the proportion of CP-AMPA receptors changed. We have demonstrated that FS rapidly reduces synaptic CP-AMPA receptors in both the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. This process was accompanied by a sharp decrease in the calcium permeability of the membrane of principal neurons, which we revealed in experiments with kainate-induced cobalt uptake. Our experiments show that FSs cause rapid changes in the function of the glutamatergic system, which may have compensatory effects that prevent excessive excitotoxicity and neuronal death.

AB  - Drought is the stressor with a significant adverse impact on the yield stability of tea plants. HD-ZIP III transcription factors (TFs) play important regulatory roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, whether and how HD-ZIP III TFs are involved in drought response and tolerance in tea plants remains unclear. Here, we identified seven HD-ZIP III genes ( CsHDZ3 - 1 to CsHDZ3 - 7 ) in tea plant genome. The evolutionary analysis demonstrated that CsHDZ3 members were subjected to purify selection. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that all seven CsHDZ3s located in the nucleus. Yeast self-activation and dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that CsHDZ3-1 to CsHDZ3-4 have trans-activation ability whereas CsHDZ3-5 to CsHDZ3-7 served as transcriptional inhibitors. The qRT-PCR assay showed that all seven CsHDZ3 genes could respond to simulated natural drought stress and polyethylene glycol treatment. Further assays verified that all CsHDZ3 genes can be cleaved by csn-miR166. Overexpression of csn-miR166 inhibited the expression of seven CsHDZ3 genes and weakened drought tolerance of tea leaves. In contrast, suppression of csn-miR166 promoted the expression of seven CsHDZ3 genes and enhanced drought tolerance of tea leaves. These findings established the foundation for further understanding the mechanism of CsHDZ3- miR166 modules' participation in drought responses and tolerance.

AB  - This study has established the impact that space radiation exposure has on the capability of rats to successfully negotiate behavioral tasks of increasing complexity. Rats previously exposed to a low dose (10 cGy) of either He-4 ions or a cocktail of 6 ions that simulates the galactic cosmic ray spectrum (GCRSim) were screened initially on an attentional set shifting (ATSET) task that provides a measure of executive function. Rats that exhibited superior ATSET performance were then selected for follow up behavioral assessments designed to evaluate how the cohort of "good performers" would fare when presented with a novel behavioral paradigm termed the Associative Recognition Memory and Interference Touchscreen (ARMIT) task. Central to this approach was to discriminate if/how adaptive problem solving would be impacted by changing the options of associative cues presented over several learning sessions to obtain a reward under time constraints using this newly designed touch screen-based task. Data from these studies indicated that when faced with an increased cognitive load, possibly due to interference from prior associative recognition memories, rats exhibited impairments in their capability to negotiate task dynamics and efficiently engage abstract reasoning. Interestingly, while exposure to the GCRSim adversely impacted problem-solving capabilities, single ion exposure did not, pointing to the nuances of space radiation exposure on CNS functionality. Since the selected behavioral paradigms exhibit strong cross-species correlates, data suggest that rodents succumb to increased task rigor as observed in humans, and make similar mistakes when challenged with the interference of overlapping associative memories. Furthermore, data clearly points to the limitations of over-reliance on a single cognitive endpoint that may underestimate global neurocognitive risk due to space radiation exposure.

AB  - Objective: Existing quality of care frameworks insufficiently integrate the perspectives of physicians, nurses and patients. We collected narrative accounts from these three groups to explore if their perspectives might add new content to these existing definitions. Methods: Ninety-seven descriptions of "good" and "poor" care episodes were collected from a convenience sample of physicians, nurses and outpatients at eight regional hospitals. Two coders classified the narrative contents into themes related to structures, processes and outcomes of care. Results: The physicians, nurses and patients raised the following "quality of care" aspects: Successful communication among staff, with patients and care companions; staff motivation; frequency of knowledge errors; prioritization of patient-preferred outcomes; institutional emphasis on building "quality cultures"; and organizational implementation of fluid system procedures. Conclusion: Respondents primarily referred to care processes in their descriptions of "quality of care." "Hippocratic pride" (in response to care successes) and "Rapid reactivity" (in response to (near) failures) emerged as two new outcome indicators of high-quality care. Practice implications: This study provides a first qualitative fundament for understanding the components of "quality of care" from a triangulated frontline perspective. Future research needs to validate our findings with quantitative data to explore their usefulness for completing existing quality frameworks. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Airway epithelium repair after infection consists of wound repair, re-synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and tight junction proteins. In humans, EPs((R)) 7630 obtained from Pelargonium sidoides roots reduces the severity and duration of acute respiratory tract infections. The effect of EPs((R)) 7630 on tissue repair of rhinovirus-16 (RV-16) infected and control human airway epithelial cells was assessed for: (i) epithelial cell proliferation by manual cell counts, (ii) epithelial wound repair by "scratch assay", (iii) ECM composition by Western-blotting and cell-based ELISA, and (iv) epithelial tight junction proteins by Western-blotting. EPs((R)) 7630 stimulated cell proliferation through cAMP, CREB, and p38 MAPK. EPs((R)) 7630 significantly improved wound repair. Pro-inflammatory collagen type-I expression was reduced by EPs((R)) 7630, while fibronectin was increased. Virus-binding tight junction proteins desmoglein2, desmocollin2, ZO-1, claudin1, and claudin4 were downregulated by EPs((R)) 7630. The RV16-induced shift of the ECM towards the pro-inflammatory type was prevented by EPs((R)) 7630. Most of the effects of EPs((R)) 7630 on tissue repair and regeneration were sensitive to inhibition of cAMP-induced signaling. The data suggest that EPs((R)) 7630-dependent modification of epithelial cell metabolism and function might underlie the faster recovery time from viral infections, as reported by others in clinical studies.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disease with a mixed genetic and environmental aetiology. Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis was suggested both as a pathophysiological mechanism and as a target for therapy. In the present study, we utilized intracerebroventricular transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as a means to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in the ketamine-induced neurodevelopmental murine model for schizophrenia. Syngeneic MSC have successfully engrafted and survived for up to 3 months following transplantation. Improvement in social novelty preference and prepulse inhibition was noted after transplantation. In parallel to behavioural improvement, increased hippocampal neurogenesis as reflected in the numbers of doublecortin expressing neurons in the dentate gyrus and gene expression was noted both 2 weeks following transplantation as well as 3 months later compared with nontreated animals. An independent aging effect was observed for both behaviour and neurogenesis, which was attenuated by MSC treatment. As opposed to MSC treatment, short-term treatment with clozapine was efficient only during treatment and diminished 3 months later. Interestingly, while shortly after transplantation (2 weeks) behavioural improvement was correlated mainly to FGF2 gene expression, 3 months later it was mainly correlated to the expression of the notch ligand DLL1. This suggests that long-term effect during ageing may depend on neural stem cell self-renewal. We conclude that a single intracerebroventricular injection of bone marrow-derived MSC can suffice for long-term reversal of changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and improve schizophrenia-like behavioural phenotype inflicted by developmental exposure to ketamine in mice.

Besides the unbearable chronic pain, disfigured limbs, and loss of livelihood, people living with LF are stigmatized and sometimes abandoned by family. To ease the burden of LF, which is known locally as gyepim or duba, the social and cultural aspects must be investigated in unison with the biomedical strategies already in place. As part of a multi-year pilot study in the Western Region of Ghana, funded by Canadian Institutes for Health Research, this article investigates the ways that traditional healers manage the stigma associated with LF. Interviews were conducted in the local languages to collect data. These were transcribed and translated to English for thematic and content analysis. Preliminary findings indicate that the traditional healers of the Western Region of Ghana regard the illness within an indigenous worldview, an ecology and history borne of the spiritual topography of Western Ghana. Healers, known as okomfoi, are conversant in the causes and outcomes of LF, and can offer varied diagnoses and cures for the disease within an indigenous framework. Additionally, they claim to do so without the need to antagonize allopathic practitioners. These insights demonstrate that thinking about LF as an indigenous ailment can offer new understandings of how we might eliminate this neglected tropical disease.

AB  - The treatment of dermatophytoses, the most common human fungal infections, requires new alternatives. The aim of this study was to determine the antidermatophytic activity of the aqueous Azorean Black Tea extract (ABT), together with an approach to the mechanisms of action. The phytochemical analysis of ABT extract was performed by HPLC. The dermatophytes susceptibility was assessed using a broth microdilution assay; potential synergies with terbinafine and griseofulvin were evaluated by the checkerboard assay. The mechanism of action was appraised by the quantification of the fungal cell wall chitin and beta-1,3-glucan, and by membrane ergosterol. The presence of ultrastructural modifications was studied by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The ABT extract contained organic and phenolic acids, flavonoids, theaflavins and alkaloids. It showed an antidermatophytic effect, with MIC values of 250 mu g/mL for Trichophyton mentagrophytes, 125 mu g/mL for Trichophyton rubrum and 500 mu g/mL for Microsporum canis; at these concentrations, the extract was fungicidal. An additive effect of ABT in association to terbinafine on these three dermatophytes was observed. The ABT extract caused a significant reduction in beta-1,3-glucan content, indicating the synthesis of this cell wall component as a possible target. The present study identifies the antidermatophytic activity of the ABT and highlights its potential to improve the effectiveness of conventional topical treatment currently used for the management of skin or mucosal fungal infections.

AB  - We examined the mechanism by which lithium chloride (LiCl) attenuates the impaired learning capability and memory function of dual-transgenic APP/PS1 mice. Six- or 12-month-old APP/PS1 and wild-type (WT) mice were randomized into four groups, namely WT, WT+Li (100 mg LiCl/kg body weight, gavage once daily), APP/PS1 and APP/PS1+Li. Primary rat hippocampal neurons were exposed to beta-amyloid peptide oligomers (A beta Os), LiCl and/or XAV939 (inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin) or transfected with small interfering RNA against the beta-catenin gene. In the cerebral zone of APP/PS1 mice, the level of A beta was increased and those of alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), phosphor-GSK3 beta (ser9), beta-catenin and cyclin D1 (protein and/or mRNA levels) reduced. Two-month treatment with LiCl at ages of 4 or 10 months weakened all of these effects. Similar expression variations were observed for these proteins in primary neurons exposed to A beta Os, and these effects were attenuated by LiCl and aggravated by XAV939. Inhibition of beta-catenin expression lowered the level of alpha 7 nAChR protein in these cells. LiCl attenuates the impaired learning capability and memory function of APP/PS1 mice via a mechanism that might involve elevation of the level of alpha 7 nAChR as a result of altered Wnt/beta-catenin signalling.

AB  - The WWC protein family is an upstream regulator of the Hippo signalling pathway that is involved in many cellular processes. We examined the effect of an endothelium-specific WWC1 and/or WWC2 knock-out on ocular angiogenesis. Knock-outs were induced in C57BL/6 mice at the age of one day (P1) and evaluated at P6 (postnatal mice) or induced at the age of five weeks and evaluated at three months of age (adult mice). We analysed morphology of retinal vasculature in retinal flat mounts. In addition, in vivo imaging and functional testing by electroretinography were performed in adult mice. Adult WWC1/2 double knock-out mice differed neither functionally nor morphologically from the control group. In contrast, the retinas of the postnatal WWC knock-out mice showed a hyperproliferative phenotype with significantly enlarged areas of sprouting angiogenesis and a higher number of tip cells. The branching and end points in the peripheral plexus were significantly increased compared to the control group. The deletion of the WWC2 gene was decisive for these effects; while knocking out WWC1 showed no significant differences. The results hint strongly that WWC2 is an essential regulator of ocular angiogenesis in mice. As an activator of the Hippo signalling pathway, it prevents excessive proliferation during physiological angiogenesis. In adult animals, WWC proteins do not seem to be important for the maintenance of the mature vascular plexus.

AB  - The pivotal role of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the emotional modulation of hippocampal plasticity and memory consolidation is well-established. Specifically, multiple studies have demonstrated that the activation of the noradrenergic (NA) system within the BLA governs these modulatory effects. However, most current evidence has been obtained by direct infusion of synthetic NA or beta-adrenergic agonists. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of endogenous NA release in the BLA, induced by a natural aversive stimulus (coyote urine), on memory consolidation for a low-arousing, hippocampal-dependent task. Our experiments combined a weak object location task (OLT) version with subsequent mild predator odor exposure (POE). To investigate the role of endogenous NA in the BLA in memory modulation, a subset of the animals (Wistar rats) was treated with the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol at the end of the behavioral procedures. Hippocampal tissue was collected 90 min after drug infusion or after the OLT test, which was performed 24 h later. We used the obtained samples to estimate the levels of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc)-two molecular markers of experience-dependent changes in neuronal activity. The result suggests that POE has the potential to become a valuable behavioral paradigm for studying the interaction between BLA and the hippocampus in memory prioritization and selectivity.

AB  - Despite the growing awareness of the importance of plant secondary metabolites in insect-plant interactions, undergraduate degree content in agronomy and biology generally does not provide a clear concept to students in relation to secondary metabolite induction of plant defences, implying that students do not obtain a good understanding of the secondary metabolism or its functions. To address this deficiency, we have designed a practical exercise where students determine the phytochemical induction of secondary metabolites in aromatic plants subjected to herbivory. This approach involves an experimental laboratory class in which students evaluate the phenolic compounds and main essential oil compound induction in peppermint damaged by an armyworm. By the end of this exercise, based on the results and findings, students will: have a better comprehension of plant defence responses to herbivores; be able to illustrate the consequences of insect herbivory in relation to plant secondary metabolites induction; acquire lab skills related to the use of a spectrophotometer; be able to understand and analyse a GC chromatogram report. Authentic research experiences in the classroom are considered valuable elements for promoting science at undergraduate level, as well as providing motivation for the student and linking research with teaching.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second leading cause of dementia. The majority of VaD patients have cognitive abnormalities, which are caused by cerebral hypoperfusion-induced ischemia, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Natural products are receiving increasing attention for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular pathways underlying the protective effects of fisetin, a flavonoid present in many fruits and vegetables, in a mouse model of VaD induced by repeated ischemia-reperfusion (IR) of the total bilateral carotid artery. Here, we found that VaD caused brain injury, lipid peroxidation, and neuronal death in the hippocampus, as well as astrocyte and microglial activation, and reduced BDNF neurotrophic factor expression together with behavioral alterations. In addition, VaD induced the activation of inflammasome components (NLRP-3, ASC, and caspase 1), and their downstream products (IL-1 beta and IL-18) release and promote activation of apoptotic cell death. Fisetin attenuated histological injury, malondialdehyde levels, inflammasome pathway activation, apoptosis, as well as increased BDNF expression, reduced astrocyte, microglial activation, and cognitive deficits. In conclusion, the protective effects of fisetin could be due to the inhibition of the ROS-induced activation of NF-kappa B/NLRP3 inflammasome together with the activation of antioxidant Nrf2/HO-1, suggesting a possible crosstalk between these molecular pathways.

AB  - Human rhinovirus (RV) is a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma exacerbations. The exploration of RV pathogenesis has been hampered by a lack of disease-relevant model systems. We performed a detailed characterization of host responses to RV infection in human lung tissue ex vivo and investigated whether these responses are disease relevant for patients with COPD and asthma. In addition, impact of the viral replication inhibitor rupintrivir was evaluated. Human precision-cut lung slices (PCIS) were infected with RV1B with or without rupintrivir. At Days 1 and 3 after infection, RV tissue localization, tissue viability, and viral load were determined. To characterize host responses to infection, mediator and whole genome analyses were performed. RV successfully replicated in PCLS airway epithelial cells and induced both antiviral and proinflarnmatory cytokines such as IFN alpha 2a, CXCL10, CXCL11, IFN-gamma, TNF alpha, and CCL5. Genomic analyses revealed that RV not only induced antiviral immune responses but also triggered changes in epithelial cell-associated pathways. Strikingly, the RV response in PCLS was reflective of gene expression changes described in patients with COPD and asthma. Although RV-induced host immune responses were abrogated by rupintrivir, RV-triggered epithelial processes were largely refractory to antiviral treatment. Detailed analysis of RV-infected human PCLS and comparison with gene signatures of patients with COPD and asthma revealed that the human RV PCLS model represents disease-relevant biological mechanisms that can be partially inhibited by a well-known antiviral compound and provide an outstanding opportunity to evaluate novel therapeutics.

AB  - As a result of physical exercise, muscle releases multiple exerkines, such as "irisin", which is thought to induce pro-cognitive and antidepressant effects. We recently demonstrated in young healthy mice the mitigation of depressive behaviors induced by consecutive 5 day irisin administration. To understand which molecular mechanisms might be involved in such effect, we here studied, in a group of mice previously submitted to a behavioral test of depression, the gene expression of neurotrophins and cytokines in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), two brain areas frequently investigated in the depression pathogenesis. We found significantly increased mRNA levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in the hippocampus and brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) in the PFC. We did not detect a difference in the mRNA levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1 beta in both brain regions. Except for BDNF in the PFC, two-way ANOVA analysis did not reveal sex differences in the expression of the tested genes. Overall, our data evidenced a site-specific cerebral modulation of neurotrophins induced by irisin treatment in the hippocampus and the PFC, contributing to the search for new antidepressant treatments targeted at single depressive events with short-term protocols.

AB  - Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) is a crucial subunit within the y-secretase complex and regulates beta-amyloid (A beta) production. Accumulated evidence indicates that n-butylidenephthalide (BP) acts effectively to reduce A beta levels in neuronal cells that are derived from trisomy 21 (Ts21) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. This article aims to investigate the possible mechanisms through which BP ameliorates the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and verify the effectiveness of BP through animal experiments. Results from RNA microarray analysis showed that BP treatment in Ts21 iPSC-derived neuronal cells reduced long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) CYP3A43-2 levels and increased microRNA (miR)-29b-2-5p levels. Bioinformatics tool prediction analysis, biotin-labeled miR-29b-2-5p pull-down assay, and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed a direct negative regulatory effect for miRNA29b-2-5p on lncRNA-CYP3A43-2 and PSEN1. Moreover, BP administration improved short-term memory and significantly reduced A beta accumulation in the hippocampus and cortex of 3xTg-AD mice but failed in miR-29b-2-5p mutant mice generated by CRISP/Cas9 technology. In addition, analysis of brain samples from patients with AD showed a decrease in microRNA-29b-2-5p expression in the frontal cortex region. Our results provide evidence that the LncCYP3A43-2/miR29-2-5p/PSEN1 network might be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying BP-induced A beta reduction.

AB  - Excessive use of alcohol can induce neurobiological and neuropathological alterations in the brain, including the hippocampus and forebrain, through changes in neurotransmitter systems, hormonal systems, and neuroimmune processes. We aimed to investigate the effects of ethanol on the expression of coding and noncoding RNAs in a brain-derived cell line exposed to ethanol. After exposing Neuro2a cells, a neuroblastoma cell line, to ethanol for 24 and 72 h, we observed cell proliferation and analyzed up- and downregulated mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) using total RNA-Seq technology. We validated the differential expression of some mRNAs and lncRNAs by RT-qPCR and analyzed the expression of Cebpd and Rnu3a through knock-down of Cebpd. Cell proliferation was significantly reduced in cells exposed to 100 mM ethanol for 72 h, with 1773 transcripts up- or downregulated by greater than three-fold in ethanol-treated cells compared to controls. Of these, 514 were identified as lncRNAs. Differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs were mainly observed in cells exposed to ethanol for 72 h, in which Atm and Cnr1 decreased, but Trib3, Cebpd, and Spdef increased. On the other hand, lncRNAs Kcnq1ot1, Tug1, and Xist were changed by ethanol, and Rnu3a in particular was greatly increased by chronic ethanol treatment through inhibition of Cebpd. Our results increase the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms related to coding and noncoding RNAs in an in vitro model of acute and chronic exposure to ethanol.

AB  - Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are ubiquitous enzymes involved in the regulation of plant growth, develop-ment, and stress responses. Unfortunately, the comprehensive identification of GSTs in tea plant has not been achieved. In this study, a total of 88 CsGSTs proteins were identified and divided into eight classes, among which the tau class was the largest. Chromosomal localization analysis revealed an uneven distribution of CsGSTs across the tea plant genome. Tandem duplication is the main force driving tea plant CsGSTs expansion. CsGSTs struc-tures and conserved motifs were similar. The analysis of cis-regulatory elements in promoter regions showed that CsGSTs can response to multiple stresses, and that MYB may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of CsGST. RNA-Seq data revealed that the expression of most GSTUs was associated with various stresses, including pathogen and insect attack, cold spells, drought and salt stresses, nitrogen nutrition, bud dormancy, and morphological development, and the expression of these CsGSTs was obviously different in eight tissues. In addition, we proved that CsGSTU19, localized at the nucleus and cell membrane, was involved in tea plant defense against temperature stresses and Co. camelliae infection. These findings provide references for the further functional analysis of GSTs in the future.

AB  - BackgroundChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is increasingly linked to systemic inflammation, however, research on peripheral blood metabolic patterns in CRS patients remains limited. This study aimed to investigate peripheral blood metabolic profiles in eosinophilic CRS and non-eosinophilic CRS, while exploring the mediating role of metabolites in the relationship between body mass index and CRS.MethodsClinical data were collected from 1,151 CRS patients and 814 healthy controls, classifying patients into eosinophilic CRS and non-eosinophilic CRS groups based on tissue eosinophil counts. Peripheral blood metabolic profiles were compared across different CRS endotypes and between CRS patients and healthy controls. Causal mediation analysis assessed the mediating effects of metabolites on the relationship between body mass index and CRS.ResultsCRS patients exhibited distinct metabolic profiles, with dysregulated lipid metabolism characterized by increased triglycerides, free fatty acids, and lipoprotein(a), but patients with eosinophilic CRS had higher triglycerides, while non-eosinophilic CRS had higher free fatty acids. Cystatin-C effectively differentiated CRS endotypes (area under the curve = 0.735). Elevated body mass index was a risk factor for both eosinophilic CRS and non-eosinophilic CRS patients, with peripheral free fatty acids and Cystatin-C mediating this effect.ConclusionsThis study reveals distinct metabolic profiles in patients with CRS, supporting its link to systemic inflammation. Promoting healthy dietary habits and weight control is therefore a cornerstone of sustainable, preventive care, offering a practical strategy to improve long-term patient well-being, particularly in refractory cases.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta). There are currently no drugs that can successfully treat this disease. This study first explored the anti-inflammatory activity of seven components isolated from Antrodia cinnamonmea in BV2 cells and selected EK100 and antrodin C for in vivo research. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were treated with EK100 and antrodin C for one month to evaluate the effect of these reagents on AD-like pathology by nesting behavior, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting. Ergosterol and ibuprofen were used as control. EK100 and antrodin C improved the nesting behavior of mice, reduced the number and burden of amyloid plaques, reduced the activation of glial cells, and promoted the perivascular deposition of A beta in the brain of mice. EK100 and antrodin C are significantly different in activating astrocytes, regulating microglia morphology, and promoting plaque-associated microglia to express oxidative enzymes. In contrast, the effects of ibuprofen and ergosterol are relatively small. In addition, EK100 significantly improved hippocampal neurogenesis in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Our data indicate that EK100 and antrodin C reduce the pathology of AD by reducing amyloid deposits and promoting nesting behavior in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice through microglia and perivascular clearance, indicating that EK100 and antrodin C have the potential to be used in AD treatment.

AB  - The goals of the current study were to determine the efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD) of a shortened, computer-augmented cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) protocol and to determine brain plasticity effects following CCBT. Seventy-two MDD participants were randomized to CCBT or waitlist control groups and compared to 40 healthy controls (HCs). Functional MRI data were collected for all participants and repeated for patients following CCBT (five therapist-administered manualized CBT sessions plus computer training exercises). Linear mixed-effects models evaluated changes in depression scores throughout treatment and in connectivity from pre- to post-CCBT. Linear regression models compared connectivity differences between groups (MDD vs. HC). Following CCBT, there were decreases in MADRS and BDI (ps < 0.001); there was more negative connectivity of dlPFC with sgACC and DMN with sgACC (ps < 0.002); and there was more positive connectivity of FPN with nucleus accumbens, bilateral amygdalae, bilateral hippocampi, and sgACC and of DMN with ventral and dorsal bilateral anterior insulae (ps < 0.01). There were no associations between change in MADRS and change in connectivity; however, there was an association between change in BDI and change in FPN-sgACC connectivity (p = 0.01). A shortened CBT schedule coupled with home computer exercises was associated with decreased depression symptoms and augmented PFC connectivity with multiple subcortical regions. One possible mechanism of the CCBT intervention is modulating PFC connectivity with subcortical regions, influencing top-down control of affective processes dysregulated in MDD.

AB  - As an essential component of the architecture of a plant, leaves are crucial to sustaining decision-making in cultivars and effectively support agricultural processes. When the leaf area is constantly monitored, a plant's health and productive capacity can be assessed to foment proactive and reactive strategies. Because of that, one of the most critical tasks in agricultural processes is estimating foliar damage. In this sense, we present an automatic method to estimate leaf stress caused by insect herbivory, including damage in border regions. As a novelty, we present a method with well-defined processing steps suitable for numerical analysis and visual inspection of defoliation severity. We describe the proposed method and evaluate its performance concerning 12 different plant species. Experimental results show high assertiveness in estimating leaf area loss with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.98 for grape, soybean, potato, and strawberry leaves. A classic pattern recognition approach, named template matching, is at the core of the method whose performance is compared to cutting-edge techniques. Results demonstrated that the method achieves foliar damage quantification with precision comparable to deep learning models. The code prepared by the authors is publicly available.

AB  - Hippocampal neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of mammalian hippocampus, is essential for cognitive and emotional processes. Despite advances in understanding the transcription factors and signaling pathways that regulate DG neurogenesis, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the molecular changes necessary for granule neuron generation remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of the H3K9 demethylase KDM3A in postnatal neurogenesis in mouse DG. Using Kdm3a-tdTomato reporter mice, we demonstrate that KDM3A is predominantly expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) during postnatal DG development. Conventional or conditional knockout (cKO) of Kdm3a in NSPCs hinders postnatal neurogenesis, compromising learning and memory abilities and impairing brain injury repair in mice. Loss of KDM3A in NSPCs suppresses proliferation and neuronal differentiation while promoting glial differentiation in vitro. KDM3A localizes both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of NSPCs and regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway through dual mechanisms. Firstly, KDM3A modulates the transcription of Wnt targets and a set of neurogenesis-related genes through its histone demethylase activity. Secondly, in the cytoplasm, KDM3A interacts with casein kinase I alpha (CK1 alpha), regulating its ubiquitination. Loss of KDM3A enhances CK1 alpha stability, leading to increased phosphorylation and degradation of beta-catenin. Finally, quercetin, a geroprotective small molecule, upregulates KDM3A protein expression and promotes adult hippocampal neurogenesis following brain injury. However, these effects are diminished in Kdm3a KO mice, indicating that quercetin primarily promotes hippocampal neurogenesis through the regulation of KDM3A. In conclusion, our study highlights KDM3A as a crucial regulator of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, influencing NSPC proliferation and differentiation via the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. These findings have potential implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders and injuries.

AB  - Transcriptional factors (TFs) act as key determinants of cell death and survival by differentially modulating gene expression. Here, we identified many TFs, including TEAD4, that form condensates in stressed cells. In contrast to YAP-induced transcription-activating condensates of TEAD4, we found that co-factors such as VGLL4 and RFXANK alternatively induced repressive TEAD4 condensates to trigger cell death upon glucose starvation. Focusing on VGLL4, we demonstrated that heterotypic interactions between TEAD4 and VGLL4 favor the oligomerization and assembly of large TEAD4 condensates with a nonclassical inhibitory function, i.e., causing DNA/chromatin to be aggregated and entangled, which eventually impede gene expression. Based on these findings, we engineered a peptide derived from the TEAD4-binding motif of VGLL4 to selectively induce TEAD4 repressive condensation. This "glue" peptide displayed a strong antitumor effect in genetic and xenograft mouse models of gastric cancer via inhibition of TEAD4-related gene transcription. This new type of repressive TF phase separation exemplifies how cofactors can orchestrate opposite functions of a given TF, and offers potential new antitumor strategies via artificial induction of repressive condensation.
   Liquid-liquid phase separation of transcription factors has been shown to activate transcription. This study identifies a repressive type of transcription factor condensation induced by TEAD4 co-factor binding, leading to DNA/chromatin aggregation.Binding of transcriptional co-factors VGLL4 and RFXANK induces formation of large condensates of TEAD4 in cells under glucose starvation.VGLL4-induced condensation of TEAD4 represses its YAP-dependent transcriptional activation.Repressive condensation of TEAD4 causes chromatin aggregation and cell death.A "glue peptide" derived from the TEAD4-binding motif of VGLL4 induces TEAD4 condensation and suppresses tumorigenesis in mice.
   Glucose deprivation-dependent co-factor binding induces TEAD4 condensation, suppressing its transcriptional activity and inhibiting gastric tumorigenesis in mice.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the effects of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on learning, memory, and hippocampal miRNA expression profiles in rats. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, intermittent hypoxia for 1 week (IH1W), 2 weeks (IH2W), and 4 weeks (CIH4W). The rats underwent hypoxia/reoxygenation cycles, and the Morris water maze test was used to evaluate learning and memory abilities. High-throughput sequencing and qPCR were employed to analyze changes in miRNA expression in the hippocampus. The study found that differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) may be involved in cognitive dysfunction under CIH conditions by regulating predicted target gene signaling pathways, such as metabolic pathways, MAPK pathway, axon guidance, ubiquitination, and apoptosis. This study revealed the roles and mechanisms of key miRNAs in CIH-induced cognitive dysfunction, highlighting the critical role of miRNAs in regulating target gene expression, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). These findings provide important molecular insights and potential therapeutic targets for further research on OSAS-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep neural networks have led to new discoveries in human and animal learning and intelligence. A recent artificial intelligence agent in the DeepMind family, muZero, can complete a variety of tasks with limited information about the world in which it is operating and with high uncertainty about features of current and future space. To perform, muZero uses only three functions that are general yet specific enough to allow learning across a variety of tasks without overgeneralization across different contexts. Similarly, humans and animals are able to learn and improve in complex environments while transferring learning from other contexts and without overgeneralizing. In particular, the mammalian extrahippocampal system (eHPCS) can guide spatial decision making while simultaneously encoding and processing spatial and contextual information. Like muZero, the eHPCS is also able to adjust contextual representations depending on the degree and significance of environmental changes and environmental cues. In this opinion, we will argue that the muZero functions parallel those of the hippocampal system. We will show that the different components of the muZero model provide a framework for thinking about generalizable learning in the eHPCS, and that the evaluation of how transitions in cell representations occur between similar and distinct contexts can be informed by advances in artificial intelligence agents such as muZero. We additionally explain how advances in AI agents will provide frameworks and predictions by which to investigate the expected link between state changes and neuronal firing. Specifically, we will discuss testable predictions about the eHPCS, including the functions of replay and remapping, informed by the mechanisms behind muZero learning. We conclude with additional ways in which agents such as muZero can aid in illuminating prospective questions about neural functioning, as well as how these agents may shed light on potential expected answers.

AB  - The intricate relationship between brain vascular diseases and neurodegeneration has garnered increased attention in the scientific community. With an aging population, the incidence of these two conditions is likely to increase, making it imperative to understand the underlying common molecular mechanisms and unveiling novel avenues for therapy. Prompted by the observation that A beta peptide aggregation has been implicated in the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and that elevated concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with less cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we demonstrate that a small peptide (Pep9) encompassing the 10-30 sequence of VEGF exhibits significant ability to inhibit the aggregation of the A beta 1-42 peptide, as well as the formation of toxic oligomers. AFM studies confirmed this inhibitory capacity, which is also paralleled by a significant reduction of the random coil to a beta-sheet conformational transition. Further studies have shown that Pep9 protects differentiated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells from A beta toxicity, being even more effective than full-length protein in preventing amyloid-induced neuronal death. The use of a control peptide wherein two histidines are substituted with glycines (H11G and H12G) suggests a close relationship between the peptide amino acid sequence and its antiaggregating/neuroprotective activity. Overall, this study provides insight into the role of VEGF in AD and suggests that specific VEGF fragments could be beneficial in the treatment of this condition.

AB  - A large number of genetic variations have been identified to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related quantitative traits. However, majority of existing studies focused on single types of omics data, lacking the power of generating a community including multi-omic markers and their functional connections. Because of this, the immense value of multi-omics data on AD has attracted much attention. Leveraging genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data, and their backbone network through functional relations, we proposed a modularity-constrained logistic regression model to mine the association between disease status and a group of functionally connected multi-omic features, i.e. single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes and proteins. This new model was applied to the real data collected from the frontal cortex tissue in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project cohort. Compared with other state-of-art methods, it provided overall the best prediction performance during cross-validation. This new method helped identify a group of densely connected SNPs, genes and proteins predictive of AD status. These SNPs are mostly expression quantitative trait loci in the frontal region. Brain-wide gene expression profile of these genes and proteins were highly correlated with the brain activation map of 'vision', a brain function partly controlled by frontal cortex. These genes and proteins were also found to be associated with the amyloid deposition, cortical volume and average thickness of frontal regions. Taken together, these results suggested a potential pathway underlying the development of AD from SNPs to gene expression, protein expression and ultimately brain functional and structural changes.

AB  - Efficient navigation is supported by a cognitive map of space. The hippocampus plays a key role for this map by linking multimodal sensory information with spatial memory representations. However, in human navigation studies, the full range of sensory information is often unavailable due to the stationarity of experimental setups. We investigated the contribution of multisensory information to memory-guided spatial navigation by presenting a virtual version of the Morris water maze on a screen and in an immersive mobile virtual reality setup. Patients with hippocampal lesions and matched controls navigated to memorized object locations in relation to surrounding landmarks. Our results show that availability of multisensory input improves memory-guided spatial navigation in both groups. It has distinct effects on navigational behaviour, with greater improvement in spatial memory performance in patients. We conclude that congruent multisensory information shifts computations to extrahippocampal areas that support spatial navigation and compensates for spatial navigation deficits.
   A virtual reality study suggests that multisensory input shifts computations to extrahippocampal regions that support spatial navigation, as multisensory input improves memory-guided spatial navigation in humans with and without hippocampal lesions.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental and analytical investigation on the performance of partial penetration welds used to adjoin steel plates in irregular shaped multicell concrete filled steel tubes. The experimental program of this study is designed based on an actual implementation of such members as mega columns in a super high rise building in China. A total of six specimens are designed with different plate arrangements for the purpose of testing the performance of the partial penetration welds at different locations of the specimen. The designed specimens are tested under different load procedures and directions; this is achieved by placing them in vertical and slantwise manners between two loading plates which impose monotonic and cyclic actions. The failure conditions of each of the tested specimens are presented and discussed in detail and are based on the conclusions drawn from the experimental observations; the partial penetration weld at the corner of the tested specimens is found to be the most vulnerable. To facilitate large scale analysis, a finite element model constructed by the finite element analysis program ABAQUS is verified against experimental results. The evaluation of the stress at the partial penetration welded corner is carried out following an empirical procedure, which is adopted due to the complexity of the problem domain. The adopted procedure consists of two steps: the first one is to initially evaluate the stress based on an existing method in the literature, and the second one is to fit the results of the initial evaluation with the finite element model results based on parametric and regression analysis. After performing regression analysis, a formula to predict the weld stress is concluded, and the results of the proposed equation are found to be satisfactory when compared with the finite element model results.

AB  - Bone is an economical material. Indeed, as moving a heavy skeleton is energetically costly, the vertebrate skeleton is adapted to maximise resistance to the stresses imposed with a minimum amount of material, so that bone tissue is deposited where it is needed. Using bone as a source of inspiration should therefore reduce the manufacturing cost (both financial and ecological) and increase the strength (and lifespan) of bioinspired (BI) structures. This study proposes to investigate which adaptive features of the outer shape and inner structure of bone, related to compressive strength, could be used to build BI support structures. To do so, we explain the choice of the bones to be analysed and present the results of the biomechanical analyses (finite element analysis) carried out on virtual models built from the structures of the different bone models and of the mechanical tests carried out on 3D-printed versions of these models. The compressive strength of these direct bone BI columns was compared with each other, and with those of a conventional filled cylindrical column, and of a cylindrical column whose internal structure is BI from the radius of the white rhinoceros. The results of our comparative analyses highlight that the shape of long bones is less effective than a cylinder in resisting compression but underline the relevance in designing BI cylindrical columns with heterogeneous structures inspired by the radius of the white rhinoceros and the tibia of the Asian elephant, and raise the interest in studying the fossil record using the radius of the giant rhinocerotoid Paraceratherium.

AB  - The effect of brain extracellular matrix (ECM) on synaptic plasticity remains controversial. Here, we show that targeted enzymatic attenuation with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) of ECM triggers the appearance of new glutamatergic synapses on hippocampal pyramidal neurons, thereby increasing the amplitude of field EPSPs while decreasing both the mean miniature EPSC amplitude and AMPA/NMDA ratio. Although the increased proportion of 'unpotentiated' synapses caused by ECM attenuation should promote long-term potentiation (LTP), surprisingly, LTP was suppressed. The upregulation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels decreased the excitability of pyramidal neurons, thereby suppressing LTP. A blockade of SK channels restored cell excitability and enhanced LTP; this enhancement was abolished by a blockade of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), which is involved in the maturation of dendritic spines. Thus, targeting ECM elicits the appearance of new synapses, which can have potential applications in regenerative medicine. However, this process is compensated for by a reduction in postsynaptic neuron excitability, preventing network overexcitation at the expense of synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Camellia (Camellia oleifera bel.) seed oil (CO) is extensively used as an edible oil in China and Asian countries owing to its high nutritional and medicinal values. It has been shown that a high-fat diet enhances lipid accumulation and induces intestinal microbiota imbalance in mice. However, it is still to be learned whether CO prevents dyslipidemia through gut microbiota. Here, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of the gut microbiota, we found that oral CO relieved lipid accumulation and reversed gut microbiota dysbiosis. Compared to mice (C57BL/6J male mice) fed a high-fat diet, treatment with CO regulated the composition and functional profiling communities related to the lipid metabolism of gut microbiota. The abundances of Dubosiella, Lactobacillus, and Alistipes were markedly increased in CO supplementation mice. In addition, the colon levels of isobutyric acid, pentanoic acid, and isovaleric acid were similar between the control and CO supplementation mice. Besides, the results indicated that CO supplementation in mice alleviated lipid droplet accumulation in the hepatocytes and subcutaneous adipose tissue, although the liver index did not show a difference. Notably, CO supplementation for 6 weeks significantly reduced the levels of LDL, TC, and TG, while enhancing the level of HDL in serum and liver. Meanwhile, we also identified that CO supplementation suppressed the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in high fat-fed (HF-fed) mice. Taken together, our results suggest that CO improved dyslipidemia and alleviated lipid accumulation in HF-fed mice, the molecular mechanisms possibly associated with the reorganization of gut microbiota, in particular, Alistipes and Dubosiella, mediated the inhibition of the mTOR pathway.

TI  - Therapeutic potential of dental pulp stem cell transplantation in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease
T2  - NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - EXPRESSION
AB  - Dental pulp stem cells are dental pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells that originate from the neural crest. They exhibit greater potential for the treatment of nervous system diseases than other types of stem cells because of their neurogenic differentiation capability and their ability to secrete multiple neurotrophic factors. Few studies have reported Alzheimer's disease treatment using dental pulp stem cells. Rat models of Alzheimer's disease were established by injecting amyloid-beta 1-42 into the hippocampus. Fourteen days later, 5 x 106 dental pulp stem cells were injected into the hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry and western blot assays showed that dental pulp stem cell transplantation increased the expression of neuron-related doublecortin, NeuN, and neurofilament 200 in the hippocampus, while the expression of amyloid-beta was decreased. Moreover, cognitive and behavioral abilities were improved. These findings indicate that dental pulp stem cell transplantation in rats can improve cognitive function by regulating the secretion of neuron-related proteins, which indicates a potential therapeutic effect for Alzheimer's disease. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University, China (approval No. KY2017-132) on February 21, 2017.

AB  - Gray blight disease, which is caused by Pestalotiopsis-like species, poses significant challenges to global tea production. However, the comprehensive metabolic responses of tea plants during gray blight infection remain understudied. Here, we employed a multi-omics strategy to characterize the temporal transcriptomic and metabolomic changes in tea plants during infection by Pseudopestalotiopsis theae, the causal agent of gray blight. Untargeted metabolomic profiling with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS) revealed extensive metabolic rewiring over the course of infection, particularly within 24 h post-inoculation. A total of 64 differentially accumulated metabolites were identified, including elevated levels of antimicrobial compounds such as caffeine and (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate, as well as oxidative catechin polymers like theaflavins, theasinensins and theacitrins. Conversely, the synthesis of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, oligomeric proanthocyanidins and flavonol glycosides decreased. Integrated omics analyses uncovered up-regulation of phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, lignin biosynthesis and down-regulation of photosynthesis in response to the pathogen stress. This study provides novel insights into the defense strategies of tea plants against gray blight disease, offering potential targets for disease control and crop improvement.

AB  - Tea is an important woody crop whose cultivation is severely limited by cold stress. Although 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is known to be effective in alleviating abiotic stresses in plants, knowledge of the detailed metabolic response of tea plants to exogenous ALA-induced cold resistance is still limited-a lack which restricts our ability to protect tea plants from cold stress. In the present study, we performed an in-depth metabolomics analysis to elucidate the metabolic responses of tea plants to cold stress and explore the role of ALA in improving tea plants' cold-resistance capability. Metabolic profiles showed that cold stress altered various metabolisms in tea plants, especially galactose composition and flavonoid contents. Furthermore, exogenous ALA application altered a series of metabolisms associated with cold stress. Importantly, increases in metabolites, including catechin, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and procyanidin B2, involved in the mechanisms of ALA improved tea plants' cold resistance. Overall, our study deciphered detailed metabolic responses of tea plants to cold stress and elucidated the mechanisms of ALA in enhancing cold resistance through rebuilding compositions of soluble carbohydrates and flavonoids. Therefore, we have provided a basis for exogenous usage of ALA to protect tea plants from cold stress.

AB  - DUSP4 is a member of the DUSP (dual-specificity phosphatase) subfamily that is selective to the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and has been implicated in a range of biological processes and functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we utilized the stereotactic delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-DUSP4 to overexpress DUSP4 in the dorsal hippocampus of 5xFAD and wildtype (WT) mice, then used mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics along with the label-free quantification to profile the proteome and phosphoproteome in the hippocampus. We identified protein expression and phosphorylation patterns modulated in 5xFAD mice and examined the sex-specific impact of DUSP4 overexpression on the 5xFAD proteome/phosphoproteome. In 5xFAD mice, a substantial number of proteins were up- or down-regulated in both male and female mice in comparison to age and sex-matched WT mice, many of which are involved in AD-related biological processes, such as activated immune response or suppressed synaptic activities. Many proteins in pathways, such as immune response were found to be suppressed in response to DUSP4 overexpression in male 5xFAD mice. In contrast, such a shift was absent in female mice. For the phosphoproteome, we detected an array of phosphorylation sites regulated in 5xFAD compared to WT and modulated via DUSP4 overexpression in each sex. Interestingly, 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation changes occurred in opposite directions. Strikingly, both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation changes were found to be mostly in neurons and play key roles in neuronal processes and synaptic functions. Site-centric pathway analysis revealed that both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation sites were enriched for a number of kinase sets in females but only a limited number of sets of kinases in male mice. Taken together, our results suggest that male and female 5xFAD mice responded to DUSP4 overexpression via shared and sex-specific molecular mechanisms, which might underly similar reductions in amyloid pathology in both sexes while learning deficits were reduced in only females with DUSP4 overexpression. Finally, we validated our findings with the sex-specific AD-associated proteomes in human cohorts and further developed DUSP4-centric proteomic network models and signaling maps for each sex.

AB  - beta-cyclocitral (beta CC) is one of the significant oxidative products of beta-carotene. It primes plants for multiple stress acclimation without compromising plant growth. Metabolic reorganization is necessary to maintain a balance between growth and defense. However, the beta CC-mediated changes in a plant's metabolic network are unknown. Here, we demonstrate how beta CC-induced metabolic changes enable Solanum lycopersicum L. (tomato) plants to promote defense and maintain growth under stress. An analysis of early (0-240 min) and late (72 h) changes in the tomato metabolome after beta CC-treatment using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry identified 57 compounds. A principal coordinate analysis suggested that beta CC treatment significantly changes the metabolite profile. A variable importance in projection (VIP) analysis revealed 16 and 19 discriminant metabolites from early and late samples, respectively (VIP >= 1.0). Upregulated metabolites were mainly amino acids and phytophenols. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that beta CC treatment influenced amino acid metabolism at early and later times; however, phenylpropanoid and isoquinoline biosynthesis were influenced only at the later time. A 66.6% similarity in the upregulated metabolites of beta CC- and simulated-herbivory-treated plants confirmed beta CC's role against herbivores. We conclude that beta CC steers a temporal separation in amino acids and defense metabolite accumulation that optimizes resource allocation to growth and defense.

AB  - A non-invasive, accessible and effective biomarker is critical to the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of age-related cognitive decline. Recent work has suggested a strong association between auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and cognitive function in aging macaques. Here we show in 118 human participants (66 females; age range=18-92 years; hearing loss = -5 to 70 dB HL) that cognition is associated with both age and hearing level, but this triad relationship is mainly driven by the age factor. After adjusting for age, cognition is still significantly associated with both the ABR wave V amplitude (B, 0.110, 95% CI, 0.018- 0.202; p = 0.020) and latency (B, -0.101, 95% CI, -0.186- -0.016; p = 0.021). Importantly, this age-adjusted ABR-cognition association is primarily driven by older individuals and language-dependent cognitive functions. We also perform the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating-characteristic analysis and find that the ABR wave V amplitude is best for detecting good cognitive performers (AUC = 0.96) whereas the wave V latency is best for detecting poor ones (AUC = 0.86). The present result not only confirms the previous animal work in humans but also shows the clinical potential of using auditory brainstem responses to improve diagnosis and treatment of age-related cognitive decline.

AB  - The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, ?-3, or n-3) and arachidonic acid (ARA, ?-6 or n-6) are known to have distinct physiological functions, yet can both support growth and reproduction of consumers, raising the question of whether EPA and ARA are ecologically substitutable dietary resources. We explored the relative importance of EPA and ARA for the growth and reproduction of the freshwater keystone herbivore Daphnia in a life-history experiment. Both PUFA were supplemented in a concentration-dependent manner to a PUFA-free diet, separately and in combination (50% EPA: 50% ARA mixture). The growth-response curves obtained with EPA, ARA, and the mixture were virtually congruent and the thresholds for PUFA limitation did not differ, indicating that EPA (n-3) and ARA (n-6) were substitutable dietary resources under the applied experimental conditions. The actual requirements for EPA and ARA might change with growth conditions, e.g., under the influence of parasites or pathogens. The higher retention of ARA in Daphnia suggests that EPA and ARA are subject to different turnover rates, which also implies different physiological functions. Studies on the ARA requirements of Daphnia could provide valuable information on the presumably underestimated ecological importance of ARA in freshwater food webs.

AB  - Background The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is a large herbivorous freshwater fish belonging to the Cyprinidae family. It is widely cultivated as a food source in China and is renowned as one of the Four Great Domestic Fishes. Despite its economic importance, the published genome assemblies of grass carp remain incomplete due to gaps, thereby hindering molecular research and genetic improvement.Results In this study, we report the assembly of a telomere-to-telomere (T2T) gap-free genome of the grass carp with total length of 890,918,310 bp for 24 chromosomes without gaps, representing the highest completeness and assembly quality to date. Our assembly contains 27,446 protein-coding genes, and 93.04% of all were annotated with multiple databases, with 48 telomeres and 24 centromeres characterized. Gap-free reference genomes enable us to study the structure of centromeres and identify conserved centromere-specific satellite motifs for grass carp. Furthermore, we identified 108 gene-related gaps across 12 chromosomes and 38 structural variations across 17 chromosomes in this T2T assembly.Conclusions The validated gap-free genome provides invaluable resource for future genomic studies grass carp, offering new insights into its genetic architecture and evolutionary dynamics.

AB  - PurposeWe investigated the role of lnc_AABR07044470.1 on the occurrence and development of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and neuronal injury by targeting the miR-214-3p/PERM1 axis to find a novel clinical drug target and prediction and treatment of AIS.MethodsThe mouse AIS animal model was used in vivo experiments and hypoxia/reoxygenation cell model in vitro was established. Firstly, infarction volume and pathological changes of mouse hippocampal neurons were detected using HE staining. Secondly, rat primary neuron apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry assay. The numbers of neuron, microglia and astrocytes were detected using immunofluorescence (IF). Furthermore, binding detection was performed by bioinformatics database and double luciferase reporter assay. Lnc_AABR07044470.1 localization was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Lnc_AABR07044470.1, miR-214-3pand PERM1mRNA expression was performed using RT-qPCR. NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and PERM1 protein expression was performed using Western blotting. IL-1 beta was detected by ELISA assay.ResultsMouse four-vessel occlusion could easily establish the animal model, and AIS animal model had an obvious time-dependence. HE staining showed that, compared with the sham group, infarction volume and pathological changes of mouse hippocampal neurons were deteriorated in the model group. Furthermore, compared with the sham group, neurons were significantly reduced, while microglia and astrocytes were significantly activated. Moreover, the bioinformatics prediction and detection of double luciferase reporter confirmed the binding site of lnc_AABR07044470.1 to miR-214-3p and miR-214-3p to Perm1. lnc_AABR07044470.1 and PERM1 expression was significantly down-regulated and miR-214-3pexpression was significantly up-regulated in AIS animal model in vivo. At the same time, the expression of inflammasome NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and pro-inflammatory factor IL-1 beta was significantly up-regulated in vivo and in vitro. The over-expression of lnc_AABR07044470.1 and miR-214-3p inhibitor could inhibit the neuron apoptosis and the expression of inflammasome NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and pro-inflammatory factor IL-1 beta and up-regulate the expression of PERM1 in vitro. Finally, over-expression of lnc_AABR07044470.1 and miR-214-3p inhibitor transfected cell model was significant in relieving the AIS and neuronal injury.ConclusionLnc_AABR07044470.1 promotes inflammatory response to neuronal injury via miR-214-3p/PERM1 axis in AIS.

AB  - We performed transcriptome analysis in the hippocampus 24 h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. We observed glial-specific genes, comprised of two-thirds of all differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We found microglial DEGs that were the most numerous in LPS group. On the contrary, differential alternative splicing (DAS) analysis revealed the most numerous DAS events in astrocytes. Besides, we observed distinct major isoform switching in the Ptbp1 gene, with skipping of exon 8 in LPS group. Ptbp1 usually considered a pluripotency sustaining agent in brain embryonic development, according to the previous studies. Analyzing the splicing tune-up upon LPS exposure, we came to a supposition that the short Ptbp1 isoform de-represses immune-specific response by Ptbp1 adjusted splicing architecture. Additionally, the Ptbp3 (NOD1) immune-specific splicing factor has apparently been de-repressed by the Ptbp1 short isoform in glial cells. Notably, both the Ptbp1 and Ptbp3 genes express primarily in microglial/endothelial brain cells. We also report immune-related genes, altering their major isoforms upon LPS exposure. The results revealed immune modulating role of alternative splicing in brain.

AB  - In plants, recent studies have revealed that N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation of mRNA has potential regulatory functions of this mRNA modification in many biological processes. m(6)A methyltransferase, m(6)A demethylase and m(6)A-binding proteins can cause differential phenotypes, indicating that m(6)A may have critical roles in the plant. In this study, we depicted the m(6)A map of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides Linn.) transcriptome. Similar to A. thaliana, m(6)A sites of sea buckthorn transcriptome is significantly enriched around the stop codon and within 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-untranslated regions (3MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEUTR). Gene ontology analysis shows that the m(6)A modification genes are associated with metabolic biosynthesis. In addition, we identified 13,287 different m(6)A peaks (DMPs) between leaf under drought (TR) and control (CK) treatment. It reveals that m(6)A has a high level of conservation and has a positive correlation with mRNA abundance in plants. GO and KEGG enrichment results showed that DMP modification DEGs in TR were particularly associated with ABA biosynthesis. Interestingly, our results showed three m(6)A demethylase (HrALKBH10B, HrALKBH10C and HrALKBH10D) genes were significantly increased following drought stress, which indicated that it may contributed the decreased m(6)A levels. This exhaustive m(6)A map provides a basis and resource for the further functional study of mRNA m(6)A modification in abiotic stress.

AB  - Background: Diabetes is highly prevalent, and the number of patients with diabetic sarcopenia and cognitive impairment has grown, leading to decreased quality of life. Although the exact mechanisms between sarcopenia and cognitive impairment have not been elucidated, it is speculated that muscle and liver-derived mediators might contribute to brain function. This study examined the molecular mechanisms associated with muscle-brain interaction accompanied by insulin resistance (IR) caused by aberrant energy metabolism via myokines/hepatokines in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Methods: T2DM was induced by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection. Behavior tests were conducted to analyze grip strength and cognitive function. Histopathological changes in skeletal muscle and brain tissue were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining and the protein levels of biomarkers related to energy metabolism via myokines/hepatokines were measured by western blot. Results: T2DM caused peripheral and central IR. Furthermore, T2DM led to aberrant energy metabolism through the reduced fibroblast growth factor 21 dependent AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)/surtuin1/proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha pathway in T2DM. Subsequently, reduced circulating myokines/hepatokines were in accordance with their levels with hippocampal neuronal markers in T2DM mice. Accordingly, skeletal muscle (muscle strength: 2.83 +/- 0.39 vs. 2.187 +/- 0.51, p = 0.004) and brain function (PAT: 38.5 +/- 57.91 vs. 11.556 +/- 12.03, p = 0.02) impairment and morphological changes (muscle cross-sectional area: 872.43 +/- 242.87 vs. 743.68 +/- 169.31, p = 0.01; density of neurons in hippocampus: 145 +/- 15.13 vs. 77 +/- 35.51, p = 0.05; density of neurons in cortex: 138.333 +/- 6.66 vs. 78 +/- 17.35, p = 0.05) were shown in T2DM mice. In addition, the working ability demonstrated by Y-maze was positively correlated with % lean mass (p = 0.046, R = 0.3426). Conclusions: T2DM led to aberrant energy in skeletal muscle and brain via myokines/hepatokines. This study suggested that myokines and hepatokines might have potential roles in skeletal muscle and central metabolic functions which can mediate cognitive function in T2DM mice.

AB  - BackgroundParkinson<acute accent>s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world, is characterized by the death or impairment of dopaminergic neurons (DAn) in the substantia nigra pars compacta and dopamine depletion in the striatum. Currently, there is no cure for PD, and treatments only help to reduce the symptoms of the disease, and do not repair or replace the DAn damaged or lost in PD. Cell replacement therapy (CRT) seeks to relieve both pathological and symptomatic PD manifestations and has been shown to have beneficial effects in experimental PD models as well as in PD patients, but an apt cell line to be used in the treatment of PD has yet to be established. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the transplantation of hVM1 clone 32 cells, a bankable line of human neural stem cells (hNSCs), in a PD mouse model at four months post-transplant.MethodsAdult (five month-old) C57BL/6JRccHsd male mice were injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and subsequently transplanted with hVM1 clone 32 cells, or buffer, in the left striatum. Four months post-transplant, behavioral effects were explored using the open field and paw print tests, and histological analyses were performed.ResultsTransplantation of hVM1 clone 32 cells rescued dopaminergic nigrostriatal populations in adult Parkinsonian mice. Motor and neurological deterioration were observed in buffer-treated mice, the latter of which had a tendency to improve in hNSC-transplanted mice. Detection of mast cell migration to the superficial cervical lymph nodes in cell-transplanted mice denoted a peripheral effect. Transplantation of hNSCs also rescued neuroblast neurogenesis in the subgranular zone, which was correlated with dopaminergic recovery and is indicative of local recovery mechanisms.ConclusionsIn this proof-of-concept study, the transplantation of hVM1 clone 32 cells provided neuroprotection in adult Parkinsonian mice by restoring the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and hippocampal neurogenesis, demonstrating the efficacy of cell replacement therapy as a treatment for PD.

AB  - Toxorhynchites mosquitoes have an exclusively phytophagous feeding habit as adults, which leads to significant differences in their morphophysiology compared with haematophagous mosquitoes. However, the molecular mechanisms of digestion in this mosquito are not well understood. In this study, RNA sequencing of the posterior midgut (PMG) of the mosquito Toxorhynchites theobaldi was undertaken, highlighting its significance in mosquito digestion. Subsequently, a comparison was made between the differential gene expression of the PMG and that of the anterior midgut. It was found that the most abundant proteases in the PMG were trypsin and chymotrypsin, and the level of gene expression for enzymes essential for digestion (such as serine protease, alpha-amylase and pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase) and innate immune response (including catalase, cecropin-A2 and superoxide dismutase) was like that of haematophagous mosquitoes. Peritrophin-1 was detected in the entire midgut, with an elevated expression level in the PMG. Based on our findings, it is hypothesized that a non-haematophagic habit might have been exhibited by the ancestor of Tx. theobaldi, and this trait may have been retained. This study represents a pioneering investigation at the molecular level of midgut contents in a non-haematophagous mosquito. The findings offer valuable insights into the evolutionary aspects of feeding habits in culicids.

AB  - Introduction Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2), one of the enzymes that catalyze the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA, has been proved to be an oncogene in various cancers. However, the function of ACSS2 is still largely a black box in melanoma.Methods The ACSS2 expression was detected in melanoma cells and melanocytes at both protein and mRNA levels. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were investigated after ACSS2 knockdown. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology was employed to identify differentially expressed genes caused by ACSS2 knockdown, which were then verified by immunoblotting analysis. Animal experiments were further performed to investigate the influence of ACSS2 on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.Results Firstly, we found that ACSS2 was upregulated in most melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes. In addition, ACSS2 knockdown dramatically suppressed melanoma cell migration and invasion, whereas promoted cell apoptosis in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, tumor growth and metastasis were dramatically suppressed by ACSS2 knockdown in vivo. RNA-Seq suggested that the Hippo pathway was activated by ACSS2 knockdown, which was forwardly confirmed by Western blotting and rescue experiments. Taken together, we demonstrated that ACSS2 enables melanoma cell survival and tumor metastasis via the regulation of the Hippo pathway.Discussion In summary, this study demonstrated that ACSS2 may promote the growth and metastasis of melanoma by negatively regulating the Hippo pathway. Targeting ACSS2 may be a promising target for melanoma treatment.

AB  - Genome replication of positive strand RNA viruses requires the production of a complementary negative strand RNA that serves as a template for synthesis of more positive strand progeny. Structural RNA elements are important for genome replication, but while they are readily observed in the positive strand, evidence of their existence in the negative strand is more limited. We hypothesized that this was due to viruses differing in their capacity to allow this latter RNA to adopt structural folds. To investigate this, ribozymes were introduced into the negative strand of different viral constructs; the expectation being that if RNA folding occurred, negative strand cleavage and suppression of replication would be seen. Indeed, this was what happened with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) constructs. However, little or no impact was observed for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), human rhinovirus (HRV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) constructs. Reduced cleavage in the negative strand proved to be due to duplex formation with the positive strand. Interestingly, ribozyme-containing RNAs also remained intact when produced in vitro by the HCV polymerase, again due to duplex formation. Overall, our results show that there are important differences in the conformational constraints imposed on the folding of the negative strand between different positive strand RNA viruses.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem worldwide, which could lead to an extremely high percentage of mortality and disability. Current treatment strategies mainly concentrate on neuronal protection and reconstruction, among them, exogenous neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has long been regarded as the most effective curative treatment. However, due to secondary trauma, transplant rejection, and increased incidence of brain malignant tumor, a non-invasive therapy that enhanced endogenous neurogenesis was more suitable for TBI treatment. Our previous work has shown that miR-132 overexpression could improve neuronal differentiation of NSCs in vitro and in vivo. So, we engineered a new kind of AAV vector named AAV-PHP.eB which can transfect brain parenchyma through intravenous injection to overexpress miR-132 in brain after TBI. We found that miR-132 overexpression could reduce impact volume, promote neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG), accelerate neuroblast migrating into the impact cortex, ameliorate microglia-mediated inflammatory reaction, and ultimately restore learning memory function. Our results revealed that AAV-PHP.eB-based miR-132 overexpression could improve endogenous tissue repairment and release clinical symptoms after traumatic brain injury. This work would provide a new therapeutic strategy for TBI treatment and other neurological disorders characterized by markable neuronal loss and memory impairment.Graphical AbstractmiR-132 overexpression accelerates endogenous neurogenesis and releases TBI-induced tissue repairment and memory impairment. Controlled cortical impact onto the cortex would induce serious cortical injury and microglia accumulation in both cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, endogenous neuroblast could migrate around the injury core. miR-132 overexpression could accelerate neuroblast migration toward the injury core and decreased microglia accumulation in the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus. miR-132 could be a suitable target on neuroprotective therapy after TBI.

AB  - Human agriculture has always raced against insect adaptation, requiring updated pest control methods and knowledge of evolutionary processes. Excessive exposure to blue light (BL) kills a wide range of insect species and has attracted attention as an alternative to chemical pesticides. Here, to understand how insects adapt to BL toxicity, we investigated evolutionary responses to BL toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster over 70 generations using laboratory selection experiments. The selected line exhibited an obese phenotype accompanied by midgut elongation, with BL tolerance dependent on gut microbiota-mediated lipid accumulation. Whole-genome and transcriptome analyses consistently highlighted interactions between the microbiota and host lipid metabolism-related genes. Remarkably, manipulating genes associated with lipid accumulation conferred BL tolerance even in the absence of selection. We suggest that the acquisition of BL tolerance occurs through 'adaptive obesity'. Our study introduces a mechanism of evolutionary adaptation of insects against BL-based selective pressure by maximising the benefits from the gut microbiota via midgut elongation.

AB  - The dendritic cell of the CNS, the microglia (MG), is an initiation point of the immunological response within the post-blood-brain barrier (BBB) compartment. Microglia drastically changes in response to cell stress to a much different non-dendritic morphologies. This investigation postulates that if the first MG responses to toxic injury are isolated and studied in greater morphological detail, there is much to be learned about microglia's metamorphosis from and M2 to an M1 state. The organotypic hippocampal slice was the experimental setting used to investigate microglial response to toxic injury; this isolates dendritic cell to post-BBB cells dynamics from the impact of nonspecific of in vivo blood-derived signaling. Within the context of biochemically verified precise toxic cell injury/death (induced with mercury or cyanide in combination with 2-deoxy-glucose) to a specific region within the hippocampal slice, MG's morphological response was evaluated. There was up to 35% increase in microglia activation proximally to injury (CA3 region) and no changes distally (DG region) when compared to control slices treated with PBS. Maximum microglia activation consisted of a 3 plus-fold increase in the distance between the nucleus membrane and the cell membrane, which underscores an extensive and quantifiable amount of membrane rearrangement. This quantification can be applied to contemporaneous AI image analysis algorithms to demarcate and quantify relative MG activation in and around a site of injury. In between baseline and activated MG morphologies, 5 intermediate morphologies (or structural variations) are described as it relates to its cell body, nucleus, and dendrites. The result from this study reconciles details of MG's structure to its holistic characteristics in relation to parenchymal cell stress.

AB  - Objective: The paper aimed to explore the mechanism of cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2) in-volvement in Golgi stress and tumor dryness in non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells through the estro-gen receptor (ER) dependent Hippo pathway. Meth-ods: Human NSCLC cell line A549 was purchased from ATCC andcultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS. Attract-ene reagent was used for plasmid transfection. ER (sh) RNA was designed using RNAi Designer. Seventy-six hours after infection, stable cells were obtained after treated with puromycin for 3 weeks. ER silencing cells (with inhibited ER expression) were compared to the control cells (normal cultured NSCLC cell line A549, CRABP2 normal expression). CRABP2 and ER expres-sion levels were detected by RT-PCR. MTT assay was used to detect cell proliferation, and the cell localiza-tion of ER and Golgi was observed by confocal mi-croscopy. The invasion and metastasis of cells were analyzed by Boden chamber invasion and migration assays. Western blotting assays was used for detecting the protein expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, ZO-1 protein and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related factors. Results: The lower expression level of mRNA was detected in the ER-silencing group com-pared to the control group (P<0.05). We also found a higher proliferation level of cells, the number of invad -ing and metastatic cells, the expression of vimentin, p-Lats1T1079, Lats1 and p-YAPS127 mRNA in the control group compared to the ER silencing group (P<0.05). And the expression level of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), phos-phorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (p-eIF2 alpha), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in the control group was higher than that in the ER silencing group (P<0.05). Adversely, a lower expression level of E-cadherin and ZO-1 protein was found in the control group compared to the ER silencing group (P<0.05). Conclusion: The ex -pression of CRABP2 in NSCLC cells was regulated by ER, and cell proliferation and invasion were regulated by the Hippo pathway. At the same time, it was found that decreased expression of CRABP2 enhanced endoplas-mic reticulum/Golgi stress response.

AB  - S100B is a calcium-binding protein produced and secreted by astrocytes in response to various extracellular stimuli. C6 glioma cells are a lineage commonly employed for astroglial studies due to the expression of astrocyte specific markers and behavior. However, in high-glucose medium, C6 S100B secretion increases, in contrast to the trend in primary astrocyte cultures. Additionally, S100B secretion decreases due to fluorocitrate (FC), a Krebs cycle inhibitor, highlighting a connection between S100B and metabolism. Herein, we investigate the impact of FC on S100B secretion in primary astrocyte cultures, acute hippocampal slices and C6 glioma cells, as well as lactate mediation. Our results demonstrated that C6 responded similarly to astrocytes in various parameters, despite the decrease in S100B secretion, which was inversely observed in astrocytes and slices. Furthermore, FC inversely altered extracellular lactate in both models, suggesting a role for lactate in S100B secretion. This was reinforced by a decrease in S100B secretion in hippocampal slices treated with lactate and its agonist, but not in C6 cells, despite HCAR1 expression. Our findings indicate that extracellular lactate mediates the decrease in S100B secretion in astrocytes exposed to FC. They also emphasize the differences in C6 glioma cells regarding energetic metabolism. The proposed mechanism via HCAR1 provides further compelling evidence of the relationship between S100B and glucose metabolism.

AB  - Recently, it has been reported that a gene (PEN1) in Arabidopsis thaliana is highly resistant to Plutella xylostella. We screened all the homologous genes of PEN1 in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that the motif of these genes was very conserved. At present, few insect resistance genes have been identified and characterized in Brassica napus. Therefore, we screened all the homologous genes containing this motif in the Brassica napus genome and systematically analyzed the basic information, conserved domain, evolutionary relationship, chromosomal localization and expression analysis of these genes. In this study, 12 PEN1 homologous genes were identified in the Brassica napus genome, which is more than the number in Arabidopsis thaliana. These genes are unevenly distributed on the 12 chromosomes in Brassica napus. Furthermore, all the PEN1 homologous genes contained light responsiveness elements, and most of the genes contained gibberellin-responsive elements, meJA-responsive elements and abscisic-acid-responsive elements. The results will provide a theoretical basis for screening insect resistance genes from the genome of Brassica napus and analyzing the molecular mechanism of insect resistance in Brassica napus.

AB  - Mammalian TRPC5 channels are predominantly expressed in the brain, where they increase intracellular Ca2+ and induce depolarization. Because they augment presynaptic vesicle release, cause persistent neural activity, and show constitutive activity, TRPC5s could play a functional role in late developmental brain events. We used immunohistochemistry to examine TRPC5 in the chick embryo brain between 8 and 20 days of incubation, and provide the first detailed description of their distribution in birds and in the whole brain of any animal species. Stained areas substantially increased between E8 and E16, and staining intensity in many areas peaked at E16, a time when chick brains first show organized patterns of whole-brain metabolic activation like what is seen consistently after hatching. Areas showing cell soma staining match areas showing Trpc5 mRNA or protein in adult rodents (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellar Purkinje cells). Chick embryos show protein staining in the optic tectum, cerebellar nuclei, and several brainstem nuclei; equivalent areas in the Allen Institute mouse maps express Trpc5 mRNA. The strongest cell soma staining was found in a dorsal hypothalamic area (matching a group of parvicellular arginine vasotocin neurons and a pallial amygdalohypothalamic cell corridor) and the vagal motor complex. Purkinje cells showed strong dendritic staining at E20. Unexpectedly, we also describe neurite staining in the septum, several hypothalamic nuclei, and a paramedian raphe area; the strongest neurite staining was in the median eminence. These novel localizations suggest new unexplored TRPC5 functions, and possible roles in late embryonic brain development.

AB  - Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is mainly present in adipose tissue where it hydrolyzes diacylglycerol. Although expression of HSL has also been reported in the brain, its presence in different cellular compartments is uncertain, and its role in regulating brain lipid metabolism remains hitherto unexplored. We hypothesized that HSL might play a role in regulating the availability of bioactive lipids necessary for neuronal function and therefore investigated whether dampening HSL activity could lead to brain dysfunction. In mice, we found HSL protein and enzymatic activity throughout the brain, localized within neurons and enriched in synapses. HSL-null mice were then analyzed using a battery of behavioral tests. Relative to wild-type littermates, HSL-null mice showed impaired short-term and longterm memory, yet preserved exploratory behaviors. Molecular analysis of the cortex and hippocampus showed increased expression of genes involved in glucose utilization in the hippocampus, but not cortex, of HSL-null mice compared with controls. Furthermore, lipidomics analyses indicated an impact of HSL deletion on the profile of bioactive lipids, including a decrease in endocannabinoids and eicosanoids that are known to modulate neuronal activity, cerebral blood flow, and inflammation processes. Accordingly, mild increases in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in HSL mice compared with littermates were suggestive of low-grade inflammation. We conclude that HSL has a homeostatic role in maintaining pools of lipids required for normal brain function. It remains to be tested, however, whether the recruitment of HSL for the synthesis of these lipids occurs during increased neuronal activity or whether HSL participates in neuroinflammatory responses.

AB  - Lignocellulose, as the key structural component of plant biomass, is a recalcitrant structure, difficult to degrade. The traditional management of plant waste, including landfill and incineration, usually causes serious environmental pollution and health problems. Interestingly, the xylophagous beetle, Trypoxylus dichotomus, can decompose lignocellulosic biomass. However, the genomics around the digestion mechanism of this beetle remain to be elucidated. Here, we assembled the genome of T. dichotomus, showing that the draft genome size of T. dichotomus is 636.27 Mb, with 95.37% scaffolds anchored onto 10 chromosomes. Phylogenetic results indicated that a divergent evolution between the ancestors of T. dichotomus and the closely related scarabaeid species Onthophagus taurus occurred in the early Cretaceous (120 million years ago). Through gene family evolution analysis, we found 67 rapidly evolving gene families, within which there were 2 digestive gene families (encoding Trypsin and Enoyl-(Acyl carrier protein) reductase) that have experienced significant expansion, indicating that they may contribute to the high degradation efficiency of lignocellulose in T. dichotomus. Additionally, events of chromosome breakage and rearrangement were observed by synteny analysis during the evolution of T. dichotomus due to chromosomes 6 and 8 of T. dichotomus being intersected with chromosomes 2 and 10 of Tribolium castaneum, respectively. Furthermore, the comparative transcriptome analyses of larval guts showed that the digestion-related genes were more commonly expressed in the midgut or mushroom residue group than the hindgut or sawdust group. This study reports the well-assembled and annotated genome of T. dichotomus, providing genomic and transcriptomic bases for further understanding the functional and evolutionary mechanisms of lignocellulose digestion in T. dichotomus.

AB  - Executive dysfunction encompasses altered decision-making, attentional deficits, excessive risk-taking behaviours, and inefficient planning. Alongside memory loss, these cognitive deficits are amongst the most frequently reported symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Normal executive function depends on connectivity between the ventral hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), yet abnormalities in this circuit and how such changes lead to cognitive dysfunction in AD have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that 6-month-old male 3xTg AD mice display maladaptive decision-making in the rodent 4-Choice Gambling Task measure of executive function. Extracellular field recordings in the infralimbic cortex of age-matched 3xTg mice show layer-specific reductions in response amplitude and paired-pulse ratio compared to controls following activation of hippocampal input fibres, indicating changes to short-term hippocampal-prefrontal synaptic plasticity. These results therefore reveal a pre-clinical deficit in executive function that correlates with mPFC synaptic plasticity deficits in a mouse model for AD.

AB  - Williams syndrome (WS) and Down syndrome (DS) are two neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct genetic origins characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability. Individuals with WS or DS exhibit impaired hippocampus-dependent place learning and enhanced striatum-dependent spatial response learning. Here, we used the Weather Prediction Task (WPT), which can be solved using hippocampus- or striatum-dependent learning strategies, to determine whether individuals with WS or DS exhibit similar profiles outside the spatial domain. Only 10% of individuals with WS or DS solved the WPT. We further assessed whether a concurrent memory task could promote reliance on procedural learning to solve the WPT in individuals with WS but found that the concurrent task did not improve performance. To understand how the probabilistic cue-outcome associations influences WPT performance, and whether individuals with WS or DS can ignore distractors, we assessed performance using a visual learning task with differing reward contingencies, and a modified WPT with unpredictive cues. Both probabilistic feedback and distractors negatively impacted the performance of individuals with WS or DS. These findings are consistent with deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and executive functions, and reveal the importance of congruent feedback and the minimization of distractors to optimize learning in these two populations.

AB  - The interaction between plants and phytophagous arthropods encompasses a complex network of molecules, signals, and pathways to overcome defences generated by each interacting organism. Although most of the elements and modulators involved in this interplay are still unidentified, plant redox homeostasis and signalling are essential for the establishment of defence responses. Here, focusing on the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, we demonstrate the involvement in plant defence of the thioredoxin TRXh5, a small redox protein whose expression is induced by mite infestation. TRXh5 is localized in the cell membrane system and cytoplasm and is associated with alterations in the content of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Protein S-nitrosylation signal in TRXh5 over-expression lines is decreased and alteration in TRXh5 level produces changes in the JA/SA hormonal crosstalk of infested plants. Moreover, TRXh5 interacts and likely regulates the redox state of an uncharacterized receptor-like kinase, named THIOREDOXIN INTERACTING RECEPTOR KINASE (TIRK), also induced by mite herbivory. Feeding bioassays performed withTRXh5 over-expression plants result in lower leaf damage and reduced egg accumulation after T. urticae infestation than in wild-type (WT) plants. In contrast, mites cause a more severe injury in trxh5 mutant lines where a greater number of eggs accumulates. Likewise, analysis of TIRK- gain and-loss-of-function lines demonstrate the defence role of this receptor in Arabidopsis against T. urticae. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the interaction between TRXh5 and TIRK and highlight the importance of TRXh5 and TIRK in the establishment of effective Arabidopsis defences against spider mite herbivory.

AB  - We have previously shown that maternal endotoxin exposure leads to a phenotype of cerebral palsy and pro-inflammatory microglia in the brain in neonatal rabbits. 'Activated' microglia overexpress the enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) that hydrolyzes N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) to N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate, and we have shown previously that inhibiting microglial GCPII is neuroprotective. Glutamate-induced injury and associated immune signaling can alter microglial responses including microglial process movements for surveillance and phagocytosis. We hypothesize that inhibition of GCPII activity could alter microglial phenotype and normalize microglial processes movement/dynamics. Newborn rabbit kits exposed to endotoxin in utero, when treated with dendrimer conjugated 2-PMPA (D-2PMPA), a potent and selective inhibitor of microglial GCPII, showed profound changes in microglial phenotype within 48-hour of treatment. Live imaging of hippocampal microglia in ex-vivo brain slice preparations revealed larger cell body and phagocytic cup sizes with less stable microglia processes in CP kits compared to healthy controls. D-2PMPA treatment led to significant reversal of microglial process stability to healthy control levels. Our results emphasize the importance of microglial process dynamics in determining the state of microglial function in the developing brain and demonstrate how GCPII inhibition specifically in microglia can effectively change the microglial process motility to healthy control levels potentially impacting migration, phagocytosis, and inflammatory functions.

AB  - Zebrafish have revolutionised physiological screening in vertebrates, however, their strong sociality present challenges for interpreting behavioural assays conducted on individual subjects. To retain the advantages of the zebrafish model while addressing its limitations, we propose the use of a solitary species-the paradise fish-as a complementary model system. We compared paradise fish and zebrafish of late larval stage in social and non-social exploratory tasks, anxiety tests and in a working memory assay to assess their performance in these individual-based challenges. We found that in contrast to zebrafish, paradise fish did not show social approach in sociability tests, their exploratory behaviour was unaffected by the presence of a conspecific, and social isolation did not impair their performance during anxiety tests. Intra- and intertest variability measures of different anxiety tests revealed that, compared to zebrafish, paradise fish express more consistent, repeatable patterns of exploratory and risk-avoidance behaviour across time and contexts. We also showed that paradise fish exploration of the Y-maze is dominated by arm alternations, suggesting advanced working memory. Considering the results of this systematic comparison and the natural history of the two species we recommend prioritizing zebrafish in social tasks, while favouring paradise fish in individual-based behavioural assays.

AB  - Background. The present study is aimed at evaluating the functional and clinical values of P3H4 in lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, we also investigated the downstream pathways that P3H4 might participate in. Methods. The differential expression analysis was used to identify genes differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues as compared with normal tissues. Survival analysis was used to test the association between P3H4 and survival time. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to explore the downstream pathways. CCK8 and transwell were employed to examine the impact of P3H4 on cell phenotypes. Results. P3H4 was highly upregulated in LUAD tissues at both RNA and protein levels. Moreover, the LUAD patients, who had high expression of P3H4, were also observed to have shorter disease-free survival and overall survival. These results demonstrated that P3H4 could be used as a prognostic biomarker for LUAD. Moreover, we also found that it was the copy number alterations (CNAs), not DNA methylation, that regulated the RNA expression of P3H4, indicating that its upregulation might be partially resulted from the CNAs. Furthermore, functional experiments revealed that the A549 and H1299 cells with siRNA treatment (siP3H4) exhibited significantly decreased cell proliferation after 24 hours, migratory ability, and invasiveness. Functionally, the upregulated proteins in the P3H4 high expression group were mainly enriched in tumor microenvironment-related pathways such as phagosome, focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction and cancer-related pathways such as bladder cancer pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, and hippo signaling pathway. Conclusion. The present study systematically evaluated the functional and clinical values of P3H4 in LUAD, and explored the related biological pathways. P3H4 might promote LUAD progression through regulating tumor microenvironment-related pathways.

AB  - The action of Corepressor for Element Silencing Transcription Factor 1 (CoREST) is primarily related to neural fate decisions. However, the molecular mechanisms linking neuroinflammation to the histone modifying complex remain unclear. CoREST is a hub for several cofactors that play important roles in epigenetic remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It allows us to question their functions during the inflammatory response in the Central Nervous System. The impact of LPS-induced neuroinflammation on the transcriptional epigenetic control of members with CoRest repressive complex in the hippocampus was investigated. Characterizing the basal transcriptional profile in the hippocampus of members with CoREST repressive complex showed that the Rcor3 is the most expressed gene, and the Rcor2 is the least expressed one. It was also demonstrated that the levels of Lsd1, CoREST1 (Rcor1), and CoREST2 (Rcor2) transcripts increased in the hippocampus after LPS i.p. administration, while for CoREST3 (Rcor3), no significant difference was observed. A significant increase was noticed in the percentages of the 5-meC mark (Hypermethylation) for the Rcor1 and Lsd1 genes with a positive Pearson correlation between methylation and expression. However, the correlation was directly proportional, ruling out DNA methylation as the main mechanism in transcriptional control.

AB  - Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is used among pregnant women. However, the question of its safety during pregnancy remains unclear. The use of these products relies on history of use data but there are specific toxicities like developmental neurotoxicity that are clearly understudied. Here we use the zebfrafish embryo develop-mental toxicity assay (ZEDTA) in combination with two behavioral assays: touch-evoked response and Light/ Dark (L/D) transition assay to evaluate the neuro/developmental toxicity of three herbal products commonly used in CHM [Chinese name (abbreviation; part of the plant and Scientific name]: tian ma (TM; tuber form Gastrodia elata Blume), lei gong teng (LGT; root and rhizome of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f) and cha ye (green tea, leaves from Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze). In case significant alterations were detected, single components with potential exposure during pregnancy were identified in the literature and further tested. TM had no neurodevelopmental toxic potential in zebrafish embryos, while LGT and its main compounds triptolide and celastrol induced significant alterations in behavior. Developmental exposure to EGCG, the main catechin of green tea, also produced significant alterations in zebrafish embryos behavior after developmental exposure. A combination of ZEDTA with L/D Transition assay is proposed as a useful combination of alternative methods for DNT assessment of CHM products together with other New Approach Methodologies (NAMs).

AB  - Growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a), also known as the ghrelin receptor, is an important nutrient sensor and metabolic regulator in both humans and rodents. Increased GHS-R1a expression is observed in the hippocampus of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and AD model mice. However, the causal relationship between GHS-R1a elevation in the hippocampus and AD memory deficits remains uncertain. Here, we find that increasing GHS-R1a expression in dCA1 pyramidal neurons impairs hippocampus-dependent memory formation, which is abolished by local administration of the endogenous antagonist LEAP2. GHS-R1a elevation in dCA1 pyramidal neurons suppresses excitability and blocks memory allocation in these neurons. Chemogenetic activation of those high GHS-R1a neurons during training rescues GHS-R1a overexpression-induced memory impairment. Moreover, we demonstrate that increasing GHS-R1a expression in dCA1 pyramidal neurons hampers these neurons' ability to encode spatial memory and reduces engram size in the dCA1 region. Finally, we show that GHS-R1a deletion mitigates spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice with increased GHS-R1a expression in the hippocampus. Our findings reveal a negative, causal relationship between hippocampal GHS-R1a expression and memory encoding, and suggest that blocking the abnormal increase in GHS-R1a activity/expression may be a promising approach to improve memory and treat cognitive decline in AD.
   Mechanistic modeling reveals that increased GHS-R1a expression in hippocampal neurons impairs memory formation, suggesting that targeting GHS-R1a activity could improve memory and mitigate cognitive decline in AD.

AB  - Acute stress response triggers various physiological responses such as energy mobilization to meet metabolic demands. However, the underlying molecular changes in the brain remain largely obscure. Here, we used a brief water avoidance stress (WAS) to elicit an acute stress response in mice. By employing RNA-sequencing and metabolomics profiling, we investigated the acute stress-induced molecular changes in the mouse whole brain. The aberrant expression of 60 genes was detected in the brain tissues of WAS-exposed mice. Functional analyses showed that the aberrantly expressed genes were enriched in various processes such as superoxide metabolism. In our global metabolomic profiling, a total of 43 brain metabolites were significantly altered by acute WAS. Metabolic pathways upregulated from WAS-exposed brain tissues relative to control samples included lipolysis, eicosanoid biosynthesis, and endocannabinoid synthesis. Acute WAS also elevated the levels of branched-chain amino acids, 5-aminovalerates, 4-hydroxy-nonenal-glutathione as well as mannose, suggesting complex metabolic changes in the brain. The observed molecular events in the present study provide a valuable resource that can help us better understand how acute psychological stress impacts neural functions.

AB  - Social memory dysfunction is an especially devastating symptom of many neuropsychiatric disorders, which makes understanding the cellular and molecular processes that contribute to such abnormalities important. Evidence suggests that the hippocampus, particularly the CA2 region, plays an important role in social memory. We sought to identify potential mechanisms of social memory dysfunction in the hippocampus by investigating features of neurons, glia, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) of BTBR mice, an inbred mouse strain with deficient social memory. The CA2 is known to receive inputs from dentate gyrus adult-born granule cells (abGCs), neurons known to participate in social memory, so we examined this cell population and found fewer abGCs, as well as fewer axons from abGCs in the CA2 of BTBR mice compared to controls. We also found that BTBR mice had fewer pyramidal cell dendritic spines, in addition to fewer microglia and astrocytes, in the CA2 compared to controls. Along with diminished neuronal and glial elements, we found atypical perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized ECM structures that regulate plasticity, in the CA2 of BTBR mice. By diminishing PNNs in the CA2 of BTBR mice to control levels, we observed a partial restoration of social memory. Our findings suggest that the CA2 region of BTBR mice exhibits multiple cellular and extracellular abnormalities and identify atypical PNNs as one mechanism producing social memory dysfunction, although the contribution of reduced abGC afferents, pyramidal cell dendritic spine, and glial cell numbers remains unexplored.

AB  - The variability of severity in hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced brain injury among research subjects is a major challenge in developmental brain injury research. Our laboratory developed a novel injury scoring tool based on our gross pathological observations during hippocampal extraction. The hippocampi received scores of 0-6 with 0 being no injury and 6 being severe injury post-HI. The hippocampi exposed to sham surgery were grouped as having no injury. We have validated the injury scoring tool with T2-weighted MRI analysis of percent hippocampal/hemispheric tissue loss and cell survival/death markers after exposing the neonatal mice to Vannucci's rodent model of neonatal HI. In addition, we have isolated hippocampal nuclei and quantified the percent good quality nuclei to provide an example of utilization of our novel injury scoring tool. Our novel injury scores correlated significantly with percent hippocampal and hemispheric tissue loss, cell survival/death markers, and percent good quality nuclei. Caspase-3 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) have been implicated in different cell death pathways in response to neonatal HI. Another gene, sirtuin1 (SIRT1), has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic properties. To assess the correlation between the severity of injury and genes involved in cell survival/death, we analyzed caspase-3, PARP1, and SIRT1 mRNA expressions in hippocampi 3 days post-HI and sham surgery, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The ipsilateral (IL) hippocampal caspase-3 and SIRT1 mRNA expressions post-HI were significantly higher than sham IL hippocampi and positively correlated with the novel injury scores in both males and females. We detected a statistically significant sex difference in IL hippocampal caspase-3 mRNA expression with comparable injury scores between males and females with higher expression in females.

AB  - Multiple studies have shown that clinical events resulting into neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, such as asthma in early life and food allergy, were associated with brain damage and that the neuroinflammation induced by them might lead to cognitive impairments, anxiety-/depressive-like behaviors. IL-4 is the most major elevated cytokine in periphery when these clinical events occur and peripheral IL-4 level positively correlates with the severity of those events. Our previous studies have verified that neonatal IL-4 over-exposure induced a delayed neuroinflammatory damage in rodents, which might have adverse implications for brain development and cognition. Neuroinflammation in brain parenchyma is often accompanied by changes in CSF cytokines levels. However, whether the cytokines levels in CSF change after neonatal IL-4 over-exposure is unknown. Here, we found a delayed pro-inflammatory cytokines response (higher IL-6, IL-1 beta and, TNF levels) in both hippocampus and CSF after an instant anti-inflammatory cytokine response in IL-4 over-exposed rats. Moreover, the pro-inflammatory cytokines response appeared earlier in CSF than in hippocampus. The level of each of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in CSF positively correlated with that in hippocampus at the age of postnatal day 42. More microglia numbers/activation and higher M-CSF level in the hippocampus in IL-4 over-exposed rats were also observed. Furthermore, there were more macrophages with inflammatory activation in dural mater of IL-4 over-exposed rats. In sum, neonatal IL-4 over-exposure in rats induces delayed inflammation in CSF, suggesting CSF examination may serve as a potential method in predicting delayed neuroinflammation in brain following neonatal IL-4 over-exposure.

AB  - We used nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (NMR) to evaluate the metabolomics of heparinized whole blood drawn from six African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) maintained on a well characterized diet. Whole blood samples obtained under behavioral restraint, then quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, were stored at -80 degrees C until analysis. Frozen samples were thawed under controlled conditions and extracted with methanol and chloroform to separate the polar and non-polar metabolites. We identified 18 polar metabolites and 14 non-polar lipids using one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra. Despite unexpected rouleaux formation in the thawed frozen samples, spectra were consistent among animals and did not vary dramatically with age or the sex of the animal.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is associated with several neurodegenerative factors, which are exacerbated further during reperfusion. Increased iron storage in the brain also contributes to stroke progression and worsens the outcome with the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation. Further, several clinical studies have demonstrated that disease susceptibility, response to infection and inflammation, worsen with increased iron levels. So, in the present study, the iron levels were assessed using atomic absorption spectroscopy and Prussian blue staining in the brain and retina of the rats post ischemic insult. The retinal alterations were also assessed as retina is a projection of the CNS. The expressions of the regulatory genes of iron homeostasis were estimated in the cerebrum. In addition to it, the BBB disruption due to iron overload and oxidative stress, were measured. The iron levels were found to be significantly higher in the cortical and hippocampal regions leading to the appearance of iron deposits and cellular damage in retina post ischemic injury. In the current study the protective role of apocynin, a NADPH oxidase assembly inhibitor, was assessed against the alterations induced by disturbed iron homeostasis post cerebral ischemia. Apocynin supplementation was able to maintain the iron homeostasis in the brains of ischemic rats through the normalization of the gene expressions of regulatory genes and restoration of the BBB integrity. The decline in the iron levels in the brain after apocynin supplementation also prevented the appearance of iron deposits and cellular damage in the retina during the states of cerebral ischemia.

AB  - The morula-to-blastocyst transition (MBT) culminates with formation of inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) lineages. Recent studies identified signaling pathways driving lineage specification, but some features of these pathways display significant species divergence. To better understand evolutionary conservation of the MBT, we completed a meta-analysis of RNA sequencing data from five model species and ICMTE differences from four species. Although many genes change in expression during the MBT within any given species, the number of shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is comparatively small, and the number of shared ICMTE DEGs is even smaller. DEGs related to known lineage determining pathways (e.g., POU5F1) are seen, but the most prominent pathways and functions associated with shared DEGs or shared across individual species DEG lists impact basic physiological and metabolic activities, such as TCA cycle, unfolded protein response, oxidative phosphorylation, sirtuin signaling, mitotic roles of polo-like kinases, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress, estrogen receptor signaling, apoptosis, necrosis, lipid and fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, endocytosis, AMPK signaling, homeostasis, transcription, and cell death. We also observed prominent differences in transcriptome regulation between ungulates and nonungulates, particularly for ICM- and TE-enhanced mRNAs. These results extend our understanding of shared mechanisms of the MBT and formation of the ICM and TE and should better inform the selection of model species for particular applications.

AB  - Familial British dementia and familial Danish dementia are neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in the gene integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2b) encoding BRI2, which tunes excitatory synaptic transmission at both presynaptic and postsynaptic termini. In addition, BRI2 interacts with and modulates proteolytic processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), whose mutations cause familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (familial AD). To study the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by the Danish mutation, we generated rats carrying the Danish mutation in the rat Itm2b gene (Itm2b(D) rats). Given the BRI2/APP interaction and the widely accepted relevance of human amyloid beta (A beta), a proteolytic product of APP, to AD, Itm2b(D) rats were engineered to express two humanized App alleles and produce human A beta. Here, we studied young Itm2b(D) rats to investigate early pathogenic changes in these diseases. We found that periadolescent Itm2b(D) rats not only present subtle changes in human A beta levels along with decreased spontaneous glutamate release and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepro pionic acid receptor-mediated responses but also had increased short-term synaptic facilitation in the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway. These alterations in excitatory interneuronal communication can impair learning and memory processes and were akin to those observed in adult mice producing rodent A beta and carrying either the Danish or British mutations in the mouse Itm2b gene. Collectively, the data show that the pathogenic Danish mutation alters the physiological function of BRI2 at glutamatergic synapses across species and early in life. Future studies will determine whether this phenomenon represents an early pathogenic event in human dementia.

AB  - About 40-50% of perishableproducts such as fruitsand vegetablesare wasted without consumption owing to the short shelf life and uncontrolledstorage and transportation conditions. To address this issue, conventionalmethods including refrigeration, irradiation, controlled atmospherestorage, and surface coatings are often harnessed. However, thesemethods will probably change both the appearance and flavor of foodor give rise to potential safety concerns and health risks. In thiswork, we have successfully fabricated plant oil-based polymer-coatedfilms as passively modified packaging for the preservation of perishableproducts. Two Camellia oil-based monomers with N-methyl and amide groups were polymerized to produce variousplant oil-based polymers. The obtained plant oil-based polymers presentdistinct capacity for the formation of hydrogen bonding, leading totunable gas permeability and selectivity for the films coated withplant oil-based coatings. Good appearance, low water loss, high firmness,and total soluble solid contents were observed for the perishablefood when sealed with the plant oil-based polymer-coated films. Thismethod is universal and applicable to different fruits and vegetableseither nonclimacteric or climacteric such as cherries, waxberries,tomatoes, and cucumbers. Therefore, passively modified atmospherepackaging films by coating plant oil-based polymers to modulate theCO(2)/O-2 selectivity are a safe and efficientcandidate for the preservation of perishable food.

AB  - The mechanism ofthe negative impact of corticosteroidson theinduction and progress of mental illness remains unclear. In thiswork, we studied the effects of corticosteroids on the activity ofneuronal glycine receptors (GlyR) and GABA-A receptors (GABA(A)R) by measuring the chloride current induced by the application ofGABA (2 or 5 & mu;M) to isolated cerebellar Purkinje cells (I (GABA)) and by the application of glycine (100 & mu;M) to pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus (I (Gly)). It was found that corticosterone, 5 & alpha;-dihydrodeoxycorticosterone,allotetrahydrocorticosterone, cortisol, and 17 & alpha;,21-dihydroxypregnenolonewere able to accelerate the desensitization of the I (Gly) at physiological concentrations (IC50 valuesvarying from 0.39 to 0.72 & mu;M). Next, cortisone, 11-deoxycortisol,11-deoxycorticosterone, 5 & beta;-dihydrodeoxycorticosterone, and tetrahydrocorticosteroneaccelerated the desensitization of I (Gly) with IC50 values varying from 10.3 to 15.2 & mu;M.Allotetrahydrocorticosterone and tetrahydrocorticosterone potentiatedthe I (GABA) albeit with high EC50 values (18-23 & mu;M). The rest of the steroids had noeffect on I (GABA) in the range of concentrationsof 1-100 & mu;M. Finally, our study has suggested a structuralrelationship of the 3 & beta;-hydroxyl group/3-oxo group with the selectivemodulatory activity on GlyRs in contrast to the 3 & alpha;-hydroxylgroup that is pivotal for GABA(A)Rs. In summary, our resultssuggest that increased GlyR desensitization by corticosteroids maycontribute to brain dysfunction under chronic stress and identifycorticosteroids for further development as selective modulators ofGlyRs.

AB  - Sustained microglial activation and increased pro-inflammatory signalling cause chronic inflammation and neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Resolution of inflammation follows neutralization of pathogens and is a response to limit damage and promote healing, mediated by pro-resolving lipid mediators (LMs). Since resolution is impaired in AD brains, we decided to test if intranasal administration of pro-resolving LMs in the App(NL-G-F/NL-G-F) mouse model for AD could resolve inflammation and ameliorate pathology in the brain. A mixture of the pro-resolving LMs resolvin (Rv) E1, RvD1, RvD2, maresin 1 (MaR1) and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) was administered to stimulate their respective receptors. We examined amyloid load, cognition, neuronal network oscillations, glial activation and inflammatory factors. The treatment ameliorated memory deficits accompanied by a restoration of gamma oscillation deficits, together with a dramatic decrease in microglial activation. These findings open potential avenues for therapeutic exploration of pro-resolving LMs in AD, using a non-invasive route.
   Intranasal administration of pro-resolving lipid mediators improves memory deficits and reduce microglial activation in a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a future therapy.

AB  - Background WD40 transcription factors are crucial in plant growth and developmental, significantly impacting plant growth regulation. This study investigates the WD40 transcription factor HmWDR68's role in developing the distinctive blue infertile flower colors in Hydrangea macrophylla 'Forever Summer'. Methods and results The HmWDR68 gene was isolated by PCR, revealing an open reading frame of 1026 base pairs, which encodes 341 amino acids. Characterized by four WD40 motifs, HmWDR68 is a member of the WD40 family. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that HmWDR68 shares high homology with PsWD40 in Camellia sinensis and CsWD40 in Paeonia suffruticosa, both of which are integral in anthocyanin synthesis regulation. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that HmWDR68 expression in the blue infertile flowers of 'Forever Summer' hydrangea was significantly higher compared to other tissues and organs. Additionally, in various hydrangea varieties with differently colored infertile flowers, HmWDR68 expression was markedly elevated in comparison to other hydrangea varieties, correlating with the development of blue infertile flowers. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant association between HmWDR68 expression and the concentration of delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, as well as key genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis (HmF3H, HmC3'5'H, HmDFR, and HmANS) in the blue infertile flowers of 'Forever Summer' hydrangea (P < 0.01). Conclusion These findings suggest HmWDR68 may specifically regulate blue infertile flower formation in hydrangea by enhancing delphinidin-3-O-glucoside synthesis, modulating expression of HmF3H, HmC3'5'H, HmDFR and HmANS. This study provides insights into HmWDR68's role in hydrangea's blue flowers development, offering a foundation for further research in this field.

AB  - Herbivores have evolved the ability to detoxify feed components through different mechanisms. The oligophagous silkworm feeds on Cudrania tricuspidata leaves (CTLs) instead of mulberry leaves for the purpose of producing special, high-quality silk. However, CTL-fed silkworms are found to have smaller bodies, slower growth and lower silk production than those fed mulberry leaves. Here, we show that the high content of prenylated isoflavones (PIFs) that occurred in CTLs is converted into glycosylated derivatives (GPIFs) in silkworm faeces through the silkworm gut microbiota, and this biotransformation is the key process in PIFs detoxification because GPIFs are found to be much less toxic, as revealed both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, adding Bacillus subtilis as a probiotic to remodel the gut microbiota could beneficially promote silkworm growth and development. Consequently, this study provides meaningful guidance for silk production by improving the adaptability of CTL-fed silkworms.
   The silkworm (Bombyx mori) gut microbiome can impact its ability to metabolize and tolerate prenylated isoflavone toxins from plant leaves, providing further insight into how the gut microbiota promotes silkworm growth and development.

AB  - Background: Cold stress usually occurs in winter and is one of the most significant environmental factors restricting the growth of the tea plant as well as its geographical distribution. Objective: It is necessary to identify the physiological and molecular mechanisms of plants under cold stress so that cold-tolerant crop varieties can be cultivated to limit production losses. At the same time, this would allow the crop planting area to be expanded, hence improving the economic benefits. Methods: In this study, the transcriptome data of Yunwu Tribute Tea under cold conditions were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq platform. By analyzing changes in transcriptome data associated with the antioxidant enzyme system, plant hormone signal transduction, proline and tyrosine metabolism pathways, and transcription factors, the molecular mechanisms involved in Yunwu Tribute Tea under cold stress were investigated. Results: In this study, Illumina HiSeq technology was applied to investigate the cold-tolerance mechanism. For this purpose, cDNA libraries were obtained from two groups of samples, namely the cold-treated group (DW) and the control group (CK). A total of 185,973 unigenes were produced from 511,987 assembled transcripts; among these, 16,020 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (corrected p-value < 0.01, |log2(fold change)| >3), including 9606 up-regulated and 6414 down-regulated genes, were obtained. Moreover, the antioxidant enzyme system, plant hormone signal transduction, proline and tyrosine metabolism pathways, and transcription factors were analyzed; based on these results, a series of candidate genes related to cold stress were screened out and discussed. The physiological indexes related to the low-temperature response were tested, along with five DEGs which were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Conclusions: Differential gene expression analysis has confirmed that substantial cold-responsive genes are related to the antioxidant enzyme system, plant hormone signal transduction, proline metabolism pathway, tyrosine metabolism pathway, and transcription factors.

AB  - BDNF plays a pivotal role in neuroplasticity events, vulnerability and resilience to stress-related disorders, being decreased in depressive patients and increased after antidepressant treatment. BDNF was found to be reduced in patients carrying the human polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter region (5-HTTLPR). The serotonin knockout rat (SERT-/-) is one of the animal models used to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of depression in humans. They present decreased BDNF levels, and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. To investigate whether upregulating BDNF would ameliorate the phenotype of SERT-/- rats, we overexpressed BDNF locally into the ventral hippocampus and submitted the animals to behavioral testing. The results showed that BDNF overexpression in the vHIP of SERT-/- rats promoted higher sucrose preference and sucrose intake; on the first day of the sucrose consumption test it decreased immobility time in the forced swim test and increased the time spent in the center of a novel environment. Furthermore, BDNF overexpression altered social behavior in SERT-/- rats, which presented increased passive contact with test partner and decreased solitary behavior. Finally, it promoted decrease in plasma corticosterone levels 60 min after restraint stress. In conclusion, modulation of BDNF IV levels in the vHIP of SERT-/- rats led to a positive behavioral outcome placing BDNF upregulation in the vHIP as a potential target to new therapeutic approaches to improve depressive symptoms.

AB  - Age is a critical determinant of arterial disease, including aneurysm formation. Here, to understand the impact of aging on the arterial transcriptome, we leveraged RNA-sequencing data to define transcripts that change with advancing age in human arteries. Among the most repressed transcripts in aged individuals were those that are relevant for actomyosin structure and organization, including both myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) and smooth muscle g-actin (ACTG2). This was associated with a reduction of serum response factor (SRF), which controls these transcripts via defined promoter elements. To determine the consequences of isolated Srf depletion, we conditionally deleted Srf in vascular smooth muscle of young mice (i8-SRF-KO mice). This led to a reduction of the SRF regulon, including Mylk and Actg2, and impaired arterial contractility, but left endothelial-dependent dilatation unaffected. Srf-depletion also increased aortic diameter and Alcian blue staining of the aortic media, which are cardinal features of aortopathy, such as aortic aneurysmal disease. Despite this, i8SRF-KO mice were protected from aortic lesions elicited by angiotensin II (AngII). Proteomics demonstrated that Srfdepletion mimicked a protein signature of AngII treatment involving increases of the mechanoresponsive transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ and reduction of the Hippo kinase Lats2. Protection from aortopathy could be overcome by changing the order of KO induction and AngII administration resulting in advanced aneurysms in both i8-SRF-KO and control mice. Our work provides important insights into the molecular underpinnings of age-dependent changes in aortic function and mechanisms of adaptation in hypertension.

AB  - Background Arnica montana and Bellis perennis are two medicinal plants that are thought to accelerate bone repair in homoeopathic literature. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells with the ability to differentiate and regenerate bone or osteogenesis. Hence, we aimed to determine the role of Arnica montana and Bellis perennis on the osteogenic differentiation of the C3H10T1/2 stem cell line. Methods and Results The cell proliferation of Arnica montana and Bellis perennis was evaluated by MTT assay. Osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 was induced by the addition of beta-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid and dexamethasone in the differentiation medium over 3 weeks. Cells were treated with Arnica montana and Bellis perennis individually as well as in combination. The osteogenic differentiation potential of Arnica montana and Bellis perennis to differentiate C3H10T1/2 into osteoblasts was measured by alkaline phosphatase activity, alizarin red staining and the expression of Osteocalcin using immunostaining and qRT-PCR.<br /> Arnica montana and Bellis perennis could enhance C3H10T1/2 cell proliferation at 1600 mu g. Further, the compound showed the ability to augment osteogenesis as confirmed by increased expression of alkaline phosphatase and enhanced calcium accumulation as seen by the Alizarin Red staining and quantification. Enhanced osteogenesis was further supported by the increased expression of osteocalcin in the treated cells with individual and combined doses of Arnica montana and Bellis perennis. Therefore, the findings provide additional support for the positive impact of Arnica montana and Bellis perennis on bone formation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that homoeopathic compounds Arnica montana and Bellis perennis can augment osteogenesis individually as well as in combination.

AB  - The impact of physiological stress on the metabolome of breast muscle, liver, kidney, and hippocampus was investigated in Ross 308 broiler chicks. Simulated on-farm stressors were compared to a corticosterone model of physiological stress. The three different stressors investigated were: (i) corticosterone at a dose of 15 mg/kg of feed; (ii) heat treatment of 36 degrees C and 40% RH for 8 h per day; and (iii) isolation for 1 h per day. Liver, kidney, breast muscle, and hippocampus samples were taken after 2, 4, 6, and 8 days of stress treatment, and subjected to untargeted H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolomic analysis to provide insights on how stress can modulate metabolite profiles and biomarker discovery. Many of the metabolites that were significantly altered in tissues were amino acids, with glycine and alanine showing promise as candidate biomarkers of stress. Corticosterone was shown to significantly alter alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism in the liver, breast, and hippocampus, while isolation altered the same pathways, but only in the kidneys and hippocampus. Isolation also significantly altered the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathway in the liver and breast, while the same pathway was significantly altered by heat in the liver, kidneys, and hippocampus. The study's findings support corticosterone as a model of stress. Moreover, a number of potential metabolite biomarkers were identified in chicken tissues, which may allow producers to effectively monitor stress and to objectively develop and evaluate on-farm mitigations, including practices that reduce stress and enhance bird health.

AB  - Natto is a traditional fermented soybean-based food that has been an integral part of Japanese cuisine for several centuries. Although there have been extensive studies on the cognitive benefits of soybeans, only limited studies have examined the effects of natto on cognitive function. This study investigated the potential cognitive benefits of natto in senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. After 12 weeks of oral administering natto fermented for 18 h, the spatial learning and memory performance were improved compared with those in SAMP8 control mice. Furthermore, activation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) cascade was observed in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice that were fed natto. Additionally, natto administration upregulated trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) as a modulator of NMDAR. These findings suggest that natto ameliorates cognitive decline by activating the TAAR1-mediated CaMKII/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice.

AB  - Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a risk factor for the outbreak of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we isolated Lactobacillus plantarum NK151 and Bifidobacterium longum NK173 from a human fecal bacteria collection, which inhibited Escherichia coli LPS production, and examined their effects on the Escherichia coli K1- or LPS-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Oral gavage of NK151, NK173, or their (4 : 1) mixture (NKm) significantly alleviated Escherichia coli K1-induced cognitive impairment-like behaviors in the Y-maze and novel object recognition tasks. Their treatments decreased IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression and NF-kappa B+/Iba1(+) and LPS+/Iba1(+) cell populations in the hippocampus, while the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)(+)/neuronal nuclei (NeuN)(+) cell population and BDNF to proBNDF expression increased. They suppressed LPS-induced cognition impairment-like behaviors and neuroinflammation marker levels in the hippocampus. Treatment with them reduced Escherichia coli K1- or LPS-induced LPS and apolipoprotein E levels in the blood and inflammatory marker levels in the colon. Furthermore, treatment with them modulated fecal Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia populations. Of these gut bacteria, Bacteroidaceae, Odoribacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Rikenellaceae, Helicobacteraceae, and Deferribacteraceae are correlated with cognitive function and blood and fecal LPS levels. These findings suggest that NK151 and NK173 may alleviate cognitive impairment with colitis by upregulating NF-kappa B-mediated BDNF expression through the suppression of fecal and blood bacterial LPS levels.

AB  - Probiotic supplements are potential therapeutic agents for age-related cognitive deficits. A prior study showed that probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei PS23 (PS23) supplementation delayed age-related cognitive decline in mice. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of live or heat-killed PS23 (HK-PS23) on cognitive function in d-galactose (d-gal)-induced aging mice and explore the underlying mechanisms. We designed four groups of mice: control, d-gal aging mice, and PS23 supplemented and HK-PS23 supplemented d-gal aging mice. We evaluated memory function and anxiety using Morris water maze and open field tests, respectively. Neural monoamines and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the hippocampus were evaluated. RNA-seq was used to evaluate hippocampal gene expression profiles in each group, and the composition of the gut microbiota was analyzed. We revealed that PS23 and HK-PS23 supplementation ameliorated d-gal-induced memory deficits and improved motor and anxiety-behaviors in aging mice. In the hippocampus, serotonin levels (5-HT) were increased and the genes involved in neuroplasticity, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant functions were upregulated in PS23 and HK-PS23 supplemented groups. The gut microbiota showed specific changes. Our results suggest that PS23 and HK-PS23 supplements could ameliorate age-related cognitive decline, possibly by upregulating the genes involved in synaptic plasticity and preventing oxidation and inflammation.

AB  - The free fatty acid FFA3 receptor (FFA3R) belongs to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In the intestine and adipose tissue, it is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism, but its function in the brain is unknown. We aimed, first, to investigate the expression of the receptor in the hippocampus of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients at different stages of the disease and, second, to assess whether genetic inactivation of the Ffar3 gene could affect the phenotypic features of the APP(swe) mouse model. The expression of transcripts for FFA receptors in postmortem human hippocampal samples and in the hippocampus of wild-type and transgenic mice was analyzed by RT-qPCR. We generated a double transgenic mouse, FFA3R(-/-)/APP(swe), to perform cognition studies and to assess, by immunoblotting A beta and tau pathologies and the differential expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins. For the first time, the occurrence of the FFA3R in the human hippocampus and its overexpression, even in the first stages of AD, was demonstrated. Remarkably, FFA3R(-/-)/APP(swe) mice do not have the characteristic memory impairment of 12-month-old APP(swe) mice. Additionally, this newly generated transgenic line does not develop the most important Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related features, such as amyloid beta (A beta) brain accumulations and tau hyperphosphorylation. These findings are accompanied by increased levels of the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and lower activity of the tau kinases GSK3 beta and Cdk5. We conclude that the brain FFA3R is involved in cognitive processes and that its inactivation prevents AD-like cognitive decline and pathological hallmarks.

AB  - The disruption of iron homeostasis is an important factor in the loss of mitochondrial function in neural cells, leading to neurodegeneration. Here, we assessed the protective action of gossypitrin (Gos), a naturally occurring flavonoid, on iron-induced neuronal cell damage using mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells and mitochondria isolated from rat brains. Gos was able to rescue HT22 cells from the damage induced by 100 mu M Fe(II)-citrate (EC50 8.6 mu M). This protection was linked to the prevention of both iron-induced mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation and ATP depletion. In isolated mitochondria, Gos (50 mu M) elicited an almost complete protection against iron-induced mitochondrial swelling, the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and ATP depletion. Gos also prevented Fe(II)-citrate-induced mitochondrial lipid peroxidation with an IC50 value (12.45 mu M) that was about nine time lower than that for the tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced oxidation. Furthermore, the flavonoid was effective in inhibiting the degradation of both 15 and 1.5 mM 2-deoxyribose. It also decreased Fe(II) concentration with time, while increasing O-2 consumption rate, and impairing the reduction of Fe(III) by ascorbate. Gos-Fe(II) complexes were detected by UV-VIS and IR spectroscopies, with an apparent Gos-iron stoichiometry of 2:1. Results suggest that Gos does not generally act as a classical antioxidant, but it directly affects iron, by maintaining it in its ferric form after stimulating Fe(II) oxidation. Metal ions would therefore be unable to participate in a Fenton-type reaction and the lipid peroxidation propagation phase. Hence, Gos could be used to treat neuronal diseases associated with iron-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage.

AB  - In this work, a decoction (DOe) and a methanolic global extract (MGEOe), obtained with the aerial parts of Oxalis erythrorhiza Gillies ex Hooker et Arnott (Oxalidaceae), were evaluated. The high-resolution liquid chromatography in conjunction with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) analysis showed forty compounds in MGEOe and twenty-nine in DOe, including flavones, C-glycosyl flavones, isoflavones, fatty acids, terpenes, phenolic acids, and sterols. The antioxidant properties were evaluated by DPPH, TEAC, FRAP, and ILP assays. Both DOe and MGEOe showed stronger antioxidant activities. The anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by COX inhibition method, where DOe demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect. The cytotoxic effects were evaluated in the tumoral HCT-116 and non-tumoral HBL-100 cell lines, revealing a selective action from DOe and MGOe on cancer cells. DOe was evaluated in an animal model of insulin resistance, which is characterized by alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as cognitive impairments, including anxiety-like behavior and memory deficits. Male SD rats received sucrose (10% w/v, SUC), a half dilution of DOe (5% w/v) with sucrose (HDOeS) or DOe with sucrose (DOeS) from PND21 to PND61. Then, anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory were assessed using the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM) and the novel object location (NOL) tests, respectively. Serum parameters basal glycemia, total cholesterol (TC) and tryglicerides were measured using commercial kits. The lipid peroxidation was determined in homogenates of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus by TBAR assay. Only HDOeS exhibited lower anxiety-like behavior in OF and improved performance in NOL compared to SUC. Furthermore, DOeS showed reduced serum parameters, while HDOeS presented lower TC levels than SUC. No differences were observed on TBAR assay. The beneficial properties of these preparations could be attributed to the identified metabolites. These findings highlighted O. erythrorhiza as a potential source of compounds to improve human health; however, further research is required to elucidate its mechanisms of action.

AB  - Hippo signaling plays an essential role in the development of numerous tissues. Although it was previously shown that the transcriptional effectors of Hippo signaling Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) can fine-tune the regulation of sex differentiation genes in the testes, the role of Hippo signaling in testis development remains largely unknown. To further explore the role of Hippo signaling in the testes, we conditionally deleted the key Hippo kinases large tumor suppressor homolog kinases 1 and -2 (Lats1 and Lats2, two kinases that antagonize YAP and TAZ transcriptional co-regulatory activity) in the somatic cells of the testes using an Nr5a1-cre strain (Lats1(flox/flox);Lats2(flox/flox);Nr5a1-cre). We report here that early stages of testis somatic cell differentiation were not affected in this model but progressive testis cord dysgenesis was observed starting at gestational day e14.5. Testis cord dysgenesis was further associated with the loss of polarity of the Sertoli cells and the loss of SOX9 expression but not WT1. In parallel with testis cord dysgenesis, a loss of steroidogenic gene expression associated with the appearance of myofibroblast-like cells in the interstitial space was also observed in mutant animals. Furthermore, the loss of YAP phosphorylation, the accumulation of nuclear TAZ (and YAP) in both the Sertoli and interstitial cell populations, and an increase in their transcriptional co-regulatory activity in the testes suggest that the observed phenotype could be attributed at least in part to YAP and TAZ. Taken together, our results suggest that Hippo signaling is required to maintain proper differentiation of testis somatic cells.

AB  - Experimental mouse studies are important to gain a comprehensive, quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the biological factors that modify individual risk of radiation-induced health effects, including age at exposure, dose, dose rate, organ/tissue specificity and genetic factors. In this study, neonatal Ptch1(+/-) mice bred on CD1 and C57Bl/6 background received whole-body irradiation at postnatal day 2. This time point represents a critical phase in the development of the eye lens, cerebellum and dentate gyrus (DG), when they are also particularly susceptible to radiation effects. Irradiation was performed with gamma rays (Co-60) at doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 Gy, delivered at 0.3 Gy/min or 0.063 Gy/min. Wild-type and mutant mice were monitored for survival, lens opacity, medulloblastoma (MB) and neurogenesis defects. We identified an inverse genetic background-driven relationship between the radiosensitivity to induction of lens opacity and MB and that to neurogenesis deficit in Ptch1(+/-) mutants. In fact, high incidence of radiation-induced cataract and MB were observed in Ptch1(+/-)/CD1 mutants that instead showed no consequence of radiation exposure on neurogenesis. On the contrary, no induction of radiogenic cataract and MB was reported in Ptch1(+/-)/C57Bl/6 mice that were instead susceptible to induction of neurogenesis defects. Compared to Ptch1(+/-)/CD1, the cerebellum of Ptch1(+/-)/C57Bl/6 mice showed increased radiosensitivity to apoptosis, suggesting that differences in processing radiation-induced DNA damage may underlie the opposite strain-related radiosensitivity to cancer and non-cancer pathologies. Altogether, our results showed lack of dose-rate-related effects and marked influence of genetic background on the radiosensitivity of Ptch1(+/-), supporting a major contribution of individual sensitivity to radiation risk in the population.

AB  - Photoactive organic semiconductors, such as bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) of donor-acceptor pairs, are promising for building flexible devices for nongenetic and precise optical neuromodulation. However, the full potential of the diverse compositions and functionalities of BHJs has yet to be explored for neuromodulation due to their unsatisfactory interfaces with soft biotissues, which hinder signal transduction, tissue adhesion, and biocompatibility. Here, we address these challenges by introducing an interfacial layer composed of conductive and porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The MOFs layer enhances charge injection capacity at the interface by >400 times and ensures tight and biocompatible junction between BHJs and biological materials. These improvements enable efficient electrical-to-ionic signal transduction for various BHJs, supporting reliable nongenetic modulation of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons under deep-red and near-infrared light. Moreover, flexible devices made from MOFs-modified BHJs allow for the in vivo stimulation of rat sciatic nerves at an ultralow light intensity threshold (0.01 mW mm(-2)), 700 times lower than that required for unmodified devices. This interfacial engineering with porous MOFs can expand the material toolbox of BHJs-based photocapacitors and unlock more functionalities for neuromodulation and prosthetic biointerfaces.

AB  - We studied the neuroprotective properties of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist memantine, in combination with a positive allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptors of Group III, VU 0422288. The treatment was started 48 h after the injection of neurotoxic agent trimethyltin (TMT) at 7.5 mg/kg. Three weeks after TMT injection, functional and morphological changes in a rat hippocampus were evaluated, including the expression level of genes characterizing glutamate transmission and neuroinflammation, animal behavior, and hippocampal cell morphology. Significant neuronal cell death occurred in the CA3 and CA4 regions, and to a lesser extent, in the CA1 and CA2 regions. The death of neurons in the CA1 field was significantly reduced in animals with a combined use of memantine and VU 0422288. In the hippocampus of these animals, the level of expression of genes characterizing glutamatergic synaptic transmission (Grin2b, Gria1, EAAT2) did not differ from the level in control animals, as well as the expression of genes characterizing neuroinflammation (IL1b, TGF beta 1, Aif1, and GFAP). However, the expression of genes characterizing neuroinflammation was markedly increased in the hippocampus of animals treated with memantine or VU 0422288 alone after TMT. The results of immunohistochemical studies confirmed a significant activation of microglia in the hippocampus three weeks after TMT injection. In contrast to the hilus, microglia in the CA1 region had an increase in rod-like cells. Moreover, in the CA1 field of the hippocampus of the animals of the MEM + VU group, the amount of such microglia was close to the control. Thus, the short-term modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission by memantine and subsequent activation of Group III mGluR significantly affected the dynamics of neurodegeneration in the hippocampus.

AB  - Background HECTD3 (HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 3) exerts biological activities in neuroinflammation of distinct diseases, such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis and donations after heart death. However, the effect of HECTD3 on diabetes-associated cognitive decline (DACD) remains unclear. Methods Wild-type or HECTD3-knockout rats were administered with streptozotocin to establish diabetic model. Pathological changes in the hippocampus were assessed by NISSL and haematoxylin and eosin staining. Morris water maze test was used to assess cognitive function. Neuronal survival and inflammation were investigated by immunofluorescence staining and ELISA assay. NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis were assessed by western blot, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays. Results HECTD3 was up-regulated in hippocampus of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and high glucose-induced PC12 cells. Knockout of HECTD3 increased the number of neurons and improved the learning and memory function. Moreover, knockout of HECTD3 promoted in vivo neuronal survival, and reduced levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in the hippocampus. Silencing of HECTD3 increased cell viability, and reduced IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in high glucose-induced PC12 cells. Fluorescence intensities of NLRP3, GSDMD-N and caspase-1 were reduced in HECTD3-knockout diabetic rats, and knockdown of HECTD3 down-regulated protein expression of NLRP3, GSDMD-N, caspase-1, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 in high glucose-induced PC12 cells to suppress the pyroptosis. HECTD3 promoted the stability of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) through up-regulation of c-JUN and phospho (p)-JNK in high glucose-induced PC12 cells. Over-expression of MALT1 attenuated neuroprotective effects of HECTD3 silencing on high glucose-induced PC12 cells. Conclusion HECTD3 silencing exerted neuroprotective effect against DACD through MALT1-mediated JNK signalling.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that progressively involves brain regions with an often-predictable pattern. Damage to the brain appears to spread and worsen with time, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the region-specific distribution of AD pathology at different stages of the disease are still under-investigated. In this study, a whole-transcriptome analysis was carried out on brain samples from the hippocampus (HI), temporal and parietal cortices (TC and PC, respectively), cingulate cortex (CG), and substantia nigra (SN) of six subjects with a definite AD diagnosis and three healthy age-matched controls in duplicate. The transcriptomic results showed a greater number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the TC (1571) and CG (1210) and a smaller number of DEGs in the HI (206), PC (109), and SN (60). Furthermore, the GSEA showed a difference between the group of brain areas affected early (HI and TC) and the group of areas that were subsequently involved (PC, CG, and SN). Notably, in the HI and TC, there was a significant downregulation of shared DEGs primarily involved in synaptic transmission, while in the PC, CG, and SN, there was a significant downregulation of genes primarily involved in protein folding and trafficking. The course of AD could follow a definite time- and severity-related pattern that arises from protein misfolding, as observed in the PC, CG, and SN, and leads to synaptic impairment, as observed in the HI and TC. Therefore, a map of the molecular and biological processes involved in AD pathogenesis may be traced. This could aid in the discovery of novel biological targets in order to develop effective and well-timed therapeutic approaches.

AB  - We have previously reported that vision decline was not associated with amyloidogenesis processing in aging C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice and in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, the APP(swe)/PS1 Delta E9 transgenic mouse model (APP/PS1). This conclusion was drawn using middle-aged (10-13 months old) mice. Here, we hypothesized that compared with hippocampal and cortical neurons, the weak amyloidogenic activity of retinal neurons may result in a detectable release of amyloid beta (A beta) only in aged mice, i.e., between 14 and 24 months of age. The aim of the present study was thus to follow potential activity changes in the amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic pathways of young (4 months) and old (20-24 months) WT and APP/PS1 mice. Our results showed that in spite of retinal activity loss reported by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, the level of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and its derivatives did not significantly vary in the eyes of old vs. young mice. Strikingly, the ectopic expression of human APP(swe) in APP/PS1 mice did not allow us to detect A beta monomers at 23 months. In contrast, A beta was observed in hippocampal and cortical tissues at this age but not at 4 months of life. In contrast, optic nerve transection-induced retinal ganglion cell injury significantly affected the level of retinal APP and the secretion of soluble APP alpha in the vitreous. Collectively, these results suggest that the amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic pathways are not involved in visual function decline in aging mice. In WT and APP/PS1 mice, it is proposed that retinal neurons do not have the capacity to secrete A beta in contrast with other cortical and hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Direct neuronal reprogramming of somatic cells into induced neurons (iNs) has been recently established as a promising approach to generating neuron cells. Previous studies have reported that the biophysical cues of the in vitro microenvironment are potent modulators in the cell fate decision; thus, the present study explores the effects of a customized pattern (named colloidal self-assembled patterns, cSAPs) on iN generation from human fibroblasts using small molecules. The result revealed that the cSAP, composed of binary particles in a hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) geometry, is capable of improving neuronal reprogramming efficiency and steering the ratio of the iN subtypes. Cells exhibited distinct cell morphology, upregulated cell adhesion markers (i.e., SDC1 and ITGAV), enriched signaling pathways (i.e., Hippo and Wnt), and chromatin remodeling on the cSAP compared to those on the control substrates. The result also showed that the iN subtype specification on cSAP was surface-dependent; therefore, the defined physicochemical cue from each cSAP is exclusive. Our findings show that direct cell reprogramming can be manipulated through specific biophysical cues on the artificial matrix, which is significant in cell transdifferentiation and lineage conversion.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related, multifactorial progressive neurodegenerative disorder manifested by cognitive impairment and neuronal death in the brain areas like hippocampus, yet the precise neuropathology of AD is still unclear. Continuous failure of various clinical trial studies demands the utmost need to explore more therapeutic targets against AD. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and neuronal insulin resistance due to serine phosphorylation of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 at 307 exhibits correlation with AD. Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) have also indicated therapeutic effects in AD by increasing the level of Glucagon-like peptide-1 in the brain after crossing Blood Brain Barrier. The present study is hypothesized to examine Linagliptin, a DPP-4i in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin induced neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation and hippocampal insulin resistance in rat model of AD. Following infusion on 1st and 3rd day, animals were treated orally with Linagliptin (0.513 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 5 mg/kg) and donepezil (5 mg/kg) as a standard for 8 weeks. Neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological analysis was done at the end of treatment. Dose-dependently Linagliptin significantly reversed behavioral alterations done through locomotor activity (LA) and morris water maze (MWM) test. Moreover, Linagliptin augmented hippocampal GLP-1 and Akt-ser473 level and mitigated soluble A beta (1-42), IRS-1 (s307), GSK-3 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, AchE and oxidative/nitrosative stress level. Histopathological analysis also exhibited neuroprotective and anti-amylodogenic effect in Hematoxylin and eosin and Congo red staining respectively. The findings of our study concludes remarkable dose-dependent therapeutic potential of Linagliptin against neuronal insulin resistance via IRS-1 and AD-related complication. Thus, demonstrates unique molecular mechanism that underlie AD.

AB  - Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the development of the central nervous system and are considered pivotal to cognitive functions in the adult brain. Recently, thyroid dysfunction has been associated with Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to assess the neuroprotective effects of triiodothyronine (T3) on insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and cognitive function in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced sporadic Alzheimer's disease-like model. Male Wistar rats underwent stereotaxic surgery for intracerebroventricular injections of streptozotocin (STZ; 2 mg/kg) or vehicle in the lateral ventricles to induce an AD-like model. The animals received a daily dose of 1.5 mu g of T3/100 g body weight or the same volume of vehicle for 30 days and were subdivided into four experimental groups: (1) animals receiving citrate treated with saline (Control = CTL); (2) animals receiving citrate treated with T3 (T3); (3) animals receiving STZ treated with saline (STZ); and (4) animals receiving STZ treated with T3 (STZ + T3). The novel object recognition test was used to measure cognitive function. Serum analysis, real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting analyses were also carried out. Our results demonstrated that T3 treatment reversed cognitive impairment and increased Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation in the treated group, while also reducing microglial activation (Iba-1) and GFAP expression (reactive astrocytes), along with TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta levels in the hippocampus. Additionally, T3 treatment increased levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and reduced the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in the hippocampus.

AB  - Despite progress in understanding the role of the dorsal hippocampus in the acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of episodic-like memory, plastic changes within the intra- and extrahippocampal circuits for aversive memory formation and anxiety-like behaviours must still be identified since both processes contribute to multiple aspects of flexible decision-making. Here, we investigated the effect of reversible inactivation induced by a muscimol microinfusion into the dorsal CA1 subfield (dCA1) either prior to acquisition or to retrieval testing of a discriminative avoidance task performed in a plus-maze apparatus (PM-DAT). Differential cAMP-responseelement-binding protein 1 (CREB-1) expression in the dorsal and ventral CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus (dCA1, dCA3, vCA1, and vCA3), dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG), and infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PrL) regions of the medial prefrontal cortex was also assessed to investigate the molecular changes associated with the consolidation or retrieval of episodic-like memory and anxiety. Adult male Wistar rats were assigned to two control groups, learning (no surgery/no microinfusion, n = 7) and sham-operated (sham surgery/no microinfusion, n = 6) groups, or four experimental groups, in which the vehicle (0.5 mu l per side, n = 8/per group) or a GABAA receptor agonist (0.5 mu g/0.5 mu l muscimol/per side) was bilaterally microinfused in the dCA1 30 min prior to training (n = 9) or prior to testing sessions (n = 6) with a 24 h intertrial interval. Memory was evaluated using the percentage of time spent in the nonaversive enclosed arms, whereas anxiety was measured by calculating the percentages of time spent and entries into open arms and the percentage of time spent self-grooming. Our findings corroborated previous data showing that the dCA1 is required for discriminative avoidance consolidation. Furthermore, additional information indicated that impaired long-term memory was associated with downregulated CREB-1 expression in the dDG and vCA3. Moreover, memory retrieval was not impaired by dCA1 inactivation prior to the testing session, which was associated with the upregulation of CREB-1 in the dCA3 and vCA1 and downregulation in the dCA1 and vCA3. Differential expression of CREB was not identified in the IL or PrL areas. These results improve our understanding of how the hippocampal circuitry mediates the acquisition and retrieval of aversive memory and anxiety.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is the most common type of cerebrovascular disease with high mortality and poor prognosis, and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CI/R) injury is the main murderer. Here, we attempted to explore the effects and mechanism of Xuesaitong (XST) combined with dexmedetomidine (Dex) on CI/R injury in rats. First, a rat model of CI/R injury was constructed via the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method and treated with XST and Dex alone or in combination. Then, on the 5th and 10th days of treatment, the neurological impairment was assessed using the modified neurological severity scores (mNSS), the 8-arm radial maze test (8ARMT), novel object recognition test (NORT), and fear conditioning test (FCT). H&E staining was performed to observe the pathological changes of the hippocampus. ELISA and related kits were used to assess the monoamine neurotransmitters and antioxidant enzyme activities in the hippocampus. The ATP, mitochondrial membrane potential levels, and qRT-PCR of genes related to mitochondrial function were determined to assess mitochondrial functions in the hippocampus and western blot to determine Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway and mitophagy-related protein expression. The results showed that XST combined with Dex significantly reduced mNSS, improved spatial memory and learning deficits, and enhanced fear memory and cognitive memory ability in CI/R rats, which was superior to single-drug treatment. Moreover, XST combined with Dex treatment improved hippocampal histopathological damage; significantly increased the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, ATP, and mitochondrial membrane potential; and upregulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the expression of mitophagy-related proteins in the hippocampus of CI/R rats. XST combined with Dex treatment also activated the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling and upregulated the protein expression of downstream antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and NQ. Altogether, this study showed that a combination of XST and Dex could activate the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling and mitophagy to protect rats from CI/R-related neurological impairment.

AB  - We previously showed that simvastatin (SV) restored memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) concomitantly with normalization in protein levels of memory-related immediate early genes in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Here, we investigated age-related changes in the hippocampal memory pathway, and whether the beneficial effects of SV could be related to enhanced neurogenesis and signaling in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. APP mice and wild-type (WT) littermate controls showed comparable number of proliferating (Ki67-positive nuclei) and immature (doublecortin (DCX)-positive) granule cells in the dentate gyrus until 3 months of age. At 4 months, Ki67 or DCX positive cells decreased sharply and remained less numerous until the endpoint (6 months) in both SV-treated and untreated APP mice. In 6 month-old APP mice, dendritic extensions of DCX immature neurons in the molecular layer were shorter, a deficit fully normalized by SV. Similarly, whereas mature granule cells (calbindin-immunopositive) were decreased in APP mice and not restored by SV, their dendritic arborizations were normalized to control levels by SV treatment. SV increased Prox1 protein levels (up arrow 67.7%, p < 0.01), a Wnt/beta-catenin signaling target, while significantly decreasing (down arrow 61.2%, p < 0.05) the upregulated levels of the beta-catenin-dependent Wnt pathway inhibitor DKK1 seen in APP mice. In APP mice, SV benefits were recapitulated by treatment with the Wnt/beta-catenin specific agonist WAY-262611, whereas they were fully abolished in mice that received the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitor XAV939 during the last month of SV treatment. Our results indicate that activation of the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway through downregulation of DKK1 underlies SV neuronal and cognitive benefits.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents one of the most common worldwide causes of death and disability. Clinical and animal model studies have evidenced that TBI is characterized by the loss of both gray and white matter, resulting in brain atrophy and in a decrease in neurological function. Nowadays, no effective treatments to counteract TBI-induced neurological damage are available. Due to its complex and multifactorial pathophysiology (neuro-inflammation, cytotoxicity and astroglial scar formation), cell regeneration and survival in injured brain areas are strongly hampered. Recently, it has been proposed that adult neurogenesis may represent a new approach to counteract the post-traumatic neurodegeneration. In our laboratory, we have recently shown that physical exercise induces the long-lasting enhancement of subventricular (SVZ) adult neurogenesis in a p21 (negative regulator of neural progenitor proliferation)-null mice model, with a concomitant improvement of olfactory behavioral paradigms that are strictly dependent on SVZ neurogenesis. On the basis of this evidence, we have investigated the effect of running on SVZ neurogenesis and neurorepair processes in p21 knock-out mice that were subject to TBI at the end of a 12-day session of running. Our data indicate that runner p21 ko mice show an improvement in numerous post-trauma neuro-regenerative processes, including the following: (i) an increase in neuroblasts in the SVZ; (ii) an increase in the migration stream of new neurons from the SVZ to the damaged cortical region; (iii) an enhancement of new differentiating neurons in the peri-lesioned area; (iv) an improvement in functional recovery at various times following TBI. All together, these results suggest that a running-dependent increase in subventricular neural stem cells could represent a promising tool to improve the endogenous neuro-regenerative responses following brain trauma.

AB  - Introduction Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are the most studied anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family proteins. We previously characterized both of them, not only for their role in regulating apoptosis and resistance to therapy in cancer cells, but also for their non-canonical functions, mainly including promotion of cancer progression, metastatization, angiogenesis, and involvement in the crosstalk among cancer cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. Our goal was to identify transcriptional signature and novel cellular pathways specifically modulated by Bcl-2.Methods We performed RNAseq analysis of siRNA-mediated transient knockdown of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in human melanoma cells and gene ontology analysis to identify a specific Bcl-2 transcriptional signature. Expression of genes modulated by Bcl-2 and associated to Hippo pathway were validated in human melanoma, breast adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR. Western blotting analysis were performed to analyse protein expression of upstream regulators of YAP and in relation to different level of Bcl-2 protein. The effects of YAP silencing in Bcl-2 overexpressing cancer cells were evaluated in migration and cell viability assays in relation to different stiffness conditions. In vitro wound healing assays and co-cultures were used to evaluate cancer-specific Bcl-2 ability to activate fibroblasts.Results We demonstrated the Bcl-2-dependent modulation of Hippo Pathway in cancer cell lines from different tumor types by acting on upstream YAP regulators. YAP inhibition abolished the ability of Bcl-2 to increase tumor cell migration and proliferation on high stiffness condition of culture, to stimulate in vitro fibroblasts migration and to induce fibroblasts activation.Conclusions We discovered that Bcl-2 regulates the Hippo pathway in different tumor types, promoting cell migration, adaptation to higher stiffness culture condition and fibroblast activation. Our data indicate that Bcl-2 inhibitors should be further investigated to counteract cancer-promoting mechanisms.

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring a KRAS mutation have unfavorable therapeutic outcomes with chemotherapies, and the mutation also renders tolerance to immunotherapies. There is an unmet need for a new strategy for overcoming immunosuppression in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. The recently discovered role of melatonin demonstrates a wide spectrum of anticancer impacts; however, the effect of melatonin on modulating tumor immunity is largely unknown. In the present study, melatonin treatment significantly reduced cell viability accompanied by inducing cell apoptosis in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines including A549, H460, and LLC1 cells. Mechanistically, we found that lung cancer cells harboring the KRAS mutation exhibited a higher level of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). However, treatment with melatonin substantially downregulated PD-L1 expressions in both the presence and absence of interferon (IFN)-gamma stimulation. Moreover, KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells exhibited higher Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) levels, and PD-L1 expression was positively correlated with YAP and TAZ in lung cancer cells. Treatment with melatonin effectively suppressed YAP and TAZ, which was accompanied by downregulation of YAP/TAZ downstream gene expressions. The combination of melatonin and an inhibitor of YAP/TAZ robustly decreased YAP and PD-L1 expressions. Clinical analysis using public databases revealed that PD-L1 expression was positively correlated with YAP and TAZ in patients with lung cancer, and PD-L1 overexpression suggested poor survival probability. An animal study further revealed that administration of melatonin significantly inhibited tumor growth and modulated tumor immunity in a syngeneic mouse model. Together, our data revealed a novel antitumor mechanism of melatonin in modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by suppressing the YAP/PD-L1 axis and suggest the therapeutic potential of melatonin for treating NSCLC.

AB  - The balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) signaling is important for maintaining homeostatic function in the brain. Indeed, dysregulation of inhibitory GABA interneurons in the amygdala has been implicated in human mood disorders. We hypothesized that acetylcholine (ACh) signaling in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) might alter E/I balance resulting in changes in stress-sensitive behaviors. We therefore measured ACh release as well as activity of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII)-, parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SOM)- and vasoactive intestinal protein (VIP)-expressing neurons in the BLA of awake, behaving male mice. ACh levels and activity of both excitatory and inhibitory BLA neurons increased when animals were actively coping, and decreased during passive coping, in the light-dark box, tail suspension and social defeat. Changes in neuronal activity preceded behavioral state transitions, suggesting that BLA activity may drive the shift in coping strategy. In contrast to exposure to escapable stressors, prolonging ACh signaling with a cholinesterase antagonist changed the balance of activity among BLA cell types, significantly increasing activity of VIP neurons and decreasing activity of SOM cells, with little effect on CaMKII or PV neurons. Knockdown of alpha 7 or beta 2-containing nAChR subtypes in PV and SOM, but not CaMKII or VIP, BLA neurons altered behavioral responses to stressors, suggesting that ACh signaling through nAChRs on GABA neuron subtypes contributes to stress-induced changes in behavior. These studies show that ACh modulates the GABAergic signaling network in the BLA, shifting the balance between SOM, PV, VIP and CaMKII neurons, which are normally activated coordinately during active coping in response to stress. Thus, prolonging ACh signaling, as occurs in response to chronic stress, may contribute to maladaptive behaviors by shifting the balance of inhibitory signaling in the BLA.

AB  - The Retinoblastoma (Rb) family of pocket proteins (p107, Rb, and p130) controls all aspects of neurogenesis from stem cell activation to long-term neuronal survival in the brain. Previous studies have reported non-overlapping, often complementary, roles for these cell cycle regulators with possibility for functional compensation. Yet the extent to which each protein might compensate for other family members and whether synergistic effects exist during neural stem cell (NSC) lineage development remain unclear. Fong et al. recently revealed that a triple knock-out (TKO) of all pocket proteins results in a transcriptomic switch from NSC quiescence to activation, followed by niche depletion in the adult hippocampus. Here, we investigated whether pocket proteins are equally critical in NSC fate regulation in the adult subventricular zone (aSVZ) and during embryogenesis. We report that TKO of these proteins results in NSC activation coupled to ectopic progenitor proliferation and massive apoptosis, leading to niche depletion and premature loss of neurogenesis inside the olfactory bulb (OB). Notably, a p107-p130 double knockout carrying a single wild-type Rb allele (DKO) substantially rescues the above defects and maintains adult neurogenesis. In comparison, TKO embryos display severe disruptions in all stages of neurogenesis at E14.5, leading to embryonic lethality. Similar defects are detected when any five out of the six alleles of pocket proteins are lost, with only partial rescue of the proliferation defects observed in DKO embryos. The above TKO phenotypes are partially mediated by opposed deregulations in the Notch-Hes signaling pathway in the embryonic versus the adult brain. Such deregulation is linked to opposite changes in E2F3a and E2F3b embryonic gene expressions. Our data identifies Rb as a critical pocket protein in the control and maintenance of adult OB neurogenesis, and uncovers interchangeable, dose-dependent roles for pocket proteins in the control of neuronal differentiation and survival during development.

AB  - Multi-infarct dementia (MID), a prominent subtype of vascular dementia (VD), is responsible for at least 15 to 20 percent of dementia in the elderly. Mitochondrial dysfunctions and glutamate neurotoxicity due to chronic hypoperfusion and oxidative stress were regarded as the major risk factors in the pathogenesis. Kaixin San (KXS), a classic prescription of Beiji Qianjin Yaofang, was applied to treatment for "amnesia" and has been demonstrated to alleviate the cognitive deficit in a variety of dementias, including MID. However, little is known whether mitochondria and glutamate are associated with the protection of KXS in MID treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of KXS in improving the cognitive function of MID rats through strengthening mitochondrial functions and antagonizing glutamate neurotoxicity via the Shh/Ptch1 signaling pathway. Our data showed that KXS significantly ameliorated memory impairment and hippocampal neuron damage in MID rats. Moreover, KXS improved hippocampal mitochondrial functions by reducing the degree of mitochondrial swelling, increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and elevating the energy charge (EC) and ATP content in MID rats. As expected, the concentration of glutamate and the expression of p-NMDAR1 were significantly reduced by KXS in the brain tissue of MID rats. Furthermore, our results showed that KXS noticeably activated the Shh/Ptch1 signaling pathway which was demonstrated by remarkable elevations of Ptch1, Smo, and Gli1 protein levels in the brain tissue of MID rats. Intriguingly, the inhibition of the Shh signaling pathway with cyclopamine significantly inhibited the protective effects of KXS on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. To sum up, these findings suggested that KXS protected MID rats from memory loss by rescuing mitochondrial functions as well as against glutamate neurotoxicity through activating Shh/Ptch1 signaling pathway.

AB  - The hippocampus is a highly scrutinized brain structure due to its entanglement in multiple neuropathologies and vulnerability to metabolic insults. This study aims to non-invasively assess the perfusion-mechanics relationship of the hippocampus in the healthy brain across magnetic resonance imaging sequences and magnetic field strengths. In total, 17 subjects (aged 22-35, 7 males/10 females) were scanned with magnetic resonance elastography and arterial spin labelling acquisitions at 3T and 7T in a baseline physiological state. No significant differences in perfusion or stiffness were observed across magnetic field strengths or acquisitions. The hippocampus had the highest vascularity within the deep grey matter, followed closely by the caudate nucleus and putamen. We discovered a positive perfusion-mechanics correlation in the hippocampus across both 3T and 7T groups, with a highly significant correlation overall (R = 0.71, p = 0.0019), which was not observed in the caudate nucleus, a similarly vascular region. Furthermore, we supported our hypothesis that increased perfusion in the hippocampus would lead to greater pulsatile displacement in a small cohort (n = 10). Given that the hippocampus is an exceptionally vulnerable structure, with perfusion deficits often seen in diseases related to learning and memory, our results suggest a unique mechanistic link between metabolic health and stiffness biomarkers in this key region for the first time.

AB  - The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key site where fear learning takes place through synaptic plasticity. Rodent research shows prominent low theta (similar to 3-6 Hz), high theta (similar to 6-12 Hz), and gamma (>30 Hz) rhythms in the BLA local field potential recordings. However, it is not understood what role these rhythms play in supporting the plasticity. Here, we create a biophysically detailed model of the BLA circuit to show that several classes of interneurons (PV, SOM, and VIP) in the BLA can be critically involved in producing the rhythms; these rhythms promote the formation of a dedicated fear circuit shaped through spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Each class of interneurons is necessary for the plasticity. We find that the low theta rhythm is a biomarker of successful fear conditioning. The model makes use of interneurons commonly found in the cortex and, hence, may apply to a wide variety of associative learning situations.

AB  - Hippocampal place cell sequences have been hypothesized to serve as diverse purposes as the induction of synaptic plasticity, formation and consolidation of long-term memories, or navigation and planning. During spatial behaviors of rodents, sequential firing of place cells at the theta timescale (known as theta sequences) encodes running trajectories, which can be considered as one-dimensional behavioral sequences of traversed locations. In a two-dimensional space, however, each single location can be visited along arbitrary one-dimensional running trajectories. Thus, a place cell will generally take part in multiple different theta sequences, raising questions about how this two-dimensional topology can be reconciled with the idea of hippocampal sequences underlying memory of (one-dimensional) episodes. Here, we propose a computational model of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) and dentate gyrus (DG), where sensorimotor input drives the direction-dependent (extrinsic) theta sequences within CA3 reflecting the two-dimensional spatial topology, whereas the intrahippocampal CA3-DG projections concurrently produce intrinsic sequences that are independent of the specific running trajectory. Consistent with experimental data, intrinsic theta sequences are less prominent, but can nevertheless be detected during theta activity, thereby serving as running-direction independent landmark cues. We hypothesize that the intrinsic sequences largely reflect replay and preplay activity during non-theta states.

AB  - A key feature of advanced brain aging includes structural defects of intracortical myelin that are associated with secondary neuroinflammation. A similar pathology is seen in specific myelin mutant mice that model 'advanced brain aging' and exhibit a range of behavioral abnormalities. However, the cognitive assessment of these mutants is problematic because myelin-dependent motor-sensory functions are required for quantitative behavioral readouts. To better understand the role of cortical myelin integrity for higher brain functions, we generated mice lacking Plp1, encoding the major integral myelin membrane protein, selectively in ventricular zone stem cells of the mouse forebrain. In contrast to conventional Plp1 null mutants, subtle myelin defects were restricted to the cortex, hippocampus, and underlying callosal tracts. Moreover, forebrain-specific Plp1 mutants exhibited no defects of basic motor-sensory performance at any age tested. Surprisingly, several behavioral alterations reported for conventional Plp1 null mice (Gould et al., 2018) were absent and even social interactions appeared normal. However, with novel behavioral paradigms, we determined catatonia-like symptoms and isolated executive dysfunction in both genders. This suggests that loss of myelin integrity has an impact on cortical connectivity and underlies specific defects of executive function. These observations are likewise relevant for human neuropsychiatric conditions and other myelin-related diseases.

AB  - Animals use memory-guided and memory-independent strategies to make navi-gational decisions. Disentangling the contribution of these strategies to navigation is critical for understanding how memory influences behavioral output. To address this issue, we studied spatial behaviors of the chickadee, a food-caching bird. Chickadees hide food in concealed, scattered loca-tions and retrieve their caches later in time. We designed an apparatus that allows birds to cache and retrieve food at many sites while navigating in a laboratory arena. This apparatus enabled auto-mated tracking of behavioral variables - including caches, retrievals, and investigations of different sites. We built probabilistic models to fit these behavioral data using a combination of mnemonic and non-mnemonic factors. We found that chickadees use some navigational strategies that are independent of cache memories, including opportunistic foraging and spatial biases. They combine these strategies with spatially precise memories of which sites contain caches and which sites they have previously checked. A single memory of site contents is used in a context-dependent manner: during caching chickadees avoid sites that contain food, while during retrieval they instead preferen-tially access occupied sites. Our approach is a powerful way to investigate navigational decisions in a natural behavior, including flexible contributions of memory to these decisions.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that administration of omega (omega)-9, omega-3, and omega-6 to mice can prevent oxidative alterations responsible for behavioral and cognitive alterations related with aging. Twenty-eight-day-old mice received skim milk (SM group), SM enriched with omega oil mixture (EM group), or water (control group) for 10 and 14 months, equivalent to middle age. Mice were evaluated for behavioral alterations related to depression and memory and oxidative status [brain levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH), and myeloperoxidase (MPO)]. The 10-month EM group increased immobility time during the forced swimming test compared with control, indicating increased stress response. The 14-month SM- and EM-treated groups increased sucrose consumption compared with control, showing an expanded motivational state. The 14-month SM group decreased the number of rearings compared with the 14-month control and EM groups. The number of entries and time spent in the central square of the open field was higher in the 10-month EM group than in the control, revealing an anxiolytic-like behavior. TBARS decreased in the hippocampus and striatum of the 10-month EM group compared with the control. A similar decrease was observed in the striatum of the 10-month SM group. GSH levels were higher in all 14-month treated groups compared with 10-month groups. MPO activity was higher in the 14-month EM group compared with the 14-month control and SM groups, revealing a possible pro-inflammatory status. In conclusion, omega oils induced conflicting alterations in middle-aged mice, contributing to enhanced behavior and anxiolytic and expanded motivational state, but also to increased stress response and pro-inflammatory alterations.

AB  - Compromise of the vascular system has important consequences on cognitive abilities and neurodegeneration. The identification of the main molecular signatures present in the blood vessels of human hippocampus could provide the basis to understand and tackle these pathologies. As direct vascular experimentation in hippocampus is problematic, we achieved this information by computationally disaggregating publicly available whole microarrays data of human hippocampal homogenates. Three conditions were analyzed: 'Young Adults', 'Aged', and 'aged with Mild Cognitive Impairment' (MCI). The genes identified were contrasted against two independent data-sets. Here we show that the endothelial cells from the Younger Group appeared in an 'activated stage'. In turn, in the Aged Group, the endothelial cells showed a significant loss of response to shear stress, changes in cell adhesion molecules, increased inflammation, brain-insulin resistance, lipidic alterations, and changes in the extracellular matrix. Some specific changes in the MCI group were also detected. Noticeably, in this study the features arisen from the Aged Group (high tortuosity, increased bifurcations, and smooth muscle proliferation), pose the need for further experimental verification to discern between the occurrence of arteriogenesis and/or vascular remodeling by capillary arterialization.

AB  - The Hippo signalling pathway is a master regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and cancer. The transcriptional coregulators of the Hippo pathway, YAP and TAZ, are central in various cancers. However, how YAP and TAZ get activated in most types of cancers is not well understood. Here, we show that androgens activate YAP/TAZ via the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer (PCa), and that this activation is differential. AR regulates YAP trans-lation while inducing transcription of the TAZ encoding gene, WWTR1. Furthermore, we show that AR-mediated YAP/TAZ acti-vation is regulated by the RhoA GTPases transcriptional mediator, serum response factor (SRF). Importantly, in prostate cancer patients, SRF expression positively correlates with TAZ and the YAP/TAZ target genes CYR61 and CTGF. We demonstrate that YAP/ TAZ are not essential for sustaining AR activity, however, targeting YAP/TAZ or SRF sensitize PCa cells to AR inhibition in anchorage -independent growth conditions. Our findings dissect the cellular roles of YAP, TAZ, and SRF in prostate cancer cells. Our data emphasize the interplay between these transcriptional regula-tors and their roles in prostate tumorigenesis and highlight how these insights might be exploited therapeutically.

AB  - Nested hippocampal oscillations in the rodent give rise to temporal dynamics that may underlie learning, memory, and decision making. Although theta/gamma coupling in rodent CA1 occurs during exploration and sharp-wave ripples emerge in quiescence, it is less clear that these oscillatory regimes extend to primates. We therefore sought to identify correspondences in frequency bands, nesting, and behavioral coupling of oscillations taken from macaque hippo-campus. We found that, in contrast to rodent oscillations, theta and gamma frequency bands in macaque CA1 were segregated by behavioral states. In both stationary and freely moving designs, beta2/gamma (15-70 Hz) had greater power during visual search whereas the theta band (3-10 Hz; peak similar to 8 Hz) dominated during quiescence and early sleep. Moreover, theta-band amplitude was strongest when beta2/slow gamma (20-35 Hz) amplitude was weakest, instead occurring along with higher frequencies (60-150 Hz). Spike-field coherence was most frequently seen in these three bands (3-10 Hz, 20-35 Hz, and 60-150 Hz); however, the theta-band coherence was largely due to spurious coupling during sharp-wave ripples. Accordingly, no intrinsic theta spiking rhythmicity was apparent. These results support a role for beta2/slow gamma modulation in CA1 during active exploration in the primate that is decoupled from theta oscillations. The apparent difference to the rodent oscillatory canon calls for a shift in focus of frequency when considering the primate hippocampus.

AB  - Simple Summary Our understanding of what can preserve in the fossil record, and for how long, is constantly evolving with the use of new scientific techniques and exceptional fossil discoveries. In this study, we examine the state of preservation of a Tyrannosaurus rex that died about 66 million years ago. This specimen has previously been studied using a number of advanced methods, all of which have indicated preservation of original soft tissues and bone biomolecules. Here, we use synchrotron-a type of particle accelerator-analyses to generate data identifying and quantifying elements that constitute this fossil bone. We show that trace elements incorporated by the living animal during bone deposition and remodeling, such as zinc, are preserved in the fossil bone in a pattern similar to what is seen in modern bird bones. This pattern is not observed in a microscopically well preserved, but molecularly more degraded dinosaur, a herbivorous Tenontosaurus. These data further support the preservation of original biological material in this T. rex, suggesting new possibilities for deciphering extinct species life histories. This study also highlights that preservation of original biochemistry in fossils is specimen-specific and cannot be determined by pristine appearance alone. Biomolecules preserved in deep time have potential to shed light on major evolutionary questions, driving the search for new and more rigorous methods to detect them. Despite the increasing body of evidence from a wide variety of new, high resolution/high sensitivity analytical techniques, this research is commonly met with skepticism, as the long standing dogma persists that such preservation in very deep time (>1 Ma) is unlikely. The Late Cretaceous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex (MOR 1125) has been shown, through multiple biochemical studies, to preserve original bone chemistry. Here, we provide additional, independent support that deep time bimolecular preservation is possible. We use synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging (XRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate a section from the femur of this dinosaur, and demonstrate preservation of elements (S, Ca, and Zn) associated with bone remodeling and redeposition. We then compare these data to the bone of an extant dinosaur (bird), as well as a second non-avian dinosaur, Tenontosaurus tilletti (OMNH 34784) that did not preserve any sign of original biochemistry. Our data indicate that MOR 1125 bone cortices have similar bone elemental distributions to that of an extant bird, which supports preservation of original endogenous chemistry in this specimen.

AB  - Predator exposure is a life-threatening experience and elicits learned fear responses to the context in which the predator was encountered. The anterior cingulate area (ACA) occupies a pivotal position in a cortical network responsive to predatory threats, and it exerts a critical role in processing fear memory. The experiments were made in mice and revealed that the ACA is involved in both the acquisition and expression of contextual fear to predatory threat. Overall, the ACA can provide predictive relationships between the context and the predator threat and influences fear memory acquisition through projections to the basolateral amygdala and perirhinal region and the expression of contextual fear through projections to the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray. Our results expand previous studies based on classical fear conditioning and open interesting perspectives for understanding how the ACA is involved in processing contextual fear memory to ethologic threatening conditions that entrain specific medial hypothalamic fear circuits.

AB  - Several plants have traditionally been used since antiquity to treat various gastroenteritis and respiratory symptoms similar to COVID-19 outcomes. The common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever or chills, cold, cough, flu, headache, diarrhoea, tiredness/fatigue, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, asthma, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, etc. This study aims to find out the plants and plant-derived products which are being used by the COVID-19 infected patients in Bangladesh and how those plants are being used for the management of COVID-19 symptoms. In this study, online and partially in-person survey interviews were carried out among Bangladeshi respondents. We selected Bangladeshi COVID-19 patients who were detected Coronavirus positive (+) by RT-PCR nucleic acid test and later recovered. Furthermore, identified plant species from the surveys were thoroughly investigated for safety and efficacy based on the previous ethnomedicinal usage reports. Based on the published data, they were also reviewed for their significant potentialities as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory agents. We explored comprehensive information about a total of 26 plant species, belonging to 23 genera and 17 different botanical families, used in COVID-19 treatment as home remedies by the respondents. Most of the plants and plant-derived products were collected directly from the local marketplace. According to our survey results, greatly top 5 cited plant species measured as per the highest RFC value are Camellia sinensis (1.0) > Allium sativum (0.984) > Azadirachta indica (0.966) > Zingiber officinale (0.966) > Syzygium aromaticum (0.943). Previously published ethnomedicinal usage reports, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activity of the concerned plant species also support our results. Thus, the survey and review analysis simultaneously reveals that these reported plants and plant-derived products might be promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, this study clarifies the reported plants for their safety during COVID-19 management and thereby supporting them to include in any future pre-clinical and clinical investigation for developing herbal COVID-19 therapeutics.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by a multitude of pathological manifestations, prominently marked by the aggregation of amyloid beta. Recent investigations have revealed a compelling association between excessive adiposity and glial activation, further correlating with cognitive impairments. Additionally, alterations in levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have been reported in individuals with metabolic conditions accompanied by memory dysfunction. Hence, our research endeavors to comprehensively explore the impact of IGF-1 on the hippocampus and adipose tissue in the context of Alzheimer's disease. To address this, we have conducted an in-depth analysis utilizing APP/PS2 transgenic mice, recognized as a well-established mouse model for Alzheimer's disease. Upon administering IGF-1 injections to the APP/PS2 mice, we observed notable alterations in their behavioral patterns, prompting us to undertake a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of both the hippocampal and adipose tissues. Our data unveiled significant modifications in the functional profiles of these tissues. Specifically, in the hippocampus, we identified changes associated with synaptic activity and neuroinflammation. Concurrently, the adipose tissue displayed shifts in processes related to fat browning and cell death signaling. In addition to these findings, our analysis enabled the identification of a collection of long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs that exhibited significant changes in expression subsequent to the administration of IGF-1 injections. Furthermore, we endeavored to predict the potential roles of these identified RNA molecules within the context of our study. In summary, our study offers valuable transcriptome data for hippocampal and adipose tissues within an Alzheimer's disease model and posits a significant role for IGF-1 within both the hippocampus and adipose tissue.

AB  - Root-synthesized secondary metabolites are critical quality-conferring compounds of foods, plant-derived medicines, and beverages. However, information at a single-cell level on root-specific secondary metabolism remains largely unexplored. L-Theanine, an important quality component of tea, is primarily synthesized in roots, from which it is then transported to new shoots of tea plant. In this study, we present a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-derived map for the tea plant root, which enabled cell-type-specific analysis of glutamate and ethylamine (two precursors of theanine biosynthesis) metabolism, and theanine biosynthesis, storage, and transport. Our findings support a model in which the theanine biosynthesis pathway occurs via multicellular compartmentation and does not require high co-expression levels of transcription factors and their target genes within the same cell cluster. This study provides novel insights into theanine metabolism and regulation, at the single-cell level, and offers an example for studying root-specific secondary metabolism in other plant systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the role of Ezrin in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and investigate potential therapeutic targets for ESCC by interfering with Ezrin expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that Ezrin expression differed significantly among patients with different clinical stage ESCC. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between Ezrin and yes-associated protein/connective tissue growth factor (YAP(1)/CTGF) levels in esophageal cancer. Sixty paraffin-embedded ESCC tissue samples were examined and Ezrin and YAP(1)/CTGF levels were determined using immunohistochemistry. The positive expression rates of Ezrin and YAP(1)/CTGF were significantly lower in adjacent tissues than in ESCC tissues. Furthermore, knockdown of Ezrin expression inhibited colony formation and reduced cell migration and invasion. Compared with control ESCC cells, protein expression levels of YAP(1) and CTGF were significantly downregulated in cells with Ezrin knocked down. We conclude that Ezrin may be involved in ESCC progression through the Hippo signaling pathway.

AB  - Although time is a fundamental dimension of life, we do not know how brain areas cooperate to keep track and process time intervals. Notably, analyses of neural activity during learning are rare, mainly because timing tasks usually require training over many days. We investigated how the time encoding evolves when animals learn to time a 1.5 s interval. We designed a novel training protocol where rats go from naive- to proficient-level timing performance within a single session, allowing us to investigate neuronal activity from very early learning stages. We used pharmacological experiments and machine-learning algorithms to evaluate the level of time encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum. Our results show a double dissociation between the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum during temporal learning, where the former commits to early learning stages while the latter engages as animals become proficient in the task.

AB  - Simple Summary Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common partial complex epilepsy in adults and the most often refractory to medications. Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proved effective in controlling seizures in animal models and in drug-refractory MTLE patients. However, there is still no unifying framework for DBS parameters, which are obtained by trial-and-error and based on arbitrary, fixed stimulation frequencies rather than on physiologically relevant patterns. Interictal activity may present the key to devising personalized and physiologically relevant DBS strategies. Interictal activity occurs between seizures and is a hallmark of the hyperexcitability of the epileptic brain; depending on the underlying mechanisms and site of origin, it may promote seizures (pro-ictogenic) or dampen them (anti-ictogenic). In this work, we address the possibility of controlling seizure activity by means of electrical stimulation fashioned as a surrogate interictal pattern known to be anti-ictogenic. We show that this approach can effectively control seizure activity while delivering fewer electrical pulses than fixed-frequency stimulation. Thus, mimicking the temporal dynamics of an anti-ictogenic interictal pattern may represent a straightforward, personalized and more efficient DBS strategy to ameliorate drug-refractory epilepsy. Our work heralds a paradigm shift toward physiologically meaningful rather than arbitrary DBS parameters. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common partial complex epilepsy in adults and the most unresponsive to medications. Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the hippocampus has proved effective in controlling seizures in epileptic rodents and in drug-refractory MTLE patients. However, current DBS paradigms implement arbitrary fixed-frequency or patterned stimuli, disregarding the temporal profile of brain electrical activity. The latter, herein included hippocampal spontaneous firing, has been shown to follow lognormal temporal dynamics. Here, we present a novel paradigm to devise DBS protocols based on stimulation patterns fashioned as a surrogate brain signal. We focus on the interictal activity originating in the hippocampal subfield CA3, which has been shown to be anti-ictogenic. Using 4-aminopyridine-treated hippocampus-cortex slices coupled to microelectrode array, we pursue three specific aims: (1) address whether lognormal temporal dynamics can describe the CA3-driven interictal pattern, (2) explore the possibility of restoring the non-seizing state by mimicking the temporal dynamics of this anti-ictogenic pattern with electrical stimulation, and (3) compare the performance of the CA3-surrogate against periodic stimulation. We show that the CA3-driven interictal activity follows lognormal temporal dynamics. Further, electrical stimulation fashioned as a surrogate interictal pattern exhibits similar efficacy but uses less pulses than periodic stimulation. Our results support the possibility of mimicking the temporal dynamics of relevant brain signals as a straightforward DBS strategy to ameliorate drug-refractory epilepsy. Further, they herald a paradigm shift in neuromodulation, wherein a compromised brain signal can be recreated by the appropriate stimuli distribution to bypass trial-and-error studies and attain physiologically meaningful DBS operating modes.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent, multifaceted inflammatory condition affecting the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses, frequently accompanied by formation of nasal polyps (CRSwNP). This apparently uniform clinical entity is preceded by heterogeneous changes in cellular and molecular patterns, suggesting the presence of multiple CRS endotypes and a diverse etiology. Alterations of the upper airway innate defense mechanisms, including antimicrobial and antioxidant capacity, have been implicated in CRSwNP etiology. The aim of this study was to investigate mRNA expression patterns of antioxidative enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), and innate immune system defense players, namely the bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold-containing family A, member 1 (BPIFA1) and PACAP family members, particularly adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor 1 (ADCYAP1) in nasal mucosa and nasal polyps from CRSwNP patients. Additional stratification based on age, sex, allergic comorbidity, and disease severity was applied. The results showed that ADCYAP1, BPIFA1, and PRDX2 transcripts are differentially expressed in nasal mucosa and scale with radiologically assessed disease severity in CRSwNP patients. Sinonasal transcriptome is not associated with age, sex, and smoking in CRSwNP. Surgical and postoperative corticosteroid (CS) therapy improves endoscopic appearance of the mucosa, but variably reverses target gene expression patterns in the nasal cavity of CRSwNP patients. Transcriptional cross-correlations analysis revealed an increased level of connectedness among differentially expressed genes under inflammatory conditions and restoration of basic network following CS treatment. Although results of the present study imply a possible engagement of ADCYAP1 and BPIFA1 as biomarkers for CRSwNP, a more profound study taking into account disease severity and CRSwNP endotypes prior to the treatment would provide additional information on their sensitivity.

AB  - Effective regulation of energy metabolism is critical for survival. Metabolic control involves various nuclei within the hypothalamus, which receive information about the body's energy state and coordinate appropriate responses to maintain homeostasis, such as thermogenesis, pancreatic insulin secretion, and food-seeking behaviors. It has recently been found that the hippocampus, a brain region traditionally associated with memory and spatial navigation, is also involved in metabolic regulation. Specifically, hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), which are high-frequency neural oscillations supporting memory consolidation and foraging decisions, have been shown to reduce peripheral glucose levels. However, whether SWRs are enhanced by recent feeding-when the need for glucose metabolism increases, and if so, whether feeding-dependent modulation of SWRs is communicated to other brain regions involved in metabolic regulation-remains unknown. To address these gaps, we recorded SWRs from the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus of mice during sleep sessions before and after consumption of meals of varying caloric values. We found that SWRs occurring during sleep are significantly enhanced following food intake, with the magnitude of enhancement being dependent on the caloric content of the meal. This pattern occurred under both food-deprived and ad libitum feeding conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which are known to regulate food intake, exhibit a robust SWR-triggered increase in activity. These findings identify the satiety state as a factor modulating SWRs and suggest that hippocampal-lateral hypothalamic communication is a potential mechanism by which SWRs could modulate peripheral metabolism and food intake.

AB  - Ethylamine (EA), the precursor of theanine biosynthesis, is synthesized from alanine decarboxylation by alanine decarboxylase (AlaDC) in tea plants. AlaDC evolves from serine decarboxylase (SerDC) through neofunctionalization and has lower catalytic activity. However, lacking structure information hinders the understanding of the evolution of substrate specificity and catalytic activity. In this study, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of AlaDC from Camellia sinensis (CsAlaDC) and SerDC from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSerDC). Tyr(341) of AtSerDC or the corresponding Tyr(336) of CsAlaDC is essential for their enzymatic activity. Tyr(111) of AtSerDC and the corresponding Phe(106) of CsAlaDC determine their substrate specificity. Both CsAlaDC and AtSerDC have a distinctive zinc finger and have not been identified in any other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases. Based on the structural comparisons, we conducted mutation screen of CsAlaDC. The results indicated that the mutation of L110F or P114A in the CsAlaDC dimerization interface significantly improved the catalytic activity by 110% and 59%, respectively. Combining a double mutant of CsAlaDC(L110F/P114A) with theanine synthetase increased theanine production 672% in an in vitro system. This study provides the structural basis for the substrate selectivity and catalytic activity of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC and provides a route to more efficient biosynthesis of theanine.

AB  - Background Elephant seals exhibit extreme hypoxemic tolerance derived from repetitive hypoxia/reoxygenation episodes they experience during diving bouts. Real-time assessment of the molecular changes underlying protection against hypoxic injury in seals remains restricted by their at-sea inaccessibility. Hence, we developed a proliferative arterial endothelial cell culture model from elephant seals and used RNA-seq, functional assays, and confocal microscopy to assess the molecular response to prolonged hypoxia.Results Seal and human endothelial cells exposed to 1% O2 for up to 6 h respond differently to acute and prolonged hypoxia. Seal cells decouple stabilization of the hypoxia-sensitive transcriptional regulator HIF-1 alpha from angiogenic signaling. Rapid upregulation of genes involved in glutathione (GSH) metabolism supports the maintenance of GSH pools, and intracellular succinate increases in seal but not human cells. High maximal and spare respiratory capacity in seal cells after hypoxia exposure occurs in concert with increasing mitochondrial branch length and independent from major changes in extracellular acidification rate, suggesting that seal cells recover oxidative metabolism without significant glycolytic dependency after hypoxia exposure.Conclusions We found that the glutathione antioxidant system is upregulated in seal endothelial cells during hypoxia, while this system remains static in comparable human cells. Furthermore, we found that in contrast to human cells, hypoxia exposure rapidly activates HIF-1 in seal cells, but this response is decoupled from the canonical angiogenesis pathway. These results highlight the unique mechanisms that confer extraordinary tolerance to limited oxygen availability in a champion diving mammal.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP), the downstream effector of the evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway, promotes cellular proliferation and coordinates certain regenerative responses in mammals. Small molecule activators of YAP may, therefore, display therapeutic utility in treating disease states involving insufficient proliferative repair. From a high-throughput chemical screen of the comprehensive drug repurposing library ReFRAME, here we report the identification of SM04690, a clinical stage inhibitor of CLK2, as a potent activator of YAP-driven transcriptional activity in cells. CLK2 inhibition promotes alternative splicing of the Hippo pathway protein AMOTL2, producing an exon-skipped gene product that can no longer associate with membrane-bound proteins, resulting in decreased phosphorylation and membrane localization of YAP. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which pharmacological perturbation of alternative splicing inactivates the Hippo pathway and promotes YAP-dependent cellular growth.

AB  - Lignocellulosic fillers have been widely investigated for various polymer resin applications since they have great potential for using wood biomass and recycled plastics. However, besides cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and nanofibrils (CNF), not much of the other lignocellulose has been used for UV-curing resins. Even more so, none has been used in hybrid lignocellulose combination compositions. In the present work, the effects of hybrid lignocellulose fillers such as lignin (LN)/CNC/CNF/ hemicellulose (HC) with ratio-varying compositions on UV-curing biobased resins have been investigated for wood-mimic material coating applications. The hybrid filler effects on the macromolecular chain network, surface morphology, thermomechanical properties, and thermostability were carefully studied. A combination of scanning electron microscopy, DMA Cole-Cole plot, contact angle, etc., allowed getting a sense of hybrid filler distribution and interaction within the polymer matrix. It was identified that an increase in the HC content of up to 38% contributes to more even particle distribution and achieves a maximum double bond conversion rate of about 80%. HC also contributes to porous surface structure, while CNC smooths surface morphology, and, in turn, CNF increases defects. Thermomechanical testing revealed the unique benefit of hybrid reinforcement, showing higher results than single-filler compositions despite the general decrease after incorporation of 5 wt % LN. The storage modulus showed a fourfold increase for 5 wt % LN composition. The observed enormous property enhancement has been attributed to the benefits of hybrid fillers, which mitigate characteristic radical scavenging properties of LN and strongly reduce general filler aggregation, allowing more even filler dispersion while also improving filler-matrix interface synergy. Seventeen different compositions clearly, in comparison to single fillers, show the benefit of hybrid lignocellulosic reinforcement and testify to the ability to precisely tune up material performance and achieve wood structure-mimicking coating materials.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease involving genetic and epigenetic factors, such as miRNAs. Sequencing-based studies have revealed that miRNAs have many isoforms (isomiRs) with modifications at the 3 '- and 5 '-ends or in the middle, resulting in distinct targetomes and, consequently, functions. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the putative targets and functional role of miR-1246 and its two 5 '-isoforms (ISO-miR-1246_a and ISO-miR-1246_G) in vitro. Commercial Caco-2 cells of CRC origin were analyzed for the expression of WT-miR-1246 and its 5 '-isoforms using small RNA sequencing data, and the overabundance of the two miR-1246 isoforms was determined in cells. The transcriptome analysis of Caco-2 cells transfected with WT-miR-1246, ISO-miR-1246_G, and ISO-miR-1246_a indicated the minor overlap of the targetomes between the studied miRNA isoforms. Consequently, an enrichment analysis showed the involvement of the potential targets of the miR-1246 isoforms in distinct signaling pathways. Cancer-related pathways were predominantly more enriched in dysregulated genes in ISO-miR-1246_G and ISO-miR-1246_a, whereas cell cycle pathways were more enriched in WT-miR-1246. The functional analysis of WT-miR-1246 and its two 5 '-isoforms revealed that the inhibition of any of these molecules had a tumor-suppressive role (reduced cell viability and migration and promotion of early cell apoptosis) in CRC cells. However, the 5 '-isoforms had a stronger effect on viability compared with WT-miR-1246. To conclude, this research shows that WT-miR-1246 and its two 5 '-isoforms have different targetomes and are involved in distinct signaling pathways but collectively play an important role in CRC pathogenesis.

AB  - Aims: Hypoxia ischemia (HI) is a leading cause of cerebral palsy and long-term neurological sequelae in infants. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons contributes to HI brain damage, this study aimed to investigate the regulatory role of miR-9-5p in mitochondrial function following HI injury.Results: Overexpression of miR-9-5p in HI mice or H2O2-exposed PC12 cells suppressed neuronal injury, associated with increased mitochondrial copy number, normalizing mitochondrial membrane potential, improved nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation, and downregulation of Keap1. This was mediated, in part, through the ability of this miR-9-5p to bind and regulate the transcriptional activity of zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 20 (ZBTB20). Further study suggested that the knockdown of ZBTB20 exerts neuroprotection by inhibiting Nrf2/Keap1 interaction to promote the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and the consequent expression of antioxidant proteins. Notably, the protective effects of miR-9-5p overexpression against HI-induced mitochondrial damage were reversed by the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385. Finally, the utilization of liposomes for the delivery of miR-9-5p (miR-9-5p@Lip) presents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HI injury.Innovation: miR-9-5p is a potential therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke through its modulation of the ZBTB20/Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway, influencing mitochondrial function and antioxidant response. Furthermore, the use of liposomal delivery for miR-9-5p offers a promising therapeutic strategy for HI injury.Conclusion: Overexpression of miR-9-5p protects against cerebral HI injury by modulating mitochondrial function through the ZBTB20/Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and warrants further study as well as timely treatment. Additionally, the mechanisms of the brain's intrinsic defense against chronic injury are not yet fully understood. Herein, we examined the response of the main neurogenic niches to amyloid exposure and the associated changes in structure and synaptic activity. Flow cytometry of Nestin-, Vimentin-, Nestin/Vimentin-, NeuN-, GFAP-, NeuN/GFAP-, NSE-, BrdU-, Wnt-, BrdU/Wnt-, VEGF-, Sox14-, VEGF/Sox14-, Sox10-, Sox2-, Sox10/Sox2-, Bax-, and Bcl-xL-positive cells was performed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), hippocampus, and cerebral cortex of rat brains on 90th day after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) single injection of a fraction of beta-amyloid (A beta) (1-42). The relative structural changes in these areas and disruptions to synaptic activity in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampus circuit were also evaluated. Our flow analyses revealed a reduction in the numbers of Nestin-, Vimentin-, and Nestin/Vimentin-positive cells in neurogenic niches and the olfactory bulb. These changes were accompanied by an increased number of BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampus and SVZ. The latter changes were strongly correlated with changes in the numbers of VEGF- and VEGF/Sox14-positive cells. The morphological changes were characterized by significant neural loss, a characteristic shift in entorhinal cortex-hippocampus circuit activity, and decreased spontaneous alternation in a behavioral test. We conclude that although an injection of A beta (1-42) induced stem cell proliferation and triggered neurogenesis at a certain stage, this process was incomplete and led to neural stem cell immaturity. We propose the idea of enhancing adult neurogenesis as a promising strategy for preventing dementia at healthy elderly people andpeople at high risk for developing AD, or treating patients diagnosed with AD.

AB  - Endogenous anticonvulsant mechanisms represent a reliable and currently underdeveloped strategy against recurrent seizures and may recall novel original therapeutics. Here, we investigated whether the intensification of the astroglial Glu-GABA exchange mechanism by application of the GABA precursor putrescine (PUT) may be effective against convulsive and non-convulsive seizures. We explored the potential of PUT to inhibit spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in WAG/Rij rats, a genetic model of absence epilepsy. Significant shortening of SWDs in response to intraperitoneally applied PUT has been observed, which could be antagonized by blocking GAT-2/3-mediated astrocytic GABA release with the specific inhibitor SNAP-5114. Direct application of exogenous GABA also reduced SWD duration, suggesting that PUT-triggered astroglial GABA release through GAT-2/3 may be a critical step in limiting seizure duration. PUT application also dose-dependently shortened seizure-like events (SLEs) in the low-[Mg2+] in vitro model of temporal lobe epilepsy. SNAP-5114 reversed the antiepileptic effect of PUT in the in vitro model as well, further confirming that PUT reduces seizure duration by triggering glial GABA release. In accordance, we observed that PUT specifically reduces the frequency of excitatory synaptic potentials, suggesting that it specifically acts at excitatory synapses. We also identified that PUT specifically eliminated the tonic depolarization-induced desynchronization of SLEs. Since PUT is an important source of glial GABA and we previously showed significant GABA release, it is suggested that the astroglial Glu-GABA exchange mechanism plays a key role in limiting ictal discharges, potentially opening up novel pathways to control seizure propagation and generalization.

AB  - Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug during pregnancy, however, the effects of gestational exposure to Cannabis smoke (CS) on the central nervous system development remain uncharacterised. This study investigates the effects of maternal CS inhalation on brain function in the offspring. Pregnant mice were exposed daily to 5 min of CS during gestational days (GD) 5.5-17.5. On GD 18.5 half of the dams were euthanized for foetus removal. The offspring from the remaining dams were euthanized on postnatal days (PND) 20 and 60 for evaluation. Brain volume, cortex cell number, SOX2, histone-H3, parvalbumin, NeuN, and BDNF immunoreac-tivity were assessed in all groups. In addition, levels of NeuN, CB1 receptor, and BDNF expression were assessed and cortical primary neurons from rats were treated with Cannabis smoke extract (CSE) for assessment of cell viability. We found that male foetuses from the CS exposed group had decreased brain volume, whereas mice at PND 60 from the exposed group presented with increased brain volume. Olfactory bulb and diencephalon vol-ume were found lower in foetuses exposed to CS. Mice at PND 60 from the exposed group had a smaller volume in the thalamus and hypothalamus while the cerebellum presented with a greater volume. Also, there was an increase in cortical BDNF immunoreactivity in CS exposed mice at PND 60. Protein expression analysis showed an increase in pro-BDNF in foetus brains exposed to CS. Mice at PND 60 presented an increase in mature BDNF in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the exposed group and a higher CB1 receptor expression in the PFC. Moreover, hippocampal NeuN expression was higher in adult animals from the exposed group. Lastly, treatment of cortical primary neurons with doses of CSE resulted in decreased cell viability. These findings highlight the potential negative neurodevelopmental outcomes induced by gestational CS exposure.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that Hypocretin (HCRT, Orexin) are involved in stress regulation of depression through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the molecular mechanism by which Hypocretin regulate neurobiological responses is unknown. Herein, the effects of chronic stress on the epigenetic modification of HCRT and its association with depression were explored with regard to a potential role in cancer progression. In the study, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used to establish an animal model of cancer with depressi on by administrating n-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). RNA-sequencing was used to detect differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of rats and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the results of RNA-sequencing. The status of HCRT promoter methylation was assessed by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction. Behavioral tests showed that rats exposed to CUMS had significant depressive-like behaviors. The number of liver tumors and tumor load in depressed rats exposed to CUMS was higher than in SD rats without CUMS. RNA-sequencing revealed that HCRT was one of the most siginificantly downregulated gene in the hippocampus of SD rats with CUMS compared to non-stressed group, which was validated by qRT-PCR. HCRT mRNA expression was downregulated and the promoter for HCRT was hyper-methylated in those with depression. These results identified a critical role for chronic psychological stressors in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, via epigenetic HCRT downregulation. Such epigenetic downregulation may be the molecular basis for the association of cancer with depression. Copyright 2020, Chongqing Medical University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work focuses on the role of NiB and ZrB2 addition on density, structural evolution, mechanical and thermal properties of 90W-6Ni-4Co (wt%) heavy alloys. The investigated tungsten heavy alloys were sintered at 1485 degrees C and 1500 degrees C with a holding time of 75 min in H-2 atmosphere. Compared to the base alloy 90W-6Ni-4Co, the NiB-substituted alloys showed improved densification at both sintering temperatures. An in-depth study of the phase and microstructure of the 1500 degrees C sintered samples was carried out. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the presence of ZrO2 in ZrB2 containing WHAs. Microstructural analysis affirms that ZrB2 incorporation attributes for grain size refinement in sintered alloys. Furthermore, the elephant foot formation in the sintered samples was avoided by incorporating NiB individually or in combination with ZrB2 dispersoids. The distortion parameter (delta) of the samples sintered at 1500 degrees C was found to be decreased from 24.83 (0 wt% ZrB2) to 6.36 (2 wt% ZrB2). On the other hand, the combined addition of NiB and ZrB2 provides better shape retention with delta=2.82 for the tungsten heavy alloys with 3 wt% NiB and 2 wt% ZrB2. The maximum compressive stress of similar to 2000 MPa was obtained in the 89W-6Ni-4Co-1ZrB(2) samples. The maximum and minimum bulk hardness of 432 +/- 5 HV3 and 365 +/- 9 HV3 was obtained for 88W-3Ni-3NiB-4Co-2ZrB(2) and 90W-6Ni-4Co heavy alloys. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the 90W-6Ni-4Co alloy was found to be the highest (7.65 x 10(-6) /degrees C), which was reduced to 7.1 x 10(-6) /degrees C and 6.8 x 10(-6) /degrees C with the incorporation of 1 and 2 wt% ZrB2 respectively. W-rich channels were noticed in the microstructure of 1500 degrees C sintered samples. Overall, W-Ni/NiB-Co-ZrB2 alloys are very effective in enhancing the mechanical properties and distortion behavior compared to W-Ni-Co alloys.

AB  - The nature of brain impairment after hypoxia is complex and recovery harnesses different mechanisms, including neuroprotection and neurogenesis. Experimental evidence suggests that hypoxia may trigger neurogenesis postnatally by influencing the expression of a variety of transcription factors. However, the existing data are controversial. As a proof-of-principle, we subjected cultured cerebral cortex neurons, cerebellar granule neurons and organotypic cerebral cortex slices from rat brains to hypoxia and treated these cultures with the hormone ghrelin, which is well-known for its neuroprotective functions. We found that hypoxia elevated the expression levels and stimulated nuclear translocation of ghrelin's receptor GHSR1 in the cultured neurons and the acute organotypic slices, whereas ghrelin treatment reduced the receptor expression to normoxic levels. GHSR1 expression was also increased in cerebral cortex neurons of mice with induced experimental stroke. Additional quantitative analyses of immunostainings for neuronal proliferation and differentiation markers revealed that hypoxia stimulated the proliferation of neuronal progenitors, whereas ghrelin application during the phase of recovery from hypoxia counteracted these effects. At the mechanistic level, we provide a link between the described post-ischemic phenomena and the expression of the transcription factor Pax6, an important regulator of neural progenitor cell fate. In contrast to the neurogenic niches in the brain where hypoxia is known to increase Pax6 expression, the levels of the transcription factor in cultured hypoxic cerebral cortex cells were downregulated. Moreover, the application of ghrelin to hypoxic neurons normalised the expression levels of these factors. Our findings suggest that ghrelin stimulates neurogenic factors for the protection of neurons in a GHSR1-dependent manner in non-neurogenic brain areas such as the cerebral cortex after exposure to hypoxia.

AB  - Neuronal activity in the hippocampus is critical for many types of memory acquisition and retrieval and influences an animal's response to stress. Moreover, the molecularly distinct principal neurons of hippocampal area CA2 are required for social recognition memory and aggression in mice. To interrogate the effects of stress on CA2-dependent behaviors, we chemogenetically manipulated neuronal activity in vivo during an acute, socially derived stressor and tested whether memory for the defeat was influenced. One day after an acute social defeat (aSD), defeated mice spent significantly less time investigating another mouse when compared to non-defeated control mice. We found that this avoidant phenotype persisted for up to one month following a single defeat encounter. When CA2 pyramidal neuron activity was inhibited with Gi-DREADD receptors during the defeat, subject mice exhibited a significantly higher amount of social avoidance one day later when compared to defeated littermates not expressing DREADDs. Moreover, CA2 inhibition during defeat caused a reduction in submissive defense behaviors in response to aggression. In vitro electrophysiology and tracing experiments revealed a circuit wherein CA2 neurons connect to caudal CA1 projection neurons that, in turn, project to corticolimbic regions including the anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, socially avoidant, defeated mice exhibited significant reductions in cFos expression in caudal hippocampal and limbic brain areas during a social investigation task 24 h after aSD. Taken together, these results indicate that CA2 neuronal activity is required to support behavioral resilience following an acute social stressor and that submissive defensive behavior during the defeat (vs. fleeing) is a predictor of future resilience to social stress. Furthermore, CA2 preferentially targets a population of caudal CA1 projection neurons that contact cortical brain regions where activity is modulated by an acute social stressor.

AB  - Noninvasive biomarkers of early neuronal injury may help identify cognitively normal individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) method allows assessing cortical microstructure via cortical mean diffusivity (cMD), suggested to be more sensitive than macrostructural neurodegeneration. Here, we aimed to investigate the association of cMD with amyloid-beta and tau pathology in older adults, and whether cMD predicts longitudinal cognitive decline, neurodegeneration and clinical progression. The study sample comprised n = 196 cognitively normal older adults (mean[SD] 72.5 [9.4] years; 114 women [58.2%]) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. At baseline, all participants underwent structural MRI, DWI, C-11-Pittsburgh compound-B-PET, F-18-flortaucipir-PET imaging, and cognitive assessments. Longitudinal measures of Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite-5 were available for n = 186 individuals over 3.72 (1.96)-year follow-up. Prospective clinical follow-up was available for n = 163 individuals over 3.2 (1.7) years. Surface-based image analysis assessed vertex-wise relationships between cMD, global amyloid-beta, and entorhinal and inferior-temporal tau. Multivariable regression, mixed effects models and Cox proportional hazards regression assessed longitudinal cognition, brain structural changes and clinical progression. Tau, but not amyloid-beta, was positively associated with cMD in AD-vulnerable regions. Correcting for baseline demographics and cognition, increased cMD predicted steeper cognitive decline, which remained significant after correcting for amyloid-beta, thickness, and entorhinal tau; there was a synergistic interaction between cMD and both amyloid-beta and tau on cognitive slope. Regional cMD predicted hippocampal atrophy rate, independently from amyloid-beta, tau, and thickness. Elevated cMD predicted progression to mild cognitive impairment. Cortical microstructure is a noninvasive biomarker that independently predicts subsequent cognitive decline, neurodegeneration and clinical progression, suggesting utility in clinical trials.

AB  - Camellia oleifera, a woody oilseed species endemic to China, often experiences growth constraints due to seasonal drought. This study investigates the coordinated regulation of photosynthetic traits, stomatal behavior, and hormone responses during drought-rehydration cycles in two cultivars with contrasting drought resistance: 'CL53' (tolerant) and 'CL40' (sensitive). Photosynthetic inhibition resulted from both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations, with cultivar-specific differences. After 28 days of drought, the net photosynthetic rate (P-n) declined by 26.6% in CL53 and 32.6% in CL40. A stable intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) in CL53 indicated superior mesophyll integrity and antioxidant capacity. CL53 showed rapid P-n recovery and photosynthetic compensation post-rehydration, in contrast to CL40. Drought triggered extensive stomatal closure; >98% reopened upon rehydration, though the total stomatal pore area remained reduced. Abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation was greater in CL40, contributing to stomatal closure and P-n suppression. CL53 exhibited faster ABA degradation and gibberellin (GA(3)) recovery, promoting photosynthetic restoration. ABA negatively correlated with P-n, transpiration rate (T-r), stomatal conductance (G(s)), and C-i, but positively with stomatal limitation (L-s). Water use efficiency (WUE) displayed a parabolic response to ABA, differing by cultivar. This integrative analysis highlights a coordinated photosynthesis-stomata-hormone network underlying drought adaptation and informs selection strategies for drought-resilient cultivars and precision irrigation.

AB  - Locus coeruleus (LC) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown. Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine. Here, we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not.

AB  - The regeneration potential of the mammalian heart is incredibly limited, as cardiomyocyte proliferation ceases shortly after birth. beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) blockade has been shown to improve heart functions in response to injury; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we inhibited beta-AR signaling in the heart using metoprolol, a cardio-selective beta blocker for beta 1-adrenergic receptor (beta 1-AR) to examine its role in heart maturation and regeneration in postnatal mice. We found that metoprolol enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation and promoted cardiac regeneration post myocardial infarction, resulting in reduced scar formation and improved cardiac function. Moreover, the increased cardiomyocyte proliferation was also induced by the genetic deletion of Gnas, the gene encoding G protein alpha subunit (G alpha s), a downstream effector of beta-AR. Genome wide transcriptome analysis revealed that the Hippo-effector YAP, which is associated with immature cardiomyocyte proliferation, was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes of beta-blocker treated and Gnas cKO hearts. Moreover, the increased YAP activity is modulated by RhoA signaling. Our pharmacological and genetic studies reveal that beta 1-AR-G alpha s-YAP signaling axis is involved in regulating postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. These results suggest that inhibiting beta-AR-G alpha s signaling promotes the regenerative capacity and extends the cardiac regenerative window in juvenile mice by activating YAP-mediated transcriptional programs.

AB  - We investigated the relevance of the prostaglandin D2 pathway in Alzheimer's disease, because prostaglandin D2 is a major pros-taglandin in the brain. Thus, its contribution to Alzheimer's dis-ease merits attention, given the known impact of the prostaglandin E2 pathway in Alzheimer's disease. We used the TgF344-AD transgenic rat model because it exhibits age-dependent and progressive Alzheimer's disease pathology. Prostaglandin D2 levels in hippocampi of TgF344-AD and wild-type littermates were significantly higher than prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin D2 signals through DP1 and DP2 receptors. Microglial DP1 receptors were more abundant and neuronal DP2 receptors were fewer in TgF344-AD than in wild-type rats. Expression of the major brain prostaglandin D2 synthase (lipocalin-type PGDS) was the highest among 33 genes involved in the prostaglandin D2 and prosta-glandin E2 pathways. We treated a subset of rats (wild-type and TgF344-AD males) with timapiprant, a potent highly selective DP2 antagonist in development for allergic inflammation treatment. Timapiprant significantly mitigated Alzheimer's disease pathol-ogy and cognitive deficits in TgF344-AD males. Thus, selective DP2 antagonists have potential as therapeutics to treat Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Glutamate and GABA co-transmitting neurons exist in several brain regions; however, the mechanism by which these two neurotransmitters are co-released from the same synaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, we show that the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) to dentate granule cell synapses, which co-release glutamate and GABA, exhibit differences between glutamate and GABA release properties in paired-pulse ratio, Ca2+-sensitivity, presynaptic receptor modulation, and Ca2+ channel-vesicle coupling configuration. Moreover, uniquantal synaptic responses show independent glutamatergic and GABAergic responses. Morphological analysis reveals that most SuM terminals form distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in proximity, each characterized by GluN1 and GABA(A)alpha 1 labeling, respectively. Notably, glutamate/GABA co-transmission exhibits distinct short-term plasticities, with frequency-dependent depression of glutamate and frequency-independent stable depression of GABA. Our findings suggest that glutamate and GABA are co-released from different synaptic vesicles within the SuM terminals, and reveal that distinct transmission modes of glutamate/GABA co-release serve as frequency-dependent filters of SuM inputs.

AB  - Patient-derived organoids grown in three-dimensional cultures provide an excellent platform for phenotypic high-throughput screening and drug-response research. Organoid technology has been applied to study stem cell biology and various human pathologies. This study investigates the characteristics and cellular morphology of organoids derived from primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients. Nasal organoids were cultured up to 20 days and morphological, cell composition and functional parameters were measured by immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, western blot and FACS analysis. The results showed that nasal organoids expressed the stem cell marker leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), and markers for apical junction genes, goblet cells and ciliated cells. Moreover, we were able to regrow and expand the nasal organoids well after freezing and thawing. This study provides an effective and feasible method for development of human nasal organoids, suitable for the phenotypic high-throughput screening and drug response research.

AB  - The present study was envisaged with an aim to evaluate the sero-positivity of Trypanosoma evansi antibodies in Indian elephants by using card agglutination test for trypanosomes (CATT/ T. evansi) and to assess haemato-biochemical alterations in positive cases. The blood samples were collected from ear veins of elephants (n = 12), kept at Mahendra Chaudhury Zoological Park, Chhatbir, Punjab. Agglutination patterns were scored as - (negative) and +, ++ or +++ (positive). One sample from female elephant was found strongly positive with +++ agglutination pattern, whereas one sample of male elephant was observed slightly positive (+). Significant hyperproteinaemia (p < 0.01), hyperglobulinemia (p < 0.05), leucocytosis (p < 0.05), and hyponatremia (p < 0.01) were amongst the haemato-biochemical alterations observed in sero-positive individuals. Molecular confirmation of T. evansi was also performed using polymerase chain reaction targeting VSG (RoTat 1.2) gene. The present study highlights the first record of card agglutination-based assessment of T. evansi in captive wild animals in India and also promulgates the haemato-biochemical responses in T. evansi sero-positive elephants.

AB  - The elucidation of the mechanisms whereby the liver maintains glucose homeostasis is crucial for the understanding of physiological and pathological states. Here, we show a novel role of hepatic transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR). TAZ is abundantly expressed in pericentral hepatocytes and its expression is markedly reduced by fasting. TAZ interacts via its WW domain with the ligand-binding domain of GR to limit the binding of GR to the GR response element in gluconeogenic gene promoters. Therefore, liver-specific TAZ knockout mice show increases in glucose production and blood glucose concentration. Conversely, the overexpression of TAZ in mouse liver reduces the binding of GR to gluconeogenic gene promoters and glucose production. Thus, our findings demonstrate that hepatic TAZ inhibits GR transactivation of gluconeogenic genes and coordinates gluconeogenesis in response to physiological fasting and feeding.

AB  - Self-motion signals, distributed ubiquitously across parietal-temporal lobes, propagate to limbic hippocampal system for vector-based navigation via hubs including posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Although numerous studies have indicated posterior cingulate areas are involved in spatial tasks, it is unclear how their neurons represent self-motion signals. Providing translation and rotation stimuli to macaques on a 6-degree-of-freedom motion platform, we discovered robust vestibular responses in PCC. A combined three-dimensional spatiotemporal model captured data well and revealed multiple temporal components including velocity, acceleration, jerk, and position. Compared to PCC, RSC contained moderate vestibular temporal modulations and lacked significant spatial tuning. Visual self-motion signals were much weaker in both regions compared to the vestibular signals. We conclude that macaque posterior cingulate region carries vestibular-dominant self-motion signals with plentiful temporal components that could be useful for path integration.

AB  - Wong et al., 2019 used a sensory preconditioning protocol to examine how sensory and fear memories are integrated in the rat medial temporal lobe. In this protocol, rats integrate a sound-light (sensory) memory that forms in stage 1 with a light-shock (fear) memory that forms in stage 2 to generate fear responses (freezing) across test presentations of the sound in stage 3. Here, we advance this research by showing that (1) how/when rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories (online in stage 2 or at test in stage 3) changes with the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1; and (2) regardless of how/when it occurs, the integration requires communication between two regions of the medial temporal lobe: the perirhinal cortex and basolateral amygdala complex. Thus, 'event familiarity' determines how/when sensory and fear memories are integrated but not the circuitry by which the integration occurs: this remains the same.

AB  - The theta rhythm, a quasi-periodic 4-10 Hz oscillation, is observed during memory processing in the hippocampus, with different phases of theta hypothesized to separate independent streams of information related to the encoding and recall of memories. At the cellular level, the discovery of hippocampal memory cells (engram neurons), as well as the modulation of memory recall through optogenetic activation of these cells, has provided evidence that certain memories are stored, in part, in a sparse ensemble of neurons in the hippocampus. In previous research, however, engram reactivation has been carried out using open-loop stimulation at fixed frequencies; the relationship between engram neuron reactivation and ongoing network oscillations has not been taken into consideration. To address this concern, we implemented a closed-loop reactivation of engram neurons that enabled phase-specific stimulation relative to theta oscillations in the local field potential in CA1. Using this real-time approach, we tested the impact of activating dentate gyrus engram neurons during the peak (encoding phase) and trough (recall phase) of theta oscillations. Consistent with previously hypothesized functions of theta oscillations in memory function, we show that stimulating dentate gyrus engram neurons at the trough of theta is more effective in eliciting behavioral recall than either fixed-frequency stimulation or stimulation at the peak of theta. Moreover, phase-specific trough stimulation is accompanied by an increase in the coupling between gamma and theta oscillations in CA1 hippocampus. Our results provide a causal link between phase-specific activation of engram cells and the behavioral expression of memory.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deficits in learning and memory. A pathological feature of AD is the alterations in the number and size of synapses, axon length, dendritic complexity, and dendritic spine numbers in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Treadmill exercise can enhance synaptic plasticity in mouse or rat models of stroke, ischemia, and dementia. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of treadmill exercise on learning and memory, and structural synaptic plasticity in 3xTg-AD mice, a mouse model of AD. Here, we show that 12 weeks treadmill exercise beginning in three-month-old mice improves spatial working memory in six-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, while non-exercise six-month-old 3xTg-AD mice exhibited impaired spatial working memory. To investigate potential mechanisms for the treadmill exercise-induced improvement of spatial learning and memory, we examined structural synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of six-month-old 3xTg-AD mice that had undergone 12 weeks of treadmill exercise. We found that treadmill exercise led to increases in synapse numbers, synaptic structural parameters, the expression of synaptophysin (Syn, a presynaptic marker), the axon length, dendritic complexity, and the number of dendritic spines in 3xTg-AD mice and restored these parameters to similar levels of non-Tg control mice without treadmill exercise. In addition, treadmill exercise also improved these parameters in non-Tg control mice. Strengthening structural synaptic plasticity may represent a potential mechanism by which treadmill exercise prevents decline in spatial learning and memory and synapse loss in 3xTg-AD mice.

AB  - Cognitive control tasks require using one class of information while ignoring competing classes of information. The central role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in cognitive control is well established in the primate literature and largely accepted in the rodent literature because mPFC damage causes deficits in tasks that may require cognitive control, as inferred, typically from the task design. In prior work, we used an active place avoidance task where a rat or mouse on a rotating arena is required to avoid the stationary task-relevant locations of a mild shock and ignore the rotating task-irrelevant locations of those shocks. The task is impaired by hippocampal manipulations, and the discharge of hippocampal place cell populations judiciously alternates between representing stationary locations near the shock zone and rotating locations far from the shock zone, demonstrating cognitive control concurrently in behavior and the hippocampal representation of spatial information. Here, we test whether rat mPFC lesion impairs the active place avoidance task to evaluate two competing hypotheses, a 'central-computation' hypothesis that the mPFC is essential for the computations required for cognitive control and an alternative 'local-computation' hypothesis that other brain areas can perform the computations required for cognitive control, independent of mPFC. Ibotenic acid lesion of the mPFC was effective, damaging the cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices. The lesion also altered the normal coordination of metabolic activity across remaining structures. The lesion did not impair learning to avoid the initial location of shock or long-term place avoidance memory, but impaired avoidance after the shock was relocated. The lesion also did not impair the alternation between task-relevant and task-irrelevant hippocampal representations of place information. These findings support the local-computation hypothesis that computations required for cognitive control can occur locally in brain networks independently of the mPFC.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is a multifactorial disease influenced by aging, genetics, and environmental factors. miRNAs are crucial regulators of gene expression and play significant roles in AD onset and progression. This exploratory study analyzed the expression levels of 28 genes and 5 miRNAs (miR-124-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-155-5p) related to AD pathology and neuroimmune responses using RT-qPCR. Analyses were conducted in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) of the 5xFAD mouse AD model at 6 and 9 months old. Data highlighted upregulated genes encoding for glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (Trem2) and cystatin F (Cst7), in the 5xFAD mice at both regions and ages highlighting their roles as critical disease players and potential biomarkers. Overexpression of genes encoding for CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (Cebpa) and myelin proteolipid protein (Plp) in the PFC, as well as for BCL2 apoptosis regulator (Bcl2) and purinergic receptor P2Y12 (P2yr12) in the HPC, together with upregulated microRNA(miR)-146a-5p in the PFC, prevailed in 9-month-old animals. miR-155 positively correlated with miR-146a and miR-21 in the PFC, and miR-125b positively correlated with miR-155, miR-21, while miR-146a in the HPC. Correlations between genes and miRNAs were dynamic, varying by genotype, region, and age, suggesting an intricate, disease-modulated interaction between miRNAs and target pathways. These findings contribute to our understanding of miRNAs as therapeutic targets for AD, given their multifaceted effects on neurons and glial cells.

AB  - Upregulation of genes and coexpression networks related to immune function and inflammation have been repeatedly reported in the brain of individuals with schizophrenia. However, a causal relationship between the abnormal immune/inflammation-related gene expression and schizophrenia has not been determined. We conducted co-expression networks using publicly available RNA-seq data from prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HP) of 64 individuals with schizophrenia and 64 unaffected controls from the SMRI tissue collections. We identified proinflammatory cytokine, transmembrane tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tmTNF alpha), as a potential regulator in the module of co-expressed genes that we find related to the immune/inflammation response in endothelial cells (ECs) and/or microglia of the brain of individuals with schizophrenia. The immune/inflammation-related modules associated with schizophrenia and the TNF signaling pathway that regulate the network were replicated in an independent cohort of brain samples from 68 individuals with schizophrenia and 135 unaffected controls. To investigate the association between the overexpression of tmTNF alpha in brain ECs and schizophrenia-like behaviors, we induced short-term overexpression of the uncleavable form of (uc)-tmTNF alpha in ECs of mouse brain for 7 weeks. We found schizophrenia-relevant behavioral deficits in these mice, including cognitive impairment, abnormal sensorimotor gating, and sensitization to methamphetamine (METH) induced locomotor activity and METH-induced neurotransmitter levels. These uc-tmTNF alpha effects were mediated by TNF receptor2 (TNFR2) and induced activation of TNFR2 signaling in astrocytes and neurons. A neuronal module including neurotransmitter signaling pathways was down-regulated in the brain of mice by the short-term overexpression of the gene, while an immune/inflammation-related module was up-regulated in the brain of mice after long-term expression of 22 weeks. Our results indicate that tmTNF alpha may play a direct role in regulating neurotransmitter signaling pathways that contribute to the clinical features of schizophrenia.

AB  - Animals have developed scent-triggered avoidance for threat evasion and survival. Here, we found that aphids exhibit a unique heat-guided herbivore-avoidance mechanism. We identified the TRP channel ApisTRPA1 in Acyrthosiphon pisum as a key receptor for sensing rapid temperature increases. Two isoforms of ApisTRPA1, ApisTRPA1-A and ApisTRPA1-B, are both expressed in neurons located in the primary rhinaria, which are essential for acute heat detection. Among them, ApisTRPA1-B exhibits a stronger response to temperature gradients. These findings shed light on aphid physiological adaptations to thermal cues and may inform the development of eco-friendly aphid management strategies.

AB  - Preeclampsia (PE) is a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the impact of PE on progeny ASD are not fully understood, which hinders the development of effective therapeutic approaches. This study shows the offspring born to a PE mouse model treated phenotypes, including neurodevelopment deficiency and behavioral abnormalities. Transcriptomic analysis of the embryonic cortex and adult offspring hippocampus suggested the expression of ASD-related genes was dramatically changed. Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokines TNF alpha in maternal serum and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) signaling in the fetal cortex were elevated. Importantly, TNF alpha neutralization during pregnancy enabled to ameliorate ASD-like phenotypes and restore the NF kappa B activation level in the offspring exposed to PE. Furthermore, TNF alpha/NF kappa B signaling axis, but not L-NAME, caused deficits in neuroprogenitor cell proliferation and synaptic development. These experiments demonstrate that offspring exposed to PE phenocopies ASD signatures reported in humans and indicate therapeutic targeting of TNF alpha decreases the likelihood of bearing children with ASD phenotypes from PE mothers.

AB  - Dravet syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic variants in SCN1A encoding the Nav1.1 sodium channel subunit, characterized by treatment-resistant epilepsy, temperature-sensitive seizures, developmental delay/intellectual disability with features of autism spectrum disorder, and increased risk of sudden death. Convergent data suggest hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) pathology in DS (Scn1a(+/-)) mice. We performed two-photon calcium imaging in brain slice to uncover a profound dysfunction of filtering of perforant path input by DG in young adult Scn1a(+/-) mice. This was not due to dysfunction of DG parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons (PV-INs), which were only mildly impaired at this timepoint; however, we identified enhanced excitatory input to granule cells, suggesting that circuit dysfunction is due to excessive excitation rather than impaired inhibition. We confirmed that both optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal cortex and selective chemogenetic inhibition of DG PV-INs lowered seizure threshold in vivo in young adult Scn1a(+/-) mice. Optogenetic activation of PV-INs, on the other hand, normalized evoked responses in granule cells in vitro. These results establish the corticohippocampal circuit as a key locus of pathology in Scn1a(+/-) mice and suggest that PV-INs retain powerful inhibitory function and may be harnessed as a potential therapeutic approach toward seizure modulation.

AB  - Simple Summary Extinct giant birds have been a source of imagination, and knowledge of their incubation mechanics is crucial to our understanding of the evolution of avian reproduction. Despite the extensive studies on avian eggs, our understanding of the eggshell mechanics of giant birds, particularly the extinct ones, remains incomplete-most of these prior works were based on empirical or allometric relationships with limited quantitative analysis. In the present study, with the help of advanced three-dimensional computer simulation using data from published fossil records, we obtain more comprehensive quantitative analysis to answer important questions related to contact incubation of giant birds. Specifically, how much safety margin does the reversed sexual size dimorphism (RSSD) of moas provide? What is the theoretical upper limit of body mass for contact incubation? Is the Williams' egg, or the putative Genyornis oological material (PGOM), really the egg of the extinct giant bird Genyornis newtoni, as commonly accepted since its discovery in 1981? Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to conduct mechanical analyses on eggshells of giant birds, and relate this to the evolution and reproductive behavior of avian species. We aim to (1) investigate mechanical characteristics of eggshell structures of various ratite species, enabling comparisons between species with or without reversed sexual size dimorphism (RSSD); (2) quantify the safety margin provided by RSSD; (3) determine whether the Williams' egg can have been incubated by an extinct giant bird Genyornis newtoni; (4) determine the theoretical maximum body mass for contact incubation. We use a dimensionless number C to quantify relative shell stiffness with respect to the egg size, allowing for comparison across wide body masses. We find that RSSD in moas significantly increases the safety margin of contact incubation by the lighter males. However, their safety margins are still smaller than those of the moa species without RSSD. Two different strategies were adopted by giant birds-one is RSSD and thinner shells, represented by some moa species; the other is no RSSD and regular shells, represented by the giant elephant bird. Finally, we predicted that the upper limit of body mass for contact incubation was 2000 kg.

AB  - The ability to distinguish strangers from familiar individuals is crucial for the survival of most mammalian species. In humans, an inability to recognize kin and familiar individuals and engage in appropriate behaviors is associated with several types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Mice preferentially spend more time investigating a novel individual relative to a familiar individual. Yet, how social novelty-related information drives increased investigation of the novel animal remains poorly understood. Recent evidence has implicated the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) as a key node in encoding information about conspecific identity. Of particular interest are vHPC projections to the lateral septum (LS), a region that has been implicated in driving a wide range of motivated social behaviors. In this study using chemogenetics, optogenetics, and monosynaptic rabies tracing, we identified a novel vHPC-LS-ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathway that is necessary for mice to preferentially investigate novel conspecifics. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we established that LS neurons make direct monosynaptic connections onto dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Thus, we have identified a potential pathway via which conspecific identity could be transformed to drive motivated social behaviors.

AB  - Simple Summary This study was aimed to explore the role of brain-derived estrogen (BDE2) in hippocampal neurogenesis with aging in female rats. Our results revealed that cell differentiation was significantly declined over the middle age (14-Mon), while the differentiation of astrocytes and microglia markedly elevated and exhibited excessive activation. The newborn immature neurons clustered in hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) area in 1-Mon juvenile, then sharply dropped thereafter and the number of neural stem cells declined over 14-Mon age. Female forebrain neuronal aromatase knockout (FBN-ARO-KO) rats showed declined neurogenesis in dentate gyrus (DG) region at 1, 6 and 18-Mon ages, compared to WT controls. In addition, letrozole suppressed neurogenesis at 1-Mon age. On the contrary, astrogenesis was elevated over middle age and FBN-ARO-KO promoted the differentiation and activation of astrocytes and microglia in the DG region. FBN-ARO-KO rats also displayed decreased levels of CREB-BDNF signal and cognitive-related proteins, as well as impaired spatial learning and memory in juvenile (1 Mon) and adulthood (6 Mon). Our results suggest that long-term shortage of aromatase-BDE2 signaling may accelerate brain inflammation by increase local gliogenesis and activation, and that BDE2 plays a key role for the maintaining of hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function. Although 17 & beta;-estradiol (E2) can be locally synthesized in the brain, whether and how brain-derived E2 (BDE2) impacts neurogenesis with aging is largely unclear. In this study, we examined the hippocampal neural stem cells, neurogenesis, and gliogenesis of 1, 3, 6, 14, and 18-month (Mon) female rats. Female forebrain neuronal aromatase knockout (FBN-ARO-KO) rats and letrozole-treated rats were also employed. We demonstraed that (1) the number of neural stem cells declined over 14-Mon age, and the differentiation of astrocytes and microglia markedly elevated and exhibited excessive activation. KO rats showed declines in astrocyte A2 subtype and elevation in A1 subtype at 18 Mon; (2) neurogenesis sharply dropped from 1-Mon age; (3) KO suppressed dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis at 1, 6 and 18 Mon. Additionally, KO and letrozole treatment led to declined neurogenesis at 1-Mon age, compared to age-matched WT controls; (4) FBN-ARO-KO inhibited CREB-BDNF activation, and decreased protein levels of neurofilament, spinophilin and PSD95. Notably, hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory was impaired in juvenile (1 Mon) and adulthood (6 Mon) KO rats. Taken together, we demonstrated that BDE2 plays a pivotal role for hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as learning and memory during female aging, especially in juvenile and middle age.

AB  - Hippocampal ripples are highly synchronous neural events critical for memory consolidation and retrieval. A minority of strong ripples has been shown to be of particular importance in situations of increased memory demands. The propagation dynamics of strong ripples inside the hippocampal formation are, however, still opaque. We analyzed ripple propagation within the hippocampal formation in a large open-access dataset comprising 267 Neuropixel recordings in 49 awake, head-fixed mice. Surprisingly, strong ripples (top 10% in ripple strength) propagate differentially depending on their generation point along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. The septal hippocampal pole is able to generate longer ripples that engage more neurons and elicit spiking activity for an extended time even at considerable distances. Accordingly, a substantial portion of the variance in strong ripple duration (R-2 = 0.463) is explained by the ripple generation location on the longitudinal axis, in agreement with a possible distinctive role of the hippocampal septal pole in conditions of high-memory demand. Moreover, we observed that the location of the ripple generation has a significant impact on the spiking rate modulation of different hippocampal subfields, even before the onset of the ripple. This finding suggests that ripple generation location plays a crucial role in shaping the neural activity across the hippocampus.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary selenium supplementation during the pre- and post-partum periods on milk production, blood parameters, reproductive performance in she-camels, and the growth of their offspring. Twenty pregnant Maghrabi she-camels, in their last three months of gestation, were randomly divided into four experimental groups and supplemented with selenium-methionine at levels of 0, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/kg diet. The experiment lasted 12 months, including a 3-month pre-partum and 9-month lactation period, during which the camels were fed a basal diet of concentrate feed, berseem hay, and rice straw. The results revealed that Se supplementation at all levels significantly increased placental weight and calf body weight at weaning, with the highest body weight and average daily gain observed in the 0.4 mg/kg group. Reproductive performance was also enhanced, with a reduction in postpartum first estrus interval and calving interval, particularly in the 0.4 mg/kg group. Milk production was significantly higher in Se-supplemented groups, with the 0.4 mg/kg group showing the longest lactation period and highest milk yield. Fat, lactose, and total solids yields improved, and Se concentration in milk increased with supplementation. Furthermore, Se supplementation led to improvements in blood biochemical parameters, including glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Hormone concentrations of T3, T4, P4, and E2 were significantly higher in Se-supplemented groups. In conclusion, dietary Se supplementation during the pre- and post-partum periods can significantly enhance reproductive performance, milk production in she-camels and growth performance of their offspring, with the greatest benefits observed at 0.4 mg/kg.

AB  - Optical report of neurotransmitter release allows visualisation of excitatory synaptic transmission. Sensitive genetically-encoded fluorescent glutamate reporters operating with a range of affinities and emission wavelengths are available. However, without targeting to synapses, the specificity of the fluorescent signal is uncertain, compared to sensors directed at vesicles or other synaptic markers. We fused the state-of-the-art reporter iGluSnFR to glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins in order to target it to postsynaptic sites. Chimeras of Stargazin and gamma-8 that we named SnFR-gamma 2 and SnFR-gamma 8, were enriched at synapses, retained function and reported spontaneous glutamate release in rat hippocampal cells, with apparently diffraction-limited spatial precision. In autaptic mouse neurons cultured on astrocytic microislands, evoked neurotransmitter release could be quantitatively detected at tens of synapses in a field of view whilst evoked currents were recorded simultaneously. These experiments revealed a specific postsynaptic deficit from Stargazin overexpression, resulting in synapses with normal neurotransmitter release but without postsynaptic responses. This defect was reverted by delaying overexpression. By working at different calcium concentrations, we determined that SnFR-gamma 2 is a linear reporter of the global quantal parameters and short-term synaptic plasticity, whereas iGluSnFR is not. On average, half of iGluSnFR regions of interest (ROIs) showing evoked fluorescence changes had intense rundown, whereas less than 5% of SnFR-gamma 2 ROIs did. We provide an open-source analysis suite for extracting quantal parameters including release probability from fluorescence time series of individual and grouped synaptic responses. Taken together, postsynaptic targeting improves several properties of iGluSnFR and further demonstrates the importance of subcellular targeting for optogenetic actuators and reporters.

AB  - In the Japanese rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus, various candidate genes required for a specific phenotype of interest are listed by next-generation sequencing analysis. Their functions were investigated using RNA interference (RNAi) method, the only gene function analysis tool for T. dichotomus developed so far. The summarized procedure for the RNAi method used for T. dichotomus is to synthesize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and inject it in larvae or pupae of T. dichotomus. Although some dedicated materials or equipment are generally required to inject dsRNA in insects, the advantage of the protocol described here is that it is possible to inject dsRNA in T. dichotomus with one syringe.

AB  - For an emerging disease like COVID-19, systems immunology tools may quickly identify and quantitatively characterize cells associated with disease progression or clinical response. With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease-specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders EXpanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both rare and common cells across human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells with highly similar phenotypes that localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specialized MHCII tetramer reagents that mark rhinovirus-specific CD4+ cells were left out during analysis and then used to test whether T-REX identified biologically significant cells. T-REX identified rhinovirus-specific CD4+ T cells based on phenotypically homogeneous cells expanding by >= 95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots of virus-specific T cells by comparing infection (day 7) to either pre-infection (day 0) or post-infection (day 28) samples. Plotting the direction and degree of change for each individual donor provided a useful summary view and revealed patterns of immune system behavior across immune monitoring settings. For example, the magnitude and direction of change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing a complete response to chemotherapy. Other COVID-19 patients instead displayed an immune trajectory like that seen in rhinovirus infection or checkpoint inhibitor therapy for melanoma. The T-REX algorithm thus rapidly identifies and characterizes mechanistically significant cells and places emerging diseases into a systems immunology context for comparison to well-studied immune changes.

TI  - NTRK1 knockdown induces mouse cognitive impairment and hippocampal neuronal damage through mitophagy suppression via inactivating the AMPK/ULK1/FUNDC1 pathway
T2  - CELL DEATH DISCOVERY

KW  - MITOCHONDRIAL
KW  - NEUROINFLAMMATION
AB  - Hippocampal neuronal damage may induce cognitive impairment. Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1 (NTRK1) reportedly regulates neuronal damage, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the role of NTRK1 in mouse hippocampal neuronal damage and the specific mechanism. A mouse NTRK1-knockdown model was established and subjected to pre-treatment with BAY-3827, followed by a behavioral test, Nissl staining, and NeuN immunofluorescence (IF) staining to evaluate the cognitive impairment and hippocampal neuronal damage. Next, an in vitro analysis was conducted using the CCK-8 assay, TUNEL assay, NeuN IF staining, DCFH-DA staining, JC-1 staining, ATP content test, mRFP-eGFP-LC3 assay, and LC3-II IF staining to elucidate the effect of NTRK1 on mouse hippocampal neuronal activity, apoptosis, damage, mitochondrial function, and autophagy. Subsequently, rescue experiments were performed by subjecting the NTRK1-knockdown neurons to pre-treatment with O304 and Rapamycin. The AMPK/ULK1/FUNDC1 pathway activity and mitophagy were detected using western blotting (WB) analysis. Resultantly, in vivo analysis revealed that NTRK1 knockdown induced mouse cognitive impairment and hippocampal tissue damage, in addition to inactivating the AMPK/ULK1/FUNDC1 pathway activity and mitophagy in the hippocampal tissues of mice. The treatment with BAY-3827 exacerbated the mouse depressive-like behavior induced by NTRK1 knockdown. The results of in vitro analysis indicated that NTRK1 knockdown attenuated viability, NeuN expression, ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitophagy, while enhancing apoptosis and ROS production in mouse hippocampal neurons. Conversely, pre-treatment with O304 and rapamycin abrogated the suppression of mitophagy and the promotion of neuronal damage induced upon NTRK1 silencing. Conclusively, NTRK1 knockdown induces mouse hippocampal neuronal damage through the suppression of mitophagy via inactivating the AMPK/ULK1/FUNDC1 pathway. This finding would provide insight leading to the development of novel strategies for the treatment of cognitive impairment induced due to hippocampal neuronal damage.

AB  - The atypical cadherins Fat and Dachsous (Ds) signal through the Hippo pathway to regulate growth of numerous organs, including the Drosophila wing. Here, we find that Ds-Fat signaling tunes a unique feature of cell proliferation found to control the rate of wing growth during the third instar larval phase. The duration of the cell cycle increases in direct proportion to the size of the wing, leading to linear-like growth during the third instar. Ds-Fat signaling enhances the rate at which the cell cycle lengthens with wing size, thus diminishing the rate of wing growth. We show that this results in a complex but stereotyped relative scaling of wing growth with body growth in Drosophila. Finally, we examine the dynamics of Fat and Ds protein distribution in the wing, observing graded distributions that change during growth. However, the significance of these dynamics is unclear since perturbations in expression have negligible impact on wing growth.

AB  - Oscillations of extracellular voltage, reflecting synchronous, rhythmic activity in large populations of neurons, are a ubiquitous feature in the mammalian brain, and are thought to subserve important, if not fully understood roles in normal and abnormal brain function. Oscillations at different frequency bands are hallmarks of specific brain and behavioral states. At the higher end of the spectrum, 150-200 Hz ripples occur in the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep, and ultrafast (400-600 Hz) oscillations arise in the somatosensory cortices of humans and several other mammalian species in response to peripheral nerve stimulation or punctate sensory stimuli. Here we report that brief optogenetic activation of thalamocortical axons, in brain slices from mouse somatosensory (barrel) cortex, elicited in the thalamorecipient layer local field potential (LFP) oscillations which we dubbed "ripplets". Ripplets originated in the postsynaptic cortical network and consisted of a precisely repeating sequence of 2-5 negative transients, closely resembling hippocampal ripples but, at similar to 400 Hz, over twice as fast. Fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons fired highly synchronous 400 Hz spike bursts entrained to the LFP oscillation, while regular-spiking (RS), excitatory neurons typically fired only 1-2 spikes per ripplet, in antiphase to FS spikes, and received synchronous sequences of alternating excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We suggest that ripplets are an intrinsically generated cortical response to a strong, synchronous thalamocortical volley, and could provide increased bandwidth for encoding and transmitting sensory information. Importantly, optogenetically induced ripplets are a uniquely accessible model system for studying synaptic mechanisms of fast and ultrafast cortical and hippocampal oscillations.

AB  - Lupus autoimmunity frequently presents with neuropsychiatric manifestations, but underlying etiology remains poorly under-stood. Human brain cytoplasmic 200 RNA (BC200 RNA) is a translational regulator in neuronal synapto-dendritic domains. Here, we show that a BC200 guanosine-adenosine dendritic transport motif is recognized by autoantibodies from a subset of neuropsychiatric lupus patients. These autoantibodies impact BC200 functionality by quasi irreversibly displacing two RNA transport factors from the guanosine-adenosine transport motif. Such anti-BC autoantibodies, which can gain access to brains of neuropsychiatric lupus patients, give rise to clinical manifesta-tions including seizures. To establish causality, naive mice with a permeabilized blood-brain barrier were injected with anti-BC autoantibodies from lupus patients with seizures. Animals so injected developed seizure susceptibility with high mortality. Seizure activity was entirely precluded when animals were in-jected with lupus anti-BC autoantibodies together with BC200 decoy autoantigen. Seizures are a common clinical manifestation in neuropsychiatric lupus, and our work identifies anti-BC au-toantibody activity as a mechanistic cause. The results demon-strate potential utility of BC200 decoys for autoantibody-specific therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric lupus.

AB  - Systems consolidation theories propose two mechanisms that enable the behavioral integration of related memories: coordinated reactivation between hippocampus and cortex, and the emergence of cortical traces that reflect overlap across memories. However, there is limited empirical evidence that links these mechanisms to the emergence of behavioral integration over time. In two experiments, participants implicitly encoded sequences of objects with overlapping structure. Assessment of behavioral integration showed that response times during a recognition task reflected behavioral priming between objects that never occurred together in time but belonged to overlapping sequences. This priming was consolidation-dependent and only emerged for sequences learned 24 hr prior to the test. Critically, behavioral integration was related to changes in neural pattern similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increases in post-learning rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and lateral occipital cortex. These findings suggest that memories with a shared predictive structure become behaviorally integrated through a consolidation-related restructuring of the learned sequences, providing insight into the relationship between different consolidation mechanisms that support behavioral integration.

AB  - The cellular mechanisms mediating norepinephrine (NE) functions in brain to result in behaviors are unknown. We identified the L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) Ca(V)1.2 as a principal target for G(q)-coupled alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors (ARs). alpha(1)AR signaling increased LTCC activity in hippocampal neurons. This regulation required protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated activation of the tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and, downstream, Src. Pyk2 and Src were associated with Ca(V)1.2. In model neuroendocrine PC12 cells, stimulation of PKC induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Ca(V)1.2, a modification abrogated by inhibition of Pyk2 and Src. Upregulation of LTCC activity by alpha(1)AR and formation of a signaling complex with PKC, Pyk2, and Src suggests that Ca(V)1.2 is a central conduit for signaling by NE. Indeed, a form of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in young mice requires both the LTCC and alpha(1)AR stimulation. Inhibition of Pyk2 and Src blocked this LTP, indicating that enhancement of Ca(V)1.2 activity via alpha(1)AR-Pyk2-Src signaling regulates synaptic strength.

AB  - Hippocampal ripples are transient population bursts that structure cortico-hippocampal communication and play a central role in memory processing. However, the mechanisms controlling ripple initiation in behaving animals remain poorly understood. Here we combine multisite extracellular and whole-cell recordings in awake mice to contrast the brain state and ripple modulation of subthreshold dynamics across hippocampal subfields. We find that entorhinal input to the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits UP and DOWN dynamics with ripples occurring exclusively in UP states. While elevated cortical input in UP states generates depolarization in DG and CA1, it produces persistent hyperpolarization in CA3 neurons. Furthermore, growing inhibition is evident in CA3 throughout the course of the ripple buildup, while DG and CA1 neurons exhibit depolarization transients 100 ms before and during ripples. These observations highlight the importance of CA3 inhibition for ripple generation, while pre-ripple responses indicate a long and orchestrated ripple initiation process in the awake state.

AB  - N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent short- and long-term types of potentiation (STP and LTP, respectively) are frequently studied in the CA1 area of dorsal hippocampal slices (DHS). Far less is known about the NMDAR dependence of STP and LTP in ventral hippocampal slices (VHS), where both types of potentiation are smaller in magnitude than in the DHS. Here, we first briefly review our knowledge about the NMDAR dependence of STP and LTP and some other forms of synaptic plasticity. We then show in new experiments that the decay of NMDAR-STP in VHS, similar to dorsal hippocampal NMDAR-STP, is not time- but activity-dependent. We also demonstrate that the induction of submaximal levels of NMDAR-STP and NMDAR-LTP in VHS differs from the induction of saturated levels of plasticity in terms of their sensitivity to subunit-preferring NMDAR antagonists. These data suggest that activation of distinct NMDAR subtypes in a population of neurons results in an incremental increase in the induction of different phases of potentiation with changing sensitivity to pharmacological agents. Differences in pharmacological sensitivity, which arise due to differences in the levels of agonist-evoked biological response, might explain the disparity of the results concerning NMDAR subunit involvement in the induction of NMDAR-dependent plasticity.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Long-term potentiation: 50 years on'.

AB  - Although fear memory formation is essential for survival and fear-related mental disorders, the neural circuitry and mechanism are incompletely understood. Here, we utilized trace fear conditioning to study the formation of trace fear memory in mice. We identified the entorhinal cortex (EC) as a critical component of sensory signaling to the amygdala. We adopted both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to demonstrate that release of the cholecystokinin (CCK) from the EC is required for trace fear memory formation. We discovered that CCK-positive neurons project from the EC to the lateral nuclei of the amygdala (LA), and inhibition of CCK-dependent signaling in the EC prevented long-term potentiation of the auditory response in the LA and formation of trace fear memory. In summary, high-frequency activation of EC neurons triggers the release of CCK in their projection terminals in the LA, potentiating auditory response in LA neurons. The neural plasticity in the LA leads to trace fear memory formation.

AB  - Natural polysaccharides have been recognized as major bioactive components in skincare and wound care products. In this study, the skincare benefits and self-healing properties of Lignosus rhinocerotis polysaccharides (LRP) and its degraded products (DLRP-1, DLRP-2 and DLRP-3) by ultrasound assisted H2O2/Vc treatment (U-H/ V) at different ultrasonic intensity (28.14, 70.35, and 112.56 W/cm2) were investigated. U-H/V altered the internal crystalline structure and microstructure of LRP, and enhanced the thermal stability. Due to the breakage of molecular chains after U-H/V, the moisture absorption of LRP was enhanced but the moisturizing property showed a different degree of reduction. U-H/V significantly improved the antioxidant, anti-tyrosinase and antiinflammatory activities of LRP. Furthermore, the results of enzyme kinetic studies showed a mixed competitivenoncompetitive inhibition of tyrosinase activity by DLRP-3 and the inhibition constant of DLRP-3 on tyrosinase was 2.97 mg/mL. The apparent viscosity of LRP dispersions showed a first increasing followed by decreasing trend as ultrasonic intensity rose. U-H/V enhanced the viscoelastic properties of LRP gels without destroying their self-healing properties. This findings reveal that U-H/V is beneficial for improving the skincare efficacy of LRP, providing a theoretical foundation for the applicability of LRP in wound dressings.

AB  - Introduction: The admission of the baby to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can be a stressful predicament for parents. This study aims to evaluate parental stress levels and the factors impacting them. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the NICU of a tertiary care centre for 3 months. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of demographic characteristics of parents, neonates and Parental Stressor Scale: NICU (PSS: NICU) to measure parental stress. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and an independent t-test. Results: P & LE; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Most of the parents reported medium stress levels (3-3.9). The mean total parental stress score of parents was 3.31 (0.36). Amongst the PSS: NICU subscales, the NICU sight and sound caused maximum stress to the parents (mean = 3.35 [0.48]) followed by the relationship with the baby and parental role (mean = 3.34 [0.44]). Mothers felt more stressed as compared to fathers (mean = 3.60 [0.23] vs. 3.08 [0.28]; P < 0.05). Conclusion: Higher parental stress levels were seen in lower age group (18-25 years), less than high school education, unemployed and previous history of neonatal death, outborn deliveries, pre-term (gestational age <37 weeks), birth weight <1500 g, longer duration of respiratory support (>3 days), intubated with ventilatory support, not started on feeds and not given kangaroo mother care. Parents of NICU-admitted neonates are under significant stress, and there is a necessity to provide family-centred care.

AB  - Simple Summary The porcine placenta has been traditionally used as a potential treatment for liver damage, and enzymatic porcine placenta hydrolysate (EPPH) may promote efficacy. However, there are few studies of EPPH to demonstrate exercise-induced physical and cognitive fatigue. Daily intake of EPPH rich in glycine, glutamate, arginine, alanine, leucine, lysine, and oligopeptides (0.16-0.31 mL/kg bw; 5 mg nitrogen/mL) alleviates exercise-induced fatigue in an animal model by decreasing fatigue-related metabolite concentrations, including lactate, blood urinary nitrogen, and creatinine, reducing liver damage, and increasing glycogen deposition in the liver and skeletal muscles. EPPH inhibits stress-related signaling and elevates hippocampal neurotrophic factors to improve cognitive function. EPPH also reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in the skeletal muscles, liver, and brain. These findings suggest that EPPH is a potential therapeutic agent for treating exercise-induced fatigue. Intense exercise is reported to induce physical and cognitive fatigue, but few studies have focused on treatments to alleviate fatigue. We hypothesized that the oral supplementation of enzymatic porcine placenta hydrolysate (EPPH) prepared using protease enzymes could alleviate exercise-induced fatigue in an animal model. The objectives of the study were to examine the hypothesis and the action mechanism of EPPH in relieving physical and cognitive fatigue. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 8 weeks (body weight: 201 g) were classified into five groups, and rats in each group were given oral distilled water, EPPH (5 mg nitrogen/mL) at doses of 0.08, 0.16, or 0.31 mL/kg body weight (BW)/day, or glutathione (100 mg/kg BW/day) by a feeding needle for 5 weeks, which were named as the control, L-EPPH, M-EPPH, H-EPPH, or positive-control groups, respectively. Ten additional rats had no intense exercise with water administration and were designated as the no-exercise group. After 2 weeks, the rats were subjected to intense exercise and forced swimming trial for 30 min once per week for an additional 4 weeks. At 5 min after the intense exercise, lactate concentrations and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the serum and the gastrocnemius muscle were higher in the control group, whereas M-EPPH and H-EPPH treatments suppressed the increase better than in the positive-control (p < 0.05). Intense exercise decreased glycogen content in the liver and gastrocnemius muscle, and M-EPPH and H-EPPH inhibited the decrement (p < 0.05). Moreover, lipid peroxide contents in the gastrocnemius muscle and liver were higher in the control group than in the M-EPPH, H-EPPH, positive-control, and no-exercise groups (p < 0.05). However, antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were opposite to the lipid peroxide contents. Hypothalamic corticosterone and hippocampal mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1 beta were higher. However, hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression and protein contents were lower in the control group than in the positive-control group. M-EPPH, H-EPPH, and positive-control suppressed the changes via activating hippocampal cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation, and H-EPPH showed better activity than in the positive-control (p < 0.05). In conclusion, EPPH (0.16-0.
   31 mL/kg BW) intake reduced exercise-induced physical and cognitive fatigue in rats and could potentially be developed as a therapeutic agent for relieving fatigue in humans.

AB  - Chest or upper body auscultation has long been considered a useful part of the physical examination going back to the time of Hippocrates. However, it did not become a prevalent practice until the invention of the stethoscope by Rene Laennec in 1816, which made the practice suitable and hygienic. Pulmonary disease is a kind of sickness that affects the lungs and various parts of the respiratory system. Lung diseases are the third largest cause of death in the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the five major respiratory diseases, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), asthma, and lung cancer, cause the death of more than 3 million people each year worldwide. Respiratory sounds disclose significant in-formation regarding the lungs of patients. Numerous methods are developed for analyzing the lung sounds. However, clinical approaches require qualified pul-monologists to diagnose such kind of signals appropriately and are also time consuming. Hence, an efficient Fractional Water Cycle Swarm Optimizer-based Deep Residual Network (Fr-WCSO-based DRN) is developed in this research for detecting the pulmonary abnormalities using respiratory sounds signals. The proposed Fr-WCSO is newly designed by the incorporation of Fractional Calculus (FC) and Water Cycle Swarm Optimizer WCSO. Meanwhile, WCSO is the combination of Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA) with Competitive Swarm Optimizer (CSO). The respiratory input sound signals are pre-processed and the important features needed for the further processing are effectively extracted. With the extracted features, data augmentation is carried out for minimizing the over fitting issues for improving the overall detection performance. Once data augmentation is done, feature selection is performed using proposed Fr-WCSO algorithm. Finally, pulmonary abnormality detection is performed using DRN where the training procedure of DRN is performed using the developed Fr-WCSO algorithm. The developed method achieved superior performance by considering the evaluation measures, namely True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR) and testing accuracy with the values of 0.963(96.3%), 0.932,(93.2%) and 0.948(94.8%), respectively.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise on depressive-like behavior induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats and to explore the role of the SIRT3/ROS/NLRP3 signaling pathway in this process. Methods: Twenty-nine male 8-week-old Sprague Dawley rats were divided into a control group (CON) (nine rats) and a model group (twenty rats). Thirteen chronic stress stimuli were randomly applied once or twice per day for 35 days to induce depression in the model group rats. After the model was established, the model group rats were randomly divided into the CUMS group (CUMS) and the aerobic exercise + CUMS group (EX + CUMS). The EX + CUMS group received 8 weeks of aerobic exercise intervention for 6 days per week. Behavioral assessments were performed using the sucrose preference test and forced swimming test. The expression of SIRT3, NLRP3, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 in the hippocampus was detected using RT-PCR. The ROS level in the hippocampus was detected using immunofluorescence. The protein levels of SIRT3 and NLRP3 in the hippocampus were detected using western blotting. The protein levels of IL-1 beta and IL-18 in the hippocampus were measured using ELISA. Results: After 5 weeks of chronic stress stimuli, the hippocampal function of rats in the CUMS model group was impaired, and their sucrose preference was reduced, while their forced swimming time was prolonged. The expression of SIRT3 decreased, ROS increased, and the expression of NLRP3 and the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-18 increased. Aerobic exercise increased the sucrose preference of rats, shortened their immobility time, increased the expression of SIRT3, and reduced the levels of ROS, NLRP3, IL-1 beta, and IL-18. Conclusion: Exercise can improve the depressive behavior of CUMS model rats, and its mechanism may be related to the upregulation of SIRT3 in the hippocampus, which plays an anti-inflammatory role.

AB  - Ring attractor models for angular path integration have received strong experimental support. To function as integrators, head direction circuits require precisely tuned connectivity, but it is currently unknown how such tuning could be achieved. Here, we propose a network model in which a local, biologically plausible learning rule adjusts synaptic efficacies during development, guided by supervisory allothetic cues. Applied to the Drosophila head direction system, the model learns to path-integrate accurately and develops a connectivity strikingly similar to the one reported in experiments. The mature network is a quasi-continuous attractor and reproduces key experiments in which optogenetic stimulation controls the internal representation of heading in flies, and where the network remaps to integrate with different gains in rodents. Our model predicts that path integration requires self-supervised learning during a developmental phase, and proposes a general framework to learn to path-integrate with gain-1 even in architectures that lack the physical topography of a ring.

AB  - Rapid progress in technologies such as calcium imaging and electrophysiology has seen a dramatic increase in the size and extent of neural recordings. Even so, interpretation of this data requires considerable knowledge about the nature of the representation and often depends on manual operations. Decoding provides a means to infer the information content of such recordings but typically requires highly processed data and prior knowledge of the encoding scheme. Here, we developed a deep-learning framework able to decode sensory and behavioral variables directly from wide-band neural data. The network requires little user input and generalizes across stimuli, behaviors, brain regions, and recording techniques. Once trained, it can be analyzed to determine elements of the neural code that are informative about a given variable. We validated this approach using electrophysiological and calcium-imaging data from rodent auditory cortex and hippocampus as well as human electrocorticography (ECoG) data. We show successful decoding of finger movement, auditory stimuli, and spatial behaviors - including a novel representation of head direction - from raw neural activity.

AB  - Sinusitis, which is also referred to as rhinosinusitis, is one of the most prevalent causes of clinical visits in the United States. It is also one of the primary reasons why antibiotics are prescribed. This study aimed to identify the types of bacteria that cause sinusitis and find out the most effective types of antibiotics to optimise the success of treatment. Samples were collected with a sterile swab, which was gently inserted into the nasal cavity, then directed towards the sinus area. They were grown on nutrient media such as blood agar, MacConkey agar and Mueller-Hinton agar. Gram stain technology was used to identify bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, biochemical tests were carried out, including catalase, oxidase, carbohydrate fermentation, and API (analytical profile index) test strips were used. The sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics was examined using CLSI standards to ensure the accuracy of the results by culturing the bacteria on Mueller Hinton agar medium and placing the antibiotic disks. The results were recorded for sensitivity, intermediate sensitivity and resistance. Zone diameter measurements were taken to determine the effectiveness of the antibiotics. The results showed that the percentage of positive cases for H. influenzae was 36.7%, Moraxella catarrhalis 24.7%, S. aureus 16.0%, S. pneumoniae 15.3%, and Staphylococcus epidermidis 8.0%. H. influenzae showed full sensitivity to ceftriaxone, gentamycin, and vancomycin, while Moraxella catarrhalis was fully sensitive to ceftriaxone, imipenem, vancomycin, and oxacillin. S. aureus was sensitive to ceftriaxone, imipenem, gentamycin, vancomycin, and erythromycin. S. pneumoniae showed sensitivity to penicillin, gentamycin, and vancomycin. S. epidermidis was sensitive to gentamycin, nitrofurantoin, and erythromycin. The study concluded that the bacteria H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were the most common in sinusitis, with high sensitivity to common antibiotics such as ceftriaxone and gentamycin. This indicates the effectiveness of these antibiotics in treatment, which helps guide appropriate treatment and reduce bacterial resistance.

AB  - Simple Summary Changes in the sinus membrane, in the form of thickening or opacification, usually pose problems of differential diagnosis between rhinological and odontogenic causes, given the similarity in their clinical behaviour. The interrelation between tooth roots and the possibility of maxillary sinus involvement seems to be a key determinant. Moreover, the role played by iatrogenic factors, especially surgical interventions, such as dental extractions, or impacted teeth, as well as implant treatments, must be considered. The contribution of new imaging procedures, such as conventional computed tomography or cone beam computed tomography, has triggered an increase in the identification of dental aetiology as a cause of the unilateral opacification of the anterior paranasal sinuses with the predominant involvement of the maxillary sinus. The aim of this study was to identify the most relevant dental factors and iatrogenic causes in the development of pathological changes to the sinus membrane and to analyse their possible influence on the development of odontogenic sinusitis. A descriptive, observational study was designed, with 276 patients who had been evaluated via cone beam computed tomography, analysing possible sinus thickening factors, such as apical infections, endodontic treatments, periodontitis, radicular cysts and impacted teeth, as well as iatrogenic factors caused by implant treatments or the development of oroantral communications produced during tooth extraction manoeuvres. Among the dental factors, periodontitis (47.1%), apical pathology (23.5%) and endodontic treatments (23.1%) were the predominant causes of sinus membrane thickening that most frequently produced an occupancy between 2 and 10 mm. Regarding the implant treatments, the placement of implants through the floor of the maxillary sinus was the main cause (9.8%), followed by sinus elevation techniques (6.2%). Dental extraction was the first cause of oroantral communication (5.0%), being the procedure that caused the greatest thickening of the sinus membrane. This study highlights the importance of dental treatments and iatrogenic factors in sinus pathology, and the need for diagnostic interrelations between the different specialists who address this pathology.

AB  - The hippocampus is critical for memory formation. The hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) sends long-range projections to hippocampal area CA2. While the SuM-CA2 connection is critical for social memory, how this input acts on the local circuit is unknown. Using transgenic mice, we found that SuM axon stimulation elicited mixed excitatory and inhibitory responses in area CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs). Parvalbumin-expressing basket cells were largely responsible for the feedforward inhibitory drive of SuM over area CA2. Inhibition recruited by the SuM input onto CA2 PNs increased the precision of action potential firing both in conditions of low and high cholinergic tone. Furthermore, SuM stimulation in area CA2 modulated CA1 activity, indicating that synchronized CA2 output drives a pulsed inhibition in area CA1. Hence, the network revealed here lays basis for understanding how SuM activity directly acts on the local hippocampal circuit to allow social memory encoding.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to develop reference values for haematological and biochemical vari-ables in the Canary camel breed (Camelus dromedarius). 114 clinically healthy dromedary camels were assessed. Age, sex, and pregnancy status was also recorded. The reference range for red blood cells (RBCs) was 8.45 - 13.65 X106/lL, haemoglobin (HGB) was 10.61 - 15.29 g/dL, packed cell volume (PCV) was 19.93 - 32.51 %, and white blood cells (WBCs) 7.35 - 18.36 X103/lL. A correlation was estab-lished between the haemoglobin concentration (HGB) (g/dl) and packed cell volume (PCV) obtaining a linear regression (HGB = 0.31 PCV + 4.67). Young animals had higher RBC and WBC values than adult ani-mals. Additionally, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), phosphorus, calcium, albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio, alka-line phosphatase, cholesterol, and lipase were higher in young animals compared with adults. Female dromedary camels showed higher values for the three main variables: RBC, HGB and PCV, but no differ-ences between sexes were detected in the biochemical variables results. The WBC count was higher in non-pregnant females than in pregnant animals. These results provide references values for the Canary camel breed and may contribute to the understanding of differences in 18 haematological and biochem-ical parameters in dromedary camels with a potential impact in health and welfare for this species.

AB  - Nicotinic partial agonists provide an accepted aid for smoking cessation and thus contribute to decreasing tobacco-related disease. Improved drugs constitute a continued area of study. However, there remains no reductionist method to examine the cellular and subcellular pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds in living cells. Here, we developed new intensity-based drug-sensing fluorescent reporters (iDrugSnFRs) for the nicotinic partial agonists dianicline, cytisine, and two cytisine derivatives - 10-fluorocytisine and 9-bromo-10-ethylcytisine. We report the first atomic-scale structures of liganded periplasmic binding protein-based biosensors, accelerating development of iDrugSnFRs and also explaining the activation mechanism. The nicotinic iDrugSnFRs detect their drug partners in solution, as well as at the plasma membrane (PM) and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cell lines and mouse hippocampal neurons. At the PM, the speed of solution changes limits the growth and decay rates of the fluorescence response in almost all cases. In contrast, we found that rates of membrane crossing differ among these nicotinic drugs by >30-fold. The new nicotinic iDrugSnFRs provide insight into the real-time pharmacokinetic properties of nicotinic agonists and provide a methodology whereby iDrugSnFRs can inform both pharmaceutical neuroscience and addiction neuroscience.

AB  - The transcription factor activating protein two gamma (AP2 gamma) is an important regulator of neurogenesis both during embryonic development as well as in the postnatal brain, but its role for neurophysiology and behavior at distinct postnatal periods is still unclear. In this work, we explored the neurogenic, behavioral, and functional impact of a constitutive and heterozygous AP2 gamma deletion in mice from early postnatal development until adulthood. AP2 gamma deficiency promotes downregulation of hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenesis, altering the ontogeny of emotional and memory behaviors associated with hippocampus formation. The impairments induced by AP2 gamma constitutive deletion since early development leads to an anxious-like phenotype and memory impairments as early as the juvenile phase. These behavioral impairments either persist from the juvenile phase to adulthood or emerge in adult mice with deficits in behavioral flexibility and object location recognition. Collectively, we observed a progressive and cumulative impact of constitutive AP2 gamma deficiency on the hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenic process, as well as alterations on limbic-cortical connectivity, together with functional behavioral impairments. The results herein presented demonstrate the modulatory role exerted by the AP2 gamma transcription factor and the relevance of hippocampal neurogenesis in the development of emotional states and memory processes.

AB  - Infection with the etiological agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, appears capable of impacting cognition in some patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). To evaluate neuropathophysiological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examine transcriptional and cellular signatures in the Brodmann area 9 (BA9) of the frontal cortex and the hippocampal formation (HF) in SARS-CoV-2, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD individuals compared to age- and gender-matched neurological cases. Here, we show similar alterations of neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier integrity in SARS-CoV-2, AD, and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD individuals. Distribution of microglial changes reflected by the increase in Iba-1 reveals nodular morphological alterations in SARS-CoV-2-infected AD individuals. Similarly, HIF-1 alpha is significantly upregulated in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same brain regions regardless of AD status. The finding may help in informing decision-making regarding therapeutic treatments in patients with neuro-PASC, especially those at increased risk of developing AD.

AB  - We reliably judge locations of static objects when we walk despite the retinal images of these objects moving with every step we take. Here, we showed our brains solve this optical illusion by adopting an allocentric spatial reference frame. We measured perceived target location after the observer walked a short distance from the home base. Supporting the allocentric coding scheme, we found the intrinsic bias , which acts as a spatial reference frame for perceiving location of a dimly lit target in the dark, remained grounded at the home base rather than traveled along with the observer. The path-integration mechanism responsible for this can utilize both active and passive (vestibular) translational motion signals, but only along the horizontal direction. This asymmetric path-integration finding in human visual space perception is reminiscent of the asymmetric spatial memory finding in desert ants, pointing to nature's wondrous and logically simple design for terrestrial creatures.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric diseases, like depression, have a considerable and persistent impact on human health; however, little is known about their underlying pathogenesis. Social defeat is a model for stress-induced psychopathologies that could present with behaviors resembling those observed in humans with depression. However, previous animal models of social defeat mainly focus on adults. Here, we re-design the protocol of early-life stress-induced social defeat paradigm, which is based on a classic resident-intruder model. Briefly, each two-week-old experimental mouse of C57BL/6 strain is introduced into the home cage of an unfamiliar CD1 aggressor mouse for 30 min per day for 10 consecutive days. Later, all experimental mice are raised individually for another month. Finally, the mice are identified as defeated through social interaction and open field tests. This model has been shown to be etiological and predictive and provide high validity and could be a powerful tool to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of early onset depression.

AB  - How does the representation of naturalistic life events change with age? Here, we analyzed fMRI data from 414 children and adolescents (5-19 years) as they watched a narrative movie. In addition to changes in the degree of inter-subject correlation (ISC) with age in sensory and medial parietal regions, we used a novel measure (between-group ISC) to reveal age-related shifts in the responses across the majority of the neocortex. Over the course of development, brain responses became more discretized into stable and coherent events and shifted earlier in time to anticipate upcoming perceived event transitions, measured behaviorally in an age-matched sample. However, hippocampal responses to event boundaries actually decreased with age, suggesting a shifting division of labor between episodic encoding processes and schematic event representations between the ages of 5 and 19.

AB  - Visual impairments, notably loss of contrast sensitivity and color vision, were documented in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients yet are critically understudied. This protocol describes a novel visualstimuli four-arm maze (ViS4M; also called visual x-maze), which is a versatile x-shaped maze equipped with spectrum-and intensity-controlled light-emitting diode ( LED) sources and dynamic grayscale objects. The ViS4M is designed to allow the assessment of color and contrast vision along with locomotor and cognitive functions in mice. In the color testing mode, the spectral distributions of the LED lights create four homogenous spaces that differ in chromaticity and luminance, corresponding to the mouse visual system. In the contrast sensitivity test, the four grayscale objects are placed in the middle of each arm, contrasting against the black walls and the white floors of the maze. Upon entering the maze, healthy wild-type (WT) mice tend to spontaneously alternate between arms, even under equiluminant conditions of illumination, suggesting that cognitively and visually intact mice use both color and brightness as cues to navigate the maze. Evaluation of the double-transgenic APPSWE/PS1.E9 mouse model of AD (AD(+) mice) reveals substantial deficits to alternate in both color and contrast modes at an early age, when hippocampal-based memory and learning is still intact. Profiling of timespan, entries, and transition patterns between the different arms uncovers variable aging and AD-associated impairments in color discrimination and contrast sensitivity. The analysis of arm sequences of alternation reveals different pathways of exploration in young WT, old WT, and AD+ mice, which can be used as color and contrast imprints of functionally intact versus impaired mice. Overall, we describe the utility of a novel visual x-maze test to identify behavioral changes in mice related to cognition, as well as color and contrast vision, with high precision and reproducibility.
   [GRAPHICS]
   Consecutive arm entries reveal that APP(SWE)/PS1(Delta E9) (AD(+)) mice alternate less between arms, as opposed to WT mice. Sequence analysis, according to the three alternation pathways (depicted by white, yellow, and brown arrows) under different conditions of illumination, uncovers specific deficits linked to color vision in AD+ mice, evidenced by a color imprint chart.

AB  - The reduction in intracellular neuronal chloride concentration is a crucial event during neurodevelopment that shifts GABAergic signaling from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. Alterations in chloride homeostasis are implicated in numerous neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recent advancements in biosensor technology allow the simultaneous determination of intracellular chloride concentration of multiple neurons. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for the use of the ratiometric chloride sensor SuperClomeleon (SClm) in organotypic hippocampal slices. We record chloride levels as fluorescence responses of the SClm sensor using two-photon microscopy. We discuss how the SClm sensor can be effectively delivered to specific cell types using virus-mediated transduction and describe the calibration procedure to determine the chloride concentration from SClm sensor responses.

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway controls cell proliferation and tissue regeneration via its transcriptional effectors yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). The canonical pathway topology is characterized by sequential phosphorylation of kinases in the cytoplasm that defines the subcellular localization of YAP and TAZ. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling dynamics of both factors under physiological and tissue-damaging conditions are poorly understood. By implementing experimental in vitro data, partial differential equation modeling, as well as automated image analysis, we demonstrate that nuclear phosphorylation contributes to differences between YAP and TAZ localization in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Treatment of hepatocyte-derived cells with hepatotoxic acetaminophen (APAP) induces a biphasic protein phosphorylation eventually leading to nuclear protein enrichment of YAP but not TAZ. APAP-dependent regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic YAP shuttling is not an unspecific cellular response but relies on the sequential induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT, synonym: protein kinase B), as well as elevated nuclear interaction between YAP and AKT. Mouse experiments confirm this sequence of events illustrated by the expression of ROS-, AKT-, and YAP-specific gene signatures upon APAP administration. In summary, our data illustrate the importance of nuclear processes in the regulation of Hippo pathway activity. YAP and TAZ exhibit different shuttling dynamics, which explains distinct cellular responses of both factors under physiological and tissue-damaging conditions.

AB  - Early electrophysiological brain oscillations recorded in preterm babies and newborn rodents are initially mostly driven by bottom-up sensorimotor activity and only later can detach from external inputs. This is a hallmark of most developing brain areas, including the hippocampus, which, in the adult brain, functions in integrating external inputs onto internal dynamics. Such developmental disengagement from external inputs is likely a fundamental step for the proper development of cognitive internal models. Despite its importance, the developmental timeline and circuit basis for this disengagement remain unknown. To address this issue, we have investigated the daily evolution of CA1 dynamics and underlying circuits during the first two postnatal weeks of mouse development using two-photon calcium imaging in non-anesthetized pups. We show that the first postnatal week ends with an abrupt shift in the representation of self-motion in CA1. Indeed, most CA1 pyramidal cells switch from activated to inhibited by self-generated movements at the end of the first postnatal week, whereas the majority of GABAergic neurons remain positively modulated throughout this period. This rapid switch occurs within 2 days and follows the rapid anatomical and functional surge of local somatic GABAergic innervation. The observed change in dynamics is consistent with a two-population model undergoing a strengthening of inhibition. We propose that this abrupt developmental transition inaugurates the emergence of internal hippocampal dynamics.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical found in the Cannabis sativa plant, is a clinically effective antiepileptic drug whose mechanism of action is unknown. Using a fluorescence-based thallium flux assay, we performed a large-scale screen and found enhancement of flux through heterologously expressed human Kv7.2/7.3 channels by CBD. Patch-clamp recordings showed that CBD acts at submicromolar concentrations to shift the voltage dependence of Kv7.2/7.3 channels in the hyperpolarizing direction, producing a dramatic enhancement of current at voltages near -50 mV. CBD enhanced native M-current in mouse superior cervical ganglion starting at concentrations of 30 nM and also enhanced M-current in rat hippocampal neurons. The potent enhancement of Kv2/7.3 channels by CBD may contribute to its effectiveness as an antiepileptic drug by reducing neuronal hyperexcitability.

AB  - SLMAP3 is a tail-anchored membrane protein that targets subcellular organelles and is believed to regulate Hippo signaling. The global loss of SLMAP3 causes late embryonic lethality in mice, with some embryos exhibiting neural tube defects such as craniorachischisis. We show here that SLMAP3-/- embryos display reduced length and increased width of neural plates, signifying arrested convergent extension. The expression of planar cell polarity (PCP) components Dvl2/3 and the activity of the downstream targets ROCK2, cofilin, and JNK1/2 were dysregulated in SLMAP3-/- E12.5 brains. Furthermore, the cytoskeletal proteins (gamma-tubulin, actin, and nestin) and apical components (PKC zeta and ZO-1) were mislocalized in neural tubes of SLMAP3-/- embryos, with a subsequent decrease in colocalization of PCP proteins (Fzd6 and pDvl2). However, no changes in PCP or cytoskeleton proteins were found in cultured neuroepithelial cells depleted of SLMAP3, suggesting an essential requirement for SLMAP3 for these processes in vivo for neurulation. The loss of SLMAP3 had no impact on Hippo signaling in SLMAP3-/- embryos, brains, and neural tubes. Proteomic analysis revealed SLMAP3 in an interactome with cytoskeletal components, including nestin, tropomyosin 4, intermediate filaments, plectin, the PCP protein SCRIB, and STRIPAK members in embryonic brains. These results reveal a crucial role of SLMAP3 in neural tube development by regulating the cytoskeleton organization and PCP pathway.

AB  - Physiological changes during awake immobility-related brain states remain one of the great unexplored behavioral states. Controlling periods of awake immobility is challenging because restraining the animal is stressful and is accompanied by altered physiological states. Here, we describe the ThermoMaze, a behavioral paradigm that allows for the collection of large amounts of physiological data while the animal rests at distinct experimenter-determined locations. We found that the paradigm generated long periods of immobility and did not alter the brain temperature. We combined the ThermoMaze with electrophysiology recordings in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and found a location-specific distribution of sharp-wave ripple events. We describe the construction of the ThermoMaze with the intention that it helps enable large-scale data recordings on immobility-related brain states.

AB  - Simple Summary Birth asphyxia (defined as the failure to establish breathing at birth) causes 800,000 newborn deaths worldwide every year and remains a leading cause of lifelong disability in children under five. Reliable diagnostic markers and advanced therapeutic approaches are still lacking. The aim of this study was to explore selected long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their protein-coding target genes using a piglet model of perinatal asphyxia. A total of 42 newborn piglets were randomized into 4 study groups. Expression of the lncRNAs (BDNF-AS, H19, MALAT1, ANRIL, TUG1, and PANDA) and their related protein-coding genes (VEGFA, BDNF, TP53, HIF1 alpha, and TNF alpha) were quantified in the cortex, the hippocampus, the white matter, and the cerebellum. Our results indicate significant changes in lncRNA expression, mainly in the cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, a brief exposure to 100% oxygen for 3 min is sufficient to induce alterations. Our observations suggest that lncRNAs are part of the molecular response to hypoxia-induced damage during perinatal asphyxia. A better understanding of the regulatory properties of lncRNAs may provide novel targets and intervention strategies for perinatal asphyxia in the future. Birth asphyxia is the leading cause of death and disability in young children worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may provide novel targets and intervention strategies due to their regulatory potential, as demonstrated in various diseases and conditions. We investigated cardinal lncRNAs involved in oxidative stress, hypoxia, apoptosis, and DNA damage using a piglet model of perinatal asphyxia. A total of 42 newborn piglets were randomized into 4 study arms: (1) hypoxia-normoxic reoxygenation, (2) hypoxia-3 min of hyperoxic reoxygenation, (3) hypoxia-30 min of hyperoxic reoxygenation, and (4) sham-operated controls. The expression of lncRNAs BDNF-AS, H19, MALAT1, ANRIL, TUG1, and PANDA, together with the related target genes VEGFA, BDNF, TP53, HIF1 alpha, and TNF alpha, was assessed in the cortex, the hippocampus, the white matter, and the cerebellum using qPCR and Droplet Digital PCR. Exposure to hypoxia-reoxygenation significantly altered the transcription levels of BDNF-AS, H19, MALAT1, and ANRIL. BDNF-AS levels were significantly enhanced after both hypoxia and subsequent hyperoxic reoxygenation, 8% and 100% O-2, respectively. Our observations suggest an emerging role for lncRNAs as part of the molecular response to hypoxia-induced damages during perinatal asphyxia. A better understanding of the regulatory properties of BDNF-AS and other lncRNAs may reveal novel targets and intervention strategies in the future.

AB  - Large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) is the key kinase controlling activation of Hippo signalling pathway. Post-translational modifications of LATS1 modulate its kinase activity. However, detailed mechanism underlying LATS1 stability and activation remains elusive. Here we report that LATS1 is acetylated by acetyltransferase CBP at K751 and is deacetylated by deacetylases SIRT3 and SIRT4. Acetylation at K751 stabilized LATS1 by decreasing LATS1 ubiquitination and inhibited LATS1 activation by reducing its phosphorylation. Mechanistically, LATS1 acetylation resulted in inhibition of YAP phosphorylation and degradation, leading to increased YAP nucleus translocation and promoted target gene expression. Functionally, LATS1-K751Q, the acetylation mimic mutant potentiated lung cancer cell migration, invasion and tumor growth, whereas LATS1-K751R, the acetylation deficient mutant inhibited these functions. Taken together, we demonstrated a previously unidentified post-translational modification of LATS1 that converts LATS1 from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter by suppression of Hippo signalling through acetylation of LATS1.

AB  - (1) Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa and the paranasal sinuses. The pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is multifactorial and, as of yet, not well understood. (2) Methods: Nasal lavage fluid samples were collected from patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) (n = 10) and individuals without sinusitis (control group) (n = 10) who had no nasal complaints. In the present study, we used an untargeted label-free LC-MS/MS mass spectrometric approach combined with bioinformatics and network pathway analysis to compare the changes in the proteomic profiles of the CRSwNP group and the control group. Data from LC-MS/MS underwent univariate and multivariate analyses. (3) Results: The proteomic analyses revealed distinct differences in the abundances of nasal lavage fluid proteins between the CRSwNP and control groups: a total of 234 proteins, 151 up- and 83 down-regulated in CRSwNP. Functional Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that dysregulated proteins were involved in airway inflammatory reaction, immune response, and oxidative stress. The biomarkers were evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve; an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.999 (95% CI) identified potential biomarkers between the CRSwNP and control group. EMILIN-3 and RAB11-binding protein RELCH were down-regulated, and Macrophage migration inhibitory factor and deoxyribonuclease-1 were up-regulated, in CRSwNP compared to the control group. (4) Conclusions: These differentially expressed proteins identified in CRSwNP are involved in airway inflammatory reaction, immune response, and oxidative stress. In particular, the identification of increased interleukin-36 gamma (IL-36 gamma), which contributes to inflammatory response, and a decrease in SOD, in this group are notable findings. In the future, several of these proteins may prove useful for exploring the pathogenesis of nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis or as objective biomarkers for quantitatively monitoring disease progression or response to therapy.

AB  - The hippocampal-dependent memory system and striatal-dependent memory system modulate reinforcement learning depending on feedback timing in adults, but their contributions during development remain unclear. In a 2-year longitudinal study, 6-to-7-year-old children performed a reinforcement learning task in which they received feedback immediately or with a short delay following their response. Children's learning was found to be sensitive to feedback timing modulations in their reaction time and inverse temperature parameter, which quantifies value-guided decision-making. They showed longitudinal improvements towards more optimal value-based learning, and their hippocampal volume showed protracted maturation. Better delayed model-derived learning covaried with larger hippocampal volume longitudinally, in line with the adult literature. In contrast, a larger striatal volume in children was associated with both better immediate and delayed model-derived learning longitudinally. These findings show, for the first time, an early hippocampal contribution to the dynamic development of reinforcement learning in middle childhood, with neurally less differentiated and more cooperative memory systems than in adults.

AB  - The nucleus incertus (NI), a conserved hindbrain structure implicated in the stress response, arousal, and memory, is a major site for production of the neuropeptide relaxin-3. On the basis of goosecoid homeobox 2 (gsc2) expression, we identified a neuronal cluster that lies adjacent to relaxin 3a (rln3a) neurons in the zebrafish analogue of the NI. To delineate the characteristics of the gsc2 and rln3a NI neurons, we used CRISPR/Cas9 targeted integration to drive gene expression specifically in each neuronal group, and found that they differ in their efferent and afferent connectivity, spontaneous activity, and functional properties. gsc2 and rln3a NI neurons have widely divergent projection patterns and innervate distinct subregions of the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). Whereas gsc2 neurons are activated more robustly by electric shock, rln3a neurons exhibit spontaneous fluctuations in calcium signaling and regulate locomotor activity. Our findings define heterogeneous neurons in the NI and provide new tools to probe its diverse functions.

AB  - Cellular ATP that is consumed to perform energetically expensive tasks must be replenished by new ATP through the activation of metabolism. Neuronal stimulation, an energetically demanding process, transiently activates aerobic glycolysis, but the precise mechanism underlying this glycolysis activation has not been determined. We previously showed that neuronal glycolysis is correlated with Ca2+ influx, but is not activated by feedforward Ca2+ signaling (Diaz-Garcia et al., 2021a). Since ATP-powered Na+ and Ca2+ pumping activities are increased following stimulation to restore ion gradients and are estimated to consume most neuronal ATP, we aimed to determine if they are coupled to neuronal glycolysis activation. By using two-photon imaging of fluorescent biosensors and dyes in dentate granule cell somas of acute mouse hippocampal slices, we observed that production of cytoplasmic NADH, a byproduct of glycolysis, is strongly coupled to changes in intracellular Na+, while intracellular Ca2+ could only increase NADH production if both forward Na+/Ca2+ exchange and Na+/K+ pump activity were intact. Additionally, antidromic stimulation-induced intracellular [Na+] increases were reduced >50% by blocking Ca2+ entry. These results indicate that neuronal glycolysis activation is predominantly a response to an increase in activity of the Na+/K+ pump, which is strongly potentiated by Na+ influx through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger during extrusion of Ca2+ following stimulation.

AB  - The septal organs are islands or patches of sensory epithelium, located in the ventral parts of the nasal septum and innervated by the olfactory nerve. The septal island in dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) was unusually located in the rostro-dorsal part of the nasal septum, where the ethmoidal branch of the trigeminal nerve provides innervation to the island mucosa. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to reveal the microscopic and ultrastructure of this island and to explain the probable functions. Twelve septal islands from 12 healthy male camels were used. Unlike the olfactory epithelium, which has a pseudostratified structure, the island neuroepithelium had a true neural lamination. Furthermore, in electron micrographs, the receptor, bipolar, and basal cells were connected with an orderly, organized network of cell-cell communication, which had some spine synapses. This network substituted the absence of supporting cells, maintained the shape of the tissue, and held the cells together. Moreover, the receptor cells were not similar to any of the different types of olfactory sensory neurons. Instead, they possessed the apical domain that might be specialized for the detection of chemical stimuli. Interestingly, a resident population of immune cells, namely mast cells and macrophages, was observed. The probable functions were discussed based on the cellular context and architecture. The nasal septal island in dromedaries may have a role in pain perception. The receptor cells most probably work as nociceptive cells that interact with the resident immune cells to coordinate pain signaling with immune response. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the most vital energy source produced mainly in the mitochondria. Age-related mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with brain diseases. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) is an essential cofactor for energy production in mitochondria. Here, we examined how the novel NAD(+)-assisting substance, 10-ethyl-3-methylpyrimido[4,5-b]quinoline-2,4(3H,10H)-dione (TND1128), modulates the morphological growth of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. The morphological growth effect of TND1128 was also compared with that of beta-nicotinamide mononucleotide (beta-NMN). TND1128 induced the branching of axons and dendrites, and increased the number of excitatory synapses. This study provides new insight into TND1128 as a mitochondria-stimulating drug for improving brain function. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interleukin (IL)-33 is a key cytokine involved in type-2 immunity and allergic airway disease. At the level of lung epithelial cells, where it is clearly expressed, IL-33 plays an important role in both innate and adaptive immune responses in mucosal organs. It has been widely demonstrated that in the course of respiratory virus infections, the release of IL-33 increases, with consequent pro-inflammatory effects and consequent exacerbation of the clinical symptoms of chronic respiratory diseases. In our work, we analyzed the pathogenetic and prognostic involvement of IL-33 during the main respiratory viral infections, with particular interest in the recent SARS-CoV-2virus pandemic and the aim of determining a possible connection point on which to act with a targeted therapy that is able to improve the clinical outcome of patients.

AB  - Suppressing tumor metastasis is a crucial strategy for improving survival rates in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), with cancer stem cells (CSCs) being the primary drivers of metastasis. Current therapeutic approaches targeting CSCs are limited, and their molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To address this challenge, a biomimetic nanoparticle delivery system, CMD-BHQ3-PTL/DOX@RBCM is developed, to deliver the stem cell regulator, piceatannol (PTL). This system used carboxymethyl dextran (CMD) and Black Hole Quencher 3 (BHQ3) to encapsulate PTL and the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin (DOX) within a red blood cell membrane (RBCm), enhancing stability and biocompatibility while allowing gradual drug release under hypoxic conditions. The effects of PTL are investigated on CSCs using molecular biology experiments, plasmid construction, and high-throughput sequencing and elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying this biomimetic nanoparticle delivery system. The therapeutic efficacy of PTL is validated at the tissue level using subcutaneous and metastatic tumor models in human and murine systems. The results demonstrated that CMD-BHQ3-PTL/DOX@RBCM effectively addressed the challenges of specificity and biocompatibility in vivo, significantly inhibiting CSC-related tumor metastasis. This inhibitory effect is closely associated with the Hippo/YAP1/SOX9 pathway. This study highlights the effectiveness of the pH-responsive biomimetic nanoparticle system CMD-BHQ3-PTL/DOX@RBCm in delivering PTL to tumor sites, with SOX9 and its upstream Hippo/YAP1 pathway playing a critical role in the underlying mechanism.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) is one of the causative factors in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive dysfunction. In the present study, we investigated the effects of hydrogen (H-2) gas inhalation in trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction in the C57BL/6 mice. First, mice were divided into the following groups: mice without TMT injection (NC), TMT-only injection group (TMT only), TMT injection + lithium chloride-treated group as a positive control (PC), and TMT injection + 2% H-2 inhalation-treated group (H-2). The TMT injection groups were administered a single dosage of intraperitoneal TMT injection (2.6 mg/kg body weight) and the H-2 group was treated with 2% H-2 for 30 min once a day for four weeks. Additionally, a behavioral test was performed with Y-maze to test the cognitive abilities of the mice. Furthermore, multiple OS- and AD-related biomarkers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), calcium (Ca2+), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase, inflammatory cytokines, apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), amyloid beta (A beta)-40, phospho-tau (p-tau), Bcl-2, and Bcl-2- associated X (Bax) were investigated in the blood and brain. Our results demonstrated that TMT exposure alters seizure and spatial recognition memory. However, after H-2 treatment, memory deficits were ameliorated. H-2 treatment also decreased AD-related biomarkers, such as Apo-E, A beta-40, p-tau, and Bax and OS markers such as ROS, NO, Ca2+, and MDA in both serum and brain. In contrast, catalase and GPx activities were significantly increased in the TMT-only group and decreased after H-2 gas treatment in serum and brain. In addition, inflammatory cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were found to be significantly decreased after H-2 treatment in both serum and brain lysates. In contrast, Bcl-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression levels were found to be enhanced after H-2 treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrated that 2% H-2 gas inhalation in TMT-treated mice exhibits memory enhancing activity and decreases the AD, OS, and inflammatory-related markers. Therefore, H-2 might be a candidate for repairing neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive dysfunction. However, further mechanistic studies are needed to fully clarify the effects of H-2 inhalation on TMT-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction.

T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION

KW  - DISEASE
KW  - BCL-2
AB  - Akt acts as a central protein influencing multiple pathologies in neurodegenerative diseases including AD and PD, and using Akt activators is a promising management strategy. The current study characterized the effects of an Akt-activating peptide (Glu-Pro-Glu-Val-Leu-Pro, EPEVLR) obtained from walnut protein degradation on d-gal-induced memory impairment in mice. EPEVLR was obtained by hydrolysis of walnut proteins, identification of peptide sequences, and screening for molecular docking sequentially. The MWM test in mice indicated that the oral administration of EPEVLR (80, 200 and 400 mg per kg per day) significantly (p < 0.05) reversed d-gal-induced memory impairment. WB tests of the mouse hippocampus confirmed that EPEVLR could activate Akt by promoting its phosphorylation. In addition, further characterization (including TEM, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry) related to Akt phosphorylation showed lower A beta and p-tau levels, as well as more autophagosomes than those in the model group. Moreover, the EPEVLR treatment significantly increased Lactobacillus abundance and reduced Helicobacter abundance in the gut microbiome and caused up-regulation of SCFAs and down-regulation of LPS of serum metabolites. Therefore, EPEVLR ingestion reversed cognitive impairment symptoms, possibly related to the activation of Akt and regulation of the intestinal flora pathway. Consumption of an EPEVLR-containing diet is beneficial for treating cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - The conserved MAP3K12/Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK) plays versatile roles in neuronal development, axon injury and stress responses, and neurodegeneration, depending on cell-type and cellular contexts. Emerging evidence implicates abnormal DLK signaling in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, our understanding of the DLK-dependent gene network in the central nervous system remains limited. Here, we investigated the roles of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons using conditional knockout and induced overexpression mice. We found that dorsal CA1 and dentate gyrus neurons are vulnerable to elevated expression of DLK, while CA3 neurons appear less vulnerable. We identified the DLK-dependent translatome that includes conserved molecular signatures and displays cell-type specificity. Increasing DLK signaling is associated with disruptions to microtubules, potentially involving STMN4. Additionally, primary cultured hippocampal neurons expressing different levels of DLK show altered neurite outgrowth, axon specification, and synapse formation. The identification of translational targets of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons has relevance to our understanding of selective neuron vulnerability under stress and pathological conditions.

AB  - Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells of the kidney glomerulus and are an essential part of the filtration barrier. Because of their position, they are exposed to constant biomechanical forces such as shear stress and hydrostatic pressure. These forces increase during disease, resulting in podocyte injury. It is likely podocytes have adaptative responses to help buffer against deleterious mechanical force and thus reduce injury. However, these responses remain largely unknown. Here, using the Drosophila model, we show the mechanosensor Cheerio (dFilamin) provides a key protective role in nephrocytes. We found expression of an activated mechanosensitive variant of Cheerio rescued filtration function and induced compensatory and hypertrophic growth in nephrocytes depleted of the nephrocyte diaphragm proteins Sns or Duf. Delineating the protective pathway downstream of Cheerio we found repression of the Hippo pathway induces nephrocyte hypertrophy, whereas Hippo activation reversed the Cheerio-mediated hypertrophy. Furthermore, we find Yorkie was activated upon expression of active Cheerio. Taken together, our data suggest that Cheerio acts via the Hippo pathway to induce hypertrophic growth, as a protective response in abnormal nephrocytes.

AB  - Ornithischian dinosaurs were ecologically prominent herbivores of the Mesozoic Era that achieved a global distribution by the onset of the Cretaceous. The ornithischian body plan is aberrant relative to other ornithodiran clades, and crucial details of their early evolution remain obscure. We present a new, fully articulated skeleton of the early branching ornithischian Heterodontosaurus tucki. Phase-contrast enhanced synchrotron data of this new specimen reveal a suite of novel postcranial features unknown in any other ornithischian, with implications for the early evolution of the group. These features include a large, anteriorly projecting sternum; bizarre, paddle-shaped sternal ribs; and a full gastral basket - the first recovered in Ornithischia. These unusual anatomical traits provide key information on the evolution of the ornithischian body plan and suggest functional shifts in the ventilatory apparatus occurred close to the base of the clade. We complement these anatomical data with a quantitative analysis of ornithischian pelvic architecture, which allows us to make a specific, stepwise hypothesis for their ventilatory evolution.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) interferes with long-term memory and cognitive functions by overactivation of phosphodiesterase (PDEs) enzymes. PDE4, a nonredundant regulator of the cyclic nucleotides (cAMP), is densely expressed in the hippocampus and is involved in learning and memory processes. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Roflumilast (ROF), a PDE4B inhibitor, on sleep deprivation-induced cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model. Memory assessment was performed using a novel object recognition task, and the hippocampal cAMP level was estimated by the ELISA method. The alterations in the expressions of PDE4B, amyloid-beta (A beta), CREB, BDNF, and synaptic proteins (Synapsin I, SAP 97, PSD 95) were assessed to gain insights into the possible mechanisms of action of ROF using the Western blot technique. Results show that ROF reversed SD-induced cognitive decline in mice. ROF downregulated PDE4B and A beta expressions in the brain. Additionally, ROF improved the cAMP level and the protein expressions of synapsin I, SAP 97, and PSD 95 in the hippocampal region of SD mice. Taken together, these results suggest that ROF can suppress the deleterious effects of SD-induced cognitive dysfunction via the PDE4B-mediated cAMP/CREB/BDNF signaling cascade.

AB  - Polyphenol ellagic acid (EA) possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, anti-diabetic and cardio protection activities, making it an interesting multi-targeting profile. EA also controls the central nervous system (CNS), since it was proven to reduce the immobility time of mice in both the forced swimming and the tail-suspension tests, with an efficiency comparable to that of classic antidepressants. Interestingly, the anti-depressant-like effect was almost nulled by the concomitant administration of selective antagonists of the noradrenergic receptors, suggesting the involvement of these cellular targets in the central effects elicited by EA and its derivatives. By in silico and in vitro studies, we discuss how EA engages with human alpha(2A)-ARs and alpha(2C)-AR catalytic pockets, comparing EA behaviour with that of known agonists and antagonists. Structurally, the hydrophobic residues surrounding the alpha(2A)-AR pocket confer specificity on the intermolecular interactions and hence lead to favourable binding of EA in the alpha(2A)-AR, with respect to alpha(2C)-AR. Moreover, EA seems to better accommodate within alpha(2A)-ARs into the TM5 area, close to S200 and S204, which play a crucial role for activation of aminergic GPCRs such as the alpha(2)-AR, highlighting its promising role as a partial agonist. Consistently, EA mimics clonidine in inhibiting noradrenaline exocytosis from hippocampal nerve endings in a yohimbine-sensitive fashion that confirms the engagement of naive alpha(2)-ARs in the EA-mediated effect.

AB  - Depression is a serious mental illness, mainly characterized as large mood swings and sleep, diet, and cognitive function disorders. NLPR3, one of the inflammasomes that can be activated by a variety of stimuli to promote the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, has been considered to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression. In this study, the putative role of CY-09, a selective and direct inhibitor of NLRP3, was evaluated in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mice. The results of the study indicated that CY-09 significantly decreased the levels of NLRP3 in the hippocampus of LPS-induced mice. In addition, CY-09 increased the sucrose preference and shortened the immobility time in LPS-induced mice, suggesting the antidepressant-like effects of inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome. Biochemical analysis showed that LPS significantly activated the NLRP3/ASC/cytokine signaling pathway and caused microglial activation, while CY-09 prevented the changes. Moreover, CY-09 increased the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) only in microglia but not in the whole hippocampus. Meanwhile, CY-09 did not promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus of LPS mice. In conclusion, the results of the study showed that the antidepressant-like effects of NLRP3 inhibitor CY-09 were mediated by alleviating neuroinflammation in microglia and independent of the neurotrophic function in the hippocampus.

AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa with epithelial dedifferentiation toward the mesenchymal phenotype, known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Asian sand dust (ASD) can induce nasal mucosal inflammation and cause the development of EMT. Korean red ginseng (KRG) and ginsenoside Rg3 have been used as traditional herbal medicines to treat various diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate their effect on ASD-induced EMT in nasal epithelial cells. Primary nasal epithelial cells were incubated with ASD with or without KRG or Rg3, and the production of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and interleukin (IL)-8 was measured. EMT markers were determined by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and confocal microscopy, and transcription factor expression by Western blot analysis. The effect on cell migration was evaluated using the wound scratch assay. Results showed ASD-induced TGF-beta 1 production, downregulation of E-cadherin, and upregulation of fibronectin in nasal epithelial cells. KRG and Rg3 suppressed TGF-beta 1 production (31.7% to 43.1%), upregulated the expression of E-cadherin (26.4% to 88.3% in mRNA), and downregulated that of fibronectin (14.2% to 46.2% in mRNA and 52.3% to 70.2% in protein). In addition, they suppressed the ASD-induced phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and mTOR, as well as inhibiting the ASD-induced migration of nasal epithelial cells (25.2% to 41.5%). The results of this study demonstrate that KRG and Rg3 inhibit ASD-induced EMT by suppressing the activation of ERK, p38, and mTOR signaling pathways in nasal epithelial cells.

AB  - Objective To investigate the relation between parental age, and behavioral, cognitive and brain differences in the children. Method Data with children aged 9-11 of 8709 mothers with parental age 15-45 years were analyzed from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. A general linear model was used to test the associations of the parental age with brain structure, and behavioral and cognitive problems scores. Results Behavioral and cognitive problems were greater in the children of the younger mothers, and were associated with lower volumes of cortical regions in the children. There was a linear correlation between the behavioral and cognitive problems scores, and the lower brain volumes (r > 0.6), which was evident when parental age was included as a stratification factor. The regions with lower volume included the anterior cingulate cortex, medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, and temporal lobe (FDR corrected p < 0.01). The lower cortical volumes and areas in the children significantly mediated the association between the parental age and the behavioral and cognitive problems in the children (all p < 10(-4)). The effects were large, such as the 71.4% higher depressive problems score, and 27.5% higher rule-breaking score, in the children of mothers aged 15-19 than the mothers aged 34-35. Conclusions Lower parental age is associated with behavioral problems and reduced cognitive performance in the children, and these differences are related to lower volumes and areas of some cortical regions which mediate the effects in the children. The findings are relevant to psychiatric understanding and assessment.

AB  - Dysregulation in brain neurotransmitters underlies several neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Also, abnormalities in the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway pave the way for neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and altered learning phenotype in ASD. Therefore, the effects of chronic systemic administration of the multiple-targeting antagonist ST-713 at the histamine H3 receptor (H3R) and dopamine D2/D3 receptors (D2/D3R) on repetitive self-grooming, aggressive behaviors, and abnormalities in the MAPK pathway in BTBR T + Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice were assessed. The results showed that ST-713 (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) mitigated repetitive self-grooming and aggression in BTBR mice (all p < 0.05), and the ameliorative effects of the most promising dose of ST-713 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) on behaviors were completely abrogated by co-administration of the H3R agonist (R)-alpha-methylhistamine or the anticholinergic drug scopolamine. Moreover, the elevated levels of several MAPK pathway proteins and induced proinflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and IL-6 were significantly suppressed following chronic administration of ST-713 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) (all p < 0.01). Furthermore, ST-713 significantly increased the levels of histamine and dopamine in hippocampal tissue of treated BTBR mice (all p < 0.01). The current observations signify the potential role of such multiple-targeting compounds, e.g., ST-713, in multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.

AB  - Status epilepticus is a severe neurological emergency that often leads to long-term neuronal damage and functional impairment. Gastrodin is a compound widely used in traditional Chinese medicine with potential neuroprotective effects. This study aims to investigate the effects of GAS on neuroinflammation and injury caused by LiCl/pilocarpine-induced SE in young rats. SE in rats was induced using the LiCl/pilocarpine model. Morris water maze and Y-maze experiments were used for the behavioral test of rats. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to quantify the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 levels, and biochemical kits assessed the levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) in hippocampus tissues. Additionally, Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the protein expression levels of p-p65, p65, p-I kappa B alpha and I kappa B alpha, which are key factors of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway. Compared to the control group, the SE group rats exhibited reduced learning and memory abilities. Markedly elevated levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8). The expression levels of p-p65 and p-I kappa B alpha were significantly upregulated, while I kappa B alpha levels were notably decreased. Following GAS treatment, the latency of seizure onset was significantly shortened, the incidence of SE was significantly reduced and the severity of nerve injury was alleviated. Additionally, both the inflammation levels and the oxidative stress were significantly decreased, primarily through inhibition NF-kappa B signaling pathway. These findings suggest that GAS may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating SE.

AB  - Physical activity may offset cognitive decline and dementia, but the molecular mechanisms by which it promotes neuroprotection remain elusive. In the absence of disease-modifying therapies, understanding the molecular effects of physical activity in the brain may be useful for identifying novel targets for disease management. Here we employed several bioinformatic methods to dissect the molecular underpinnings of physical activity in brain health. Network analysis identified 'switch genes' associated with drastic hippocampal transcriptional changes in aged cognitively intact individuals. Switch genes are key genes associated with dramatic transcriptional changes and thus may play a fundamental role in disease pathogenesis. Switch genes are associated with protein processing pathways and the metabolic control of glucose, lipids, and fatty acids. Correlation analysis showed that transcriptional patterns associated with physical activity significantly overlapped and negatively correlated with those of neurodegenerative diseases. Functional analysis revealed that physical activity might confer neuroprotection in Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's (HD) diseases via the upregulation of synaptic signaling pathways. In contrast, in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) its effects are mediated by restoring mitochondrial function and energy precursors. Additionally, physical activity is associated with the downregulation of genes involved in inflammation in AD, neurogenesis in FTD, regulation of growth and transcriptional repression in PD, and glial cell differentiation in HD. Collectively, these findings suggest that physical activity directs transcriptional changes in the brain through different pathways across the broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. These results provide new evidence on the unique and shared mechanisms between physical activity and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Cobalt (Co) toxicity has been reported to produce central nervous system and gastrointestinal abnormalities. This study assessed the therapeutic effect of cholecalciferol (Cho) supplementation against damages caused by sub-acute (14-day) cobalt chloride (CoCl2) exposure in the brain and intestines. Thirty-five male Wistar rats were divided equally into five groups: Group I (control) received no treatment; Group II received oral CoCl2 (100 mg/kg) only; Groups III, IV, and V received 1000, 3000 and 6000 IU/kg of cholecalciferol, respectively by oral gavage, and concurrently with CoCl2. Cobalt-treated rats showed neuronal vacuolation and presence of pyknotic nuclei in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, depletion of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, as well as inflammation and congestion in the intestinal mucosa. Cobalt also increased brain and intestinal hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, while simultaneously reducing glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. Further, CoCl2 induced increases in brain acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity and serum zonulin (ZO-1) levels. Conversely, Cho administration suppressed CoCl2-induced damages in the brain and intestines by reducing lipid peroxidation and increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Remarkably, Cho produced stimulation of brain choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and suppression of AchE activity, along with dose-dependent reduction in serum levels of ZO-1, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP) and nitric oxide. In conclusion, the protective role of cholecalciferol against cobalt-induced toxicity occurred via modulation of cholinergic, intestinal permeability and antioxidant pathways. The results may prove significant in the context of the role of gut-brain connections in neuroprotection.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition in the brain of senile plaques composed of amyloid-beta peptides (A beta s) that increase inflammation. An endogenous peptide derived from the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE), has IGF-I-sensitizing and neuroprotective actions. Here, we examined the effects of GPE on A beta levels and hippocampal inflammation generated by the intracerebroventricular infusion of A beta 25-35 for 2 weeks (300 pmol/day) in ovariectomized rats and the signaling-related pathways and levels of A beta-degrading enzymes associated with these GPE-related effects. GPE prevented the A beta-induced increase in the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and the reduction in activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, insulin receptor substrate-1, and Akt, as well as on interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-13 levels in the hippocampus. The functionality of somatostatin, measured as the percentage of inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and the levels of insulin-degrading enzyme, was also preserved by GPE co-treatment. These findings indicate that GPE co-administration may protect from A beta insult by changing hippocampal cytokine content and somatostatin functionality through regulation of leptin- and IGF-I-signaling pathways that could influence the reduction in A beta levels through modulation of levels and/or activity of A beta proteases.

AB  - The lysine-63 deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (CYLD) is long recognized as a tumor suppressor in immunity and inflammation, and its loss-of-function mutations lead to familial cylindromatosis. However, recent studies reveal that CYLD is enriched in mammalian brain postsynaptic densities, and a gain-of-function mutation causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD), suggesting critical roles at excitatory synapses. Here we report that CYLD drives synapse elimination and weakening by acting on the Akt-mTOR-autophagy axis. Mice lacking CYLD display abnormal sociability, anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and cognitive inflexibility. These behavioral impairments are accompanied by excessive synapse numbers, increased postsynaptic efficacy, augmented synaptic summation, and impaired NMDA receptor-dependent hippocampal long-term depression (LTD). Exogenous expression of CYLD results in removal of established dendritic spines from mature neurons in a deubiquitinase activity-dependent manner. In search of underlying molecular mechanisms, we find that CYLD knockout mice display marked overactivation of Akt and mTOR and reduced autophagic flux, and conversely, CYLD overexpression potently suppresses Akt and mTOR activity and promotes autophagy. Consequently, abrogating the Akt-mTOR-autophagy signaling pathway abolishes CYLD-induced spine loss, whereas enhancing autophagy in vivo by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin rescues the synaptic pruning and LTD deficits in mutant mice. Our findings establish CYLD, via Akt-mTOR signaling, as a synaptic autophagy activator that exerts critical modulations on synapse maintenance, function, and plasticity.

AB  - Point mutations in the beta 2 (N265S) and beta 3 (N265M) subunits of gamma-amino butyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) that render them insensitive to the general anesthetics etomidate and propofol have been used to link modulation of beta 2-GABA(A)Rs to sedation and beta 3-GABA(A)Rs to surgical immobility. These mutations also alter GABA sensitivity, and mice carrying the beta 3-N265M mutation have been reported to have impaired baseline memory. Here, we tested the effects of the beta 2-N265M and beta 3-N265M mutations on memory, movement, hotplate sensitivity, anxiety, etomidate-induced sedation, and intrinsic kinetics. We found that both beta 2-N265M and beta 3-N265M mice exhibited baseline deficits in the Context Preexposure Facilitation Effect learning paradigm. Exploratory activity was slightly greater in beta 2-N265M mice, but there were no changes in either genotype in anxiety or hotplate sensitivity. beta 2-N265M mice were highly resistant to etomidate-induced sedation, and heterozygous mice were partially resistant. In rapid solution exchange experiments, both mutations accelerated deactivation two- to three-fold compared to wild type receptors and prevented modulation by etomidate. This degree of change in the receptor deactivation rate is comparable to that produced by an amnestic dose of etomidate but in the opposite direction, indicating that intrinsic characteristics of GABA(A)Rs are optimally tuned under baseline conditions to support mnemonic function.

AB  - Organosulfur compounds, phenolic acids and flavonoids in raw and black garlic were determined, and followed by preparation of black garlic nanoemulsion for studying their effects on deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-induced hypertension and associated mild cognitive impairment in rats. Three organosulfur compounds, including diallyl sulfide (87.8 mu g/g), diallyl disulfide (203.9 mu g/g) and diallyl trisulfide (282.6 mu g/g) were detected in black garlic by GC-MS, while gallic acid (19.19 mu g/g), p-coumaric acid (27.03 mu g/g) and quercetin (22.77 mu g/g) were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. High doses of both black garlic extract and nanoemulsion prepared using Tween-80, glycerol, grapeseed oil and water could decrease systolic blood pressure through the elevation of bradykinin and nitric oxide levels as well as diminish aldosterone and angiotensin II levels in rats. In Morris water maze test, they could significantly decrease escape latency and swimming distance and increase the time spent in the target quadrant, accompanied by a decline of acetylcholinesterase activity and malondialdehyde level in the hippocampus as well as a rise in glutathione level and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. In addition, the levels of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 beta were reduced. Effects of lowering blood pressure and improving learning/memory ability in rats followed the order: lisinopril > black garlic nanoemulsion > black garlic extract.

AB  - The accumulation of oxidative stress is one of the important factors causing cellular senescence. Oxymatrine (OM) is a natural quinolizidine alkaloid compound known for its antioxidant effects. This study aimed to investigate the anti-senescence potential of OM through oxidative stress-induced in vitro and in vivo models. By treating 600 mu M of H2O2 to the HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line and by administering 150 mg/kg D-galactose to mice, we generated oxidative stress-induced senescence models. After providing 1, 2, and 4 mu g/mL of OM to the HT22 mouse cell line and by administering 50 mg/kg OM to mice, we evaluated the enhancing effects. We evaluated different senescence markers, AMPK activity, and autophagy, along with DCFH-DA detection reaction and behavioral tests. In HT22 cells, OM showed a protective effect. OM, by reducing ROS and increasing p-AMPK expression, could potentially reduce oxidative stress-induced senescence. In the D-Gal-induced senescence mouse model, both the brain and heart tissues recovered AMPK activity, resulting in reduced levels of senescence. In neural tissue, to assess neurological recovery, including anxiety symptoms and exploration, we used a behavioral test. We also found that OM decreased the expression level of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). In heart tissue, we could observe the restoration of AMPK activity, which also increased the activity of autophagy. The results of our study suggest that OM ameliorates oxidative stress-induced senescence through its antioxidant action by restoring AMPK activity.

AB  - Inflammation assumes a vital role in the pathogenesis of depression and in antidepressant treatment. Paeoniflorin (PF), a monoterpene glycoside analog possessing anti-inflammatory attributes, exhibits therapeutic efficacy on depression-like behavior in mice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antidepressant effects of PF on depression elicited by the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model and the precise neural sequence associated with the inflammatory process. In this study, we established an in vivo mouse model induced by CUMS and an in vitro BV2 cell model induced by LPS+ATP. The mechanism of PF for depression was assessed by the SIRT1 selective inhibitor EX-527. The findings demonstrated that PF significantly alleviated the damage of BV2 cells treated with LPS and ATP, inhibited the generation of ROS, up-regulated the expression of SIRT1 mRNA, and down-regulated the expression of nuclear NF-kappa B, p65, NLRP3, Caspase-1 and GSDMD-N in vitro. In vivo, PF mitigated the depressive-like behavior induced by CUMS, reduced the number of neurons, and decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemical results indicated that PF attenuated CUMS-induced hyperactivation of microglia. Moreover, the expression level of SIRT1 in the hippocampus was augmented, while the protein levels of NF-kappa B, p65, NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1 beta and GSDMD-N were diminished after PF treatment. Additionally, the selective inhibition of SIRT1 attenuated the therapeutic effect of PF on depression. These results imply that PF possesses antidepressant properties that rely on SIRT1 signaling to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases which lacks ideal treatment options. Kaempferol and kaempferide, two natural flavonol compounds isolated from Hippophae rhamnoides L., were reported to exhibit a strong regulatory effect on lipid metabolism, for which the mechanism is largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of kaempferol and kaempferide on oleic acid (OA)-treated HepG2 cells, a widely used in vitro model of NAFLD. The results indicated an increased accumulation of lipid droplets and triacylglycerol (TG) by OA, which was attenuated by kaempferol and kaempferide (5, 10 and 20 mu M). Western blot analysis demonstrated that kaempferol and kaempferide reduced expression of lipogenesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1). Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and CCAAT enhancer binding proteins beta (C/EBP beta), two adipogenic transcription factors, was also decreased by kaempferol and kaempferide treatment. In addition, western blot analysis also demonstrated that kaempferol and kaempferide reduced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear transcription factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Molecular docking was performed to identify the direct molecular targets of kaempferol and kaempferide, and their binding to SCD-1, a critical regulator in lipid metabolism, was revealed. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that kaempferol and kaempferide could attenuate OA-induced lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells, which might benefit the treatment of NAFLD.

AB  - Neuroimmune alterations have important implication in the neuropsychiatric symptoms and biochemical changes associated with lead-induced neurotoxicity. It has been suggested that inhibition of neuroinflammatory-mediated lead-induced neurotoxicity by phytochemicals enriched with antioxidant activities would attenuate the deleterious effects caused by lead. Hence, this study investigated the neuroinflammatory mechanism behind the effect of Ginkgo biloba supplement (GB-S) in lead-induced neurotoxicity in mice brains. Mice were intraperitoneally pretreated with lead acetate (100 mg/kg) for 30 min prior the administration of GB-S (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (50 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14 consecutive days. Symptoms of neurobehavioral impairment were evaluated using open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), and tail suspension test (TST) respectively. Thereafter, mice brain hippocampi were sectioned for myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha and IL-6) estimation and inflammatory protein (NF-kappa B) expression. Furthermore, histomorphormetric studies (Golgi impregnation and Cresyl violet stainings) were carried out. GB-S (10 and 20 mg/kg) significantly restores neurobehavioral impairments based on improved locomotion, reduced anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. Moreover, GB-S reduced the MPO activity, inhibits TNF-alpha, IL-6 release, and downregulates NF-kappa B immunopositive cell expression in mice hippocampus. Histomorphometrically, GB-S also prevents the loss of pyramidal neuron in the hippocampus. The endpoint of this findings suggest that GB-S decreases neuropsychiatric symptoms induced by lead acetate through mechanisms related to inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory mediators and suppression of hippocampal pyramidal neuron degeneration in mice.

AB  - Camelpox is an important infectious viral disease of camels. This viral infectious disease is considered one of the major concerns for camel breeding countries, and the most effective way to solve this problem is to develop a vaccine. In this research, we developed a vaccine against camelpox. Our developed vaccine was tested in mice and camels, and it was found that the candidate vaccine was innocuous to mice and camels. This developed vaccine can be used in camel breeding farms in the future to prevent significant economic losses caused by camel pox.
   This article describes the preparation of an inactivated vaccine from an attenuated strain of camelpox. The attenuated camelpox virus (CMLV) was grown in lamb kidney cells and in Vero cells. CMLV was accumulated to a significantly higher (p <= 0.05) titer in lamb kidney cells (7.75 +/- 0.08 log TCID50/mL) than in Vero cells (4.00 +/- 0.14 log TCID50/mL). During virus inactivation, a concentration of 0.05% beta-propiolactone (BPL) completely inactivated the virus in 6 h at a temperature of 22 +/- 1 degrees C, while a concentration of 0.2% formaldehyde inactivated the virus in 8 h. However, a viral antigen inactivated by BPL was used for vaccine preparation. The inactivated viral antigen was adsorbed with aluminum hydroxide gel, and as a result, an inactivated candidate vaccine was prepared. While the safety of the candidate vaccine was tested in camels and white mice, the protective efficacy of the vaccine was tested only in camels. In the safety evaluation of the inactivated vaccine, the vaccine was not observed to cause any adverse effects in mice and camels. During the immunogenicity study in camels, antibody formation started (0.2 +/- 0.16 log2) at Day 21 post-vaccination (PV), and the antibody titer peaked (1.33 +/- 0.21 log2) at Day 60 PV and decreased at Day 90 PV (0.50 +/- 0.22 log2). Furthermore, no antibodies were detected in vaccinated camels from Days 180 to 365 PV. Camels that received vaccination and were subsequently exposed to wild-type virus evinced a healthy state despite lacking antibodies. In contrast, unvaccinated camels exhibited susceptibility to camelpox upon challenge.

AB  - To investigate the effectiveness of nasal delivery of levetiracetam (LEV) on the distributions of synaptic vesicle protein 2 isoform A (SV2A) in epileptic rats with injection of kainic acid (KA) into amygdala. A total of 138 rats were randomly divided into four groups, including the Sham surgery group, the epilepsy group (EP), and the LEV oral administration (LPO) and nasal delivery (LND) groups. The rat intra-amygdala KA model of epilepsy was constructed. Pathological changes of rat brain tissue after status epilepticus (SE) were detected using haematoxylin and eosin staining. Expression of SV2A in rat hippocampus after SE was evaluated using the western blotting analysis. Expression and distribution of SV2A in rat hippocampus after SE were detected based on immunofluorescence staining. The EP group showed evident cell loss and tissue necrosis in the CA3 area of hippocampus, whereas the tissue damage in both LPO and LND groups was significantly reduced. Western blotting analysis showed that the expressions of SV2A in the hippocampus of both EP and LND groups were significantly decreased 1 week after SE, increased to the similar levels of the Sham group in 2 weeks, and continuously increased 4 weeks after SE to the level significantly higher than that of the Sham group. Results of immunofluorescence revealed largely the same expression patterns of SV2A in the CA3 area of hippocampus as those in the entire hippocampus. Our study revealed the same antiepileptic and neuronal protective effects by the nasal and oral administrations of LEV, without changing the expression level of SV2A.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is not only associated with seizures but also reported as an adverse effect of antiepileptic drugs. Thus, new molecules that can ameliorate seizures and maintain satisfactory cognitive function should be developed. The antiepileptic potential of asiatic acid, a triterpene derived from the medicinal herb Centella asiatica, has already been demonstrated; however, its role in epilepsy-related cognitive deficits is yet to be determined. In this study, we evaluated the effects of asiatic acid on cognitive deficits in rats with kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure and explored the potential mechanisms underlying these effects. Our results revealed that asiatic acid administrated intraperitoneally 30 min prior to KA (15 mg/kg) injection ameliorated seizures and significantly improved KA-induced memory deficits, as demonstrated by the results of the Morris water maze test. In addition, asiatic acid ameliorated neuronal damage, inhibited calpain activation, and increased protein kinase B (AKT) activation in the hippocampus of KA-treated rats. Asiatic acid also increased the levels of synaptic proteins and the number of synaptic vesicles as well as attenuated mitochondrial morphology damage in the hippocampus of KA-treated rats. Furthermore, proteomic and Western blot analyses of hippocampal synaptosomes revealed that asiatic acid reversed KA-induced changes in mitochondria function-associated proteins, including lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), ATP synthase (ATP5A), and mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3). Our data suggest that asiatic acid can prevent seizures and improve cognitive impairment in KA-treated rats by reducing hippocampal neuronal damage through the inhibition of calpain activation and the elevation of activated AKT, coupled with an increase in synaptic and mitochondrial function.

AB  - The potential of neural stem cells (NSCs) for neurological disorders the treatment has relied in large part upon identifying the NSCs fate decision. The hormone leptin has been reported to be a crucial regulator of brain development, able to influence the glial and neural development, yet, the underlying mechanism of leptin acting on NSCs' biological characteristics is still poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the role of leptin in the biological properties of NSCs. In this study, we investigate the possibility that leptin may regulate the NSCs' fate decision, which may promote the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs and thus act positively in neurological disorders. NSCs from the embryonic cerebral cortex were used in this study. We used CCK-8 assay, ki67 immunostaining, and FACS analysis to confirm that 25-100 ng/mL leptin promotes the proliferation of NSCs in a concentration-dependent pattern. This change was accompanied by the upregulation of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2, which are the classical downstream signaling pathways of leptin receptors b (LepRb). Inhibition of PI3K/AKT or MAPK/ERK signaling pathways both abolished the effect of leptin-induced proliferation. Moreover, leptin also enhanced the directed neuronal differentiation of NSCs. A blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway reversed leptin-stimulated neurogenesis, while a blockade of JAK2/STAT3 had no effect on it. Taken together, our results support a role for leptin in regulating the fate of NSCs differentiation and promoting NSCs proliferation, which could be a promising approach for brain repair via regulating the biological characteristics of NSCs.

AB  - Increased angiogenesis, especially the pathological type, has been documented in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and it is considered to be activated due to a vascular dysfunction-mediated hypoxic condition. To understand the role of the amyloid beta (A beta) peptide in angiogenesis, we analyzed its effects on the brains of young APP transgenic AD model mice. Immunostaining results revealed that A beta was mainly localized intracellularly, with very few immunopositive vessels, and there was no extracellular deposition at this age. Solanum tuberosum lectin staining demonstrated that compared to their wild-type littermates, the vessel number was only increased in the cortex of J20 mice. CD105 staining also showed an increased number of new vessels in the cortex, some of which were partially positive for collagen4. Real-time PCR results demonstrated that placental growth factor (PlGF) and angiopoietin 2 (AngII) mRNA were increased in both the cortex and hippocampus of J20 mice compared to their wild-type littermates. However, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA did not change. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the increased expression of PlGF and AngII in the cortex of the J20 mice. Neuronal cells were positive for PlGF and AngII. Treatment of a neural stem cell line (NMW7) with synthetic A beta(1-42) directly increased the expression of PlGF and AngII, at mRNA levels, and AngII at protein levels. Thus, these pilot data indicate that pathological angiogenesis exists in AD brains due to the direct effects of early A beta accumulation, suggesting that the A beta peptide regulates angiogenesis through PlGF and AngII expression.

AB  - Long-term dietary intake of elevated levels of refined sugars, fats and cholesterols is among the factors causing cognitive impairment. Ketone bodies can be used as an alternative energy source when glucose is not available. The study investigated the effects of a ketogenic diet (medium chain triglyceride, MCT) on cognitive performance after a long-term consumption of a high-fat-high-cholesterol diet using a mice model. Seventy eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFHC diet for 16 weeks to establish a model of an HFHC dietary pattern, before receiving intervention diets containing MCT diet or with Metformin for another 8 weeks in the second part of the experiment. Spatial learning, memory performance, and cortical and hippocampal protein expression levels were assessed. After consuming the HFHC diet for 16 weeks and subsequently receiving the MCT diet for 8 weeks, results showed that the mice fed a MCT diet had significantly better spatial learning and memory performance, lower expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF -KB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid protein precursor (APP) and phosphate tau, and higher expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) than the mice fed the HFHC diet. Long-term consumption of an HFHC diet caused a decline in cognitive functions and increased the risk factors for neurodegeneration, such as BBB permeability, neuropathy and inflammation. An MCT diet can be considered as an option for slowing down the early stage of neurodegeneration in mice. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exposure of ionizing radiation during early gestation often leads to deleterious and even lethal effects; however, few extensive studies have been conducted on late gestational exposures. This research examined the behavior al effects of C57Bl/6J mouse offspring exposed to low dose ionizing gamma irradiation during the equivalent third trimester. Pregnant dams were randomly assigned to sham or exposed groups to either low dose or sublethal dose radiation (50, 300, or 1000 mGy) at gestational day 15. Adult offspring underwent a behavioral and genetic analysis after being raised under normal murine housing conditions. Our results indicate very little change in the behavioral tasks measuring general anxiety, social anxiety, and stress-management in animals exposed prenatally across the low dose radiation conditions. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions were conducted on the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of each animal; results indicate some dysregulation in markers of DNA damage, synaptic activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and methylation pathways in the offspring. Together, our results provide evidence in the C57Bl/6J strain, that exposure to sublethal dose radiation (<1000 mGy) during the last period of gestation leads to no observable changes in behaviour when assessed as adults, although some changes in gene expression were observed for specific brain regions. These results indicate that the level of oxidative stress occurring during late gestation for this mouse strain is not sufficient for a change in the assessed behavioral phenotype, but results in some modest dysregulation of the genetic profile of the brain.

AB  - Theacrine, a purine alkaloid with pharmacological effects such as calming and anti-depressive activities, is biosynthesized through a key rate-limiting enzyme, caffeine oxidase. Despite its importance, the caffeine oxidase gene (CsCDH) in Camellia sinensis has not been cloned to date. We successfully isolated the full-length CsCDH cDNA, which contains a 501-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 166-amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 18.7 kDa. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations showed that CsCDH binds tightly and stably to caffeine, indicating its catalytic potential in converting caffeine to 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid. The CsCDH fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified through affinity chromatography. In vitro enzymatic assays verified that CsCDH catalyzes the conversion of caffeine into 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid. Furthermore, transient expression in tobacco confirmed its caffeine oxidase activity in planta. Finally, antisense oligonucleotide (asODN) interference experiments confirmed that CsCDH exhibits caffeine oxidase activity in tea plants. This study lays the groundwork for unraveling the theacrine biosynthesis pathway and offers new insights into breeding low-caffeine or high-theacrine tea cultivars.

AB  - In the hippocampus, the contributions of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) to neuronal transmission and synaptic plasticity change with aging, underlying calcium dysregulation and cognitive dysfunction. However, the relative contributions of NMDARs and LTCCs in other learning encoding structures during aging are not known. The piriform cortex (PC) plays a significant role in odor associative memories, and like the hippocampus, exhibits forms of long-term synaptic plasticity. Here, we investigated the expression and contribution of NMDARs and LTCCs in long-term depression (LTD) of the PC associational fiber pathway in three cohorts of Sprague Dawley rats: neonatal (1-2 weeks), young adult (2-3 months) and aged (20-25 months). Using a combination of slice electrophysiology, Western blotting, fluorescent immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging, we observed a shift from an NMDAR to LTCC mediation of LTD in aged rats, despite no difference in the amount of LTD expression. These changes in plasticity are related to age-dependent differential receptor expression in the PC. LTCC Cav1.2 expression relative to postsynaptic density protein 95 is increased in the associational pathway of the aged PC layer Ib. Enhanced LTCC contribution in synaptic depression in the PC may contribute to altered olfactory function and learning with aging.

AB  - CD2-Associated protein (CD2AP) is a candidate susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease, but its role in the mammalian central nervous system remains largely unknown. We show that CD2AP protein is broadly expressed in the adult mouse brain, including within cortical and hippocampal neurons, where it is detected at pre-synaptic terminals. Deletion of Cd2ap altered dendritic branching and spine density, and impaired ubiquitin-proteasome system activity. Moreover, in mice harboring either one or two copies of a germline Cd2ap null allele, we noted increased paired-pulse facilitation at hippocampal Schaffer-collateral synapses, consistent with a haploinsufficient requirement for pre-synaptic release. Whereas conditional Cd2ap knockout in the brain revealed no gross behavioral deficits in either 3.5- or 12-month-old mice, Cd2ap heterozygous mice demonstrated subtle impairments in discrimination learning using a touchscreen task. Based on unbiased proteomics, partial or complete loss of Cd2ap triggered perturbation of proteins with roles in protein folding, lipid metabolism, proteostasis, and synaptic function. Overall, our results reveal conserved, dose-sensitive requirements for CD2AP in the maintenance of neuronal structure and function, including synaptic homeostasis and plasticity, and inform our understanding of possible cell-type specific mechanisms in Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Constitutively active mutants of BRAF cause cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, characterized by growth and developmental defects, cardiac malformations, facial features, cutaneous manifestations, and mental retardation. An animal model of human CFC syndrome, the systemic BrafQ241R/+ mutant mouse, has been reported to exhibit multiple CFC syndrome-like phenotypes. In this study, we analyzed the effects of Braf mutations on neural function, separately from their effects on developmental processes. To this end, we generated Braf mutant mice expressing BRAFQ241R specifically in mature excitatory neurons (n-BrafQ241R/+). We found no growth retardation or cardiac malformations in n-BrafQ241R/+ mice, indicating normal development. Behavioral analysis revealed that n-BrafQ241R/+ mice exhibited reduced home cage activity and learning disability, which were similar to those of systemic BrafQ241R/+ mice. The active form of ERK was increased in the hippocampus of n-BrafQ241R/+ mice, whereas basal synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses seems to be normal. Transcriptome analysis of the hippocampal tissue revealed significant changes in the expression of genes involved in regulation of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, synaptic function and memory formation. These data suggest that the neuronal dysfunction observed in the systemic CFC mouse model is due to the disruption of homeostasis of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway by the activated Braf mutant after maturation, rather than abnormal development of the brain. A similar mechanism may be possible in human CFC syndrome.

AB  - Background This study aimed to explore the effect of inhibiting the Hippo/Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathway on the outcomes of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in treating transplanted hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods A transplanted HCC rat model was established. Then, rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham, TACE, verteporfin (inhibitor of Hippo/YAP), and TACE+verteporfin. Lent-OE-YAP was transfected into rats to overexpress YAP in vivo. After treatments, morphological changes, tumor weight, and the overall survival of rats in different groups were analyzed. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry staining, and Western blotting were used to determine the expression of factors related to the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. Results Tumor weight and tissue lesions in the TACE and verteporfin groups were significantly reduced compared with the Sham group. Verteporfin significantly decreased tumor weight after TACE treatment. In addition, verteporfin significantly improved the overall survival of rats with transplanted HCC after TACE treatment. Compared with the Sham group, both TACE and verteporfin groups exhibited significantly decreased expression of macrophage-stimulating (MST)1, MST2, long-acting thyroid stimulator 1, transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), Yes-associated protein (YAP), TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD)1, TEAD2, TEAD3, and TEAD4. TACE plus verteporfin significantly enhanced the downregulation of effectors in the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway and decreased tumor size, while the overexpression of YAP exerted opposite effects. Conclusion The inhibition of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway via verteporfin significantly improved the outcomes of TACE in treating transplanted HCC.

AB  - Even though electromagnetic fields have been reported to assist endogenous neurogenesis, little is known about the exact mechanisms of their action. In this pilot study, we investigated the effects of pulsating extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields on neural stem cell differentiation towards specific phenotypes, such as neurons and astrocytes. Neural stem cells isolated from the telencephalic wall of B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J mouse embryos (E14.5) were randomly divided into three experimental groups and three controls. Electromagnetic field application setup included a solenoid placed within an incubator. Each of the experimental groups was exposed to 50Hz ELF-EMFs of varied strengths for 1 h. The expression of each marker (NES, GFAP, beta-3 tubulin) was then assessed by immunocytochemistry. The application of high-strength ELF-EMF significantly increased and low-strength ELF-EMF decreased the expression of GFAP. A similar pattern was observed for beta-3 tubulin, with high-strength ELF-EMFs significantly increasing the immunoreactivity of beta-3 tubulin and medium- and low-strength ELF-EMFs decreasing it. Changes in NES expression were observed for medium-strength ELF-EMFs, with a demonstrated significant upregulation. This suggests that, even though ELF-EMFs appear to inhibit or promote the differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons or astrocytes, this effect highly depends on the strength and frequency of the fields as well as the duration of their application. While numerous studies have demonstrated the capacity of EMFs to guide the differentiation of NSCs into neuron-like cells or beta-3 tubulin+ neurons, this is the first study to suggest that ELF-EMFs may also steer NSC differentiation towards astrocyte-like phenotypes.

AB  - Early-life sleep deprivation (ESD) is a serious condition with severe cognitive sequelae. Considering hippocampus plays an essential role in cognitive regulation, the present study aims to determine whether melatonin, a neuroendocrine beard with significant anti-oxidative activity, would greatly depress the hippocampal oxidative stress, improves the molecular machinery, and consequently exerts the neuro-protective effects following ESD. Male weanling Wistar rats (postnatal day 21) were subjected to ESD for three weeks. During this period, the animals were administered normal saline or melatonin (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection between 09:00 and 09:30 daily. After three cycles of ESD, the animals were kept under normal sleep/wake cycle until they reached adulthood and were sacrificed. The results indicated that ESD causes long-term effects, such as impairment of ionic distribution, interruption of the expressions of neurotransmitters and receptors, decreases in the levels of several antioxidant enzymes, and impairment of several signaling pathways, which contribute to neuronal death in hippocampal regions. Melatonin administration during ESD prevented these effects. Quantitative evaluation of cells also revealed a higher number of neurons in the melatonin-treated animals when compared with the saline-treated animals. As the hippocampus is critical to cognitive activity, preserving or even improving the hippocampal molecular machinery by melatonin during ESD not only helps us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of ESD-induced neuronal dysfunction, but also the therapeutic use of melatonin to counteract ESD-induced neuronal deficiency.

AB  - Advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has a poor prognosis; this drives the exploration of alternative systemic therapies to identify more effective treatment options. Recent research has revealed that crebanine, an alkaloid derivative of the Stephania genus, induces apoptotic effects in various cancers; however, a thorough investigation of the role of crebanine in RCC has not been conducted thus far. For this study, we evaluated tumor cell viability, clonogenicity, cell-cycle distributions, morphological changes, and cell mortality with the aim of exploring the antitumor effects of crebanine in RCC. Furthermore, we compared gene and protein expressions using RNA sequencing analysis and Western blotting. The findings indicated that crebanine significantly inhibited RCC colonies and caused G1-phase cell-cycle arrest with sub-G1-phase accumulation, thus leading to suppressed cell proliferation and cell death. In addition, Hoechst 33342 staining was used to observe apoptotic cells, which revealed chromatin condensation and a reduction in the nuclear volume associated with apoptosis. Further, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that differentially expressed genes are involved in the initiation of DNA replication, centrosome duplication, chromosome congression, and mitotic processes in the cell cycle along with signaling pathways, such as I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, Hippo signaling, and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Consistent with GO and KEGG analyses, increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-7, and cleaved PARP, and decreased levels of cIAP1, BCL2, survivin, and claspin were observed. Finally, the expressions of G1/S phase transition cyclin D1, cyclin E/CDK2, and cyclin A2/CDK2 complexes were downregulated. Overall, these findings supported the potential of crebanine as an adjuvant therapy in RCC.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus leads to chronic complications, such as nephropathy. Diabetic complications are closely related to advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Excessive formation and accumulation of AGEs in diabetic renal diseases lead to excessive oxidative stress, resulting in chronic renal failure. The leaves of Hippophae rhamnoides L. (sea buckthorn leaves; SBL) show biological benefits, including antioxidant effects. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of SBL on kidney damage in db/db mice. The SBL extract was orally administered at 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) for 12 weeks to db/db mice. Histological changes and the urine albumin/creatinine ratio were relieved, and the accumulation of AGEs in kidney glomeruli decreased following SBL treatment. Moreover, the SBL extract reduced the expression of AGEs, the recep-tor for AGEs, and NADPH oxidase 4, but upregulated glyoxalase 1 in the diabetic renal tissue. Urinary excretion levels and expression of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine as a biomarker of oxidative stress decreased after SBL treatment in the renal tissue. Furthermore, SBL attenuated oxidative stress in diabetic kidneys by reducing AGE accumulation, thereby ameliorating renal damage. Therefore, from these results, we infer that the SBL extract can act as a potential therapeutic agent for diabetic renal complications caused by AGEs.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study is to freeze-drying (FD) of tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) and determine the drying kinetics using six different drying models. For this intent, a nonlinear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate four different criteria (R2, r, chi 2, RMSE) and determine the best-fitting model for each pressure level based on the highest R2 and r values and the lowest chi 2 and RMSE values. Fresh tea leaves farm in Rize, T & uuml;rkiye were placed in a laboratory-scale freeze dryer and dried until the product reached equilibrium moisture. FD experiments were performed at three different cabin pressures (0.008, 0.010, and 0.012 mbar) to examine the effect of pressure variation on drying time and quality parameters. After analyzing the experimental results, it was determined that the Alibas model best describes the drying process of tea leaves at 0.008 mbar and 0.010 mbar pressure, while the Improved Midilli-Kucuk model is the most suitable at 0.012 mbar pressure. As a consequence of the FD process, it has been noted that the hue angle changed between 86.98-87.38 depending on cabin pressure, i.e. there was a transition in the color of tea leaves from green to red. The a* (Redness/Greenness) value changed from-6.2 in the fresh product to +1.3 in the final product. The highest drying rate of tea leaves occurred at the lowest cabin pressure. As a consequence of the FD experiment, the water activity of the tea leaves decreased (from 0.9800 +/- 0.0093 to 0.2901 +/- 0.0077) to a level where no microbial growth would occur.

AB  - The type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) family produces the critical lipid regulator phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the plasma membrane (PM). Here, we investigated the potential role of PIP5K gamma, a PIP5K isoform, in the Hippo pathway. The ectopic expression of PIP5K gamma 87 or PIP5K gamma 90, two major PIP5K gamma splice variants, activated large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) and inhibited Yes-associated protein (YAP), whereas PIP5K gamma knockdown yielded opposite effects. The regulatory effects of PIP5K gamma were dependent on its catalytic activity and the presence of Merlin and LATS1. PIP5K gamma knockdown weakened the restoration of YAP phosphorylation upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor or lysophosphatidic acid. We further found that PIP5K gamma 90 bound to the Merlin's band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain, forming a complex with PI(4,5)P2 and LATS1 at the PM. Notably, PIP5K gamma 90, but not its kinase-deficient mutant, potentiated Merlin-LATS1 interaction and recruited LATS1 to the PM. Consistently, PIP5K gamma knockdown or inhibitor (UNC3230) enhanced colony formation in carcinoma cell lines YAP-dependently. In addition, PIP5K gamma 90 interacted with heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein (Hsc70), which also contributed to Hippo pathway activation. Collectively, our results suggest that PIP5K gamma regulates the Hippo-YAP pathway by forming a functional complex with Merlin and LATS1 at the PI(4,5)P2-rich PM and via interplay with Hsc70.

AB  - Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are used widely in various industries, but emerging evidence suggests their ability to elicit neurotoxicity. The present study evaluated the alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) neuroprotective potential against TiO2-NP-induced cognitive and molecular impairments in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Twenty-four rats were allocated into four groups: negative control, TiO2-NPs (150 mg/kg, i.p.), ALA (50 mg/kg, orally), and TiO2-NPs + ALA. Treatments were administered on alternate days for 28 days. Neurobehavioral tests, including the open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), novel object recognition test (NORT), and Morris water maze (MWM), revealed that TiO2-NPs impaired memory and increased anxiety-like behavior, while ALA co-treatment significantly restored behavioral performance. TiO2-NPs exposure significantly decreased antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH), increased lipid peroxidation (MDA), elevated proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6), and apoptotic marker (caspase-3), and reduced neurotransmitter levels (GABA and dopamine). ALA administration reversed these alterations, indicating antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Gene expression analysis showed TiO2-NPs upregulated BAX, NF-kappa B, APP, and MAPT and downregulated BCL-2 and Nrf2, consistent with neurodegenerative and apoptotic signaling. ALA co-treatment normalized these gene expressions. Histopathological analysis confirmed structural damage in the cerebrum and cerebellum after TiO2-NPs exposure, which ALA markedly improved. These findings suggest that ALA offers significant neuroprotection against TiO2-NP-induced toxicity via its antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis properties, and supports being a potential protective agent against nanoparticle-induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - Camelina sativa (CS) is an emerging sustainable oilseed crop with interesting feed application potentialities. The research assessed the potentiality of Camelina sativa (CS) in the diet for free-range laying hens, aiming at reaching a nutritional claim. To this purpose, two feeding groups of hens (n = 100 Livorno hens, n = 25 hens/pen) were farmed outdoor and received either a Control diet, which was a commercial diet for laying hens, or a CS diet. The latter was formulated to include the 5% CS cake and 1% CS oil, replacing conventional feedstuffs. Diets were isoprotein and isoenergy and were available ad libitum throughout the laying period (February-September). At day 1, n = 12 eggs/diet were sampled to assess the initial proximate composition and FA profile. Every 7 days the sampling was repeated to analyze the eggs' FA profile, up to day 35. At the end of the laying season, n = 6 hens/dietary treatment were slaughtered and subjected to meat quality evaluations. Results highlighted that a 28-day feeding was the period required to obtain 227 mg of C18:3 n-3 and 81 mg of C20:5 n-3 + C22:6 n-3/100 g egg, whereas a further 7 days of feeding trial were ineffective in further enhancing the omega-3 FA content of eggs. CS eggs were comparable to Control ones for overall physical traits, proximate composition, and shelf-life. In addition, at the end of the laying period, the meat of CS hens was also found to be healthier than that of Control ones, thanks to a higher omega-3 FA proportion (p < 0.01), which was, however, not sufficient to reach any nutritional claim. Instead, the proximate composition of CS meat was overall comparable to Control hens. In conclusion, the present research demonstrated that feeding Camelina sativa meal and oil to laying hens is feasible and allows to reach the nutritional claim in eggs "rich in omega-3 FA" after a feeding period of 28 days, without any negative effects on other eggs' quality trials. Camelina sativa can thus be defined as a promising sustainable feedstuff for the poultry sector for diversification purposes and to enhance the nutritional quality of eggs.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of B. subtilis HGcc-1 supplementation on the growth performance, immunity response, antioxidant capacity, intestinal microbiota and heat stress resistance of Litopenaeus vannamei. The results showed that B. subtilis HGcc-1 increased the activities of alpha-amylase and lipase and the activities of acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase, significantly decreased malondialdehyde content and significantly increased the activities of total antioxidant capacity, glutathione S-transferase, total superoxide dismutase, the expression levels of immune-related genes Toll and prophenoloxidase as compared to the control. Analysis of the intestinal microbial revealed that a significant increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes, such as Lactococcus. Conversely, there was a decrease in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, such as Vibrio and Shewanella. Furthermore, B. subtilis HGcc-1 supplementation may help alleviating heat stress injury in shrimp by modulating the Hippo signaling pathway. In summary, this study provided a valuable insight into the functional benefits of B. subtilis HGcc-1 supplementation in shrimp, offering a theoretical basis for its practical application in aquaculture.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with synaptic and memory dysfunction. One of the hallmarks of AD is reactive astrogliosis, with reactive astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques in the brain. Astrocytes have also been shown to be actively involved in disease progression, nevertheless, mechanistic information about their role in synaptic transmission during AD pathology is lacking. Astrocytes maintain synaptic transmission by taking up extracellular glutamate during synaptic activity through astrocytic glutamate transporter GLT-1, but its function has been difficult to measure in real-time in AD pathology. Here, we used an App knock-in AD model (App NL-G-F ) carrying the Swedish, Arctic and Beyreuther mutations associated with AD and exhibiting AD-like A beta plaque deposition and memory impairment. Using immunohistochemistry, patch-clamp of astrocytes, and Western blot from tissue and FACS isolated synaptosomes, we found that App NL-G-F mice at 6-8 months of age have astrocytes with clearly altered morphology compared to wild-type (WT). Moreover, astrocyte glutamate clearance function in App NL-G-F mice, measured as electrophysiological recordings of glutamate transporter currents, was severely impaired compared to WT animals. The reduction of glutamate uptake by astrocytes cannot be explained by GLT-1 protein levels, which were unchanged in synaptosomes and hippocampus of App NL-G-F mice. Our data suggest that astrocytic glutamate transporters are affected by excess A beta 42 in the brain contributing to synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus. This data contributes to the notion of restoring astrocyte synaptic function as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AD.

AB  - Decreased neurogenesis after brain exposure to ionizing radiation is linked to neurocognitive impairments. Using transgenic mouse models, we previously showed that abrogation of radiation-induced senescence, or apoptosis, can partially rescue neurogenesis in the subventricular and hippocampus regions. Here, we evaluate whether the injection of recombinant epidermal growth factor (rEGF) or mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) engineered to secrete EGF (MSC-EGF) can preserve neurogenesis. Using doublecortin (Dcx) expression and BrdU incorporation assays, we found that the injection of rEGF into the subventricular zone (SVZ) promotes neurogenesis, despite increasing apoptosis, in the brain of irradiated mice. The effect of rEGF was mostly localized, as Dcx expression was not induced in the hippocampus region and limited in the contralateral SVZ. Surprisingly, the injection of bone marrow-derived MSC alone, or secreting EGF, did not result in increased neurogenesis despite the fact that part of the MSC survived a few weeks after injection. Our results suggest that only a supraphysiological concentration of rEGF can promote neurogenesis, likely through a direct mitogenic effect. (C) 2021 by Radiation Research Society

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations has been implicated in various human diseases. A comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial genetic disorders requires suitable animal models for human disease studies. While gene knockout via premature stop codons is a powerful method for investigating the unique functions of target genes, achieving knockout of mtDNA has been rare. Here, we report the genotypes and phenotypes of heteroplasmic MT-ND5 gene-knockout mice. These mutant mice presented damaged mitochondrial cristae in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal atrophy, and asymmetry, leading to learning and memory abnormalities. Moreover, mutant mice are susceptible to obesity and thermogenetic disorders. We propose that these mtDNA gene-knockdown mice could serve as valuable animal models for studying the MT-ND5 gene and developing therapies for human mitochondrial disorders in the future.
   Mitochondria, often referred to as cell's powerhouses, are essential for energy production and health. In this study, researchers used recently developed ways to edit mtDNA, allowing precise changes to study disease results in animal models. They performed an experiment involving the injection of specially designed mRNAs, into mouse embryos to cause specific changes in mtDNA. This method allowed the creation of mice with targeted mitochondrial gene removals, providing a useful model for studying mitochondrial diseases. Researchers found that mice with certain mtDNA changes showed symptoms like human mitochondrial diseases, such as brain abnormalities and metabolic issues. These findings emphasize the importance of mtDNA in health and disease, providing insights into how specific changes can affect bodily functions. Future research may use these findings to develop therapies targeting mtDNA changes. This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author.

AB  - Enhancing adult neurogenesis in the brain has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. We developed a screening platform, ATRIVIEW (R), for molecules that activate neuronal differentiation of adult mouse NSCs. The most potent hit from an FDA-approved drug library was SNR1611 (trametinib), a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor. We found that trametinib increases the levels of P15INK4b and Neurog2, suggesting a mechanism by which MEK1/2 inhibition induces neuronal differentiation. Oral administration of trametinib increased adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone of the 5XFAD AD mouse model. Surprisingly, we also found that trametinib enhanced adult neurogenesis in the cortex. Consequently, trametinib rescued AD pathologies such as neuronal loss and cognitive impairment in 5XFAD mice. Finally, trametinib induced neurogenic differentiation of NSCs derived from AD patient iPSCs, which suggests its potential therapeutic application. Altogether, we suggest that restoration of endogenous adult neurogenesis by trametinib may be a promising therapeutic approach to AD.
   "Trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, promotes adult neurogenesis in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and human iPSC-derived neural stem cells." Researchers have discovered that trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, can enhance adult neurogenesis and replenish neurons in brain areas where neurodegeneration most affects Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study found that trametinib induced neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells and restored impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus and subventricular zone of the AD model mice, in addition to inducing adult cortical neurogenesis. It also demonstrated trametinib's potential for inducing neurogenic differentiation in AD patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived NSCs. These findings suggest that trametinib could be a promising therapeutic approach for treating AD and other neurodegenerative diseases by promoting adult neurogenesis.

AB  - AD is the abbreviation for Alzheimer's Disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder that features progressive dysfunction in cognition. Previous research has reported that mitophagy impairment and mitochondrial dysfunction have been crucial factors in the AD's pathogenesis. More recently, literature has emerged which offers findings suggesting that the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (short for NAD+) augmentation eliminates the defective mitochondria and restores mitophagy. Meanwhile, as an enzyme which is rate-limiting, the Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, or NAMPT, is part of the salvage pathway of NAD+ synthesis. Therefore, the aim of the research project has been to produce proof for how the NAMPT-NAD +-silent informationregulated transcription factors1/3 (short for SIRT1/3) axis function in mediating mitophagy in APP/PS1 mice aged six months. The results revealed that the NAMPT-NAD+-SIRT1/3 axis in the APP/PS1 mice's hippocampus was considerably declined. Surprisingly, P7C3 (an NAMPT activator) noticeably promoted the NAD+-SIRT1/3 axis, improved mitochondrial structure and function, enhanced mitophagy activity along with the ability of learning and memory. While FK866 (an NAMPT inhibitor) reversed the decreased NAD+-SIRT1/3 axis, and even exacerbated A beta plaque deposition level in the APP/PS1 mice's hippocampus. The findings observed in this study indicate two main points: avoiding downregulation of the NAMPT activity can prevent AD-related mitophagy impairment; on the other hand, NAMPT characterizes a potential therapeutic intervention regarding AD pathogenesis.

AB  - With the emergence of combined surgical treatments, complemented by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, survival rates for esophageal cancer patients have improved, but the overall 5-year survival rate remains low. Therefore, there is an urgent need for further research into the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer and the development of effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment methods. We initially utilized the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases to identify the esophageal cancer-associated gene WWOX (WW domain containing oxidoreductase). Subsequently, we employed RT-qPCR (Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR) and WB (western blot) to investigate the differential expression of WWOX in HEEC (human esophageal endotheliocytes) and various ESCC (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma) cell lines. We further evaluated alterations in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis via CCK8 (cell counting kit-8) and clonal formation, Transwell assays and flow cytometry. Additionally, we investigated changes in protein expressions related to the Hippo signaling pathway (YAP/TEAD) through RT-qPCR and WB. Lastly, to further elucidate the regulatory mechanism of WWOX in ESCC, we performed exogenous YAP rescue experiments in ESCC cells with WWOX overexpression to investigate the alterations in apoptosis and proliferation. Results indicated that the expression of WWOX in ESCC was significantly downregulated. Subsequently, upon overexpression of WWOX, ESCC cell proliferation and migration decreased, while apoptosis increased. Additionally, the expression of YAP and TEAD were reduced. However, the sustained overexpression of YAP attenuated the inhibitory effects of WWOX on ESCC cell malignancy. In conclusion, WWOX exerts inhibitory effects on the proliferation and migration of ESCC and promotes apoptosis by suppressing the Hippo signaling pathway. These findings highlight the potential of WWOX as a novel target for the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cancer.

AB  - The retrotransposon LINE-1 (L1) is central to the recent evolutionary history of the human genome and continues to drive genetic diversity and germline pathogenesis. However, the spatiotemporal extent and biological significance of somatic L1 activity are poorly defined and are virtually unexplored in other primates. From a single L1 lineage active at the divergence of apes and Old World monkeys, successive L1 subfamilies have emerged in each descendant primate germline. As revealed by case studies, the presently active human L1 subfamily can also mobilize during embryonic and brain development in vivo. It is unknown whether nonhuman primate L1s can similarly generate somatic insertions in the brain. Here we applied approximately 40x single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS), as well as retrotransposon capture sequencing (RC-seq), to 20 hippocampal neurons from two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). In one animal, we detected and PCR-validated a somatic L1 insertion that generated target site duplications, carried a short 5 ' transduction, and was present in similar to 7% of hippocampal neurons but absent from cerebellum and nonbrain tissues. The corresponding donor L1 allele was exceptionally mobile in vitro and was embedded in PRDM4, a gene expressed throughout development and in neural stem cells. Nanopore long-read methylome and RNA-seq transcriptome analyses indicated young retrotransposon subfamily activation in the early embryo, followed by repression in adult tissues. These data highlight endogenous macaque L1 retrotransposition potential, provide prototypical evidence of L1-mediated somatic mosaicism in a nonhuman primate, and allude to L1 mobility in the brain over the past 30 million years of human evolution.

AB  - The extreme contrast in stiffness between the hard scales and the surrounding soft issue of animals produces an unusual and attractive mechanism that inspires the designs of biomimetic armor. Despite the growing interest, there are few guidelines for the choice of material, optimal thickness, size, shape and arrangement of the protective scales. Here, we designed six biomimetic armors through simplifying and normalizing the biological armor structures while retaining the main features. We fabricated these structures by 3D printing technology and performed a comparative study of their mechanical properties. We found that the interactions between the adjacent scales significantly enhanced the mechanical performance. We investigated the effect of two important geometrical parameters, the overlapped depth ratio k and slanted angle & theta;, on the mechanical properties of the composite structures. Moreover, we analyzed the k values for the scales from different body parts of the herbivorous and carnivorous teleost. The optimized designs with different k-values were identified in different parts of the teleost. This study yields new insights into the mechanisms of the overlapped structures and suggests new designs for biomimetic protective systems. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exosomes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus are essential for modulating the cell signaling and controlling the neural differentiation of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs), which may determine the level of hippocampal adult neurogenesis. In the present study, we found that exosomes secreted by immature neurons may promote the neuronal differentiation of mouse NSCs in vitro. By miRNA sequencing, we discovered that miR-7a-5p was significantly lower in exosomes from differentiated immature neurons than those from undifferentiated NSCs. By modulating the level of miR-7a-5p, the mimic and inhibitor of miR-7a-5p could either inhibit or promote the neuronal differentiation of NSCs, respectively. Moreover, we confirmed that miR-7a-5p affected neurogenesis by directly targeting Tcf12, a transcription factor responsible for the differentiation of NSCs. The siRNA of Tcf12 inhibited neuronal differentiation of NSCs, while overexpression of Tcf12 promoted NSC differentiation. Thus, we conclude that the miR-7a-5p content in neural exosomes is essential to the fate determination of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and that miR-7a-5p directly targets Tcf12 to regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Theaflavins (TFs) are the characteristic components of black tea and have been widely acknowledged for their health benefits. The current study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanism of TFs, TF1, TF2a and TF3 on glycolipid metabolism in obese mice induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n = 8 per group) as follows: low-fat diet (LFD), HFD, HFD + metformin (Met, 100 mg kg(-1) d(-1)), HFD + TFs (TFs, 200 mg kg(-1) d(-1)), HFD + TF1 (TF1, 100 mg kg(-1) d(-1)), HFD + TF2a (TF2a, 100 mg kg(-1) d(-1)), and HFD + TF3 (TF3, 100 mg kg(-1) d(-1)). All groups were studied for 9 weeks continuously. The levels of serum glucose, insulin, TC, TG, LDL and HLD in the plasma, lipid accumulation in the liver, and injury of the liver were investigated. In addition, the effects of TFs and their monomers on the SIRT6/AMPK/SREBP-1/FASN pathway were also evaluated. The results showed that oral administration of TFs, TF1, TF2a and TF3 not only dramatically suppressed weight gain, reduced blood glucose level, and ameliorated insulin resistance but also obviously lowered the levels of serum TC, TG and LDL, suppressed the activities of ALT and AST, and ameliorated hepatic damage in mice fed a HFD when compared to the HFD group. Western blot analysis showed that TFs, TF1, TF2a and TF3 treatments increased the expression of SIRT6 and suppressed the expression levels of SREBP-1 and FASN significantly in mice fed a HFD as compared to the HFD group. The phosphorylation of AMPK in mice fed a HFD was obviously elevated by TF2a and TF3 when compared to the HFD group. These results proved for the first time that TF1, TF2a and TF3 improved the glucolipid metabolism of mice fed a HFD, and activated the SIRT6/AMPK/SREBP-1/FASN signaling pathway to inhibit the synthesis and accumulation of lipids in the liver to ameliorate obesity in mice fed a HFD. These findings indicate that TFs, TF1, TF2a and TF3 as the main functional components of black tea might potentially be used as a food additive for improving glycolipid metabolism and ameliorating obesity, and TF3 may be the best choice.

AB  - To obtain a theoretical reference for understanding the changes in metabolites of Yigong tea leaves during different harvesting periods and to determine the optimal harvesting period, we performed a metabolome comparison using UPLC-Q-Exactive MS on Yigong tea leaves from different harvesting periods. The results indicated that a total of 41 metabolites were significantly altered during the growth of Yi Gong tea leaves. These involved 7 amino acids and their derivatives, 16 flavonols and flavonol glycosides, 4 organic acids, 3 catechins, 3 carbohydrates, 7 fatty acid esters, 1 terpene, and 3 substances from others. In particular, the levels of arginine and glutamine were higher in early-harvested tea leaves than in late-harvested tea leaves; the levels of flavonoids and flavonols were higher in late-harvested tea leaves. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the caffeine metabolism and the flavonoid biosynthesis perform key roles in Yigong tea leaves from different harvesting periods. Practical Applications At present, the application of metabolomics in tea research is focused on the study of pesticide residues, processing processes, environmental stresses, and regional differences. This study is to focus on the effect of the tea harvesting period on tea quality through metabolomics. Through metabolomics, we can better determine the optimal tea harvesting period, and this study can improve the quality of this tea product and may be able to bring some favourable favorable contributions contribution to the local tea marketing in the future.

AB  - Neurosteroids are steroids synthesized de novo from cholesterol in brain regions, and regulate processes associated with the development and functioning of the nervous system. Enzymes and proteins involved in the synthesis of these steroids have been detected in several brain regions, including hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex. Hippocampus has long been associated with learning and memory functions, while the loss of its functionality has been linked to neurodegenerative pathologies. In this sense, neurosteroids are critical for the maintenance of hippocampal functions and neuroprotective effects. Moreover, several factors have been shown to deregulate expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the rodent brain, including aging, enrichment experiences, diet habits, drug/alcohol consumption, hormone fluctuations, neurodegenerative processes and other diseases. These transcriptional deregulations are mediated mainly by transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms. An epigenetic modification of chromatin involves changes in bases and associated proteins in the absence of changes in the DNA sequence. One of the most well-studied mechanisms related to gene silencing is DNA methylation, which involves a reversible addition of methyl groups in a cytosine base. Importantly, these epigenetic marks could be maintained over time and could be transmitted transgenerationally. The aim of this chapter is to present the most relevant steroidogenic enzymes described in rodent hippocampus; to discuss about their transcriptional regulation under different conditions; to show the main gene control regions and to propose DNA methylation as an epigenetic mechanism through which the expression of these enzymes could be controlled.

AB  - The adverse effects of elevated temperatures on human health are becoming progressively severe. This research established a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction induced by heat stress to examine the impact of omega-3 PUFAs on the cognitive capabilities of heat-stressed mice. The study also aimed to elucidate the role and potential mechanisms of autophagy regulation in cognitive enhancement through omega-3 PUFAs interventions. Administration of omega-3 PUFAs ameliorated cognitive deficits in heat-stressed mice and increased brain concentrations of these fatty acids. Notably, omega-3 PUFAs significantly protected hippocampal neurons' morphology, quantity, and synaptic architecture in heat-stressed mice. Additionally, omega-3 PUFAs intake reduced the prevalence of damaged mitochondria in the hippocampus and mitigated oxidative harm. Further investigation revealed that heat stress induces autophagy. However, the autophagic process becomes dysfunctional, leading to impaired autophagic activity. Omega-3 PUFAs supplementation markedly augmented hippocampal autophagy in the heat-stressed mice. Moreover, heat stress upregulated the phosphorylation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in both the mouse hippocampus and HT22 cells. In contrast, omega-3 PUFAs intake significantly diminished the phosphorylation levels within this pathway, alleviating the autophagic fusion barrier imposed by heat stress and promoting autophagic flux. The findings suggest that omega-3 PUFAs supplementation during heat stress may bolster autophagic function by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. This modulation reduces structural and oxidative stress damage, ultimately enhancing cognitive function in mice subjected to heat stress.

AB  - BackgroundNeuroinflammation is crucial in the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), and microglial activation is an active participant in this process. SS-31, a mitochondrion-targeted antioxidant, is widely regarded as a potential drug for neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory diseases. In this study, we sought to explore whether SS-31 plays a neuroprotective role and the underlying mechanism.MethodsInternal fixation of tibial fracture was performed in 18-month-old mice to induce surgery-associated neurocognitive dysfunction. LPS was administrated to BV2 cells to induce neuroinflammation. Neurobehavioral deficits, hippocampal injury, protein expression, mitophagy level and cell state were evaluated after treatment with SS-31, PHB2 siRNA and an STING agonist.ResultsOur study revealed that SS-31 interacted with PHB2 to activate mitophagy and improve neural damage in surgically aged mice, which was attributed to the reduced cGAS-STING pathway and M1 microglial polarization by decreased release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) but not nuclear DNA (nDNA). In vitro, knockdown of PHB2 and an STING agonist abolished the protective effect of SS-31.ConclusionsSS-31 conferred neuroprotection against POCD by promoting PHB2-mediated mitophagy activation to inhibit mtDNA release, which in turn suppressed the cGAS-STING pathway and M1 microglial polarization.

AB  - Social stress is widely recognized for increasing ethanol consumption, an effect mediated by an enhanced neuroinflammatory response. High-fat diets (HFDs) alleviate stress and have been shown to reduce cocaine-seeking behavior, likely by serving as an alternative reinforcer. This study examines whether intermittent HFD administration following social defeat (SD) mitigates long-term increases in ethanol (EtOH) consumption and neuroinflammatory responses in adult male mice. Two intermittent HFD protocols were tested: HFD1 x 2 (one-hour access twice a week), and HFD2 x 3 (two-hour access three times a week), initiated immediately after the last SD episode and maintained through the drinking-in-the-dark (DID) protocol. Defeated mice were categorized as resilient or susceptible using the social interaction test (SIT). At the end of the procedure, gene expression analysis of neuroinflammatory markers was conducted in the hippocampus and striatum. Intermittent HFD did not increase body weight, despite promoting binge-eating behavior. As expected, only susceptible SD mice on a standard diet (STD) showed increased ethanol consumption, whereas those on either HFD protocol consumed ethanol at levels comparable to non-stressed controls. Elevated Il-6 and Tnf alpha levels, along with mitochondrial dysfunction, were observed in the hippocampus and striatum of STD-fed defeated mice but were entirely absent in HFD-fed mice. These findings suggest that intermittent HFD access effectively prevents stress-induced ethanol consumption and neuroinflammatory alterations. Limited HFD access may represent a promising nutritional strategy to counteract stress-related alcohol use disorders.

AB  - This research investigated the effects of camel whey protein (CWP) treatment on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats and insulin resistance (IR) HepG2 cell models. Body weight and fasting blood glucose were observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats every week, and biochemical parameters in serum samples were evaluated after 6 weeks. Antioxidant activity in the liver was estimated, and histological examination of the liver tissues was conducted. After CWP treatment, the glucose uptake and lipid accumulation were examined in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Our results indicated that CWP mitigated the body weight loss, reversed dyslipidemia, and inhibited the inflammatory response, in T2DM rats. Meanwhile, it protected the liver from being injured by reducing the level of oxidative stress. In the CWP group, the pathological changes were significantly reduced, while the liver lobule structure, liver cell arrangement, as well as congestion, edema, and vacuolization were improved. Our results from quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analyses showed that CWP could up-regulate the expression levels of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and glycogen synthase (GS). An active protein component CWP8 was isolated and identified, which was shown to be able to stimulate glycogen synthesis and ameliorate lipid accumulation in IR HepG2 cells. These data indicate that CWP and CWP8 might act as potential natural products regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in T2DM.

AB  - Background: This paper investigates the effect of intranasal insulin administration on brain glutathione (GSH) levels and elucidates the potential mechanism by which insulin enhances antioxidant defenses in the brain. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were intranasally administered insulin (2 IU/day) or saline for 7 days. GSH levels were measured in the brain and liver. Blood glucose concentrations and daily food intake were also monitored. Protein levels of excitatory amino acid carrier-1 (EAAC1), its interaction with glutamate transport-associated protein 3-18(GTRAP3-18), and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were assessed. Results: Insulin-treated mice exhibited significantly higher GSH levels in the hippocampus and midbrain compared to saline-treated controls, while no significant differences were found in liver GSH levels, blood glucose concentrations, or food intake. EAAC1 expression increased in both the cytosolic and plasma membrane fractions of insulin-treated mouse brains. Furthermore, the interaction between EAAC1 and its negative regulator, GTRAP3-18, along with activated AMPK levels, was reduced in insulin-treated mice. Conclusions: Intranasal insulin administration enhances brain GSH levels through a mechanism involving EAAC1 upregulation and reduced AMPK activation. These findings suggest that intranasal insulin could be a promising strategy for enhancing antioxidant defenses against neurodegeneration in the brain.

AB  - Acrylamide (ACR), a well-documented neurotoxicant to humans, is extensively found in starchy foods. More than 30% of the typical daily calorie intake comes from ACRcontaining foods. Epidemiological and toxicological studies have found that ACR exposure is associated with mild cognitive change in men and experimental animals. However, there is limited information on the mechanisms by which ACR exposure induces memory deficits. The aberrant activation of the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha) signaling pathway is emerging as a major common theme in cognitive decline. The present study is designed to explore the effect of subchronic ACR exposure on the PERK signaling and the synaptic impairment to elucidate the potential mechanism of ACR-induced cognitive dysfunction in rat. ACR exposure at 5 and 10 (mg/kg)/day by gavage for 14 weeks results in gait abnormality and cognitive impairment in rats, which were accompanied by neuronal loss, glial cell proliferation, and synaptic ultrastructure damage in the hippocampus. ACR reduced the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (PCREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and synaptic vesicle proteins synapsin-1 and synaptophysin synthesis. ACR also excessively activates the PERK-eIF2 alpha signaling, resulting in overexpression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). This work helps to propose a possible mechanism of subchronic exposure of ACR-induced neurotoxicity.

TI  - Biochemical and Structural Characterization of a Peptidic Inhibitor of the YAP:TEAD Interaction That Binds to the a-Helix Pocket on TEAD
T2  - ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - YAP
KW  - PATHWAY
AB  - The TEAD transcription factors are the most distal elements of the Hippo pathway, and their transcriptional activity is regulated by several proteins, including YAP. In some cancers, the Hippo pathway is deregulated and inhibitors of the YAP:TEAD interaction are foreseen as new anticancer drugs. The binding of YAP to TEAD is driven by the interaction of an alpha-helix and an omega loop present in its TEAD-binding domain with two distinct pockets at the TEAD surface. Using the mRNA-based display technique to screen a library of in vitro-translated cyclic peptides, we identified a peptide that binds with a nanomolar affinity to TEAD. The X-ray structure of this peptide in complex with TEAD reveals that it interacts with the alpha-helix pocket. Under our experimental conditions, this peptide can form a ternary complex with TEAD and YAP. Furthermore, combining it with a peptide binding to the omega-loop pocket gives an additive inhibitory effect on the YAP:TEAD interaction. Overall, our results show that it is possible to identify nanomolar inhibitors of the YAP:TEAD interaction that bind to the alpha-helix pocket, suggesting that developing such compounds might be a strategy to treat cancers where the Hippo pathway is deregulated.

AB  - Socioeconomic disadvantage has been linked to increased stress exposure in children and adults. Exposure to stress in childhood has been associated with deleterious effects on cognitive development and well-being throughout the lifespan. Further, exposure to stress has been associated with differences in brain development in children, both in cortical and subcortical gray matter. However, less is known about the associations among socioeconomic disadvantage, stress, and children's white matter development. In this study, we investigated whether socioeconomic disparities would be associated with differences in white matter microstructure in the cingulum bundle, as has been previously reported. We additionally investigated whether any such differences could be explained by differences in stress exposure and/or physiological stress levels. White matter tracts were measured via diffusion tensor imaging in 58 children aged 5-9 years. Results indicated that greater exposure to stressful life events was associated with higher child hair cortisol concentrations. Further, physiological stress, as indexed by hair cortisol concentrations, were associated with higher fractional anisotropy in the cingulum bundle. These results have implications for better understanding how perceived and physiological stress may alter neural development during childhood.

AB  - Background: Hepatic fibrosis is a complex and dynamic process similar to "wound healing" that results in the progressive accumulation of connective tissue. We aimed to investigate the epigenetic control of liver fibrosis and Hippo pathway in human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line. We examined the effect of Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor on the LX2 cell line.
   Material and methods: 2.5 mu M SAHA was treated to LX2 cell line for 2 days. Cell proliferation and apoptosis measurement were performed by Muse Cell Analyzer. Yes-Associated Protein/Transcriptional Coactivator With Pdz-Binding Motif (YAP/TAZ) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein expression levels were measured by western blotting.
   Results: In our study, we observed that the SAHA treatment reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis of LX2 cells statistically. We found that SAHA treatment decreased alpha-SMA, YAP and TAZ proteins levels statistically.
   Conclusion: Decreased cell viability could be due to physiological, autophagical and also related to the apoptotical mechanisms. We thought that SAHA plays an important role in the creation of the fates of the LX2 cell line.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the effect of prolonged sevoflurane (SEV) exposure on differentiation potential and hypoxia tolerance of neural stem cells (NSCs). Materials and methods NSCs were extracted from 15-day fetal mice. After sub-culture, SEV exposure treatment was performed. Cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry. Western blot and immunofluorescence assay were used to detect the expression and spatial distribution of Nestin, NSE, GFAP, Oct4, and SOX2; CCK-8 detected cell viability. Cell growth morphology was observed under a microscope. TUNEL detected cell apoptosis; the concentration of extracel-lular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was determined by ELISA. Results Compared with the control group, the proportion of NSCs in the G2/M phase increased in the SEV exposure group; our results also suggested the sphere-formation rate decreased significantly, increased apoptosis and decreased cell viability. Besides, the level of LDH release increased. Conclusion Long-term exposure to SEV (>8 h) promoted the premature differentiation of NSCs and reduced their pluripotency, reserves, and hypoxia tolerance. This study reveals the reasons underlying damage to the nervous system of young children induced by long-term exposure to SEV from the perspective of CNS reserve cells.

AB  - Studies have demonstrated that chronic consumption of abused drugs induces alterations in several proteins that regulate metabolism. For instance, methamphetamine exposure reduces glucose levels. Fatty and amino acid levels were altered in groups exposed to abused drugs. Therefore, in our study, we investigated the serum metabolomic profile of patients diagnosed with cannabis and/or amphetamine use disorders. Blood was obtained from subjects (control, amphetamine, and cannabis). Detection of serum metabolites was performed using gas chromatography. The ratio peak areas for metabolites were analyzed across the three groups. Both cannabis and amphetamine groups showed higher d-erythrotetrafuranose, octadecanoic acid, hexadecenoic acid, trans-9-octadecanoic acid, lactic acid and methyl thio hydantoin metabolites compared with the control group. Moreover, cannabis patients were found to possess higher glycine, 9,12 octadecanoic acid malonic acid, phosphoric acid and prostaglandin F1a than controls. Our analysis showed that the identified metabolic profile of cannabis or amphetamine use disorder patients was different than control group. Our data indicated that chronic exposure to cannabis or amphetamine dysregulated metabolites in the serum. Future studies are warranted to explore the effects of these abused drugs on the metabolic proteins.

AB  - This study confirmed the ameliorating effect of immature persimmon (Diospyros kaki) ethanolic extract (IPEE) on neuronal cytotoxicity in amyloid beta (A beta)(1-)(42)-induced ICR mice. The administration of IPEE ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction in A beta(1-)(42)-induced mice by improving the spatial working memory, the short-term and long-term memory functions. IPEE protected the cerebral cholinergic system, such as the acetylcholine (ACh) level and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and antioxidant system, such as the superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction against A beta(1-)(42)-induced toxicity was reduced by regulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP contents. In addition, IPEE regulated the expression levels of tau signaling, such as TNF-alpha, p-JNK, p-Akt, p-GSK3 beta, p-tau, p-NF-kappa B, BAX and caspase 3. Finally, gallic acid, ellagic acid and quercetin 3-O-(6 ''-acetyl-glucoside) were identified as the physiological compounds of IPEE using ultra-performance liquid chromatography ion mobility separation quadrupole time-of-flight/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC IMS Q-TOF/MS2).

AB  - It is well known that financial disadvantage is associated with alterations in brain development in regions critical to socioemotional well-being such as the hippocampus and the amygdala. Yet little is known about whether family income at different points in development is differentially associated with these structures. Furthermore, little is known about which environmental factors statistically mediate associations between income and subcortical structure. Using a longitudinal birth cohort and linear mixed-effects models, we identified associations between income-to-needs ratio (INR) at 6 timepoints throughout childhood and hippocampal and amygdala volumes at age 7-9 years (n = 41; 236 INR measurements; 41 brain measurements). Mediation analysis identified environmental sequelae of income that statistically accounted for INR-brain associations. Lower INR prior to age 4 was associated with smaller hippocampal volumes, whereas lower INR prior to age 2 was associated with smaller right amygdala volume. These associations were mediated by unmet basic needs (e.g., food, housing). These findings delineate the temporal specificity of associations between income and hippocampal and amygdala structures.

AB  - Excess extracellular glutamate leads to excitotoxicity, which induces neuronal death through the overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Excitotoxicity is thought to be closely related to various acute and chronic neurological disorders, such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Polygalasaponin F (PGSF) is a triterpenoid saponin monomer that can be isolated from Polygala japonica, and has been reported to protect cells against apoptosis. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of PGSF against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, PGSF-pretreated hippocampal neurons were exposed to glutamate for 24 hours. The results demonstrated that PGSF inhibited glutamate-induced hippocampal neuron death in a concentration-dependent manner and reduced glutamate-induced Ca2+ overload in the cultured neurons. In addition, PGSF partially blocked the excess activity of NMDARs, inhibited both the downregulation of NMDAR subunit NR2A expression and the upregulation of NMDAR subunit NR2B expression, and upregulated the expression of phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These findings suggest that PGSF protects cultured hippocampal neurons against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity by regulating NMDARs. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of Nanchang University (approval No. 2017-0006) on December 29, 2017.

AB  - Brivaracetam (BRV) is an anti-seizure drug for the treatment of focal and generalized epileptic seizures shown to augment short-term synaptic fatigue by slowing down synaptic vesicle recycling rates in control animals. In this study, we sought to investigate whether altered short-term synaptic activities could be a pathological hallmark during the interictal periods of epileptic seizures in two well-established rodent models, as well as to reveal BRV's therapeutic roles in altered short-term synaptic activities and low-frequency band spontaneous brain hyperactivity in these models. In our study, the electrophysiological field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were performed in rat hippocampal brain slices from the CA1 region by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway with or without BRV (30 mu M for 3 h) in control or epileptic seizure (induced by pilocarpine (PILO) or high potassium (h-K+)) models. Short-term synaptic activities were induced by 5, 10, 20, and 40-Hz stimulation sequences. The effects of BRV on pre-synaptic vesicle mobilization were visually assessed by staining the synaptic vesicles with FM1-43 dye followed by imaging with a two-photon microscope. In the fEPSP measurements, short-term synaptic fatigue was found in the control group, while short-term synaptic potentiation (STP) was detected in both PILO and h-K+ models. STP was decreased after the slices were treated with BRV (30 mu M) for 3 h. BRV also exhibited its therapeutic benefits by decreasing abnormal peak power (frequency range of 8-13 Hz, 31% of variation for PILO model, 25% of variation for h-K+ model) and trough power (frequency range of 1-4 Hz, 66% of variation for PILO model, 49% of variation for h-K+ model), and FM1-43 stained synaptic vesicle mobility (64% of the variation for PILO model, 45% of the variation for h-K+ model) in these epileptic seizure models. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first report that BRV decreased the STP and abnormal low-frequency brain activities during the interictal phase of epileptic seizures by slowing down the mobilization of synaptic vesicles in two rodent models. These mechanistic findings would greatly advance our understanding of BRV's pharmacological role in pathomechanisms of epileptic seizures and its treatment strategy optimization to avoid or minimize BRV-induced possible adverse side reactions.

AB  - Neonatal mammals must rapidly adapt to significant physiological changes during the transition from the intrauterine to extrauterine environments. This adaptation, particularly in the metabolic and respiratory systems, is essential for survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate various physiological and pathological processes by binding to the 3 ' untranslated regions of mRNAs. This study aimed to identify miRNAs involved in the early extrauterine adaptation of neonatal piglets and explore their functions. We performed small RNA sequencing on six tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, multifidus muscle, and duodenum) from piglets 24 h before birth (day 113 of gestation) and 6 h after birth. A total of 971 miRNA precursors and 1511 mature miRNAs were identified. Tissue-specific expression analysis revealed 881 tissue-specific miRNAs and 164 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) across the tissues. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these DE miRNAs are significantly enriched in pathways related to early extrauterine adaptation, such as the NF kappa B, PI3K/AKT, and Hippo pathways. Specifically, miR-22-3p was significantly upregulated in the liver post-birth and may regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway by targeting AKT3, promoting gluconeogenesis, and maintaining glucose homeostasis. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and HepG2 cell experiments confirmed AKT3 as a target of miR-22-3p, which activates the AKT/FoxO1 pathway, enhancing gluconeogenesis and glucose production. Furthermore, changes in blood glucose and liver glycogen levels in newborn piglets further support the role of miR-22-3p in glucose homeostasis. This study highlights the importance of miRNAs, particularly miR-22-3p, in the early extrauterine adaptation of neonatal piglets, offering new insights into the physiological adaptation of neonatal mammals.

AB  - Excessive high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) consumption is known to cause oxidative stress, which induces transient receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2) channel gating. Oxidative stress-induced TRPM2 gating is suggested to play an important role in neurons, indicating a role for the TRPM2 channel in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. We investigated the effects of HFCS and chronic immobilization stress (CIS) on TRPM2 channel immunoreactivity, anxiety, and depressive-like behaviors in adult male rats. The male rats (n=8/group) were divided into 4 groups: Control, 20% HFCS (F20), 40% HFCS (F40), and stress. The control group received tap water, and F20 and F40 groups were exposed to 20% and 40% HFCS respectively for 14 consecutive days. Rats in the stress group were subjected to immobilization stress for 3 or 6 hours daily in the first and second weeks to induce CIS. Then, light/dark test, open field test (OFT), and tail suspension test (TST) were performed, respectively. In the light/dark test, the time spent in the dark chamber significantly increased in all groups vs the control group (P<0.01). In support of this result, the time spent in the light chamber significantly decreased in all groups vs the control group (P<0.01). Besides, CIS significantly increased depressive-like behavior in the stress group vs the control group (P<0.05). In serum hormone levels, corticosterone (CORT) levels significantly increased in the F40 and stress groups vs the control group (P<0.01). TRPM2 immunoreactivity significantly increased in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NaC), and amygdala regions by HFCS and CIS treatments. For the first time the present study showed that increased immunoreactivity of the TRPM2 cation channels may be linked to the anxiety-like behavior induced by HFCS.

AB  - Numerous emerging applications in modern society require humidity sensors that are not only sensitive and specific but also durable and intelligent. However, conventional humidity sensors do not have all of these simultaneously because they require very different or even contradictory design principles. Here, inspired by camel noses, we develop a porous zwitterionic capacitive humidity sensor. Relying on the synergistic effect of a porous structure and good chemical and thermal stabilities of hygroscopic zwitterions, this sensor simultaneously exhibits high sensitivity, discriminability, excellent durability, and, in particular, the highest respond speed among reported capacitive humidity sensors, with demonstrated applications in the fast discrimination between fresh, stale, and dry leaves, high-resolution touchless human-machine interactive input devices, and the real-time monitoring humidity level of a hot industrial exhaust. More importantly, this sensor exhibits typical synapse behaviors such as paired-pulse facilitation due to the strong binding interactions between water and zwitterions. This leads to learning and forgetting features with a tunable memory, thus giving the sensor artificial intelligence and enabling the location of water sources. This work offers a general design principle expected to be applied to develop other high-performance biochemical sensors and the nextgeneration intelligent sensors with much broader applications.

AB  - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can differentiate into all types of cells and can be used in livestock for research on biological development, genetic breeding, and in vitro genetic resource conservation. The Bactrian camel is a large domestic animal that inhabits extreme environments and holds value in the treatment of various diseases and the development of the local economy. Therefore, we transferred four mouse genes (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) into Bactrian camel fetal fibroblasts (BCFFs) using retroviruses with a large host range to obtain Bactrian camel induced pluripotent stem cells (bciPSCs). They were comprehensively identified based on cell morphology, pluripotency gene and marker expression, chromosome number, transcriptome sequencing, and differentiation potential. The results showed the pluripotency of bciPSCs. However, unlike stem cells of other species, late formation of stem cell clones was observed; moreover, the immunofluorescence of SSEA1, SSEA3, and SSEA4 were positive, and teratoma formation took four months. These findings may be related to the extremely long gestation period and species specificity of Bactrian camels. By mining RNA sequence data, 85 potential unique pluripotent genes of Bactrian camels were predicted, which could be used as candidate genes for the production of bciPSC in the future. Among them, ASF1B, DTL, CDCA5, PROM1, CYTL1, NUP210, Epha3, and SYT13 are more attractive. In conclusion, we generated bciPSCs for the first time and obtained their transcriptome information, expanding the iPSC genetic information database and exploring the applicability of iPSCs in livestock. Our results can provide an experimental basis for Bactrian camel ESC establishment, developmental research, and genetic resource conservation.

AB  - Background Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an important functional indicator for synaptic plasticity. Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) are a physical means to regulate LTP, which induce induced currents. It is unknown whether induced current is the key factor when LTP is regulated by ELF-EMFs. New Method: A method is proposed for calculating the current value induced by ELF-EMFs. Then, a comparison of ELF-EMFs with current on the regulation of theta-burst or high-frequency stimulation (TBS/HFS)-LTP was performed. Results The LTP after ELF-EMFs and mu A current regulation was significantly reduced. The regulatory effect of 0.1 mu A current on LTP was similar with 100 Hz/2 mT ELF-EMFs, while 0.2 mu A had a stronger regulatory effect than 200 Hz/2 mT on HFS-LTP. Comparison with Existing Methods: Most of the existing methods were used to calculate the induced current in human models, while we present a more accurate model for calculating the induced current induced by ELF-EMFs in the rat brain slices. Conclusions This work indicated that mu A current and ELF-EMFs stimulation reduced LTP. Also, we demonstrated that the regulatory effect of ELF-EMFs on LTP is not entirely deriving from the induced current, since its magnetic mechanism might have played a certain role

AB  - Age-related dysfunctions in specific neurotransmitter systems likely play an important role in cognitive decline even in its most subtle forms. Therefore, preservation or improvement of cognition via augmentation of neurotransmission is a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent further cognitive deficits. Here we identified a particular neuronal vulnerability in the aged Fischer 344 rat brain, an animal model of neurocognitive aging. Specifically, we demonstrated a marked impairment in glutamate-stimulated release of norepinephrine (NE) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of aged rats, and established that this release was mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Further, we also demonstrated that this decrease in NE release is fully rescued by the psychostimulant drug amphetamine (AMPH). Moreover, we showed that AMPH increases dendritic spine maturation, and importantly shows preclinical efficacy in restoring memory deficits in the aged rat through its actions to potentiate NE neurotransmission at beta-adrenergic receptors. Taken together, our results suggest that deficits in glutamate-stimulated release of NE may contribute to and possibly be a determinant of neuronal vulnerability underlying cognitive decline during aging, and that these deficits can be corrected with currently available drugs. Overall these studies suggest that repurposing of psychostimulants for age-associated cognitive deficits is a potential avenue to delay or prevent cognitive decline and/or frank dementia later in life.
   The aged brain is characterized by decreases in glutamate-stimulated norepinephrine release in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex that is rescued by the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH). From behavioral and morphological studies, AMPH rescues recognition and spatial memory deficits and favors dendritic spine maturation resulting in an overall increase in the density of spine subtypes that are associated with stronger synaptic connections integral to memory function.image

AB  - Camel whey protein (CWP) offers various health benefits, including immune enhancement, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antibacterial properties. It also possesses antioxidant activity. However, its limited efficacy and stability restrict its broader application. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline materials composed of multiple organic groups and metal ions, known for their unique structural properties. In this study, we aimed to synthesize and evaluate the biological activity of a CWP-Co-MOF conjugate. The structural characterization of the synthesized materials was conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The comparison of the XRD and FTIR patterns of ZIF-67, CWP and CWP-Co-MOF conjugate indicate successful conjugation of CWP with ZIF-67, confirming the structural integrity of the conjugate. The EDX maps further corroborate the effective conjugation of CWP with ZIF-67. The conjugated CWP-MOF nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited promising antioxidant activity, as assessed by the DPPH assay. Furthermore, they showed more potent anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells and superior anticancer activity against HepG2 and Caco-2 cell lines, as determined by the MTT assay and flow cytometry, compared to free CWP. Additionally, the CWP-MOF-NPs exhibited enhanced antimicrobial properties and increased efficacy as an anti-biofilm agent against pathogenic bacteria.

AB  - Haloperidol is a widely used antipsychotic agent that exerts antipsychotic effects through a strong antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors. In addition, haloperidol is classified as a sigma-1 receptor (S1R) antagonist that prevents endogenous oxidative stress in cultured cells. However, pharmacological activities of haloperidol against oxidative stress remain unclear. Oxytosis/ferroptosis are iron-dependent nonapoptotic oxidative cell deaths that are regarded as two names for the same cell death pathway and the potential physiological relevance of oxytosis/ ferroptosis in multiple diseases is suggested. In the present study, the effects of haloperidol on oxytosis/ferroptosis were investigated in S1R-knockdown mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. The results indicate that haloperidol is a strong inhibitor of oxytosis/ ferroptosis independent of S1R. Imaging of HT22 cells with a newly developed fluorescent probe showed that haloperidol was localized to late endosomes and lysosomes and reduced the accumulation of lysosomal ferrous ions, resulting in reduced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and inhibition of cell death. These results indicate that haloperidol is useful not only as an antipsychotic agent but also as a neuroprotective agent against endogenous oxidative stress via distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, lysosome-targeting ferroptosis inhibitors could be useful for the treatment of various diseases, including cancers, ischemiareperfusion injury, and neurodegenerative disorders, which have been associated with ferroptosis.

AB  - Cell adhesion to the substrate influences a variety of cell behaviors and its proper regulation is essential for migration, although details of the molecular pathways regulating cell adhesion during migration are lacking. Rap1 is a small GTPase that regulates adhesion in mammalian cells, as well as in Dictyostelium discoideum social amoeba, which is an established model for studying directed cell migration. In Dictyostelium, Rap1 controls adhesion via its effects on adhesion mediator talin and Ser/Thr kinase Phg2, which inhibits myosin II function. Kinase responsive to stress B (KrsB), a homologue of mammalian tumor suppressor MST1/2 and Drosophila Hippo, also regulates cell adhesion and migration, although the molecular mechanism of KrsB action is not understood. Because KrsB has been shown to interact with active Rap1 by mass spectroscopy, we investigated the genetic interaction between Rap1 and KrsB. Cells lacking KrsB have increased adhesion to the substrate, which leads to reduced movement. Expression of constitutively active Rap1 G12V increased cell spreading and adhesion even in the absence of KrsB, suggesting that Rap1 does not require KrsB to mediate cell adhesion. In contrast, KrsB activation requires Rap1 since dominant-negative Rap1 S17N impaired KrsB phosphorylation, which has been previously shown to be necessary for KrsB activity and its function in adhesion. Even though Rap1 did not require KrsB for its function in adhesion, KrsB negatively regulates Rap1 function as seen by increased cortical localization of active Rap1 in KrsB-null cells. Consistently, Rap1 S17N completely reversed the overadhesive phenotype of KrsB-null cells. Furthermore, chemoattractant-induced activation of downstream effectors of Rap1, TalB and Phg2, was increased in the absence of KrsB. Taken together, these findings suggest that Rap1 leads to activation of KrsB, which inhibits Rap1 and its downstream targets, shutting off adhesion. The existence of a negative feedback loop between Rap1 and KrsB may contribute to the dynamic regulation of cell adhesion that is necessary for rapid amoeboid-type migration.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with progressive cognitive impairment in the elderly. Beta-amyloid (A beta) formation and its accumulation in the brain constitute one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Until now, how to modulate A beta formation in hippocampal neurons remains a big challenge. Herein, we investigated whether the exosomal transfer of microRNA (miR) relates to amyloid pathology in the recipient neuron cells. We isolated circulating small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from AD patients and healthy controls, determined the miR-342-5p level in the sEVs by RT-PCR, and evaluated its diagnostic performance in AD. Then, we took advantage of biomolecular assays to estimate the role of miR-342-5p in modulating the amyloid pathway, including amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and A beta 42. Furthermore, we subjected HT22 cells to the sEVs from the hippocampal tissues of transgenic APP mice (Exo-APP) or C57BL/6 littermates (Exo-CTL), and the Exo-APP enriched with miR-342-5p mimics or the control to assess the effect of the sEVs' delivery of miR-342-5p on A beta formation. We observed a lower level of miR-342-5p in the circulating sEVs from AD patients compared with healthy controls. MiR-342-5p participated in A beta formation by modulating BACE1 expression, specifically binding its 3 '-untranslated region (UTR) sequence. Exo-APP distinctly promoted A beta 42 formation in the recipient cells compared to Exo-CTL. Intriguingly, miR-342-5p enrichment in Exo-APP ameliorated amyloid pathology in the recipient cells. Our study indicated that miR-342-5p was dysregulated in human circulating sEVs from AD patients; sEV transfer of miR-342-5p ameliorates A beta formation by modulating BACE1 expression. These findings highlight the promising potential of exosomal miRNAs in AD clinical therapy.

AB  - BackgroundAs human life expectancy increases, maintaining a healthy lifestyle has become crucial. However, excessive exercise (EE) can lead to negative consequences such as muscle damage and exercise addiction. Recently, numerous reports have indicated that EE negatively impacts cognitive performance, although the exact mechanism remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the specific mechanisms underlying cognitive alterations induced by EE.MethodsWe conducted the Y-maze, Barnes maze, and Novel Object Recognition Test to assess both short-term and long-term memory, as well as object recognition ability. We then validated our findings using qRT-PCR to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, Diclofenac (Dic), an anti-inflammatory drug, was administered to evaluate its effects on cognitive function and the results of the molecular experiments.ResultsEE-induced mice exhibited cognitive impairments, along with elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL) -6, and IL-1 beta, and downregulated monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) like MCT4. However, animals pre-treated with Dic regained cognitive function, alongside restored levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and MCT4.ConclusionMCT4 plays may play a crucial role in EE-induced cognitive impairments.

AB  - Flammulina velutipes protein hydrolysates are known for their abundant amino acids and excellent developmental values. This study aimed to identify and screen neuroprotective peptides from F. velutipes protein hydrolysates in vitro and validate the protective effects of YVYAETY on memory impairment in scopolamine-induced mice. The F. velutipes protein was hydrolyzed by simulated gastrointestinal digestion, followed by purification through ultrafiltration and gel chromatography. The fraction exhibiting the strongest neuroprotective activity was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The main identified peptides (SDLKPADF, WNDHYY, YVYAETY, and WFHPLF) effectively mitigated excessive ROS production by increasing SOD and GSH-px activities while inhibiting cell apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse against oxidative stress in A beta(25-35)-induced HT22 cells. By molecular docking, the interaction between peptides and the active site of the Keap1-Kelch domain reveals their capacity to regulate the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. In vitro, the peptide YVYAETY had the best effect and can be further validated in vivo. The behavioral tests showed that YVYAETY improved scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in mice. YVYAETY also alleviated neuron damage including neuron vacuolation and pyknotic nuclei in the hippocampus. Furthermore, it significantly inhibited oxidative stress and suppressed the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Therefore, this study revealed that YVYAETY had the potential to serve as a novel neuroprotective agent.

AB  - Simple Summary Modern livestock research has focused on the evaluation of feeding strategies that led to modify the rumen microbiome to achieve optimum productivity without compromising ruminants' physiology and health. For this reason, the supplementation of unconventional feedstuffs is extensively studied. In our study, we investigated the effect of Camelina sativa seeds supplementation on ewe's rumen microbiota. Our results suggested that supplementing Camelina sativa seeds, especially in the highest studied level (160 g center dot kg(-1) of concentrate), resulted in significant alterations in the relative abundance of the rumen microorganisms, with those reported in methanogens being considered the most promising. Supplementing ruminant diets with unconventional feedstuffs (Camelina sativa seeds; CS) rich in bioactive molecules such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, may prove a potential eco-efficient strategy to manipulate rumen microbiome towards efficiency. Forty-eight ewes were divided into four homogenous groups (n = 12) according to their fat-corrected milk yield (6%), body weight, and age, and were fed individually with concentrate, alfalfa hay, and wheat straw. The concentrate of the control group (CON) had no CS inclusion, whereas the treated groups were supplemented with CS at 60 (CS6), 110 (CS11), and 160 (CS16) g center dot kg(-1) of concentrate, respectively. Rumen digesta was collected using an esophageal tube and then liquid and solid particles were separated using cheesecloth layers. An initial bacteriome screening using next-generation sequencing of 16S was followed by specific microbes targeting with a RT-qPCR platform, which unveiled the basic changes of the rumen microbiota under CS supplementation levels. The relative abundances of Archaea and methanogens were significantly reduced in the solid particles of CS11 and CS16. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Protozoa was significantly increased in both rumen fluid and solid particles of the CS6, whereas that of Fungi was significantly reduced in the rumen particle of the CS16. In rumen fluid, the relative abundance of Fibrobacter succinogens and Ruminobacter amylophilus were significantly increased in the CS6 and CS11, respectively. In the solid particles of the CS11, the relative abundance of Ruminococcus flavefaciens was significantly reduced, whereas those of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus and Ruminobacter amylophilus were significantly increased. Additionally, the relative abundance of Selenomonas ruminantium was significantly increased in both CS11 and CS16. Consequently, the highest CS content in the concentrate reduced the relative abundance of methanogens without inducing radical changes in rumen microorganisms that could impair ruminal fermentation and ewes' performance.

AB  - Galectin-3 (Gal3) is known to interact with glycans of proteins and lipids. In cardiovascular disease, the elevated expression of Gal3 mediates inflammation, hypertrophy and fibrosis. We explored the effect of Gal3 on the cardiac lipid profile in healthy mice or in mice with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Using lipidomics and gene-targeted mouse models, we studied the influence of Gal3 gene deletion on cardiac lipid profiles in the healthy mice or mice with DCM. Cardiac-restricted transgenic activation of Hippo pathway led to DCM phenotype and Gal3 upregulation. DCM mice were cross-bred with Gal3 gene knockout (KO) mice to obtain genotypes of nontransgenic (nTG), Gal3-KO, DCM and DCM/KO. Alterations in the lipid classes and species due to Gal3-KO were identified by lipidomics in hearts from mice of four genotypes. In the nTG background, Gal3-KO increased ether lipids and lysophospholipids, and induced diverse changes of sphingolipid subclasses. The DCM hearts exhibited profound lipidomic changes including increase in sphingolipids and reduction in ether lipids and triglycerides, which were partially reversed by Gal3 deletion. We demonstrated the nuclear and mitochondrial localization of Gal-3 in DCM hearts. Transcriptomics revealed that Gal3 deletion in the DCM background partially restored the suppressed expression of mitochondrial lipid metabolic genes. In conclusion, we report multiple alterations in the lipid classes and species in the heart by Gal3 deletion in the healthy mice and, more importantly mice with DCM background. Our findings suggest that Gal3 alters cardiac contents of lipids in the DCM model in part through suppression of mitochondrial metabolism.

AB  - Small GTPase of the Rab family functions as molecular switch in vesicle trafficking, regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In our ongoing efforts to study the pathogenesis of Colletotrichum fructicola, the causal agent of anthracnose in edible-oil plant Camellia oleifera, we identified CfRab6 as the Rab GTPase and characterized its roles in C. fructicola. Consistent with our hypothesis, targeted gene deletion revealed that the Delta Cfrab6 mutant displays defects in vesicle trafficking, including endocytosis and autophagy. These combined effects led to the impairments in growth, conidia, and pathogenicity. Moreover, we demonstrated the critical importance of the GDP/GTP motifs are crucial for the normal function of CfRab6. Additionally, our findings demonstrated that CfRic1 and CfRgp1 act as conserved GEFs for CfRab6, supported by their interactions with CfRab6 and the partial restoration of the active GTP-bound CfRab6, which alleviated phenotypic defects in the Delta Cfric1 and Delta Cfrgp1 mutants. In conclusion, our study sheds new light on the significance of CfRab6-mediated vesicle trafficking in the physiology and pathogenicity of C. fructicola, which might offer new potential targets for the management of anthracnose disease.

AB  - The incorporation of fermented camel milk with natural additives possesses numerous benefits for the treatment of various pathological and metabolic conditions. The present study investigated the impact of fortification of fermented camel milk with sage or mint leaves powder (1 and 1.5%, respectively) on glucose and insulin levels, lipid profile, and liver and kidney functions in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The gross chemical composition of sage and peppermint leaves powder was studied. The chemical composition of sage and mint extracts was performed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of sage and mint extracts. Furthermore, a total of forty-two adult normal male albino rats were included in this study, whereas one group was kept as the healthy control group (n = 6 rats) and diabetes was induced in the remaining animals (n = 36 rats) using alloxan injection (150 mg/kg of body weight). Among diabetic rats groups, a control group (n = 6 rats) was kept as the diabetic control group whereas the other 5 groups (6 rats per group) of diabetic rats were fed fermented camel milk (FCM) or fermented camel milk fortified with 1 and 1.5% of sage or mint leaves powder. Interestingly, the oral administration of fermented camel milk fortified with sage or mint leaves powder, at both concentrations, caused a significant decrease in blood glucose level and lipid profile, and an increase in insulin level compared to the diabetic control and FCM groups. Among others, the best results were observed in the group of animals that received fermented camel milk fortified with 1.5% sage powder. In addition, the results revealed that the fermented camel milk fortified with sage or mint leaves powder improved the liver and kidney functions of diabetic rats. Our study concluded that the use of sage and mint leaves powder (at a ratio of 1.5%) with fermented camel milk produces functional food products with anti-diabetic activity.

AB  - Amyloid- ss (A ss) plaque formation, neuronal cell death, mitochondrial and cholinergic dysfunction are key indicators of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, gelatin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were tethered with magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)(2)) to synthesize nanocomposite (Ge/PVA/Mg(OH)(2)) through alkali co-precipitation. The characterization studies using FT-IR, XRD, DLS, and SEM-EDX confirmed the successful formation of Ge/PVA/Mg(OH)(2) nanocomposite. Further, in vitro study it clearly demonstrated the impact of Ge/ PVA/Mg(OH)(2) nanocomposite on biocompatibility, cellular uptake, reduced A ss protein expression and protection of neuronal cell death. The confocal study further confirmed the down-regulation of A ss expression. The subsequent in vivo analysis witnessed the protective effect of Ge/PVA/Mg(OH)(2) nanocomposites on the cognitive and synaptic impairments of AD in intraceribroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) treated rats. Oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes, cholinergic and mitochondrial complex activity were conducted and revealed that the Acetylcholineesterase (AChE) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) activities were significantly decreased by contrast the antioxidant enzyme activities were found to be increased in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the brain. Thus, the present investigation recommends Ge/PVA/Mg(OH)(2) nanocomposite to target AD and clinical translation.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction and redox dyshomeostasis are considered crucial factors causally linked to the pathogenesis of Down syndrome (DS), a human genetic anomaly currently lacking a cure, associated with neurodevelopmental deficits in children and early onset symptoms of aging in adults. Several natural plant-derived polyphenolic compounds, known for their neurostimulator, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, have been proposed as dietary supplements to manage DS-linked phenotypic alterations. However, the poor bioavailability and rapid metabolism of these compounds have limited conclusive evidence regarding their clinical efficacy in individuals with DS. Polydatin (PLD), a natural polyphenolic glucoside precursor of resveratrol derived from Polygonum cuspidatum, is instead highly bioavailable and resistant to enzymatic oxidation. PLD supplementation has shown many therapeutic efficacies in several human diseases without side effects. In this study, we used fetal trisomy 21 human skin fibroblasts (DS-HSFs) to investigate, from a mechanistic point of view, whether PLD supplementation could prevent or counteract critical cellular alterations linked to both neurodevelopmental deficits and early aging in DS. Our findings demonstrate that PLD reactivates mitochondrial bioenergetics, reduces oxygen radical overproduction and prevents oxidative stress (OS)-induced cellular senescence and DNA damage in DS-HSF. Notably, we identified a novel mechanism of PLD action involving the chromosome-21-encoded microRNA-155 (miR-155) and its direct target genes casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL), BAG Cochaperone 5 (BAG5) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). These proteins play pivotal roles in regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, biogenesis and mitophagy. Given that the deregulation of miR155/CBL axis is also implicated in acute leukemias, which frequently occur in children with DS, PLD emerges as a promising candidate for translational application. Its ability to enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics and address critical DS-associated phenotypic alterations highlights its therapeutic potential.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic lung disease patients throughout the world. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to regulate immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative responses. However, the effects of human-umbilical-cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) on the lung pathophysiology of COPD remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of hUC-MSCs in emphysema severity and Yes-associated protein (Yap) phosphorylation (p-Yap) in a porcine-pancreatic-elastase (PPE)-induced emphysema model. We observed that the emphysema percentages (normalized to the total lung volume) measured by chest computed tomography (CT) and exercise oxygen desaturation were significantly reduced by hUC-MSCs at 10(7) cells/kg body weight (BW) via intravenous administration in emphysematous mice (p < 0.05). Consistently, the emphysema index, as assessed by the mean linear intercept (MLI), significantly decreased with hUC-MSC administration at 3 x 10(6) and 10(7) cells/kg BW (p < 0.05). Changes in the lymphocytes, monocytes, and splenic cluster of differentiation 4-positive (CD4(+)) lymphocytes by PPE were significantly reversed by hUC-MSC administration in emphysematous mice (p < 0.05). An increasing neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was reduced by hUC-MSCs at 3 x 10(6) and 10(7) cells/kg BW (p < 0.05). The higher levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were significantly decreased by hUC-MSC administration (p < 0.05). A decreasing p-Yap/Yap ratio in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) of mice with PPE-induced emphysema was significantly increased by hUC-MSCs (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the administration of hUC-MSCs improved multiple pathophysiological features of mice with PPE-induced emphysema. The effectiveness of the treatment of pulmonary emphysema with hUC-MSCs provides an essential and significant foundation for future clinical studies of MSCs in COPD patients.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the role of lymphotoxins (LTs) family in the sinonasal mucosa of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). This study aims at investigating the expression of LIGHT, LT alpha, LT beta, and their receptors, LT beta R and HVEM in normal and inflammatory sinus mucosa, and the effect of LIGHT and LTalpha1beta2 on chemokine secretion in epithelial cells, epithelial permeability, and leukocyte migration. Material and methods: The expression of LTs family in sinonasal mucosa was evaluated with real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. In LT beta R, HVEM siRNA, or control siRNA-transfected epithelial cells treated with LIGHT or LTalpha1beta2, the expression of chemokines, the epithelial permeability, and the expression of junctional complex proteins were evaluated using real-time PCR, ELISA, western blot, confocal microscopy, and FITC-dextran. In cultured endothelial cells treated with LIGHT or LTalpha1beta2, the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and leukocyte migration were elucidated. Results: LTs family was expressed in normal mucosa and their levels were increased in inflammatory mucosa of CRS patients. Recombinant LIGHT and LTalpha1beta2 induced chemokine secretion, increased epithelial permeability, and promoted leukocyte migration. However, the activity of LIGHT and LTalpha1beta2 was attenuated in cells transfected with LT beta R and HVEM siRNA. Conclusions: LIGHT and LTs may participate in the ongoing process of chronic inflammation, inducing chemokine secretion, leukocyte migration, and dysregulated epithelial barrier through LT beta R and HVEM in sinonasal mucosa.

AB  - Methotrexate (MTX) is a widely used neurotoxic drug with broad antineoplastic and immunosuppressant spectra. However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which MTX inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis are yet unclear. Dexmedetomidine (Dex), an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has recently shown neuroprotective effects; however, its full mechanism is unexplored. This study investigated the potential of Dex to mitigate MTX-induced neurotoxicity and memory impairment in rats and the possible role of the miR-15a/ROCK-1/ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF pathway. Notably, no former studies have linked this pathway to MTX-induced neurotoxicity. Male Sprague Dawley rats were placed into four groups. Group 1 received saline i.p. daily and i.v. on days 8 and 15. Group 2 received Dex at 10 mu g/kg/day i.p. for 30 days. Group 3 received MTX at 75 mg/kg i.v. on days 8 and 15, followed by four i.p. doses of leucovorin at 6 mg/kg after 18 h and 3 mg/kg after 26, 42, and 50 h. Group 4 received MTX and leucovorin as in group 3 and Dex daily dosages as in group 2. Bioinformatic analysis identified the association of miR-15a with ROCK-1/ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF and neurogenesis. MTX lowered hippocampal doublecortin and Ki-67, two markers of neurogenesis. This was associated with the downregulation of miR-15a, upregulation of its target ROCK-1, and reduction in the downstream ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF pathway, along with disturbed hippocampal redox state. Novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests demonstrated the MTX-induced memory deficiencies. Dex co-treatment reversed the MTX-induced behavioral, biochemical, and histological alterations in the rats. These neuroprotective actions could be partly mediated through modulating the miR-15a/ROCK-1/ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF pathway, which enhances hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Understanding changes in the expression of genes involved in regulating various components of the neural extracellular matrix (ECM) during aging can provide an insight into aging-associated decline in synaptic and cognitive functions. Hence, in this study, we compared the expression levels of ECM-related genes in the hippocampus of young, aged and very aged mice. ECM gene expression was downregulated, despite the accumulation of ECM proteoglycans during aging. The most robustly downregulated gene was carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (Chst3), the enzyme responsible for the chondroitin 6-sulfation (C6S) of proteoglycans. Further analysis of epigenetic mechanisms revealed a decrease in H3K4me3, three methyl groups at the lysine 4 on the histone H3 proteins, associated with the promoter region of the Chst3 gene, resulting in the downregulation of Chst3 expression in non-neuronal cells. Cluster analysis revealed that the expression of lecticans-substrates of CHST3-is tightly co-regulated with this enzyme. These changes in ECM-related genes were accompanied by an age-confounded decline in cognitive performance. Despite the co-directional impairment in cognitive function and average Chst3 expression in the studied age groups, at the individual level we found a negative correlation between mRNA levels of Chst3 and cognitive performance within the very aged group. An analysis of correlations between the expression of ECM-related genes and cognitive performance in novel object versus novel location recognition tasks revealed an apparent trade-off in the positive gene effects in one task at the expense of another. Further analysis revealed that, despite the reduction in the Chst3 mRNA, the expression of CHST3 protein is increased in glial cells but not in neurons, which, however, does not lead to changes in the absolute level of C6S and even results in the decrease in C6S in perineuronal, perisynaptic and periaxonal ECM relative to the elevated expression of its protein carrier versican.

AB  - Melatonin (MT) is a bioactive molecule that can regulate various developmental processes. Changes in lignin content play important roles in plant growth and development. Herein, quantitative analysis and histochemical staining showed that lignin content significantly increased over time, and melatonin treatment triggered the lignification at 8 and 16 din tea leaves. The POD activity participated in lignin formation had also been significantly improved. The effect of melatonin on the increase of lignin content was attenuation over time. Sequencing results based on transcriptome at 8 and 16 d showed that 5273 and 3019 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in CK1 vs. MT1 and CK2 vs. MT2, respectively. A total of 67 DEGs were annotated to lignin biosynthesis, and 38 and 9 genes were significantly up-regulated under melatonin treatment, respectively. Some transcription factor genes such as MYB were also identified among the two pairwise comparisons, which might relate to lignin metabolism. Melatonin increased the degree of lignification in tea leaves by modifying the enzyme genes expression involved in lignin synthesis pathway. These results provide a reference for further study on the molecular mechanism of the dynamic changes of lignin content induced by melatonin treatment in tea plants. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Camellia ptilophylla Chang (C. ptilophylla), a unique low-caffeine tea species, is valued for its bioactive properties, especially antioxidant and anticancer activities, due to its distinct phytochemical profile. However, its precise constituents and mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study employs an integrated approach combining chromatographic separation, bioinformatic analysis, and cellular assays to systematically investigate the antioxidant and anticancer properties of C. ptilophylla and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. Quantitative analysis revealed that in addition to trans-catechins, the unique polyphenolic compounds, gallocatechin-3,5-di-O-gallate (GC-3,5-diGA) and 1,2,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranose (1,2,4,6-GA-glc), constituted significant proportions of C. ptilophylla extracts, with concentrations of 10.25 +/- 0.29% and 6.60 +/- 0.14%, respectively. Monomeric activity assessment demonstrated that both GC-3,5-diGA and 1,2,4,6-GA-glc exhibited pronounced antiproliferative effects against three cancer cell lines including the Lymph Node Carcinoma of the Prostate cell, human colon cancer cell, and human breast cancer cell. Notably, these compounds demonstrated potent antioxidant capacity, with 62.5 mu M of GC-3,5-diGA and 15.63 mu M of 1,2,4,6-GA-glc protecting against tBHP-induced oxidative stress in NIH3T3 cells comparable to 125 mu M of epigallocatechin gallate and gallocatechin gallate in half-maximal inhibitory concentration. Mechanistic studies revealed that these polyphenols modulated antioxidant defenses and reactive oxygen species homeostasis via targets like fibroblast growth factor 2, telomerase reverse transcriptase, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2, inducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial apoptosis to inhibit carcinogenesis. These findings enhance our understanding of the bioactive components responsible for the anticancer and antioxidant properties of C. ptilophylla and provide a scientific basis for the development of this dual-purpose plant for food and medicinal applications.

AB  - Konjac glucomannan (KGM) undergoes deacetylation in alkaline conditions, while x-carrageenan (CRG) is sensitive to potassium ions. This study examines the influence of K2CO3 on the mechanical properties of KGM/CRGbased camellia oil Pickering emulsion gels. Texture analysis and rheological testing revealed that the addition of K2CO3 significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of emulsion gels. Texture parameters, such as the hardness, gumminess, and chewiness of the gel, were closer to those of pork back fat when the K2CO3 concentration was 0.2 M. The addition of K2CO3 enhance the intermolecular crosslinking within the gel and formed a more uniform and dense gel network, promoting gelation and structural stability, which were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and microstructural analysis. Besides, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance and thermogravimetric analyses indicated that the addition of K2CO3 reduced the water mobility of the gel and improved its thermal stability. Physicochemical and color analysis results showed that the energy value of the camellia oil Pickering emulsion gel was only 15.9 % that of pork back fat, and its appearance was closer to that of pork back fat than hydrogels. This study provides technical support for the use of KGM/CRG-based camellia oil Pickering emulsion gels as fat analogs.

AB  - Glutathione (GSH) is a potent antioxidant synthesized de novo in cells and helps to detoxify free radicals in the brain and other organs. In vitro NMR studies from various research groups have reported primarily two sets of chemical shifts (2.80 or 2.96 ppm) of Cys-beta CH2 depending on GSH sample preparation in either inert or oxygenated environments. A multi-center in vivo MRS human study has also validated the presence of two types of GSH conformer in the human brain. Our study is aimed at investigating the distribution patterns of the two GSH conformers from five brain regions, namely, ACC (anterior cingulate cortex), PCC (posterior cingulate cortex), LPC (left parietal cortex), LH (left hippocampus), and CER (cerebellum). GSH was measured using a 3T MRI scanner using MEGA-PRESS pulse sequence in healthy young male and female populations (M/F = 5/9; age 32.8 +/- 5.27 years). We conclude that the closed GSH conformer (characteristic NMR shift signature: Cys H alpha 4.40-H beta 2.80 ppm) is more abundant than the extended GSH form (characteristic NMR shift signature Cys H alpha 4.56-H beta 2.95 ppm). Closed conformer has a non-uniform distribution (ACC < CER < LH < PCC < LPC) in the healthy brain. On the contrary, the extended form of GSH has a uniform distribution in various anatomical regions.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. To assess the impact of vitamin D3 (Vit.D) on neurogenesis, we investigated its role in mitigating cognitive impairment and mitochondrial dysfunction through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2)-mediated phosphorylation of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in an aluminum-chloride-D-galactose (AlCl3-D-gal)-induced AD rat model. Rats were distributed into four groups: control, AlCl3 + D-gal (10 + 60 mg/kg, ip), Vit.D (500 IU/kg, po), and AlCl3 + D-gal+Vit.D. Novel object recognition (NOR), Morris Water Maze, and passive avoidance (PA) tests were used to measure memory abilities. The hippocampal tissue was used to assess vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) and peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma-coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), CAMKK2, p-SIRT1, phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), dynamin-related-protein-1 (Drp1), and mitofusin-1 (Mnf1) proteins by western blot and Ca2+ levels, endothelial nitic oxide synthase (eNOS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), amyloid beta (A beta), and phospho tau (p-Tau) via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) in addition to histological and ultrastructural examination of rat's brain tissue. Vit.D-attenuated hippocampal injury reversed the cognitive decline and A beta aggregation, and elevated p-Tau levels in the AlCl3 + D-gal-induced AD rat model. In AlCl3 + D-gal-exposed rats, Vit.D induced VDR expression, normalized Ca2+ levels, elevated CAMKK2, p-AMPK, p-SIRT1, and PGC-1 alpha expression. Vit.D reduced Drp1, induced Mnf1, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, preserved mitochondrial structure, restored normal mitochondrial function, and retained normal eNOS level and SOD activity in AlCl3 + D-gal rats. In conclusion, our findings proved that Vit.D may ameliorate cognitive deficits in AlCl3 + D-gal-induced AD by restoring normal mitochondrial function and reducing inflammatory and oxidative stress via CAMKK2-AMPK/SIRT1 pathway upregulation.

AB  - Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative pathology-modifying mitochondrial metabolism with energy impairments where the effects of biological sex and DNA repair deficiencies are unclear. We investigated the therapeutic potential of dietary ketosis alone or with supplemental nicotinamide riboside (NR) on hippocampal intermediary metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics in older male and female wild-type (Wt) and 3xTgAD-DNA polymerase-beta-deficient (3xTg/POL beta+/-) (AD) mice. DNA polymerase-beta is a key enzyme in DNA base excision repair (BER) of oxidative damage that may also contribute to mitochondrial DNA repair. Metabolic alterations imparted by ketosis and/or NR were assessed in 16 male and female groups, 4 Wt and 4 AD. At 73 weeks of age, mice were divided into: (A) carbohydrate diet (Carb); (B) Carb diet with NR (Carb-NR); (C) Ket diet (Ket); and (D) Ket diet with NR (Ket-NR) groups and remained on their respective treatments for 12 weeks. Mice were euthanized and hippocampi were rapidly removed and frozen. Glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates were determined by quantitative GC-MS and the ratios of the mitochondrial free [NADox]/[NADHred] and coenzyme ubiquinone (CoQ/CoQH2) couples and the Gibbs free energy of the Complex I-II system of the electron transport chain (ETC) (triangle Gmitochondrial ComplexI-II '$$ \Delta {G}_{\mathrm{mitochondrial}\ \mathrm{Complex}\ \mathrm{I}-\mathrm{II}}<^>{\prime } $$) were calculated from selected metabolites. Mice in Groups C and D had elevated blood ketones (1-2 mM). In most groupings, male mice had higher concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates than females. Moreover, higher concentrations of fumarate in Wt males were associated with elevations in the Delta G ' of Complex I-II compared to females. In Wt males, NR treatments were associated with elevated concentrations of alpha-ketoglutarate and malate and linked to increased energy of Complex I-II. In AD males, both NR treatment and dietary ketosis restored the Delta G ' of Complex I-II, where the ratio of the CoQ/CoQH2 couple was oxidized and the [NADox]/[NADHred] couple was reduced. In AD females, only mice in the Ket diet group had a sufficiently reduced [NADox]/[NADHred] couple to restore the free energy profile. image

AB  - In this work, the possibility of obtaining biopolymer films from Camelina sativa oilseed cake (CSoC) at different parameters of the synthesis process was investigated. The pH (values 8, 10, and 12), the temperature (60, 80, and 100 degrees C), and the concentration of the cake in the film-forming suspension (3, 4, and 5%) were varied. The films obtained were characterized by studying the mechanical, barrier, physico-chemical, structural, and biological properties (antioxidant and antimicrobial). The results showed moderate mechanical properties, indicating the application of these biopolymer materials as coatings. Low values of water vapor permeability (5.1-12.26 g/m(2)h) and very low transmission in the UV range (less than 2%) indicate good barrier properties. FTIR analysis confirmed the films' composite structures: peaks related to proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and cellulose were detected. The biological activity of the obtained CSoC films was pronounced so that they could be used for active packaging. All films have high antioxidant activity, which is more pronounced in samples synthesized at pH 8. The films possess antibacterial properties against S. aureus, while some had an inhibitory effect on S. typhimurium. Standard score analysis showed that the film sample synthetized at pH = 10, temperature = 100 degrees C, and concentration = 5% had optimal investigated properties.

AB  - A total of 184 dromedary camel embryos were vitrified using a novel vitrification kit specifically developed for camel embryos. These embryos were vitrified using a 3-step process by exposing them to vitrification solutions (VS) containing 20% foetal calf serum (FCS) with (+) or without (-) the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Embryos were then further divided into two groups (<or >= 500 mu m), vitrified using a closed vitrification system and stored on a Cryolock (R) embryo storage device or vitrified using solid surface vitrification of the Cryologic Vitrification Method (CVM)(TM) and stored on a Fibreplug (TM) embryo storage device. Embryos were then warmed and transferred in pairs, of approximately equal size, into recipient camels on Day 6 after ovulation. A total of 92 embryos were vitrified using the Cryolock; 86 embryos (C-BSA, n = 46; C + BSA, n = 40) survived warming, and were then transferred into 43 re-cipients. The pregnancy rate (PR) per recipient was 17% (C-BSA: 4/23) and 45% (C + BSA: 9/20) at 20 days after transfer but reduced to 9% and 30% at 60 days of gestation, respectively. For the Fibreplug group, a total of 92 embryos were vitrified, 86 embryos (F-BSA, n = 44; F + BSA, n = 42) survived warming, and were transferred into 43 recipients. The PR per recipient was 73% (F-BSA: 16/22) and 48% (F + BSA: 10/ 21) at 20 days after transfer but reduced to 50% (11/22) and 33% (7/21) at 60 days of gestation, respectively. Of the 39 pregnancies at 20 days after transfer, 77% (30/39) resulted from embryos with a diameter of 300-450 mu m and 23% (9/39) were from embryos with a diameter of 500-850 mu m. In conclusion, 1) significantly higher pregnancy rates were achieved when embryos were vitrified using the Fibreplug than using the Cryolock; 2) the effect of BSA on embryo vitrification is dependent on embryo storage device type and embryo diameter; 3) smaller vitrified embryos (<500 mu m) tend to produce higher pregnancy rates than larger embryos (>= 500 mu m), however, the negative effect of embryo size on embryo vitrification is reduced when embryos are frozen using the original novel vitrification kit (no BSA) solid surface vitrification using the CVM.

AB  - Epilepsy is a prevalent and frequently devastating neurological disorder defined by recurring spontaneous seizures caused by aberrant electrical activity in the brain. Over ten million people worldwide suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy. This severe condition requires novel treatment approaches. Both oxidative and nitrosative stress are thought to have a role in the etiology of epilepsy. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that is used to treat type-2 diabetes mellitus. According to recent studies, Liraglutide also shows neuroprotective properties, improving memory retention and total hippocampus pyramidal neuronal population in mice. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the anti-seizure and anti-oxidative effects of liraglutide in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced rat model of epilepsy. 48 rats were randomly assigned to two groups: those who had electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and those who underwent behavioral assessment. Rats received either intraperitoneal (IP) liraglutide at two different dosages (3-6 mg/kg) or a placebo, followed by pentylenetetrazole (IP). To determine if liraglutide has anti-seizure characteristics, we examined seizure activity in rats using EEG, the Racine convulsion scale (RCS), the time of first myoclonic jerk (FMJ), and MDA, SOD, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and GAD-67 levels. The mean EEG spike wave percentage score was reduced from 75.8% (placebo) to 59.4% (lower-dose) and 41.5% (higher-dose). FMJ had increased from a mean of 70.6 s (placebo) to 181.2 s (lower-dose) and 205.2 s (higher-dose). RCS was reduced from a mean of 5.5 (placebo) to 2.7 (lower-dose) and 2.4 (higher-dose). Liraglutide (3 and 6 mg/kg i.p.) successfully decreased the spike percentages and RCS associated with PTZ induced epilepsy, as well as considerably decreased MDA, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and elevated SOD, GAD-67 levels in rat brain. Liraglutide significantly decreased seizure activity at both dosages when compared to control, most likely due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The potential clinical role of liraglutide as an anti-seizure medication should be further explored.

AB  - Recent reports have suggested that abnormal miR-29c expression in hippocampus have been implicated in the pathophysiology of some neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. However, the underlying effect of miR-29c in regulating hippocampal neuronal function is not clear. In this study, HT22 cells were infected with lentivirus containing miR-29c or miR-29c sponge. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay kit were applied to evaluate cell viability and toxicity before and after TNF-alpha administration. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured with fluorescent probes. Hoechst 33258 staining and TUNEL assay were used to evaluate cell apoptosis. The expression of key mRNA/proteins (TNFR1, Bcl-2, Bax, TRADD, FADD, caspase-3, -8 and -9) in the apoptosis pathway was detected by PCR or WB. In addition, the protein expression of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), nerve growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and synapsin-1 (SYN-1) was detected by WB. As a result, we found that miR-29c overexpression could improve cell viability, attenuate LDH release, reduce ROS production and inhibit MMP depolarization in TNF-alpha-treated HT22 cells. Furthermore, miR-29c overexpression was found to decrease apoptotic rate, along with decreased expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and increased expression of Bcl-2 in TNF-alpha-treated HT22 cells. However, miR-29c sponge exhibited an opposite effects. In addition, in TNF-alpha-treated HT22 cells, miR-29c overexpression could decrease the expressions of TNFR1, TRADD, FADD and cleaved caspase-8. However, in HT22 cells transfected with miR-29c sponge, TNF-alpha-induced the expressions of TNFR1, TRADD, FADD and cleaved caspase-8 was significantly exacerbated. At last, TNF-alpha-induced the decreased expression of MAP-2, GAP-43 and SYN-1 was reversed by miR-29c but exacerbated by miR-29c sponge. Overall, our study demonstrated that miR-29c protects against TNF-alpha-induced HT22 cells injury through alleviating ROS production and reduce neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, miR-29c might be a potential therapeutic agent for TNF-alpha accumulation and toxicity-related brain diseases.

AB  - Depression is the most common mental disorder in the world. Recently, an increasing number of studies have reported alcohol-related depression. However, there is no simple, efficient, and time-saving alcohol-related depression animal model yet. Based on the fact that people with alcohol addiction often have impaired gastrointestinal (GI) tract health like dysbiosis, which serves as a primary factor to augment lipopolysaccharides (LPS), we first developed a murine alcohol-LPS model (mALPS), with oral gavage of LPS in acute alcohol treated mice, and successfully observed depression-like symptoms. We found that acute alcohol treatment damaged the intestinal barrier and caused dysbiosis, which further increased the translocation of LPS and neuroinflammatory responses (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) and led to abnormal expression of the depression-related genes, i.e. BDND and IDO, reduced the levels of 5-HT and caused depressive behaviors in mice. Probiotic intervention could improve depressive symptoms without notable adverse effects. Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), one of the next-generation probiotics, has been widely used for the restoration of the intestinal barrier and reduction of inflammation. Here, we found that AKK significantly ameliorated alcohol-related depressive behaviors in a mALPS model, through enhancing the intestinal barrier and maintaining the homeostasis of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, AKK reduced serum LPS, ameliorated neuroinflammation (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta), normalized the expression of depression-related genes and increased the 5-HT levels in the hippocampus. Our study suggests that AKK supplements will be a promising therapeutic regime for alcohol-associated depression in the future.

AB  - The kynurenine pathway (KP, IDO/Kyn pathway) is an important metabolic pathway related to many diseases. Although cranial radiotherapy is the mainstay in metastatic tumors management, its efficacy is limited owing to the associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Sildenafil (SD) and simvastatin (SV) were reported to have antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects and to serve as NO donor/BH4 regulator, respectively. Fluoxetine (Fx) is an FDA-approved anti-depressant agent and one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs (SSRI), used in neurological disorder treatment. The study objective was to investigate the role of cranial irradiation (C-IR) on KP signaling impairment and the possible intervention by SD and/or SV (as nitric oxide (NO) donor/Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) regulatory) on KP following C-IR-induced disruption compared with Fx (as standard drug).Herein, rats were exposed to C-IR at a single dose level of 25 Gy, then treated with sildenafil (SD) and/or simvastatin (SV), and fluoxetine (Fx) at doses of 75, 20, 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. The body weight gain and forced swimming test (FST) were used for evaluation along with the biochemical quantifications of KP intermediates and histopathological examination of cortex and hippocampus. The results indicated a significant activation of KP following C-IR as manifested by decreased Trp content and increased activities of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) with a rise in kynurenine (KYN) and quinolinic acid (QA) hippocampal contents. In addition, a state of C-IR-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, NO-pathway dysregulation and neuronal apoptosis were observed as compared to the control group. However, significant modulations were recorded after the combined administration of SD and SV than those offered by each of them alone and by Fx. The biochemical assessment results were supported by the histopathological tissue examination. It could be concluded that the co-administration of SV and SD offers a neuroprotective effect against irradiation-induced brain injury due to its NO donor/BH4 regulatory activities, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that modulate IDO/KYN pathway.

AB  - The phytogenic flavanol component of the plant Rhus verniciflua Stokes is fustin which is implicated in various disease aliments and has promising therapeutic efficacy and a long history of its uses in the Indian medicinal system. The present study investigated the ameliorative effect of fustin in streptozotocin (STZ) induced cognitive impairments in the diabetic animal paradigm. A total of five different animal groups were used for the present study.The preclinical efficacy of fustin at 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg was studied in diabetic male rats by employing a 35-day study design. In the present investigation the Morris water maze test (MWM) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test were employed as behavioral paradigms for the assessment of memory impairments. The study design also carried out certain biochemical parameters which include glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), relative interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1B in samples obtained from cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The behavioral parameters with MWM and EPM were significant restored in fustin treatment groups as compared to elevated levels in the diabetic control group. Furthermore, fustin significantly improved the altered levels of several biochemical parameters for cognitive dysfunction such as GSH, SOD, CAT, MDA, NO, and relative IL-6 and IL-1B compared to a diabetic control group. The present investigation highlights certain preclinical pieces of evidence that strongly indicate that fustin might restore the normal cognitive function in the experimental animal paradigm.

AB  - The emergence of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) as illicit psychoactive substances has posed considerable public health risks, including fatalities. Many SCRAs exhibit much higher efficacy and potency compared with the phytocannabinoid Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R), leading to dramatic differences in signaling levels that can be toxic. In this study, we investigated the structure-activity relationships of aminoalkylindole SCRAs at CB1Rs, focusing on 5F-pentylindoles containing an amide linker attached to different head moieties. Using in vitro bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays, we identified a few SCRAs exhibiting significantly higher efficacy in engaging the Gi protein and recruiting beta-arrestin than the reference CB1R full agonist CP55940. Importantly, the extra methyl group on the head moiety of 5F-MDMB-PICA, as compared to that of 5F-MMB-PICA, led to a large increase in efficacy and potency at the CB1R. This pharmacological observation was supported by the functional effects of these SCRAs on glutamate field potentials recorded in hippocampal slices. Molecular modeling and simulations of the CB1R models bound with both of the SCRAs revealed critical structural determinants contributing to the higher efficacy of 5F-MDMB-PICA and how these subtle differences propagated to the receptor-G protein interface. Thus, we find that apparently minor structural changes in the head moiety of SCRAs can cause major changes in efficacy. Our results highlight the need for close monitoring of the structural modifications of newly emerging SCRAs and their potential for toxic drug responses in humans.

AB  - Dietary methionine restriction (MR) has been shown to delay aging and ameliorate age-related cognitive impairments. We hypothesized that changes in the gut microbiota may mediate these effects. To test this hypothesis, ICR mice subcutaneously injected with 150 mg kg(-1) day(-1)d-galactose were fed a normal (0.86% methionine) or an MR (0.17% methionine) diet for 2 months. Multiple behavioral experiments were performed, and the gut microbiota composition, metabolite profiles related to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the feces, and indicators related to the redox and inflammatory states in the hippocampus were further analyzed. Our results indicated that MR alleviated cognitive impairment (including non-spatial memory deficits, working memory deficits, and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory deficits) and anxiety-like behavior in d-Gal-induced aging mice. Furthermore, MR increased the abundance of putative SCFA-producing bacteria such as Lachnospiraceae, Turicibacter, Roseburia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Intestinimonas, Rikenellaceae, Tyzzerella, and H2S-producing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio in feces. Moreover, MR reversed and normalized the levels of intestinal SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) and important intermediate metabolites of the SCFAs (pyruvate, lactate, malate, fumarate, and succinate), abolished aging-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, increased the levels of H2S in the plasma and hippocampus, and selectively modulated the expression of multiple learning- and memory-related genes in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that MR improved the gut microbiota composition and SCFA production and alleviated oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the hippocampus, which might prevent cognitive impairment in d-galactose-induced aging mice.

AB  - Genetic studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have revealed multigene variations that converge on synaptic dysfunction. DOCK4, a gene at 7q31.1 that encodes the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Dock4, has been identified as a risk gene for ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, whether and how Dock4 disruption leads to ASD features through a synaptic mechanism remain unexplored. We generated and characterized a line of Dock4 knockout (KO) mice, which intriguingly displayed a series of ASD-like behaviors, including impaired social novelty preference, abnormal isolation-induced pup vocalizations, elevated anxiety, and perturbed object and spatial learning. Mice with conditional deletion of Dock4 in hippocampal CA1 recapitulated social preference deficit in KO mice. Examination in CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed that excitatory synaptic transmission was drastically attenuated in KO mice, accompanied by decreased spine density and synaptic content of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid)- and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-type glutamate receptors. Moreover, Dock4 deficiency markedly reduced Rac1 activity in the hippocampus, which resulted in downregulation of global protein synthesis and diminished expression of AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits. Notably, Rac1 replenishment in the hippocampal CA1 of Dock4 KO mice restored excitatory synaptic transmission and corrected impaired social deficits in these mice, and pharmacological activation of NMDA receptors also restored social novelty preference in Dock4 KO mice. Together, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized Dock4-Rac1-dependent mechanism involved in regulating hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission and social behavior.

AB  - In spatial cognition, the Successor Representation (SR) from reinforcement learning provides a compelling candidate of how predictive representations are used to encode space. In particular, hippocampal place cells are hypothesized to encode the SR. Here, we investigate how varying the temporal symmetry in learning rules influences those representations. To this end, we use a simple local learning rule which can be made insensitive to the temporal order. We analytically find that a symmetric learning rule results in a successor representation under a symmetrized version of the experienced transition structure. We then apply this rule to a two-layer neural network model loosely resembling hippocampal subfields CA3 - with a symmetric learning rule and recurrent weights - and CA1 - with an asymmetric learning rule and no recurrent weights. Here, when exposed repeatedly to a linear track, neurons in our model in CA3 show less shift of the centre of mass than those in CA1, in line with existing empirical findings. Investigating the functional benefits of such symmetry, we employ a simple reinforcement learning agent which may learn symmetric or classical successor representations. Here, we find that using a symmetric learning rule yields representations which afford better generalization, when the agent is probed to navigate to a new target without relearning the SR. This effect is reversed when the state space is not symmetric anymore. Thus, our results hint at a potential benefit of the inductive bias afforded by symmetric learning rules in areas employed in spatial navigation, where there naturally is a symmetry in the state space.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic marks an inflection point in the perception and treatment of human health. Substantial resources have been reallocated to address the direct medical effects of COVID-19 and to curtail the spread of the virus. Thereby, shortcomings of traditional disinfectants, especially their requirement for regular reapplication and the related complications (e.g., dedicated personnel and short-term activity), have become issues at the forefront of public health concerns. This issue became especially pressing when infection-mitigating supplies dwindled early in the progression of the pandemic. In consideration of the constant threat posed by emerging novel viruses, we report a platform technology for persistent surface disinfection to combat virus transmission through nanomaterial-mediated, localized UV radiation emission. In this work, two formulations of Y2SiO5-based visible-to-UV upconversion nanomaterials were developed using a facile sol-gel-based synthesis. Our formulations have shown substantial antiviral activities (4 x 10(4) to 0 TCID50 units in 30 min) toward an enveloped, circulating human coronavirus strain (OC43) under simple white light exposure as an analogue to natural light or common indoor lighting. Additionally, we have shown that our two formulations greatly reduce OC43 RNA recovery from surfaces. Antiviral activities were further demonstrated toward a panel of structurally diverse viruses including enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, parainfluenza virus, and Zika virus, as well as nonenveloped viruses, rhinovirus, and calicivirus, as evidence of the technology's broad antiviral activity. Remarkably, one formulation completely inactivated 105 infectious units of SARS-CoV-2 in only 45 min. The detailed technology has implications for the design of more potent, long-lived disinfectants and modified/surface-treated personal protective equipment targeting a wide range of viruses.

AB  - Ultrasound stimulation is increasingly used to investigate brain function and treat brain diseases due to its high level of safety and precise spatiotemporal resolution. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in ultrasound brain stimulation. In this study, we investigate the role of NMDA receptors in mediating the effects of ultrasound on primary hippocampal neurons in mice. Our results show that ultrasound alone can activate heterologous NMDA receptor subunits, including NR1A, NR2A, and NR2B, in 293T cells, as well as endogenous NMDA receptors in primary neurons. This activation leads to an influx of calcium and an increase in nuclear c-Fos expression in primary neurons that have not been pre-treated with an NMDA receptor inhibitor. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that NMDA receptors contribute to neuronal activation by ultrasound stimulation in vitro, providing insight into the molecular mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation and a new mediator for the sonogenetics technique.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity impairment and behavioral deficits constitute classical pathological hallmarks in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests these synaptic dysfunctions may stem from metabolic dysregulation, particularly impaired aerobic glycolysis. As a key product of astrocyte-mediated aerobic glycolysis, lactate serves dual roles as both an energy substrate and a signaling molecule, playing a critical regulatory role in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. This study investigated whether exogenous L-lactate supplementation could ameliorate synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in early-stage AD models. Our findings reveal significant reductions in hippocampal lactate levels in experimental AD mice. Systemic administration of L-lactate (200 mg/kg) effectively restored physiological lactate concentrations in both hippocampal tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Chronic L-lactate treatment significantly improved spatial learning and memory performance in behavioral assessments. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that either acute bath application of L-lactate (2 mM) to hippocampal slices or chronic intraperitoneal administration enhanced high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) magnitude in 3xTg-AD mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that L-lactate treatment enhanced synaptic density and improved morphological features of hippocampal synapses. At the molecular level, L-lactate administration upregulated synaptic marker synaptophysin (SYP) expression while downregulating activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (ARC) levels in AD mice. These multimodal findings demonstrate that exogenous L-lactate supplementation effectively restores synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in early-stage 3xTg-AD mice through concurrent improvements at behavioral, structural, and molecular levels.

AB  - Perilla frutescens (L.), a traditional edible and medicinal crop, contains diverse triterpenes with multiple pharmacological properties. However, the biosynthesis of triterpenes in perilla remains rarely revelation. In this study, nine putative 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) genes (PfOSC1-9) were screened from the P. frutescens genome and functionally characterized by heterologous expression. Camelliol C, a triterpenol with pharmacological effect, was first identified as abundant in perilla seeds, and the camelliol C synthase (PfOSC7) was first identified in P. frutescens utilizing a yeast system. In addition, PfOSC2, PfOSC4, and PfOSC9 were identified as cycloartenol, lupeol, and beta-amyrin synthase, respectively. Molecular docking and site directed mutagenesis revealed that changes in Leu253 of PfOSC4, Ala480 of PfOSC7, and Trp257 of PfOSC9 might lead to variations of catalytic specificity or efficiency. These results will provide key insights into the biosynthetic pathways of triterpenoids and have great significance for germplasm breeding in P. frutescens.

AB  - The health-promoting properties of blueberries are widely recognized and are mainly attributed to anthocyanins. However, fruit's chemical composition includes also other components and strongly depends on varieties and climatic conditions. Here, H-1 NMR metabolite profiling and biological activity of four blueberry cultivars (Spartan, Jewels, Misty, Camelia) grown in Central Italy over two years were reported. Untargeted and targeted NMR analyses allowed the quantification of sugars, organic acids, amino acids, anthocyanins, lipids, and other compounds. Spectrophotometric assays evaluated total phenolic and flavonoid content, antioxidant activity, and enzyme inhibitory activity toward cholinesterase, alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and tyrosinase. Statistical analysis showed a correlation between chemical composition and biological activity, revealing markers specific to blueberry cultivars (quinic acid, quercitrin, myo-inositol, myrtillin, and petunidin-3-O-glucoside). Almost all antioxidant assays were correlated with the chlorogenic acid levels. A strong effect of harvesting on chemical composition and biological activities was observed, with Misty cultivar having the highest antioxidant activity.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes with obesity-related insulin resistance as the main manifestation is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Adipose tissue plays an important role in this process. Here, we demonstrated that adipose tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate inter-organ communication between adipose tissue and the brain, which can be transferred into the brain in a membrane protein-dependent manner and enriched in neurons, especially in the hippocampus. Further investigation suggests that adipose tissue-derived EVs from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice or patients with diabetes induce remarkable synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. Depletion of miRNA cargo in these EVs significantly alleviates their detrimental effects on cognitive function. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting adipose tissue-derived EVs or their cargo miRNAs may provide a promising strategy for phar-maceutical interventions for cognitive impairment in diabetes.

AB  - Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is frequently used as a plasticizer in industrial and agricultural products. DEHP can cause severe neurotoxicity, such as impaired learning and memory function. Lycopene (LYC) as a carotenoid exerts excellent antioxidant capacity and therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether LYC can prevent the cognitive impairment induced by DEHP and the specific mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, the behavioral test results suggested that LYC alleviated the learning and memory impairment induced by DEHP. The histopathological data revealed that LYC attenuated DEHP-induced disordered arrangement of the neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus tissue. Moreover, LYC inhibited the occurrence of DEHP-induced ferroptosis via regulating iron metabolism, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and activating the cysteine transporter and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 (NrF2/HO-1) signaling pathway. Overall, the study contributes novel perspectives into the potential mechanisms of LYC preventing phthalate-induced cognitive impairment in the hippocampus.

AB  - Tobacco-etch-virus (TEV) protease is the workhorse of many laboratories in which protein expression is the linchpin of downstream experiments. TEV protease is remarkable in its sequence specificity as the cleavage sequence rarely appears in higher organisms and its ability to cleave fusion tag proteins from proteins of interest. Herein we report work done on large-scale production of TEV protease using different promotors, media, fusion tags, and expression platforms. During our work we detected post-translational modification (gluconoylation and phosphogluconoylation) of TEV protease and the subsequent effects this has on the purity of the protein. Subsequently we made our pgl plus bacteria that negates these modifications and their effects. We also introduce a GFP-based assay for measurement of activity and ultimately a new set of protocols for producing 400-500 mg/L TEV protease.

AB  - Using Sprague-Dawley rats and rat PC12 cells treated with sodium fluoride (NaF), we investigated the effects of SIK2-CRTC1 signaling on the neurobehavioral toxicity induced by fluoride. The in vivo results demonstrated that NaF treatment induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in juvenile rats, resulting in histological and ultrastructural abnormalities in the rat hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, NaF exposure induced neuronal loss and excessive apoptosis. We also found that NaF elevated the expression of SIK2 and reduced the expression of CRTC1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and VGF. The in vitro results showed that NaF suppressed cell viability, induced SIK2-CRTC1 signaling dysfunction, and caused excessive apoptosis in PC12 cells. Notably, targeted knockout of SIK2 with SIK2-siRNA or blocking of SIK2-CRTC1 signaling with 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) (as well as venlafaxine) can reduce apoptosis and increase cell viability in vitro. These findings suggest that neuronal death resulting from abnormal SIK2-CRTC1 signaling contributes to neurobehavioral toxicity induced by fluoride.

AB  - Background Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during appendage regeneration among vertebrates. However, its role during tail regeneration in axolotl as redox signaling molecule is unclear. Results Treatment with exogenous H2O2 rescues inhibitory effects of apocynin-induced growth suppression in tail blastema cells leading to cell proliferation. H2O2 also promotes recruitment of immune cells, regulate the activation of AKT kinase and Agr2 expression during blastema formation. Additionally, ROS/H2O2 regulates the expression and transcriptional activity of Yap1 and its target genes Ctgf and Areg. Conclusions These results show that H2O2 is necessary and sufficient to promote tail regeneration in axolotls. Additionally, Akt signaling and Agr2 were identified as ROS targets, suggesting that ROS/H2O2 is likely to regulate epimorphic regeneration through these signaling pathways. In addition, ROS/H2O2-dependent-Yap1 activity is required during tail regeneration.

AB  - Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is the main bioactive ginseng component. This study investigates the effects of Rg1 on cognitive deficits triggered by chronic sleep deprivation stress (CSDS) and explores its underlying mechanisms. Rg1 effectively improved spatial working and recognition memory, as evidenced by various behavioral tests. RNA-sequence analysis revealed differential gene expression in the metabolic pathway. Treatment with Rg1 abrogated reductions in SOD and CAT activity, lowered MDA content, and increased Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels. Rg1 administration alleviated hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring normal ultrastructure and enhancing ATP activities and Mfn2 expression while regulating Drp-1 expression. Rg1 mitigated neuronal apoptosis by reducing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the levels of cleaved caspase-3. Additionally, Rg1 upregulated AMPK and SIRT3 protein expressions. These findings suggest that Rg1 has potential as a robust intervention for cognitive dysfunction associated with sleep deprivation, acting through the modulation of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and the AMPK-SIRT3 axis.

AB  - Radiation therapy is a standard treatment for head and neck tumors. However, patients often exhibit cognitive impairments following radiation therapy. Previous studies have revealed that hippocampal dysfunction, specifically abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis or neuroinflammation, plays a key role in radiation-induced cognitive impairment. However, the long-term effects of radiation with respect to the electrophysiological adaptation of hippocampal neurons remain poorly characterized. We found that mice exhibited cognitive impairment 3 months after undergoing 10 minutes of cranial irradiation at a dose rate of 3 Gy/min. Furthermore, we observed a remarkable reduction in spike firing and excitatory synaptic input, as well as greatly enhanced inhibitory inputs, in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Corresponding to the electrophysiological adaptation, we found reduced expression of synaptic plasticity marker VGLUT1 and increased expression of VGAT. Furthermore, in irradiated mice, long-term potentiation in the hippocampus was weakened and GluR1 expression was inhibited. These findings suggest that radiation can impair intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were found to play crucial regulatory roles in ischemic injury. Based on GEO databases and our experimental results, we selected Dcp2, lncRNA-RNCR3, Dkc1, and Snora62 and Foxh1 as research candidates. We found that expression levels of Dcp2, RNCR3, Dkc1, Snora62, and Foxh1 were upregulated in oxygen glucose deprivation-treated HT22 cells and hippocampal tissues subject to chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI). Silencing of Dcp2, RNCR3, Dkc1, Snora62, and Foxh1 all inhibited apoptosis of oxygen glucose deprivation-treated HT22 cells. Moreover, Dcp2 promoted RNCR3 expression by increasing its stability. Importantly, RNCR3 may act as a molecular skeleton to bind to Dkc1 and recruit Dck1 to promote snoRNP assembly. Snora62 was responsible for pseudouridylation at 28S rRNA U3507 and U3509 sites. Pseudouridylation levels of 28S rRNA were reduced after knockdown of Snora62. Decreased pseudouridylation levels inhibited the translational activity of its downstream target, Foxh1. Our study further confirmed that Foxh1 transcriptionally promoted the expression of Bax and Fam162a. Notably, experiments in vivo showed that Dcp2 knockdown combined with RNCR3 knockdown and Snora62 knockdown resulted in an anti-apoptosis effect. In conclusion, this study suggests that the axis Dcp2/RNCR3/Dkc1/Snora621 is important for the regulation of neuronal apoptosis induced by CCI.

AB  - Background Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant tumor with seriously poor outcomes. Studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an omnifarious regulatory effect in GC. However, the role of miR-3650 in the progression of GC is not well known.Methods In this study, miR-3650 expression and its clinical significance were determined using clinical specimens. The biological functions of miR-3650 were determined in gastric cancer cell lines through CCK-8, cell scratch, and transwell experiments. Bioinformatics predictions, combined with Western blot experiments, were employed to explore its downstream molecular targets.Results We observed that miR-3650 was overexpressed in GC specimens and most cell lines, i.e., 77.8% (MKN28, SNU1, AGS, MKN45, N87, BGC823 and SGC7901). The overexpression correlated with advanced T-stage, N-stage, M-stage, and TNM-stage. Furthermore, miR-3650 promoted the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells, and its overexpression promoted the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and inhibited the PTEN and hippo pathways. The potassium ion signaling pathway was also involved in the biological process of miR-3650 promoting cancer.Conclusion Therefore, we concluded that miR-3650/PTEN/PI3K-AKT-mTOR and miR-3650/hippo pathways are vital in the progression of GC and serve as novel targets for GC therapy.

AB  - Human calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) senses calcium ion concentrations in vivo and is an important class of drug targets. Mutations in the receptor can lead to disorders of calcium homeostasis, including hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia. Here, 127 CaSR-targeted nanobodies were generated from camels, and four nanobodies with inhibitory function were further identified. Among these nanobodies, NB32 can effectively inhibit the mobilization of intracellular calcium ions (Ca2+i ) and suppress the G12/13 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways downstream of CaSR. Moreover, it enhanced the inhibitory effect of the calcilytics as a negative allosteric modulator (NAM). We determined the structure of complex and found NB32 bound to LB2 (Ligand-binding 2) domain of CaSR to prevent the interaction of LB2 domains of two protomers to stabilize the inactive state of CaSR.

AB  - Our preliminary study found that the long noncoding RNA (LncRNA)-5657 can reduce the expression of inflammatory factors during inflammatory reactions in rat glial cells. However, the role played by LncRNA-5657 during septic brain injury remains unclear. In the present study, rat models of septic encephalopathy were established by cecal ligation and puncture, and then the rats were treated with a hippocampal injection small hairpin RNA (shRNA) against LncRNA-5657 (sh-LnCRNA-5657). The sh-LncRNA-5657 treatment reduced the level of neuronal degeneration and necrosis in the rat hippocampus, reduced the immunoreactivities of aquaporin 4, heparanase, and metallopeptidase-9, and lowered the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Glial cells were pre-treated with sh-LncRNA-5657 and then treated with 1 mu g/mL lipopolysaccharide. Sh-LncRNA-5657 transfection decreased the expression of LncRNA-5657 in lipopolysaccharide-treated glial cells and decreased the mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6. These findings suggested that LncRNA-5657 expression can significantly reduce the inflammatory reaction during septic encephalopathy and induce protective effects against this disease. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University of China (approval No. 2017-004) in 2017.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment are common symptoms in many neurologic and psychiatric disorders, as well as nonpathological aging. Ketones have been suggested as therapeutic for their efficacy in epilepsy and other brain pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. However, their effects on cognitive function in healthy individuals is less established. Here, we explored the mitochondrial and performative outcomes of a novel eight-week ketone-supplemented ketogenic (KETO) diet in healthy adult male and female mice. In a novel object recognition test, KETO mice spent more time with the novel, compared to familiar, object, indicating an improvement in recognition memory. High-resolution respirometry on permeabilized hippocampal tissue returned significant reductions in mitochondrial O-2 consumption. No changes in ATP production were observed, yielding a significantly higher ATP:O-2 ratio, a measure of mitochondrial efficiency. Together, these findings demonstrate the KETO diet improves hippocampal mitochondrial efficiency. They add to a growing body of evidence that suggests ketones and ketogenic diets are neuroprotective and metabolically and cognitively relevant, even in healthy adults. They also suggest that ketogenic lifestyle changes may be effective strategies for protecting against cognitive decline associated with aging and disease.

AB  - Postmenopausal syndrome refers to symptoms caused by the gradual decrease in female hormones after mid-40 years. As a target organ of estrogen, decrease in estrogen causes various changes in brain function such as a decrease in choline acetyltransferase and brain-derived neurotrophic factor; thus, postmenopausal women experience cognitive decline and more depressive symptoms than age-matched men. Radix Polygalae has been used for memory boosting and as a mood stabilizer and its components have shown neuroprotective, antidepressant, and stress relief properties. In a mouse model of estrogen depletion induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide, Radix Polygalae was orally administered for 3 weeks. In these animals, cognitive and depression-related behaviors and molecular changes related to these behaviors were measured in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Radix Polygalae improved working memory and contextual memory and despair-related behaviors in 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide-treated mice without increasing serum estradiol levels in this model. In relation to these behaviors, choline acetyltransferase and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and bcl-2-associated athanogene expression increased in the hippocampus. These results implicate the possible benefit of Radix Polygalae in use as a supplement of estrogen to prevent conditions such as postmenopausal depression and cognitive decline.

KW  - YAP
AB  - Liver fibrosis, which results from chronic liver injury due to factors such as chronic alcohol consumption, hepatitis virus infections, and immune attacks, is marked by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Resveratrol (Res), a polyphenol phytoalexin, has been demonstrated to show anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiproliferative, and chemopreventive activities. In recent years, Res has been found to inhibit liver fibrosis. Enhanced Hippo pathway activation has also been reported to inhibit tumor progression and liver fibrosis. In the present study, the role of the Hippo pathway in mediating the effects of Res on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was examined. We found that Res significantly suppresses HSC proliferation, reducing the cell index. Res induced HSC inactivation, reducing collagen deposition and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression. In addition, Res contributed to HSC apoptosis, upregulating Bax and downregulating Bcl-2 expression. Notably, the Hippo pathway was involved in the Res-mediated suppression of HSC activation. Res enhanced the activation of the Hippo pathway and reduced yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with the PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) expression. Interestingly, the YAP overexpression inhibited Res-induced HSC inactivation and apoptosis. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that Res inhibits HSC activation, at least in part, via the Hippo pathway. The present study indicates a new antifibrotic mechanism of Res and provides novel insights into Hippo-mediated HSC apoptosis and HSC activation in liver fibrosis.

AB  - Introduction: Cognitive impairment is a vital complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effect of irisin on CKD-induced cognitive impairment remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of Irisin in mitigating cognitive impairment and explore the underlying mechanisms in CKD.Methods: A CKD mice model was established by adenine. Cognitive function was assessed via the novel object recognition (NOR). Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while pyroptosis-related protein expression was analyzed using western blotting.Results: Our data showed an upregulation of cell pyroptosis in hippocampus tissues of CKD mice, accompanied by significant cognitive impairment. Pyroptosis and cognitive impairment was both improved by Irisin treatment in vivo. Additionally, irisin markedly downregulated pyroptosis levels through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/NF-kappa B p65 signaling in HT-22 cells pretreated with indoxyl sulfate (IS). In vitro experiments further confirmed that pyroptosis was inhibited by AhR and NF-kappa B p65 inhibitors.Conclusions: We first demonstrated that irisin alleviated cognitive impairment by inhibiting AhR/NF-kappa B-NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis of hippocampal neurons in CKD. Overall, irisin may have the potential to serve as a critical antipyroptotic agent for improving CKD-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - The neurotoxicant trimethyltin (TMT) triggers cognitive impairment and hippocampal neurodegeneration. TMT is a useful research tool for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and treatment. Although the antidiabetic agent metformin has shown promising neuroprotective effects, however, its precise modes of action in neurodegenerative disorders need to be further elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether metformin can mitigate TMT cognition impairment and hippocampal neurodegeneration. To induce an AD-like phenotype, TMT was injected i.p. (8 mg/kg) and metformin was administered daily p.o. for 3 weeks at 200 mg/kg. Our results showed that metformin administration to the TMT group mitigated learning and memory impairment in Barnes maze, novel object recognition (NOR) task, and Y maze, attenuated hippocampal oxidative, inflammatory, and cell death/pyroptotic factors, and also reversed neurodegeneration-related proteins such as presenilin 1 and p-Tau. Hippocampal level of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a key regulator of energy homeostasis was also improved following metformin treatment. Additionally, metformin reduced hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactivity, and prevented the loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This study showed that metformin mitigated TMT-induced neurodegeneration and this may pave the way to develop new therapeutics to combat against cognitive deficits under neurotoxic conditions.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after surgical anesthesia, mainly manifested as memory impairment, decreased attention, and cognitive function with mood and personality changes. Activated microglia (M1-type microglia) have been demonstrated to release inflammatory substances (IL-1 & beta;, TNF-& alpha;, etc.) that cause neuronal degeneration and death by activating the NF-& kappa;B signaling pathway and upregulating Caspase-3 and Bax. However, the pathogenesis of POCD is still not fully understood and needs further research. In the present study, we investigated the effect of M1-type microglia-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs(M1-Microglia)) in the pathological process of POCD. The levels of NF-& kappa;B phosphorylation and IL-1 & beta; protein expression in hippocampal neurons were significantly increased in the Surgery group, while PSD95 and MAP2 were significantly decreased. Surgery induced microglia activation, synapse-associated protein decrease, and neuronal degeneration in hippocampus. And the amount of spine and mushroom spine significantly decreased in surgical mice, which was reverted in the presence of IL-1R1 siRNA. In addition, EVs(M1-Microglia) promoted synaptic loss and neuron degeneration independent of surgery and microglia activation. Furthermore, EVs(M1-Microglia) promoted memory defects in surgical mice. We demonstrated that EVs(M1-Microglia) with high expression of IL-1R1 promote POCD development by regulating neuronal inflammation.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease for which there are no effective drugs. Kai-Xin-San (KXS), with definite curative effects, is widely used for the prevention and treatment of AD in China. But its mechanism is not yet fully understood. Based on our established rat model and previous pharmacodynamics study, Multi-omics (metabolomics, proteomics) and network analysis were integrated to explore the holistic mechanism of anti-AD effects of KXS. The key pathways were validated with western blot and ELISA methods. Morris water maze and Nissl staining showed that KXS could ameliorate cognitive deficits and pathological morphology of the hippocampus in AD rats. A total of nine metabolites were identified, which were related to pyrimidine metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Proteomics results indicated that the improvement of cognitive deficits by KXS was closely related to the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Western blotting results showed that KXS significantly inhibited the expression of Mt-nd2 and Ndufb6 in AD rats. Integrated analysis indicated that the anti-AD targets of KXS were interrelated and KXS could exert its anti-AD effect by reducing oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, and inflammation.

AB  - Sleep is a state in which important restorative and anabolic processes occur. Understanding changes of these metabolic processes during the circadian rhythm in the brain is crucial to elucidate neurophysiological mechanisms important for sleep function. Investigation of amino acid modifications and dipeptides has recently emerged as a valuable approach in the metabolic profiling of the central nervous system. Nonetheless, very little is known about the effects of sleep on the brain levels of amino acid analogues. In the present study, we examined brain regional sleep-induced alterations selective for modified amino acids and dipeptides using Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS (UHPLC-MS/MS) based metabolomics. Our approach enabled the detection and identification of numerous amino acid-containing metabolites in the cortex, the hippocampus, the midbrain, and the cerebellum. In particular, analogues of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan were significantly altered during sleep in the investigated brain regions. Cortical levels of medium and long chain N-acyl glycines were higher during sleep. Regional specific changes were also detected, especially related to tyrosine analogues in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between circadian rhythms and amino acid metabolism specific for different brain regions that provide previously unknown insights in brain metabolism.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) and PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) have emerged as important regulators of pathologic fibroblast activation in fibrotic diseases. Agonism of G alpha s-coupled G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) provides an attractive approach to inhibit the nuclear localization and function of YAP and TAZ in fibroblasts that inhibits or reverses their pathological activation. Agonism of the dopamine D1 GPCR has proven effective in preclinical models of lung and liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms coupling GPCR agonism to YAP and TAZ inactivation in fibroblasts remain incompletely understood. Here, using human lung fibroblasts, we identify critical roles for the cAMP effectors EPAC1/2, the small GTPase RAP2c, and the serine/threonine kinase MAP4K7 as the essential elements in the downstream signaling cascade linking GPCR agonism to LATS1/2-mediated YAP and TAZ phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion in fibroblasts. We further show that this EPAC/RAP2c/MAP4K7 signaling cascade is essential to the effects of dopamine D1 receptor agonism on reducing fibroblast proliferation, contraction, and extracellular matrix production. Targeted modulation of this cascade in fibroblasts may prove a useful strategy to regulate YAP and TAZ signaling and fibroblast activities central to tissue repair and fibrosis.

A series of behavioral tests, comprising the sucrose preference, tail suspension, as well as forced swimming tests, were conducted. Levels of LINC00641, miR-323a-3p, and EIF4G2 in hippocampal tissues were measured. Biochemical indices, including 5-HT, NE, and DA, were analyzed. Hippocampal neuron structure and apoptosis were evaluated. The targeting relationship among LINC00641, miR-323a-3p, and EIF4G2 was validated experimentally.ResultsCUMS mice exhibited reduced sucrose preference, prolonged immobilization time in behavioral tests, decreased 5-HT, NE, and DA levels, and increased hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Overexpression of LINC00641 or knockdown of miR-323a-3p significantly alleviated depression-like behaviors and restored monoamine neurotransmitter levels. LINC00641 regulated EIF4G2 expression by targeting miR-323a-3p, while miR-323a-3p and EIF4G2 also modulated depression through LINC00641.ConclusionUpregulation of LINC00641 improves depression-like behaviors and enhances monoamine neurotransmission in CUMS mice via the miR-323a-3p/EIF4G2 axis, underscoring its potent as a therapeutic target for depression.

AB  - The metabolite profiles and antioxidant activity of Dendrobium catenatum Lindley leaf, a new functional ingredient for food product development, were evaluated in samples that had been prepared using various methods, including freeze-drying, hot-air drying, rolling before drying, steaming before drying, steaming and rolling before drying, and drying at 100, 80, and 60 degrees C. The concentrations of polysaccharides and flavonoids, as well as the antioxidant capacity of each sample, were determined. Furthermore, two nucleosides, four amino acids, one monoaromatic compound, and eight flavonoids were identified in dried leaves using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-electrospray ionization-multistage mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn) and ultraviolet (UV) spectral analyses. The content of polar compounds such as cytidylic acid, arginine, tyrosine, and hydroxybenzoic acid hexose increased dramatically during hot-air-drying and rolling-before-drying treatments, while flavonol C-glycosides remained stable throughout the various treatments and drying temperatures. Rolling before drying at 100 degrees C was identified as the most suitable process when manufacturing tea products from D. catenatum leaves. This process resulted in a high-antioxidant-activity and visually appealing tea. This report details a potential strategy that should be applied in the manufacturing processes of high-quality products from D. catenatum leaves.

This paper proposed Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse Weight-related Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MPW-DCNN) overcomes such complications for the BLB disease identifi-cation system. The proposed method encompasses six phases. First, the Image Acquisition (IA) procedure is accomplished, next the pre-processing is carried out, in which the noise of the input rice leaf image is mitigated using the Hybrid Gaussian-Weiner (HGW) filter, and the image pixel is normalized by utilizing min-max normalization. Then, the segmentation of the input image is done by Improved Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM). Next, the features, such as entropy, energy, correlation, contrast, homogeneity, colour histogram, and Scale-Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT) are extracted from the segmented image. Then, the efficient features are chosen by applying the Exhaustiveness and Brownian Motion-related Elephant Herding Optimization (EBM-EHO) algo-rithm. Then, these selected features are fed to the MPW-DCNN classifier, which categorizes the image as 'BLB malady' or 'normal' or else 'chances being influenced by other maladies'. Lastly, the proposed MPW-DCNN performance is equated with the prevailing classification algorithm, and better accuracy is proffered by the proposed work than the prevalent algorithms. The accuracy of the implemented approach is 2.36, 3.08, 4.62, 5.13, and 6.15% improved than the existing methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) + Deep features, AlexNet, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), respectively.
